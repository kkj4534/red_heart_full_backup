      "title": "AITA for getting mad at my brother when he does dumb stuff and my parents turn a blind eye?",
      "description": "A little bit of information before we go: I live in a house with three younger brothers, the only female. I do have a bit of anger issues and the changes in my medication can make it worse. I also have depression. They’re not at all an excuse for my behaviour, I just want to provide a little bit of what it’s like to be me.\n\nThe brother I’m referring to is 14, and is, what I believe, capable of acting like a somewhat mature person. However he likes to go out of his way to bother me. He just got over the three-year long phase of twerking with his butt a mere few feet from my face, and mooning me. Every time he did it I got mad at him. Every time I got mad, which is in my opinion a normal reaction, my parents would get mad at me and he would walk away laughing to prepare for the next opportunity.\n\nThis behaviour would often happen at the worst times, his favourite was when I would be swamped with schoolwork. (Why didn’t you lock yourself in your bedroom? There was no internet there so I had to be close to the router to do my research.) I tried talking to my dad and my mom about it, but I would end up hearing about “my problems” for an hour. That wasn’t good for my mental health, so eventually I gave up.\n\nHe’s a bit over the previously mentioned behaviour now because he was recently handed a new tablet. Samsung. He enjoys playing annoying songs at full volume and despite how annoying my parents find it, they have yet to do anything.\n\nI’m now sleep deprived from coming out of exams and now I have to endure my brother playing loud music in the room next to mine. He also thumps around at 2am and pitches a fit when my parents tell him to turn the device off.\n\nThat brings us to today, me sitting in my room working on my hobby novel in silence when I hear him move downstairs and start watching a fortnite stream at full volume. I decided to grab some food while I went to the kitchen to tell him to turn it down. He looks at me and says no when I ask him to lower the volume. So I grab a pair of brand new headphones and give them to him, a solution to the problem. He turns those away too. So I ask him why he can’t simply cooperate and he tells me to screw off.\n\nI call my dad, and tell him what’s going on. He tells me to leave my brother alone. I felt angry and alone, so when I hung up, I grabbed the headphones and hit him across the head with them.\n\nAm I an asshole for putting up with his behaviour for so long?\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for ending my friendship?",
      "description": "My close friends consists of four of us. There’s my best friend and I (both 23F) who have known each other since 8th grade then there’s Jessi(26F) and Daniel(25F). We met Jessi and Daniel when Jessi moved in with my best friend. \n\nWe all got close. I was very close to Jessi. She knows everything about. However, she’s slut shamed me, and made me feel disgusting for a lot of my views. She told me I had no responsibilities (a rant, actually) said hurtful things about my best friend and Daniel. \n\nI admit I shouldn’t have bottled everything up she was doing/saying but every time I tried to talk to her in a calm manner about something that bothered me.. she would get upset and blame it on something else/someone else. For example: I tried talking to her about BV and how her comments made me feel. Instead of apologizing, she directed it towards my best friend and stated, “she’s disgusting and dirty. She sleeps with men all the time with no condoms.” My best friend was only hooking up with one guy during that time and I had NOT mentioned her at all. \n\nI’m fully aware that I should’ve never let her say nasty things in the first place and I never agreed with her or said anything when she said those things but... it’s a hard position.\n\nNow my best friend lives with her and had distanced herself from her because Jessi had said some very rude things to her in her face. Daniel already knows how she is.\n\nI finally let everything out last night. I told them everything. I wrote a letter to Jessi explaining how I felt about things and left it in her room. Everything in the letter was said in a kind way.\n\nAfter the big blowout last night, I didn’t say anything to her because I already stated how I felt. I told her she can talk to me when she realizes that it’s not us whose the problem.\n\nShe had asked all of us to speak with her but she only ended up talking to my best friend and Daniel. I was not asked to talk. She texted me saying she was over it and that if I wanted to talk to her that she would be open to it because she didn’t want to talk to me.\n\nI told her I needed a few days to cool down &amp; to respect that. She texted me saying that I created the wedge between her, my best friend and Daniel. Reading that just made me cut the friendship off because the rude words that she said about them never came out of my mouth. I only made them aware of it.\n\nMy best friend supports me. Daniel, on the other hand. Is telling me that “She’s family and you shouldn’t cut her off. Give her a chance. Don’t be a bitch about it.”\n\nAnd I get that... I would have been fine, partly, but that comment of how I wedged in between them was it for me. So am I the asshole here for cutting her off like that?",

      "description": "TL;DR My mom asked my neighbors to pay me $50 less for dog sitting/house sitting for them for 5 days. This was after she tried to get a family friend to not pay me at all for babysitting her mentally handicapped daughter. AIMTA for getting mad at my mom?\n\nSome background: My neighbors are lovely people and they have three kids who I think of as little siblings. They come over to birthday parties and we go over there. We’re basically family. \n\nThey were going away for 5 days and asked me to stay at their house and take care of their dog while they were gone. Even though we’re close I still expected to be paid something. Their dog is extremely annoying and wouldn’t eat so I had to make special food for him. And every night he woke me up 5 times to go to the bathroom. They had me lock him in the stairwell when I went to school or work because it was pouring rain and they didn’t want him to be outside. Anyways the five days were really hard on me but I did it. They got home when I was at school so they came over later to give me my pay. They paid me $120, which meant they paid me $24 a day. And that might seem like a lot but I was doing their laundry and taking care of their plants too. I know they would have paid me more because I’m the last they paid me $35 a day which is a $50 difference. My mom told my neighbors they shouldn’t pay me that much because I don’t do anything when I’m there and so they dropped the amount the paid me. It’s not the first time my mom has done this either. When I was babysitting a family friend’s daughter who was mentally challenged my mom told her friend not to pay me at all. I love the girl I was babysitting, she’s super sweet, but it can be stressful because she’s developmentally delayed. I have to deal with mental break downs and helping her change her pads. I got mad at my mom and we got into a fight. AITA?",

      "description": "Okay, so this happened on r/LGBTteens, I recently made a post asking why does the majority of the subreddit complain about a multitude of things yet make no strive to change or fix the problem.\n\nEverything was going pretty well, I was answering and conversating with other redditors etc. This was this one user who just came off as pessimistic and negative, they said their reply (which was negative) \nand I replied with \"if you say so\". \n\nI replied in that manner because I don't get into conversations in which the person already has a particular mindset that is negative. It's hard to try to talk to someone who has already given up. \n\nSo after I sent that, the user replied go fuck yourself.\n\nSo I replied with fuck you you depressed bitch. \n\nIn this insult, depressed was an adjective and was not used as in insult. Not only that but the user also labeled himself as a depressed furry, so I considered it equal grounds to use the word depressed.  \n\nAfter that I have been banned for r/lgbtTeens and  muted by the mods when I told my side of the story. \n\nSo, AITA? The way I see it, I was defending myself against someone who was negative for no reason. ",

      "description": "A little back story.....\n\nCurrently on vacation with the family and my wife needed to take our daughter upstairs to the hotel while I stayed with our three boys at the pool. While in our room she couldn't find her phone so she used mine to call herself. \n\nShe explained to me that she was unsure how exactly my phone worked (I recently changed from apple to android after 5 years of us using iOS exclusively, so I buy that she didnt know what was what to an extent).  In trying to open the 'phone' area to make a call (a picture of a phone on the front page) she instead stumbled into the text messages, scrolled a couple pages down, and found a thread between my step mom and myself. After scrolling through this for a couple of screens, she found a message from a me to my step mom where I vented a bunch of things about my wife. \n\nNow these are things that I would not say directly to my wife as they would both hurt her feelings and start an argument that would not go well in my favor.  Specifically, my wige was upset where I referred to her as a 'slob' and 'pack rat' in regards to the fact that she still has clothes that do not fit her from 10 years ago prior to our first son being born that she refuses to get rid of while also collecting more and more clothing. It is to the point that I had to remove all of my things from our shared dresser and closet as there was no more room. She currently has over 100 folder shirts and a full walk in closet of dresses and blousses that are hung (this number is not inflated as I'm the one that does the laundry in our relationship).  This, and other areas where she simply does not take care of her things (multiple coffee cups left in the car for weeks, etc), is point of tension in our relationship and both my wife and step mom are aware of this.\n\nMy wife is furious that I would ever speak about her behind her back like this and feels that me implying that she is a slob is insulting as she works incredibly hard to help provide for our family (which she does) and the only reason she hasn't gone through her clothes is because she is so busy with work an family (which is true. She is incredibly busy).  \n\nI mad that she went through my phone in the first place. I dont buy that she accidentally stumbled upon something like she says she did. I feel that I should be able to speak to family about what is bothering me and if I chose to not bring  certain frustrations to my wife's attention, then so be it. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?  Am I the ass hole in this situation?",

      "description": "Before you judge the title hear me out, TL;DR at the bottom. My girlfriend (long distance) has a best friend (we’ll call him J), she told me back when we started dating that he was a gay guy that she is friends with and that he takes her to work because it is easier, she spends nights at his house on occasion and posts about him on snapchat a lot. With that being said today while bsing around with her she started talking about how she and J met, they were at a costume party at J’s house that her ride left from early so she stayed at J’s place for the night, she tells me her and J slept on the same couch and yada yada but again I had no problems. She gets to a part in the story about how she and J almost had sex once, I was taken a little off guard by this because I was under the impression that he is gay. When I told her that I was confused and that I thought he was gay she just told me that she thinks he only says he is gay but he is actually straight. I told her it weirded me out that she never thought it would be worth telling me that the guy she spends hours a day and sleeps over with isn’t gay like she told me he was, now she won’t speak to me. Again I have no problem with her having gay or even straight guy friends but her lying to me made me feel off like she is hiding something here, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Long distance girlfriend tells me her guy friend she spends nights with is gay, I find out she lied and he is actually straight/bi and when I brought it up she shut down and wouldn’t talk to me",

      "description": "We live in a second story apartment which is right under a family with four small children. These children are allowed to run &amp; jump and scream during throughout the day &amp; night. They blare loud music.\n\nWe dont mind footsteps or occasional booms, but there’s a point where it’s overwhelming. We have tried to speak with them on multiple occasions. The first time, they politely agreed to keep it down. I saw a child jumping rope in the living room. It didn’t stop.\n\nThe times after that, they told us that “it’s just part of apartment living.” They then got a Barbie Jeep to drive around the living room. The fourth &amp; final time, the woman told us that she was tired of us bothering her family. \n\nWe’ve spoken to management, they say that they keep talking to them. Nothing has changed. Tonight, they were running &amp; pole vaulting when a wall hanging fell and shattered into the carpet. I reached out to the onsite security guard for advice, he went to speak with them. When he called me back, he said he could hear the loud music/screaming &amp; even feel vibrations from outside the door, &amp; that he felt sorry for us. They refused to answer the door.\nAbout 15 minutes later, the woman knocked on our door. She asked me, “why the hell did you call cops on children?” I explained that I needed to study for an exam &amp; that I needed to go to bed soon because I work early in the morning. She fussed at me for being heartless about her children &amp; how I need to get over it or just “go study at McDonald’s because they’re open 24/7.” I told her that I pay to live in my apartment, not McDonald’s. She said that she pays to live freely in her apartment &amp; she is allowed to do whatever she wants in a place that she pays for. I said that the lease she signed says otherwise. She asked me if I want her to just tie her kids to the bed every day? Because they’re kids, they have to run around? She told me to just rent a house since her kids “haven’t learned how to fly to prevent them from disturbing my delicate ears.” (I’d love to rent a house, but a natural disaster has caused housing prices to skyrocket.) \n\nI teach elementary students. I know how kids work. They get wiggly sometimes. When they get wiggly, we do activities that involve movement and noise and all that fun stuff, but I make it a point to teach them to not disrupt other classrooms. \n\nI know what it’s like to live in an apartment as a child. It sucks. However, my grandma NEVER let me run around inside. She told us to go outside and play &amp; never be rude to neighbors since they pay rent too. \n\nHalf of me feels like a horrible person because I fear that I’m making these children miserable by preventing them to be children. The other half of me is frustrated that we cannot live peacefully in our apartment. We have things falling, we’ve had to get a fire alarm &amp; two light fixtures repaired due to vibrations. My dog has been diagnosed with anxiety due to thunder from above. AITA?",

The room is tiny and a fucking pigsty, pizza boxes everywhere, no sheets on the bed, no floor in sight just clothes that they never wash, overflowing ashtrays spilling into their bed, bits of food and empty packets/rubbish everywhere, most of the house's dishes (mouldy food included) and an eye-watering stench that stunk the house out.\n\nWe are all mid-to-late twenties and don't want to live with this kind of stuff, we have actively tried to help them by contacting friends and family and even trying to talk to them and offering help but this person flatly refuses to do anything and calls us insensitive and mean for calling them out on this stuff. This person obviously needs help and being in this house isn't helping them at all, everyone is sick of it so we told them the news yesterday which resulted in them running away to their room and resume hiding.

Now about a week he asked me to review one of his videos (I will put link at end so you can see for yourself) and I did rather brutally if I'm being honest. I brought up how there are lots of \"empty\" spaces in it where nothing entertaining really happens and how he should cut those out, I said that the jokes felt kinda forced and could be well better expanded upon, I brought up a seeming lack of direction and told him a vague script could help him stay on track while also allowing him to vere off and make jokes I gave him 6/10, for this criticism I was promptly blocked on Instagram. Fastfoward to today I hadn't talked to him since he blocked me and I told him that I hoped my criticism will help him to which he responds that I'm just being a contrarian and that I don't know wtf I'm talking about (I have 2 years trained from my school in editing btw) and that because he has 3 years experience editing my opinion is basically invalid then told me not to talk to him anymore. So am I the asshole for being extremely honest with my friend or is he the asshole for blowing up at me like that? (https://youtu.be/1VdSg2ovEPs)",

      "description": "Hello reddit. I am in a quandary and I don't know what to do. I will abide by the judgment of the sub to guide my actions tonight.\n \nFor some background, I am 21, in college living about 2 hours away from home. I have an 8 year old cousin who was born with a pretty rare auto-immune disorder and he alternates regularly between the hospital and home. Since I've been away I've always arranged my schedule so I can have Fridays off and drive home Thursday night so I can spend some time with him either at his house or in the hospital. He apparently had a bad interaction with a new medication and has been hospitalized for the past week and I was planning on driving home to play Settlers of Catan with him tonight to keep him busy in the hospital. \n\nFor some more background, I have been seriously crushing on this guy \"Craig\" since we took a summer class together last year. We have been good friends but I'm way to scared of rejection to ask him out and up until today he's never asked me out. About an hour ago he sent me the following iMessage: \n\n\"I'm sorry its taken me so long, but you know I'm leaving tomorrow for -professors name- field study and I would be sick if I didn't at least try to take you out on a real \"date\" before I'm gone for a month. I don't want to make things weird between us but I really, really like you.\" \n\nMy heart about melted but I want to do the right thing by my cousin. The truth is if I were to tell my cousin, I'm sure he'd tell me to go on the date, but the guilt of even thinking about it is eating me alive (yes, I'm pretty neurotic). \n\nWould I be the asshole if I flake on my cousin and go on this date?",

(18F)\n\nI met this guy online and he seemed alright and after a recent break up I was ready to try something new. I met him and right away I know it wasn't going anywhere, he looked very much different from his pictures and within a few moments of meeting he wanted to hug which I was very clear made me uncomfortable.\n\nThe date was filled with uncomfortable silence and I tried very hard to make conversation but he just wouldn't talk at least not much. When he did it was about anime or sexual stuff which I shrugged off and ignored. I made an excuse to leave early at which he asked if he could come back to mine because my mum wasn't in (I had said she had work and that's why I had to go home, she didn't have work).\n\nI told him no but he kept asking until we got to where we had to part he asked me again I told him very clearly no. Then he asked for a hug and a kiss, I gave him a very quick and uncomfortable side hug but refused him the kiss then hurried off.\n\nWithin minutes of of us parting he messaged and asked if I had fun made another sex joke and when the next date was, I just said I was busy and I didn't know. He kept messaging me, with me not answering anything because I suffered really bad social anxiety and couldn't bring myself to tell him I didn't like him and he made me feel very uncomfortable, so I just blocked him without saying anything.\n\nToday i told a friend of mine that I just blocked him and he said I should have been clear about why I was blocking him. I really don't think I could have because of my anxiety but now I feel really bad about it, so am I the asshole for just blocking and not explaining why to him. ",

      "description": "Here are the basics.  My mother is disabled with a host of medical issues.  She is 66 yrs old and does not have any sort of dementia. She does have some memory issues though. A year ago, her license was suspended after she reported to her doctor that she had fallen asleep in her car.  She drove to a store, parked, and fell asleep slumped over the wheel for several hours.  Passerbys knocked on her window to check on her and she responded but went back to sleep.  She did this over three hours.  \n\nOnce she lost her license, I set her up with GoGo Grandparent that uses Lyft and Uber to shuttle her around at a moments notice with just a call.  No confusing apps, no 24 hour notice. There is no cost to her since I pay for it.  I get texts when she is picked up and dropped off and it helps me keep track of when she actually goes to her appointments. Sometimes she gets her dates confused.  Complicating this is that she had just purchased a car just days before the incident and she desperately wants to drive again because she wants to drive her new car. To help with this aspect, I use her car on some weekends so she can at least be in her new car while running her errands. \n\nAnother issue is that three months ago she was hospitalized and since then she is on 24/7 oxygen and she feels trapped in her apartment because she has to use an oxygen concentrator which has limited battery time. This has only exacerbated her desire to drive her own vehicle.\n\nShe has been pretty good about not driving up until a month ago. But a month ago she decided to start paying a friend to drive her and she found a second friend who is an Uber driver who takes her to appointments, or so she says.  My concern here is that she is telling me she is getting a ride when in fact she is driving herself. The change that happened a month ago is that we figured out what caused her sleepiness and adjusted the medication to address that issue and added new medication to address the hallucinations she admitted having \"for years\". She now feels there should be no barrier to getting her license back but I don't think the doctors will sign off on it. It has become an obsession.\n\nSo my question is, would I be an asshole if I hire a private investigator to see if she is being honest about not driving?  Since she isn't using the service, I have no way of knowing if she is driving or not.  I trusted her before and I don't technically have any evidence that these people are not driving her.  But she has the psychology of a rebellious 13 year and doesn't like being told what to do. I had some assurance with the car service.  Now my gut tells me there may be cause to worry. If I learn she is driving, I am taking the keys away. \n\nPlace your judgment.",

      "description": "*first time poster, sorry if I ramble a bit :/ * \nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for about 5 months and we are moving in together at the first of the month. Full disclosure, it’s sooner than we planned (dispute with my landlord) but it’s the same plan we had for when my lease would have been up in June. It’s his house but I will pay him rent. We’ve known for the past 3-4 weeks that I’d be moving in sooner than we planned but he’s seemed totally on board this whole time, ie. talking about how much easier/more convenient things will be when I live there (we live 25min away from each other right now), planning evenings together, telling me to just leave stuff there, ect. We even had multiple serious discussions about expectations &amp; lifestyle differences (I like to have some down time when I get home from work before really engaging with someone) -seemed like we were on the same page though I did notice that he didn’t really make any tangible “moves” like making a copy of his key or give me a lot of feedback on practical things like combining our respective furniture (he told me that there was a lot of extra room for any of my stuff that didn’t “fit” in the garage so not to worry about it ???). \nToday I call him when I get home from work and we’re talking about our day and he mentions that he’s going golfing this weekend on Saturdaywith his dad &amp; uncle and then “the boys” on Sunday. I felt kind of irritated bc he knows that I work &amp; go to school during the week so this weekend is really my only opportunity to move most of my stuff. I brought it up and he told me that was fine but he didn’t plan on helping bc “he already moved around a bunch in college and he was over it” so I’d be packing and moving everything from my apartment to his house by myself?  *side note I drive a little Toyota hatchback and he drives a pickup truck* AITA to be pissed / think that he doesn’t want to build a home with me and  just wants the convenience of having a live in girlfriend?

      "description": "Long read.\n\nAs a bit of background, I (20 yr old) became homeless when my mom divorced my asshole step dad. We couch surfed for a while, I was still going to school, and hadn't considered getting a job until then so that I could fully focus on my studies.\n(Please note that at this point all of my college fees were paid in full through my own savings from doing odd jobs through high school)\n\nIt came to a point where a connection of one of my mom's friends offered us a room in her house for a standard fee - all utilities included, a shelf in her fridge, a cupboard for our food, the washing machine and shower and the root of all of our arguments: internet.\nShe went to great extents to make sure we settled in, but soon, things started going sour.\n\nIt started with me considering leaving college to find a job to help support my mom and myself (hopefully get a stable place for us to live as we weren't allowed to use her address on account of her receiving financial help from various other sources as well as rent from my mom)\nShe tore into me, it turned into an hour long screaming fest where she called me all sorts of things and so I stayed in school - last thing I needed was this massive woman screaming at me every day or for her to throw us out.\n\nThen she came to me again and accused me of being lazy for not doing more for my mom, so I took up the cooking, washing and cleaning of our room, fine I understood where she was coming from and I didn't want to argue since we had nowhere else to go.\nThen she came to me again, same argument, saying that I'm childish, lazy and arrogant. She had me now cleaning her bathroom every weekend.\n\nAdditionally, I babysit her special needs child and her two dogs when she goes out. (I don't get paid for this, this is to \"pay her back for letting us stay here\")\n\nHere's the thing, I finished College, and since I'm not allowed to use her address I can't get anyone to hire me. \nI volunteer my time at an animal shelter while I throw my CV to any place I can find that's hiring, but she still maintains that I'm not doing enough for her around the house or at all.\n\nIn my two to three hours of spare time, I play videogames (predictable for someone my age) I used to play online games, overwatch mostly, but she complained that it used too much internet and so would turn the internet off when I got home from the shelter (10 to 12 hour days mind you)\nOkay, I thought, and traded in my online games for offline single player stuff, but she still says that I use all of her internet?? She's adamant that all I do is go and cuddle dogs all day then get home and sit and do nothing.\n\nSo recently I've stopped really doing chores around the house, I've been going out to see a friend every second or so weekend and I've been downstairs less - I just keep the room clean and refill the dog's water bowl, I still cook and do the washing for my mom (bless her she works so hard) but the landlady is getting more and more angry with me for being lazy.\n\nI've stopped the babysitting, I always make excuses now, and I've stopped doing her son's chores, I haven't been mean but I also haven't been extraordinarily nice to her or the boy lately.\nI feel like I might be an asshole in this situation, but I also feel like she may be absolutely worse.\n\nOn the one hand she took us in when we were homeless. She lets us stay in her house, she gave us a room and beds to sleep in. Apparently (and I don't believe this part) I'm using all of her internet allowance, one time she claimed that I used 500gb in 7 hours!\n\nOn the other hand, we're paying her full rent, cleaning her bathroom, watching her dogs and child, we can only wash our clothes and shower when she says and she's always on my case about how lazy and childish I am.\n\nDoes she have a point? Am I the asshole? Should I be doing more?\n\n",

It’s enough, he says, that we live together and see each other every day and morning. Okay. But when he wakes up it’s to browse Facebook. When we get home from work there’s no together time. If he goes out with his friends he asks to go alone or reluctantly invites me. Tonight I asked him to get a drink at the bar downstairs. He gripes, “if you want.” But I say, well not if you’re in pjs already... and he responds “oh my friend texted me, he’s there, meet you there?” \n\nWibta if I fucjing say something for once ? ",

      "description": "I like chicken from Pizzahut, the chicken in the shape of a ball. I think they're delicious. My mom knows how much I love them and offered to buy them for me on her way home from work. However, there was heavy traffic and she decided not to as she came home at 8 (I don't eat past 7).\n\n So, I wanted the chicken balls she owed me for lunch today instead. I asked her if we could order them, she tried backing out of buying me my balls (which she later said she didn't back out). But I asked her when she would get them and she said \"I'm having my smoothie.) . I held her accountable, I said \"you promised me chicken last night, but you have to get them today.\" She decided to stay true to her promise and said I'll get them later, I pressed her on when because I wanted them for lunch. She told me at 4 pm, which is like in 4 hours.... She didn't want to get them delivered because of the extra charge. So I was shocked, visibly in my expression. I said, actually can you give me the coin and I'll run and get them right now. \n\nMy mom started to cry, she said I was pressuring her to get them in the middle of her drinking her smoothie. I didn't  think I was pressuring her, I said I'll get them right now instead of waiting. So, she goes and gets dressed and tells me to order it. She made me feel so bad. I was just trying to problem solve. Like instead of waiting why can't I just run by myself and get them now (it's one block away). So she gets dressed and I tell her, \"just forget it.\" I tell her I didn't know chicken would cause so much drama and that I didn't have  to have it. She tells me I'm full of drama and that she's not coming home tonight. She tells me she'll go outside waiting for me order. I try to make amends, tell her it doesn't matter, the chicken doesn't matter. She insists I order it, so I do. She tells me I was childish for asking her when she would get it, I say I didn't want to be left in suspense. We hug, in a hug she did not participate in, am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for dating the girl that I hooked my best friend up with?",
      "description": "**Backstory:** I met this girl Amber in December 2017 who lives 40 minutes away. We never officially dated, but we had mutual interests in each other and talked for a few weeks until I decided to end things since I had a girlfriend at the time. She was really upset and we stopped communicating.\n\nA few months later in April we started talking again. By this time, my former girlfriend and I have already broken up. Amber and I became really close as friends. Her family was familiar with who I was and we became very comfortable with each other. After some time, we started taking interest in each other again. However, we soon stopped talking again because I began talking to another girl. Again, she was really upset and we stopped communicating in July.\n\nBoth these times, I admit I was the asshole. I really did have feelings for her and we get along *extremely* well but our situation was difficult to maintain at the time since we live somewhat far from each other and I had been dealing with situations of my own\n\nWe recently reignited our friendship in September at a wrestling tournament and since then we've gotten closer than ever. We are extremely open and comfortable with each other. I apologized for everything that I've put her through and we both agreed that we would never try talking again. After some months I started developing a crush on her but suppressed my feelings this time since we both agreed to stay friends. We hung out frequently and when we did she would be somewhat clingy and flirty but I thought nothing of it since she claimed that she's usually a clingy person. I had suspicions that she was also crushing on me but did not want to make any assumptions.\n\nCurious as to if she was actually into me, I pitched the idea for her to hook up with my best friend Anthony who I see and hangout with almost everyday. If she did find interest in that idea then I would conclude she had no interest in me however if she didn't, then she was probably interested in me. Long story short, they started talking and Anthony was obviously really into her but she didn't feel the same. She constantly flaked on their plans and rarely texted him back. Amber and I still continued to talk normally since we were good friends.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nAmber drunk texted me at a party one night asking why I have no interest in her. Since she was so clearly intoxicated I took this idea lightly. I allowed her two days to sober up and talk to me about it again and it was true: she still liked me. I exclaimed how I thought we were strictly friends. This conversation led me to confess that I also did have feelings for her but the problem was she was *still talking to Anthony*. She invited me over her house New Years Eve and we did countdown together. We both had drinks that night so she invited me to spend the night which I agreed to. It was around 2AM and I assumed that I would sleep on the floor beside the bed but she invited me to lay with her. She began to cuddle with me and eventually she made the move to kiss me which led to making out. After the night, we discussed how terrible this was of us to do and how extremely guilty we both felt. Since we both had a little to drink that night I assumed it was the alcohol.\n\nTwo days later she was over at my house and she spent the night at my place. Similar to New Year's night, we did the same thing which was initiated by her again. We **both agreed** that this was something we wanted however it was something I *had* to tell Anthony since he was  my best friend.\n\nI end up telling Anthony about the situation in a one on one conversation. I left out the major details and kept it very short, only explaining how we took interest in each other with ZERO intention of hurting him. I apologized and emphasized how this was not intentional. He seemed totally cool about it saying how he appreciated how I came upfront to him about it and he made everything seem all good and normal. They were never officially dating, but he said he was already planning to end things with her and that it was all okay.\n\nEvery time I see him he avoids eye contact with me and rarely talks to me. My friends are telling me that he's been telling  ***a story*** to many people seeing if he should stay friends with me or not *(I say* ***a story*** *because he never asked me about what happened or how it happened so the story he is telling other people is most likely very flawed)*. They say that he's upset that I didn't tell him sooner and how he's just mad. I feel like a dick and I understand why he wouldn't want to be friends, but I want him to be upfront with me and let me know if we are cool or not rather than telling me we are cool but telling everyone different. When we talked one on one he made it seem like everything was all good and he forgave me. Now, he's acting different and almost even talking bad about me behind my back making me look like a villain. Am I really an asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for purposefully making a kid with a disability lose a talent competition?",
      "description": "I was invited to judge a music talent show contest for teenage kids. There were two other judges and this was the final round of the competition with only 3 people remaining. The winner would get a cash prize worth ~$3,000 and direct entry with a one year scholarship to a shitty music school (sponsor of the competition).\n\nI studied music theory for years, played professionally both solo and in bands, and was a previous runner-up for a variant of this competition (me with my giant check to cash at a giant bank: http://imgur.com/lmygRNp)\n\nNow there were 3 students competing and one of them was on a wheelchair. The first student played a beautiful OC piece for a classical guitar. The second student was the one with the disability on a wheelchair(Ryan) , and the third guy played Tchaikovsky. I have been playing for years and I can tell you that Ryan played worse than someone who would have never even played the piano. It was atrocious to a point that it made me cringe. He stops playing and starts crying because he forgot the rest of whatever the fuck piece he was ruining and his mom rushes on stage and is hugging him and the crowd starts cheering and shit for him to continue playing. He changes his piece now to play \"dont stop believing\". He's not even playing the melody, like just the chords and the entire audience is cheering him on and singing all the words. The crowd gives him a standing ovation and his mom talks about her son inspires her because he is a fighter and never gives up.\n\nIt's time to judge them. We had to give our own individual scores to each contestant (out of 100), tally up the scores and pick a winner based on the most points. I gave Ryan a 7/100, the first guy a 93/100 (or something) and the third guy 85/100. He did NOT even deserve the 7 points.\n\nAnyway, we tally up the votes and I could see the other two judges getting shocked at how low of a score I gave Ryan. We announce the winner (the first guy who deserved to win) and the crowd STARTS BOO-ING. Guys. This poor first kid practiced for fucking HOURS, played a beautiful piece, and was BOOED FOR HIS HARD WORK.\n\nAt this point, Ryan's mom starts feeding off the crowd and begins demanding why her kid did not win. She starts talking to the other judges and then goes to talk to the organizer. The guy who brought me in to judge comes to me and asks me why I purposely made Ryan lose. (Keep in mind that at this point I'm still an undergraduate student and I'm dealing with grown adults). I explain to him that I did not think Ryan deserved to win and he stormed off to talk to his superior. I tried talking to the other judges but they both want nothing to do with me.\n\nThe audience is *still* cheering for the kid.\n\nThe organizer comes to me and tells me that I need to go on stage and say that I made a mistake. At this point I'm feeling terrible because I think everyone knows it was me, and also because I \"fucked up\". He convinces me to do it and we had to embarrassingly strip the title away from the deserving winner into someone with NO TALENT.\n\nRyan gets the new trophy and for his speech, he says that he does not think he should have won and says that he would like to give the scholarship to the first guy (He still keeps the trophy and money though). Anyway, NOW the audience starts cheering for the first guy and at this point I have had just so much that I want to get out of there so I start heading out. Ryan's mom stops me and starts asking questions like \"Why did you purposefully try to make my son lose?\". I say that \"I didn't think he deserved to win because he is not as talented as the other guys\" and she starts getting REALLY confrontational and right on my face while she is talking. Her husband moves her away from me because she was getting aggressive and she says some mean (and slightly racist) things before turning around and walking away. \n\nTelling this story back to my friends, the general consensus I got was them saying, \"You're not wrong (because you did what you thought was the right thing, you're just an asshole.\" I didn't think I was the asshole, but this gives me a reason to post here. Now that you know the story too, AITA?  ",

      "description": "Some context before I get to my point. I might drag on at times so apologies in advance. So the friend in question is someone I’ve known for a long long time - since grade school, in fact. We weren’t particularly close, but we had a few classes together throughout the years and came to know &amp; understand each other quite well. I dare say she’s one of maybe two or three people that truly gets me, because we’re almost the same person. At one point we flirted with the idea of hooking up but never acted on it.\n\nAnyway, as it usually goes, we went our separate ways after high school and lost contact for a while. A couple of nights ago we reconnected on social media and met up for coffee. It was as if we never lost touch. We picked up right where we left off years ago and spent the night talking and laughing like the old days. As it turns out, she was on the verge of breaking up with her current boyfriend of two years. I talked her through it and offered my friendly, no-strings-attached advice. \n\nHere’s where things take a turn. The next day she completely goes off on me, accusing me of lying to her, manipulating her, and pulling some kind of con to get her into bed. Now, I will admit I sensed a bit of a spark between us the other night, but given all the shit I’ve gone through last year, I genuinely just wanted to reconnect with my old friend. I explained it to her, but it turns out her boyfriend had somehow convinced her that I sent him our messages (the ones where I essentially highlighted the reasons to break up with him, mind you). I did not. I had no ulterior motive. I was not trying to pull anything. I just wanted my friend back in my life. But she wouldn’t have any of it. Not only did she persist on calling me a liar, she took it to a personal level and said things along the lines of “everyone in high school was right about you” “you’re not who I thought you were” “I should’ve listened to them.” Never have I been so hurt or disappointed by someone. I essentially told her to figure her own shit out and to leave me out of whatever disastrous hell hole of a relationship she’s caught herself in. I told her I wasn’t gonna waste any time or energy in explaining myself, and that if she’s gonna take her manipulative boyfriend’s word over her friend’s, it’s clear where she stands. I feel like shit. Not only because of what she said, but I feel like I failed her as a friend. \n\nTL;DR. My longtime friend accused me of coming between her and her boyfriend to try and get her for myself. Distraught, I left her to fight her own battles and I feel like a shitty friend for doing so.

I don’t know why. they never tell me.\n\nthis isn’t relevant, but some things that happened in the past.\nI heard through my other sibling that my sibling has said they wished that I was never born. \nthey have told me to die.\nthey have sent me negative paragraph length text messages in the past.\nthey made threats to take my stuff away.\nwhenever I would be around our pets, they would take them away. this will also happen when I’m talking to my sibling, they would always take the sibling away from me.\nthey did things to humiliate me, i won’t specify what because it embarrasses me, so i guess this won’t count as a point.\n\nnow here are on going things they do.\nthey always do stuff like turn their back on me, as if they want to keep me out of their view.\nwhenever i come into the room, they always drop silent and be a bit passive aggressive. or they would leave the room.\nwhen they see me, they always start slamming stuff and stomp around.\nthey back talk me.\nwhen they get mad at me, they always assume things and never want to hear my side. they only want to hear theirs.\nthey often project their anger onto me.\n\ni can’t think of anything else they do.\n\nnow, this could be an explanation why they do all this.\nmy sibling is schizophrenic, and they have been mentally abused. \n\nthey have told me that i take everything they do towards me too personally. because when they do these things, i tend to overreact because it hurts me, honestly. I think I am taking their actions too personally and I should grow thick skin.\ni have tried telling my mother about it, but she has reminded me that my sibling is mentally ill and that they will tend to react this way. \n\nnow, i’ll be honest. I kind of believe in “treat others how you want to be treated”. i know you may think that is bull. but, because of how my sibling treats me, i usually give my sibling the silent treatment, and i usually try to avoid them the best i can. however, i don’t think i should be entitled to be doing that because it may be encouraging them.\n\ni feel very trapped and i feel so uncomfortable in this house because of them, especially under their presence. this has been going on all my life. i have never done anything to my sibling... at least not that i know of, but they never tell me anything. they just always assume that i’m mad at them. they always have, even when i do nothing.\n\ni appreciate any judgement and criticism.\nthanks for your time.",

      "description": "This happened about a month ago, but the details are more than clear.\n\nI  matched with a girl on Tinder, let's say her name is Erin. Erin looks amazing in her profile, great body, cute face, funny bio, what's not to like? We talk for a few days, I eventually ask for her number and we text from there. I also ask for her snapchat because I tend to be on there more than iMessage, she declines in suspicion that I will send/ask her nude pictures, fair enough, it happens with tinder matches. \n\nFriday rolls along, and the plans that we have agreed on are going to happen. Watch a movie and then chill after. She says she will take an uber to the movie theater, I offer to pick her up and she declines saying that it will be faster to uber. Me, trying to save her some money, offer again to pick her up, she eventually says that is fine and sends me her address. \n\nI get to her place, and she walks out. At first I was not sure whether this person was a catfish or not, this was not the Erin that I had seen in the pictures. The great body that I had seen in the photos does not exist, it looks like she has gained 100 pounds. The cute face is there if you squint hard enough, but to top it all off, she smells like straight cigarettes. I'm not talking a little bit, this is multiple packs a day smoker, she never mentioned that to me at any point. \n\nImmediately I was turned off, not only is the smoke smell putrid, but I really do not want to spend the next 3 hours with this woman, she is absolutely not what she had described herself to be. Instead of going to the movies, I make the excuse that I left my wallet at my apartment and I have to stop by and pick it up. I drop her off outside and tell her I gotta park and I will be back, to end the story, I did not come back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for ditching my tinder date that refused to send me any pictures of herself, didn't bring up that she smokes heavily, and looks absolutely nothing like her pictures?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - My tinder date refuses to send me current pictures of herself, when I pick her up she smells of cigs and looks like she has let herself go, and I ditched her later on.",

      "description": "**Background:** I was in a brief relationship with this person we'll call A. He was a cool guy and I really liked him, but we were just two different people and we were honestly better off as friends than anything more, so we decided to try and keep it like that. \n\nStarting a couple weeks ago, I was starting to get annoyed with A because he would stop responding to my messages. It's not like we were talking all the time, but I did try and stay in regular contact with him and we had been trying to set up a time for us to get coffee or something. But after only 2 or 3 messages, after all the pleasantries, he would just stop replying. Our conversations were usually over Snapchat, so I could see that he was opening my messages and not responding. It was bothering me that I was the only one who seemed to ever initiate conversations, and that he didn't ever seem to care to talk to me. Except, of course, the rare time he *would* contact me - when he was drunk, or horny, or both, and wanted me for other purposes.\n\nFinally, one night I had enough and sent him a message telling him that I was going to unfriend him if he was just going to keep ignoring me. I didn't like it that he only seemed to want to *use* me instead of actually talking to me, especially as I was having a bit of a rough time and was wanting someone to talk to like he always said I could with him. \n\nHis response was very condescending and was basically \"If you want to unfriend me than so be it, but I don't really know what you want me to say. Actually, I do - goodnight.\"\n\nSo I unfriended him on Snapchat like I said I would. I don't think he noticed at first because a couple of days later he tried saying \"hi\" to me, but after saying \"hello\" back (I shouldn't have responded, but oh well) he stopped responding again. Then about two days later he unfriended me off of all social media.\n\nI don't really feel bad about what I did, because I think I was pretty reasonable. I don't need to keep people around that make me feel like shit. But what does Reddit think? AITA?",

      "description": "So, last year, which was also my 1st semester, my English teacher told me that there is this English speaking competition that anyone of my school could participate in. At first, I didn't sign up for the competition, then I changed my mind and was going to participate but it was too late, therefore I could not compete.\n\nThe competition itself was the qualifier for the same thing, the only difference is that it is a city-level competition (competitors from all over the city I'm living in). A student from my class made it to the city-level competition, that's why my English teacher told the whole class that it was compulsory to go and cheer for her.\n\nJust this morning, when I was having my breakfast, my dad asked me where I would go after class. I told him that I would go cheer in the competition with my classmates, then attend 2 extra classes. My parents didn't know anything about me not participating in the competition, so they asked me why I didn't participate in it. My dad was a bit angry and told me that I didn't get to decide. Then he pointed at me and told that if there is any competition English-related that I didn't tell my dad about it, he would beat me. After that, I went to class.\n\nThen I went back home, only to find that my entire family was pissed at me, and still is. My brother, my mom, my dad. Even my sister-in-law seemed unhappy too. I think it's because my family has high expectations of me because my English is decent. Especially my brother and sister in law, they want to take me to Da Nang City for better education, especially in English.\n\nSo fellow Redditors, AITA?\n\n(Please don't mind any grammatical mistakes if there are any)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "It was hard to give this the necessary context in the title, but let me give you guys a better description of the situation.\n\nSo, I used to be roommates with this guy, and long-story short, he and I had a falling out over some miscommunication between us. He had also told my best friend that he couldn't wait to not live with me anymore, and I was understandably mad, but in hindsight, it was overdramatic for me to be as petty and mad as I was.\n\nFor several months after, my best friend and I would vent our frustrations about this guy (my ex-roommate) to each other. I had already blocked him and my other roommates (who I felt were complicit with his behavior) and so she did the same. Now, she has a different history with my ex-roommate. She knew him before I knew him. She had some confused feelings for him when things were rough with her BF at the time. But the thing is: she has also told me about a time that she and my ex-roommate were alone at my dorm, and he put her in a chokehold while they were messing around. She told me that she felt like he went to far and was not considerate toward her fears as a woman (which I totally understand). She resents him for that, but also because of his poor behavior with me, and she suspects he might even be a little racist (I am mixed black and white, and she is Latinx, but I truthfully never got the sense that was the case with him but I don't challenge her viewpoint).\n\nSo neither of us have had contact with him in well over a year and a half, other than rarely seeing them in passing around town. Yesterday, I got a text from my ex-roommate inviting me to a bonfire and karaoke night like we used to do when we lived together. I should mention that for the past several months, I've been seeing a counselor who helped me rethink the whole situation between my ex-roommate and me. Basically, I think I overreacted, but I still haven't forgotten what happened between my ex-roommate and I, though I am not mad about anymore, and haven't been for awhile now.\n\nSo... I kind of want to go to the bonfire, mostly because at one point, my ex-roommate and our other roommates (and their s/o's) and I were all friends. I enjoyed living with them for the year and some months before my ex-roommate and I had our falling out. The thing is...knowing my best friend's experience with him, I feel like this would make me a massive hypocrite for going since I shared ill opinions of him during the time I was still holding onto my anger (before I started seeing a counselor). But I'm in a far different frame of mind, now. Holding onto grudges is exhausting, for one.\n\nI feel like if my best friend found out I went to the bonfire, she would question my loyalty and possibly even sever ties immediately. I don't want that to happen because I absolutely adore her to death.\n\nSo, WIBTA?",

      "description": "Hey guys! So I just got my first full time job working in case management for mental health. It's going well, I think. My coworkers are all so kind and inclusive and my supervisors are all really accessible. I'm making good money and I think we're all progressing well. My only concern is that I'm not often making the day's productivity. We have to spend roughly. 4.5 hours of face time or phone time with clients a day, but due to the nature of mental health, a lot of people flake or cancel. Additionally, travel time doesn't count. My coworkers have told me a lot of people quit because they're not making productivity and I'm really worried about being written up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, before I got this job, I was in contact with a job that was directly in my field of study for my master's. They were very interested in me and said they were planning on creating a full time position for me because of how well the interview went. I wanted to accept, but it took them a long time to organize themselves and eventually they said that I should take another job because they didn't know when they'd get their act together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust last night I got an email from them saying they've organized themselves and they'd like to talk to me about the job. I've discovered that with just 2.5 hours a week more (because my current job is 37.5 hours a week, and this potential job is 40 hours a week) I could actually afford a dollar per hour LOSS and still make more money in this new job. They haven't told me salary yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I quit my job I've been at for two months for a job in my field and possibly the same or more money? It's going so well that I'm worried about ruining a good relationship with a big company. But I also need to do what's best for me. What do you think?",

      "description": "A few years back, my dad took his own life. I cried my eyes out the days before the funeral and just felt dead during the service. I choked through my eulogy, we buried his ashes, and everyone started talking amongst themselves. Nothing crazy, nothing big, just like he would've wanted.\n\nThe whole time, I just felt off. My mind was swimming, like I was drifting through a dream.\n\nMy dad had a buddy from work who couldn't make it for some reason, but his wife showed up.\nI met them both when I was small, during a summer break where my dad took me to the oil field where he and his friend worked. His wife babysitted me while my dad and him were working.\n\nShe was...whatever. Her idea of hanging out was dragging me around and shopping for purses she couldn't afford. She took me to a movie and bowling once, but that was about it.\n\nShe showed up and offered me condolences, I thanked her and wandered off to just be by myself. Like I said, I was kind of in a daze.\n\nI come back to the big circle of people comprised of my mom, my sister, my dad's siblings and the wife, and I arrive just in time to hear the wife talking to my family about the time she looked after me, and she follows up with \"But you know what my favorite part was?\" and proceeds to tell them about an extremely embarrassing thing I did while she looked after me.\nEveryone else gave \"yeahs\" and chuckles, but I actually stumbled back from shock and embarrassment. I was so pissed I heard blood in my ears. Why was she gushing to my damn family about this during my dad's funeral, of all places?\n\nAfterwards, the crowd dispersed and she cornered me again. She wanted to swap phone numbers \"so we could hang out again sometime.\" She's a married 40-something who lives with her husband miles away from me, a 14 year old(at the time), and she wants to do this cutesy shit. The only reason we met in the first place is because my dad knew her husband and she was the only one there my dad knew would keep me in one piece.\n\nShe kept pestering me to copy down her number into my flip phone and at this point, I just want her to leave, but I was too much of a pushover for that, so I fumbled with my phone a little before I got frustrated and told her I'd memorize it. She has the balls to give me this amused smile like she knows I'm lying and just want to get out of this. Fuck her.\n\nWe all left soon after that and pretty soon I started coming undone and venting to my mom and sister in the car.\n\nMy sister calmed me down as best she could, but I just got this knot of anger in my chest that didn't go away for a long time.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for resenting her for the way she acted? The whole chain of events has just been bugging me lately, and I'd appreciate an outside opinion.",

      "description": "I have a 6 month old baby and have always withheld her images from social media- aside from an initial announcement on Facebook looking like basically every newborn out there.\nIn order for my family and close friends to keep up with her, we created a shared, private photostream.\n\nMy mom is constantly posting pics of my niece and nephews on Facebook and IG. She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\n\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom’s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it’s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don’t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\n\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\n\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It’s been two weeks, and we haven’t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she’s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew’s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.\nIt’s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it’s cruel I am “withholding the opportunity” for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.\nIt’s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn’t since our blow out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?\n\nTl;dr: I won’t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.\n",

      "description": "REPOST: (Last post had mentions of stuff that I guess wasn't 'sub appropriate')\n\nOver the last five years or so my father has been getting progressively worse in the way he treats my brother and I. However he has been treating my mom like shit since she started working again. He constantly degrades her to my brother and I when she isn't home, he talks about her to family, and constantly puts down her appearance and life choices if he doesn't personally agree with them. \n\nMy mother is has lost nearly thirty pounds since she began working and is now sitting at about 90 to 100 pounds. She's stopped eating and just gets up to work. Now, we had a conversation not too long ago about how she was depressed and contemplating some pretty messed up things. I blankly told her that my brother and I don't even really like our father and that she should just leave him because even though she isn't my favorite person all the time, she doesn't deserve to be treated like absolute shit everyday after a 10 hour work day.  She promised me that she would consider it and that if he doesn't stop smoking, drinking, and actually find a job she will leave him.\n\nMy cousin who was over at the time had been listening in and told me that I needed to stay out of my parent's business and that I had no right to try and break their marriage up. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for wanting my mom to drop my dad once and for all?

      "description": "The title is very weird but please listen to my story. In the last school year some girl joined the semester half way through let’s call her Dany. Well Dany was a smart and very sweet girl and a goody-two-shoes at heart. But when the school year ended all of her friends left. And there was only one more person with who she could talk to introducing Alice, well Alice is a very difficult person to describe because her personality is every personality ever she can be cruel, rude, mad, but she call also be sweet, and sometimes understandable. So Dany has no one to talk to so she talked to her. And they became friends! Which in my eyes is all well and good. But I started to fall in love with Dany so I started to talk to her more via texting and one thing left to an other and she said “I just don’t know (me) I just feel like I have change I don’t do things because I like them I do them because I want attention” when I saw this I got very worry as any one would so I went to Alice to talk about this and Alice had a rant about how she is such a bad friend. So I told her to do what she thought was right. And she thought that by that I meant to stop being friends with her. So Alice goes to Dany to tell her that she wants to stop being friends. But one thing left to another and now Alice is blaming me that I wanted to break their relationship because I loved Dany and wanted her all to myself. And now Alice is making false claims on how I said that they should break up and I can’t tell if I did something wrong did I?",

      "title": "AITA for doing a project on my own and not showing up to the presentation?",
      "description": "So this happened about a year ago, and I just kind of started thinking about it.\n\nIn a class I had there was a huge (50% of our grade) project that we were assigned in the beginning of the year and had until about the end to finish it. We had the choice to work alone or in groups of 2 or 3. I had two friends in that class and they both immediately looked at me and wanted to be a group of three. I wasn't expecting them to just let me do all the work, especially since they both love the subject so much and seemed very excited about the project. One of them even pulled up a good amount of potential sources on the first day.\n\nThen days go by and nothing gets done. Days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months and we are basically left with 3 weeks to finish this entire project. At that point only like 10% of it was done. I procrastinated too up until here. I realized this needed to be done asap, so I basically spent those 3 weeks finishing the entire project by myself. I even had to take some days off school to sit and work on it all day since we were so behind. If I had gotten help we honestly could have finished it ahead of time but I was working on it up until the very last minute. \n\nOne of my partners came over a couple times near the end just to help assemble the presentation, which was nice, and he said he was sorry for not showing up to help do the research. On the other hand, my other partner just got pissed off at me when I expressed I was upset I did the whole thing on my own, and she kept claiming she did a lot of work and bringing up how she gave me a bunch of sources (they were actually just sources found by searching a keyword, I still had to look through all of them and make sure they were relevant and credible, then annotate the ones that were).\n\nWe had to present this project later and I actually had plans ahead of time (before we even knew the presentation date) to be out of town with family on the day of the presentation. I COULD have cancelled the plans, but I was so pissed about how my partner was acting I decided not to. The teacher even said not showing up wouldnt affect your grade as long as at least one person from your group was there and both my other partners were there. I feel bad that they did the presentation on their own, but in the end we got like a 98% on the project and the only place we lost points was the presentation, and when we got the feedback it was all about how obvious it was that the people presenting didnt know what exactly they were talking about. \n\nI'm still friends with the one partner that helped me a bit near the end but the other one just stopped talking to me and has been telling everyone about how horrible I am for not showing up, but leaving out that I made the entire project. so AITA??",

      "description": "I got another one for ya\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for the 4+ years my lady companion and I have been together, we've had an underlying issue. Or rather, *I've* had an underlying issue as I've only brought it up very few times. \n\nI **feel** like she goes out of her way to interact with other dudes (she has a type, and I'm not that *type* anymore, though she still loves me to pieces because that's just how it is) just to get me jealous. That might not be the case, but hear me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe work at the same place, but in different.... departments I guess. Another guy that works in another department has been interacting with her for a while. Their first interaction was her showing him a meme or something even though they've never spoken before that, to my knowledge. He makes jewelry and sells it online, so he agreed to make her a necklace. I hate that necklace because I'm a jealous dick, but obviously, I don't express my jealousy of them two to her, because she might just be trying to make friends, I dunno.\n\nHe didn't know we were together for the first couple months they've been talking. So he messaged her one day while her and I were watching TV and asked if he can come \"chill\", and I believe she responded with something about \"I'm with with my boyfriend\" and I'm not sure where the convo went from there.\n\nA couple days, maybe a week ago she told me he's making her a **ring**. A little background as to why this bothers me; I bought her a ring that says \"Zelda\" years ago and I've worn one that says \"Link\" for just as long. We've had to get replacements, but that's besides the point. She stopped wearing her ring maybe a year or two ago because she wasn't too into rings ***apparently.*** \n\nSo he's making her a moonstone ring and I know she'll wear it everywhere she goes as she does the necklace. OH! I also bought her a moonstone necklace, that she only wore for two days after I bought it. I get that, I'm not a necklace person myself but you get the point. \n\nShe talks super highly of him because of his skills, but doesn't even show a shred of interest in my hobbies or things I'm extremely passionate about. I'm not just saying that to make her sound rude or anything, I've genuinely tried showing her songs I've written or mastered and she just acts very uninterested with \"mm-hm\"'s and \"neat\". It breaks me but doesn't get to me too badly. \n\nShe talks about him and what he does to her parents, my parents, or anybody that'll listen. She's not like \"he's so hot, he's so funny\", she just talks about his skills and how talented he is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWow this is worded horribly, but bear with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR— **Am I the asshole for being salty about my girlfriend taking an interest in some other guys hobbies more than mine? Am I the asshole for not being okay with how they interact?**",

      "description": "Recently my wife and I went over to a neighbors house to play Cards Against Humanity. They have a son that is around the same age as our boys. The boys do enjoy playing together and get along well. Their son is an only child and does enjoy playing with our boys. The boys went and played in the playroom while the adults sat at the table and played cards and had some adult beverages. Every once in awhile one kid would come over complaining “so and so isn’t sharing” or some other problem. It was getting late for the kids and they started to fight more than play so we ended up leaving in the middle of the game. Now, I love my children and I do enjoy spending time with them, but sometimes I wouldn’t mind just having some adult time and playing cards and not have to stop every few minutes to deal with some issue. I have brought it up to my wife that we should just go over and play cards without the kids and leave them with her mom for a bit or maybe go after they are asleep and that way grandma doesn’t have to watch them but is there if they wake up. I always seem to get some pushback on this idea. She will say, “well we had them they’re our responsibility”, and she acts like I just want to pawn them off every chance I get. Which makes me kinda feel like an asshole. I just would like to have some “adult” time. She never seems to think that’s a good idea and just kinda scoffs at my suggestion. So am I the asshole because I want to play cards and not bring the kids over even if they have a kid to play with them?",

      "description": "Hi, this is actually my first post on reddit after lurking for so long, i apologize im on mobile rn so the formating isn't the best. im just really frustrated and idk if im wrong\n\nSo i met this girl in middleschool  i'll call her jd (her initials) we were pretty great friends for a few years and then we started to drift away. Nothing major but we just weren't into the same stuff anymore and we still hung out as a friend group. From my point of view there was no hard feelings we just weren't as close. (i used to have feelings for her a bit back but that doesn't matter in this context)\nI came out to one of our mutual friends as queer (im pan but idk back then) and she took it ok.She promised she won't tell anyone but told a bunch of people (i live in Serbia and most people are very conservative) and jd ended up being one of them.\nAfter that jd started acting weird around me and would occasionally cancel plans if she knew i was coming. I thought she just felt weird about me liking girls and i let it go. Fast forward a few moths she actually moved to a different city.\nI found out later by the friend i came out to that jd was talking shit with a bunch of our friends in a group chat I WAS IN. She was saying how she's disgusted by lesbian relationships and she'd disown her child if they were gay, but also said that 2 men in a relationship is hot.\nofc i was mad but there's even more tea\nMy friend messaged jd privately to tell her she was being an asshole and jd told her how me liking girls is just a phase and that i'll find a boyfriend soon.\nNow nothing annoys me more than that and i emmidiately cut off all contact.\n\n\nMy friend is saying that im mad at jd for  a stupid reason, and is saying im a huge dick bc jd wants to be friends again (without apologizing ofc) and idk if she's right. \nSo reddit AITA? \n\n",

They even said \"good thing (baby) didn't die.\"\n\nAITA? I am very low contact with this sibling due to tension that began when I had my first child because sibling oversteps boundaries constantly.

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to repeatedly be asked when I’m going to have a baby?",
      "description": "My husband and I got married in August at the JOP. My MIL, GMIL and parents were there. 10 minutes after the ceremony my stepdad asked when we were going to have a baby. Since then, he has brought it up every time we are around him, more so when other people are around. I think he’s looking for their validation or trying to get a conversation going about it. The first few times he asked, I would reply with something like, “Not any time soon,” or “It’s going to be a while.” I figured this was clear enough to satisfy him or would at least make him aware that this wasn’t something we were ready to discuss. My mom is usually quiet and doesn’t say anything when he does this.\n\n\n\nOver the last few months he has gone so far as to share things on FB about a new grandchild. Every time he does, I ask him to remove the post because 1. It’s not his business to put out there and 2. Why does anyone else on FB care? I have fielded pregnancy questions from several family members after he does this. He removed one of the posts. \n\n\n\nMy parents, my sister and her husband were at our house for dinner last week. My stepdad was talking to my husband, and I overheard just the end of the conversation. My husband pretended not to hear him to avoid even talking about it. My stepdad repeated himself, but loud enough that everyone heard him. He told my husband he was losing faith in us that we would ever give them a baby.\n\n\n\nThe way he said it made me feel like he thinks we are obligated to provide him a grandchild. It made me angry so I told him that if and when we have a child is none of his business. He told me to shut up, that he was joking. I said that he was not joking because of the frequency of him bringing it up every time we see him. I mentioned the FB posts he has made that he wouldn’t take down after I asked him to. I told him it made me uncomfortable being asked about it and that maybe we would not be able to have children and every time he brings it up, it hurts my feelings. I said he doesn’t take into consideration a number of factors that go into having a child, and I would appreciate it if he would stop talking about it until we decide we want to talk about it.\n\n\n\nEventually he told me I wasn’t allowed to speak to him that way, and he and my mom left. I apologized to my mom the next day for how I reacted because I know I didn’t need to yell, but not for why I was upset. I told her I wasn’t trying to put her in an awkward position. She responded by telling me how disappointed she is in me and that I crossed a line by speaking to him that way. I told her I am not a child any longer and if I don’t want to talk to them about something personal my husband and I are going through, I don’t think I should have to.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR my stepdad continually asks when we’re going to have a baby to the point it’s making us uncomfortable. I yelled at him and now my mom is mad at me.\n\n\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "I was in LA visiting a friend and was picking him up from work. He gave me the address and as I turned into the driveway I realized it was a parking garage. I took a ticket so the gate opened and parked in a visitor spot for a few minutes until my friend came down and got in the car. I went to leave the parking gate and handed the attendant my ticket. I told her I had only been there for a minute to pick up my friend and asked if I had to pay. She said yes and pointed to a sign that said \"$1 minimum per entry\". I paid her $1 in cash, she opened the gate and we left. \n\nMy friend and I went to dinner and he had to go back to the office. He didn't have the access card to get him through the front door after hours, only through the elevator so we had to go back into the parking garage. My friend gave me a dollar because I was going to have to go through the gate again. I pulled through the gate with the dollar already in my hand and saw it was the same parking attendant. I waved at her with the dollar, showing her I had the money to pay again.\n\nMy friend got out and as I turn around I see the attendant is leaving the parking booth, with the gate closed. I pull up to the gate and wait about 10 minutes. She comes back with her manager/supervisor. The supervisor leans into my window and says \"Apparently you've been pulling in and out of here all day, it's an established pattern and you can't do that.\"\n\nI told her I had been there once to pick up my friend and was back now to drop them off. She said, \"Yeah but you were told you couldn't do that without paying. And you didn't so you can't do that.\" I am still HOLDING THE DOLLAR. I pointed to the initial security guard who was standing behind her and said, \"She told you I didn't pay? I paid a dollar the first time and I'm obviously holding one now.\"\n\nThe supervisor turns around and begins talking to the attendant. I said \"Excuse me? What is she saying I didn't do? Is she saying I didn't pay? Excuse me?\" She refuses to look at me and turns around after a few minutes and says, \"You've been pulling in and out all day so how about we drop the attitude?\"\n\nI repeat AGAIN, I have been here twice, once to pick up my friend and now to drop them off. I said \"Did she say I didn't pay?\" And the supervisor said, \"She gave you a break and you came back here and you can't do that?\" \"Did she say I didn't pay?\" \"You can't do that.\" \"Did she say I refused to pay?\" \"You can't do turn arounds all day.\"\n\nJust back and forth with no answer. I finally say, \"Look maybe she told you she didn't charge me the first time but she did. I paid a dollar. I am obviously HOLDING A DOLLAR NOW so I'm ready to pay again. Once I picked my friend up, there was no way to get them back in the building without coming through here. I have pulled through the gate twice. I was told I could not enter without paying, not that I could not enter. So can you take my dollar and LET ME LEAVE?\"\n\nThe supervisor takes the dollar, leans into my car and says \"You can't come back here.\" and then opens the gate.\n\nI have no idea what the issue was the attendant had that she was reporting. If she pocketed the dollar, why would she call attention to it? If I'm willing to pay each time, why the hell is it an issue if I pull in and out all day? \n\nI told my friend who worked in the building about it and  they reported it to building security and was notified that the attendant has been 'given a strike'. \n\nAITA for reporting an attendant over a $2 parking fee that I ended up paying?",

      "title": "AITA for supposedly using a well-known podcast as inspiration for a pet project of mine?",
      "description": "Summer of 2017 I started listening to Welcome to Night Vale since I traveled a lot. I loved the spooky, weird, and strange nature of it. I loved how it took the supernatural and made it seem like a mundane part of life. I loved the format, a community radio station. Since I lived in a desert town in New Mexico for a few years, I could relate to it. \n\nAlso during that summer, maybe a couple months after I started binging WTNV, I wrote a sarcastic and witty post on my hometown’s (Florida, not New Mexico) Facebook page after some funny things happened (dude was arrested for being naked at a kid’s splash pad, a couple were caught having sex behind the McDonald’s Dumpster, and brief power outages that no one could explain). It was, in my mind, a real life episode of WTNV. The post was an absolute hit. Everyone loved it and asked for me to write weekly reviews of everything that happens in town. Its a humor bit I write every Sunday night. Mostly make fun of the weird shit that happens, or play on the repeated complaints people make on Facebook about our town. It’s still going strong even to today. I’m about 14 weeks from celebrating my 100th post, and my two year anniversary is coming up in June as well. \n\nEvery now and then I have comments saying how much my format reminds them of Welcome to Night Vale, to which I will reply that the podcast was my initial inspiration for my work in the beginning, but I strive to make it unique, to make it mine, to make it special to my hometown. I do have all my posts saved up in a compilation. I don’t plan on actually publishing it for monetary gain, so I’m not pushing on copyright infringement with many other things (posts mention certain businesses and people). \n\nHowever, last night I got the comment that I AM infringing on copyright, and that I need to stop posting. It was one comment, one hater, which I do get every now and then. When it comes to usual haters I just ignore them. More often than not my supporters will take care of them for me. Like my Christmas special when I wrote The 12 Day of Christmas (but with things only my hometown will get). One comment said I need to move if I’m so negative about the town. Sadly, my being negative is a literal joke on all the people who post negative complaints all the freaking time. I’m just making fun of them. I love my (Florida) town. I moved away for 5 years and learned to love it again when I moved back.\n\nBut this one person has been consistently negative towards me in the last few weeks, often saying I’m not funny, annoying, and unoriginal (claiming I’m stealing Night Vale’s bit). Like I said, I don’t plan on making my weekly bit into a real thing. I do plan on writing a novelized version soon with original characters and plot, things that reference the town itself. Other than that, I strive to be original and creative, but mostly it’s just to have fun. It’s strengthened my ability as an aspiring writer, and the support I get is a total confidence boost I needed. \n\nPersonally, I don’t see how I’m an asshole, but I just wanted to ask just in case.

      "description": "So, I’m pretty socially awkward and I have a really hard time reading social situations, just thought id preface this with that.\n\nI’m a freshman in college and I’ve been trying to reach out and meet new people, make friends and whatnot. About a month ago my school had this involvement fair where all the clubs could go and recruit, and I saw that there was quidditch table. It looked really cool, I’m a huge fan of Harry Potter and I’ve been looking for ways to be more active and the people at the table seemed really cool, so I signed up.\n\nThe first meeting was like a week later at the soccer fields, and when I got there I was one of only three people there. I went and sat down on one of the bleachers and got ready to introduce myself but the other two seemed to be kinda locked in what looked like a serious convo so I didn’t. When more people started to come, the two people stood up and started to run the meeting, so they were the organizers. After a while we started doing stretches and a few exercises, and afterwards there was like a ten minute break.\n\nAt this point pretty much everyone seemed to either already know one another or they just hit it off right away, so I started to kinda freak out bc I hadn’t talked to a single person the entire time. There was this group of like five or six people standing around talking, and I kinda walked over and stood in the same general area. They were talking about Skyrim and a few other games, and I thought this was my chance to get in on the conversation so I said, “Skyrim is like my favorite game” or something like that. And they all went like SILENT and just stared at me. I don’t know if I committed some kind of social faux pas or what but they seemed really offended that I interrupted their convo. \n\nNaturally I just kinda awkwardly apologized and went about the rest of the practice as normal. From that point on I still tried to get in on conversation but the same thing would happen every time. Even in the group chat, everyone would just kinda ignore my messages. Eventually I just stopped coming to meetings bc, what was the point? I need to know though AITA for trying to jump in on that conversation?",

I said it was already cold and that I'm not having the window open when its 7 degrees outside. He said that it was so hot in our room that his ears were burning and that it was at least 82 degrees. He went to open the window and I raised my voice and said that I am not having 7 degree air enter our room, and that if he felt feel like he was hot, he needs change out of his long sleeve clothing. I stopped him from opening the window, and we begrudgingly agreed to open the window about a centimeter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards, he began sarcastically remarking about how sorry he was that he disagreed with me. Example sentence:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm so sorry I disagreed with such a godly man. You're clearly always right, I'm so sorry.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then got angry and said he was drunk if he thought it was hot in here, reminded him that nobody else thinks it's hot, and said he should go to the doctor for a fever. It was seven fucking degrees outside and there was no way in hell that window was opening more than a crack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe then remained angry for about 20 minutes, constantly reminding me about how salty and angry I was about it (I already got over it considering that the window was hardly open, I have no idea what he was talking about).\n\nI told him that he was acting like a victim and that he should grow up. I reminded him that it was 7 degrees outside and that I wasn't having the window opened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo top it off, he afterwards asked me if I was going to stab him at night, and that it seemed like something I would do.\n\nIn the past, I've gotten slightly physical (a push) when he, for the 9th time that day, went to open the blinds that let the sunlight glare on my computer screen, I lost patience with him wanting to sacrifice the ability for me to use my computer because our room's ceiling light wasn't good enough for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards, a friend came into my room asking for the temperature outside, and I said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"It's seven degrees outside. Ya wanna know how I know? Cause \\[Roommate\\] wanted to open the fucking window.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Today at school, i could sense my friend was in a pissy mood. We agreed couple months back if she ever felt bad and didn’t want to to talk to me, all she had to say was “i don’t want to talk to you right now” or “i’m in a bad mood”.\n\nAnyways, I asked her to see what was wrong with her, if anything was wrong. As we were walking, she said “no” coldly. I didn’t believe it so i asked her “are you sure?”. She then said in a very bold voice, without looking at me “i’m fine”, and completely droned past me.\n\nNow the problem is, I am angry because I actually went out of my way to give a damn about her situation (if she was in one) more than ALL of her friends, and i know this fact. But the paradox is, I feel angry but i am not sure if i have any right to because i don’t know if i insisted on knowing what was wrong with her, assumed there was something wrong in the first place or just was annoying.\n\nI am probably sounding like a triggered liberal, but i really love and care for this friend’s well being.\nThanks for taking the time to read.",

Now, there is this one \"friend\" that I decided to stop talking to after explaining to her that I don't care for the way she treats me. I explained it once and she apologized but continued to do it. Then, I stopped communication with her. We're both adults, I'm not going to beg for your respect and you shouldn't have to be told how to treat people. Now when we were bowling, she and my other friend were acting kinda shitty. They are those \"can't handle at my worst, don't deserve me at my best.\" But one of them is actually tolerable. And after they were acting shitty and making people uncomfortable, I went up to her and explained how she made me feel and that it made me not want to talk to her anymore. She explained that she could tell that she was playing up her personality and apologized and has since toned it down. But the other girl started talking about me and how I always bring up drama and can never just let things go. Personally, I feel if you have a problem with someone, you should privately discuss it and then see where the situation goes from there. There's nothing wrong with stating your feelings. Am I starting drama a lot and just not seeing it?",

      "description": "TL;DR: I can't deal with my youngest sibling and prefer not to be around him\n\nI (young adult male) am currently living in with my parents and school-aged siblings. The youngest is in elementary school. We'll call him Charlie.\n\nCharlie was an unexpected addition to our family towards the beginning of the decade. I should note that the sibling before him was born *nine* years prior. This represents a significant age gap and makes it hard for any of us to relate to a kid his age. \n\nCharlie acts out. Constantly. He's an unreasonably picky eater, has to constantly be told to do things like knock on doors or not stand on the furniture because he \"forgets,\" and in general just has no respect for other people or their personal space. I think this is mostly due to a lack of discipline and my parents being too old, weary and busy to properly raise him, but that's another story.\n\nI should make it clear that I don't go out of my way to abuse or be mean to him. It's just that being around him at all is really hard on my anxiety. Hell, just being in an office all day wears me out. When I come home, all I really want to do is be in my room, alone. I used to be able to do things like sit down and eat dinner with my family, something which I'm no longer willing to do because all of our dinner situations are either Charlie wanting to leave the table and go watch TV or having to be coerced into eating his food. That is, if Mom or Dad didn't just take extra time to make him his own meal.\n\nThing is, I used to try to be more active about setting an example for Charlie. I would try to keep him from watching/playing violent games or viewing explicit Youtube videos. Of course, being in a shared home, I usually don't get the final say in any of those things. Any attempts to discipline him (as in, telling him to stop or pulling him away) will just result in my parents scolding me in front of everyone. It's just taken so much out of me, and I don't think it's worth the hassle anymore.\n\nI'll still do things like make him food or babysit him if I'm asked to. That's fair enough, since I'm still living in the family home. I do those things out of duty to my parents. But outside of that, I just prefer not to have anything do with Charlie. I'm not mentally equipped for dealing with him and I think it's best for both of us if I keep my distance. I feel bad because part of me feels it's the responsibility of me as an older sibling to try to have a positive influence on him. On the other hand, I never chose for him to be born into the family. I'm fourteen years older than him and I can't relate to him at all. I also feel that my parents aren't doing their part in raising him properly, especially since they brought him into the world in the first place. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "I used to have this best friend, we'll call her Mary, that I met, while attending a boarding school for just one year. She was my first roommate, and we quickly became very close to each other, always hung out and had a lot of fun. The day we met, we basically knew pretty much every important detail that had to be said about ourselves within an hour or so, and I had never felt such a strong connection with any other friend I had ever had. We were both very depressive at the time, but it was especially rough for her, because of some problems with her family. I would often try to support her as much as I possibly could with the surplus of energy I had, as well as sitting up all night to comfort her, when she needed me. Whenever she was mad at me, I would try to make it up to her and deal with it, so we would avoid any kind of conflict. Basically, I wanted to please her in every way, since she meant a lot to me.  \n\n\nAs a minimum, you could study at the boarding school for one year, while the maximum amount of years you could attend the school was 3 years. Though I had plans about attending the school for two years, instead of just one, I got talked into just getting a youth education, while she decided to stick around for another year. During that year, she was really depressed, felt lonely without me there, as well as feeling like an outcast. When I went to visit her at the school, I would often see her with new cuts on her arm, which made me feel really bad about myself, since I felt like I had let her down, though I stayed in contact through social media. I don't know, if any of that has got to do with what happened later on. If so, that is taken into account.  \n\n\nA youth education here usually takes between 2-3 years, and when I started my 3rd year, she was in her 1st year, we had both made new friends during the time we had spent apart, and she seemed a little annoyed that I had gotten close with another girl, we'll call her Diana, but never mentioned anything about it (until later, when we had a fight). (At this point in time, I had a boyfriend, who wasn't very faithful to me, and since we were close, I felt like I could tell her everything and get help from her, just like I used to help her. Him being unfaithful made me very jealous. This will play a role later on, since it ended up being used against me).  \nThough I had school, boyfriend, new friends etc., I wanted to spend more time with her again, so therefore I asked her, if she would like to meet up more, do something, have a sleepover or whatever came to my mind, and we would often make plans. I would look forward to them, only for her to cancel them last minute. At first, I didn't mind, but one day, when she cancelled one of our plans, I saw that she was at the cinema instead with one of her new friends (I looked at her My Story on Snapchat). When she had cancelled the plan, she told me that something else had come up, so I felt hurt, when I saw that she was with another friend, we'll call her Anne. I've been raised with the ideas that, if you have two plans on the same day, you go to the one, which you got invited to first, so that might've sparked my reaction as well. I understand that she has the right to pick, which person she wants to spend her time with, though.  \nThe next day, I decided to text her about what I had seen and told her that I felt like I had been replaced, how I felt pushed away, which she told me was absolute nonsense.  \nAs I tried to argue my case, she eventually stopped responded, but her friend, Anne, decided to text me something in style of: \"You may push your boyfriend around and treat him however you want, but you can't treat Mary however you want. She's allowed to have other friends than you.\", which made me feel backstabbed, since I didn't expect Mary to tell Anne about my personal problems and framing me. I expressed myself to her as well, and made it clear to the both of them that of course she is allowed to have other friends, but the problem was that she had been cancelling plans with me to be with Anne instead. Besides that I told Anne that it was a low blow to bring my relationship into it all, before blocking her. It ended out with a long discussion between Mary and I, and she wouldn't talk to me for a long time, though I apologized to her several times, so in the end I decided to just let her be. Even though we are no longer in contact, I still feel like she was in the wrong, so I've been wondering about it.  \n\n\nTL,DR: (Former) best friend started to cancel plans with me to be with another friend instead, when we had planned out to do something together. Ended up in a fight, where I told her about how I felt about it.",

      "description": "I found out I was pregnant the same day my step sons mum confirmed she was pregnant. This seemed to really worry my partner about his son having so much change in both households. \n\nWhen we first found out his immediate reaction was “well, we know what to do because we aren’t ready”  and I burst into tears. When I met my partner he said he fell in love with me because I was just born to be a mother and I felt the same. His son was my best friend. I have helped raise him since he was 6 months old and he is now turning 6. \n\nWhen I calmed down I reminded him how much I wanted to be a mother, and that I understood the circumstances weren’t perfect but that I never really thought they would be. He didn’t take to this well and ignored me, but stood firm On terminating because; 1) step sons mum being pregnant. 2) “I’m not ready”. 3) less than perfect financial situation (I receive a disability pension and he runs his own business(when he wants))\n\nI completely understood reason 1, because we spent the last 4 years in court fighting for the 50% custody we have of his son now. The ex wife of my partner has severe mental issues and used her son as a pawn to make my partner suffer. \n\nWhat I didn’t understand was, could you be “not ready” after you’ve had your first child? Why I also struggled to understand this is, my partner is a great dad but he’s struggling at the moment with being motivated so I do a lot even though I have multiple chronic illness’s. I look after the house, his son, and the business book work. So when I imagined having a child, I felt I’d be doing most of it on my own, another issue entirely obviously; but I just want to be a mother so that didn’t really bother me (at the time). \n\nWe went through with a medical termination in week 5 of my pregnancy. Immediately I told my partner how much I felt deep regret for our decision. To my shock he said “me too, I didn’t think you’d actually go through with it, but it’s probably for the best”.Over the next few weeks/months I continually discussed how broken I felt given the situation. At one point I stayed with my dad for 1 night for some support (and because my partner was acting very unsupportive). My partner told his mum I had a miscarriage and had been feeling depressed. She didn’t know the truth about anything. \n\nSince this has happened my partner has been researching guns, and has asked he put money aside to purchase a gun safe, guns, equipment as well as club membership and weekly club visits etc so he can shoot. I discussed how unfair this was in my opinion. We just had a car break down, he said we couldn’t afford a child, I have specialists I need to see. Anyway. Well, he’s paid for his gun license. He’s going ahead with it. I’m really struggling with this and feel I need to leave. Am I the asshole for feeling this way?",

      "description": "So for context my wife and I have a good group of friends and in that group we know someone named 'Liz' (hiding real name for her privacy). She's 35 and was married for almost 5 years but divorced her husband on account of infidelity on his part.\n\nShe's always been very timid and reserved. It's not the worst thing in the world but since the divorce she really seems to love attention from men. She's been seeing this guy for a bit and he seems nice. We were having a birthday party for one of our mutual friends so my wife and I invite Liz and her new boyfriend.\n\nHe doesn't show up but she does. She says he's working. Which was kind of weird this is at 8 PM and the guy works at a bank. So it's just odd I know there's always a chance but it threw me off. Also at the party was 'Brad' (also not real name). He's been single now for 5ish years and I can tell he's very anxious. He's been taken advantage of by various women because he tends to commit and overlook some really bad traits.\n\nSo at the party Liz starts talking to Brad and Brad gets infatuated with her. He's letting her drink his beer, he's grabbing her food, he's head over heels for her and this is an hour in to them meeting. I take Liz aside and ask her to not lead Brad on. I know how he is and can see that it's not going to end well. Well she snaps at me and storms out. Brad follows. Then a few others leave.\n\nWife's now mad at me for 'ruining the party' but in my opinion it was lose-lose either she was gonna lead him on and that comes crashing down or I bring it up and stop the awkward train wreck but deal with the fallout.\n\nWhat do you all think? AITA? Could I have handled this better?",

She is moving from our current one because she has had back and knee surgery so climbing stairs is very painful and difficult for her. And this new apartment is all one floor which is perfect for her. Since it is one bedroom she has talked with me multiple times asking me if I will be okay without her and paying rent by myself. I don't know if I'm ready but I'll try my best. The reason this is even happening is because she thinks I'm capable of being an adult and she trusts me however, the problem is my brother. \nHe is almost 30 and still living here, can't keep a job and is very rude and mean to my mom. He doesn't clean up after himself. My mom has babied him for so long and it drives me up the wall. He only works Saturday and Sundays. So all the other days he spends on his computer, eating, or snoring loudly. \nThe reason I don't want him here to live with me once my mom moved out is if he will be responsible enough to give me rent money on time which is ridiculous because he's almost 30 and my mom still does his laundry?! Ugh fuck.\nOne thing I absolutely hate about him is he eats on the couch or in my mom's room (he doesn't have his own room) and leaves dishes there and wrappers and his disgusting socks every where. since he sleeps on the couch he always  leaves the blankets all sprawled out on the floor and couch. My mom has given up on telling him anything because he doesn't listen. I really don't want to deal with that because I am already stressed from other things. Im a full time uni student so I'm busy but I always make time to wash my own fucking dish and to clean up after myself. \nSo, Reddit... AITA??",

      "description": "This is really long so if you read, thank you. \n\nFirstly I love my cousin, her future husband and we have never had issues in our relationship. I am debating on not attending her wedding because of my sister. \n\nBackstory: Sister (S) has NPD and I have always been her scapegoat, it’s been an abusive relationship since we were kids. It got really bad when we approached our teens (3 yr age difference, I’m the oldest) my parents were in the middle of a messy divorce and we spent a lot of time with two of my aunts. My aunts very much nurtured these flaws S had and the three of them would pretty much gang up on me. It wasn’t as bad when we were with mom because she suffered with having to have 7 major back surgeries between my ages of 13-19 so that left me to take care of pretty much everything from school things to making sure bills had been paid. After I moved out I didn’t have a lot of interaction with S but she never stopped always trying to get me in trouble or taking any and all attention from me. I was in labor with my first child and she lost her shit on my mom because she had strep throat and mom ended up leaving me while in active labor to go pacify S.\n\nNow I’m in my mid 30’s and mom is living with me, my boyfriend and our three kids because she is 100% disabled. We all have moved to a different state in order to keep our distance with S, even though mom loves her she can only handle her in small doses. In Nov. of last year S found out that I decided to homeschool two of my kids (the youngest needs extra help so he goes to a special private school) S doesn’t think I’m “qualified” to homeschool even though I work with an umbrella school, subscribe to online schooling for the kids and I do everything I’m supposed to do. S reports me for neglect because I’m not qualified. It caused a huge disruption in our lives and scared my daughter. This was the last straw and I cut her out of my life completely. In what I believe to be S’s retaliation for cutting her out she cried to all of mom’s side of the family, whom she has never been close to and voiced her dislike for them, to make me look like the bad guy. None of mom’s family believes that she can be as manipulative and evil as she really. This has been very hard on me and honestly makes me feel a little crazy because I’m questioning whether or not I really am the bad guy. \n\nCurrent situation: cousin’s wedding is coming up and while S wouldn’t have attended before I cut her out, she is now going and I really don’t know if I can handle seeing/spending all that time with her in the same room. There is so much hurt that I have pent up that has been done because of S, I’m not sure I can cope. I am in the process of starting therapy to get past this and I should probably add that I have been diagnosed with severe generalized anxiety so that doesn’t help at all.

      "description": "So a little background info, I’ve had a roommate in the past that had a drug addict boyfriend who she secretly moved into our place. They sat in her room and wouldn’t come out for days doing who knows what. They would always come out just to fight in the middle of the night, I’d wake up in a panic. This stressed me out so much. Never again. \n\nNow, my current roommate who I’ve lived with 2 years now is wanting to do the same. She’s been dating this guy for maybe 4-5 months but he lives in a different city. He sometimes comes for a couple days, but ultimately he is planning on moving to Chicago for her. \n\nHe failed a background check, so he didn’t get the job he wanted, but still plans on coming here in December. Red flag? Idk. Anyways, I had a talk with my roommate about a couple weeks ago about him contributing and she totally understood that. YESTERDAY, she was in a bad mood and brought it up to me how it’s not fair to do this to him cause he barely has money. She brought up my ex, which I think was completely unfair + he would only stay over like once a week... I also don’t think she can compare a SO staying over to a SO MOVING into our place. I don’t care if “I’ll barely even know he’s there”, I am losing my privacy. He’s gonna use our electricity, our water, gas, etc, I think he should pay. I didn’t have to say yes to letting him stay, I’m doing her a favor in the first place by doing so. ",

      "description": "Okay, long story folks. They'll be a tl:dr at the end. Sorry for formatting, on mobile. \n\n\n   So here's some backstory, I (16m) come from a lower-middle class family in a suburban neighbourhood, but I am not exactly privileged when it comes to my family situation. I was a mistake child, as well as my brother (18m), and we were born into a family with a submissive pushover mother(50f) (she most likely has Stockholm Syndrome)  and an physically and mentally abusive father(55m).\n\n\n   I won't go into all the details about what me, my brother, and my mother have gone through, but here is the jist: Choking, beating, spanking (with fists), kicking, slamming against walls, getting punished to get at my mom, slamming glass, purposely keeping us up at night with loud music, burning our favourite toys, chasing me around with a needle... You get it, I don't have a very good father.\n\n    Furthermore, my mother earns more than my dad as a manager, yet does all the work around the house (laundry, cooking, cleaning, filling up gas in the cars, literally every chore). Yet, my dad works in labour, does jackshit around the house, and claims that he is the only one holding the family together.\n\n   So flashback almost exactly a year from now. I woke up at around 6am on the living room couch to my father yelling at my mother, and this was normal. So I got up, and I stood at the kitchen door kinda just watching them argue and yell at each other. Well, my mom starts walking down the hallway to their bedroom to pack her stuff and leave for her parents house. This is when my dad came up behind her and started trying to strangle her on their bed. She was on her back, and he was on top with his hands around her neck.\n\n   At that moment, after years of submission and built up anger against my \"father\" I broke, and went into a fullsprint jumping on to his back and began pounding his head in with my fist. I got a good 20 full force hits, and if it wasn't for my mom ripping me off of him I would've gouged his eyes out. After that, he realised \"oh shit I really fucked up\" and began saying how much he loves all of us and how he couldn't believe I'd do that to him, y'know, the standard narcissistic thing. Me, my mother, and my father were pretty much arguing about how awful of a person he is. I reminded him of all the awful things he has done and he would deny literally every. Single. Instance.\n\n   After a few days of tension, nothing really happened, but I decided to go into no-contract with him and no longer address him as my father, but by his name. He knew how I felt about him, I called him all the names he called us when we were kids right to his face (garbage waste of space, cunt, etc.) And going back to the beating, I rushed him so hard that when I kneed him in his back I broke a rib, and he was too embarrassed to go to the hospital. I hurt him so badly I caused him to lose his job and basically become disabled as he spends literally every waking hour in his bed playing World Of Warcraft in his bedroom. So that went quite well for a few months, until he, and my mother, began demanded that I give him respect.\n\n   They have (and still do) have this rule where I have to say goodnight and goodmorning everytime I wake up/go to bed. I didn't want to, or needed to talk to my father for obvious reasons. This pissed him off, because requoting him through my mother it \"made him feel like he was a piece of shit in the corner\" Which is funny, because that's exactly what he is. They threatened to punish me, and tried to force me to apologize to him. Fuck. That.\n\n   So after a few months of tension, my father gets pissed off at me for a irrelevant reason and we get into an argument. He bagan threatening me with violence, calling me a libtard, and said he was proud of choking my mother to the point of blacking out. I actually threatened him back, and he backed off. He realised he can't take on his 6'4 slightly muscular teenage son when he is at grandpa age and has troubles getting up to use the washroom. After he ranted for a bit more about the gays, libtards, and women that was the end of that ordeal. And since then I've continued to do the same, no contact. My only form of communication has been through him bitching about me to my mother.\n\n   Fast forward to today, and he is getting moody again. He wants me to say goodmorning/goodnight everyday. And I refuse. Here is the thing, my mother and my brother on his side. They say that he has \"changed\" in this past year, even after the decades of abuse. They say that I need to learn to forgive, and not be \"stuck up\" to my dad. I on the other hand want to go down with dignity when I get kicked out the day I turn 18, I want to make him feel like what he is. A piece of shit in the corner.\n\n\nTl:Dr - abused physically and mentally by father, father strangles mother, and I beat the shit out of my dad causing him to lose his job. I go into no contact with him, refuse to call him my father, and refuse to give him any respect. My family is against me saying I'm taking it too far.\n\nI'll provide more information if you really think you need it to decide if I'm in the right or wrong here. So,\n\nAm I the asshole? ",

      "description": "TL;DR—My adoptive sister and I are getting married, my parents aren't invited.\n\n\nI told a friend about my concerns earlier, and when he showed me this subreddit, he recommended I make an account and get some other opinions on the situation. He supports us 100% of the way, which I'm grateful for, but anyway, into the situation.\n\n\nI met my best friend and future fiancé in the 5th grade at age 11. We got along great, but neither if us really knew a thing about sexuality at the time, so we were just really good friends.\n\n\nFast forward 3 years, and her parents die in a really bad car crash. Both parents are only children, and there's no family for her to go to anymore. After a lot of consideration, my parents stepped up and offered to adopt her to keep yet out of the foster system. Yay, we're going to be sisters!\n\n\nWe both came out, and eventually, we finally started officially dating at 17. This was weird to my parents for obvious reasons. They never outright said anything about it, but it was pretty obvious they weren't too happy about it. I don't think it has anything to do with us being gay, just that they see us as sisters more than we do.\n\n\nAnyway, here at 22, she proposed to me, but after a little bit of research, we found that a legal marriage would be illegal. We've decided on a more symbolic wedding, just the ceremony with the food and the dresses and the whole 9. We invited close friends and some members of my family who are a bit more open about the whole situation. We did not invite my parents.\n\n\nTurns out, we were right—they did cause a scene. An aunt brought it up to them, and they were shocked they were just finding out. They did not handle the news well. Rather than politely ask for an invitation, they spent the better part of an entire evening trying to convince us to break up. So they're still not invited, and I don't really know how to reconcile this.\n\n\nAm I the asshole here? I don't want to leave my parents behind, but at the same time, I really am madly in love. A little help from the internet?",

      "description": "Hello,\n\nBackstory: I just moved to my fiancée's home country after having a long distance relationship with her for sometime. She's now 11 weeks pregnant and she's experiencing severe hyperemesis (incredibly bad morning sickness - more like all day sickness).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bought her a pregnancy pillow (one which can wrap around her entire body) recently, and she's been using it in bed. It's a queen sized bed, but with the pillow too, there's not a lot of room for me now, so I'm sleeping as far up against the wall on my side of the bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday she's told me that she didn't sleep well last night because she's having to get up around 4 times a night to pee (as a result of the fluids she's being administered to help with dehydration). She told me that once she did get back into bed, I was breathing in her general direction, and it wasn't very pleasant - which is fair enough, but I'm having trouble sleeping facing the wall, my arm now has a bad ache every time I am positioned that way. She also cannot face the other way as a result of having the line for her fluids in her arm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I wanted to figure out how we are going to solve this - as the big thing here is that we need to re-arrange her room as a few pieces of furniture need to move around to make sure we both have access to a side of the bed, and also for room in the future for a crib. In lieu of that not happening instantaneously (need help from her brothers to shift the furniture), I suggested that I sleep in the front room until it comes time to rearrange the bedroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe took this to mean that I didn't want to sleep next to her in bed anymore, which is entirely untrue - and I even made that clear, but she then says that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill out of the whole situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I can take away from this is that we are both uncomfortable, so I am willing to bite the bullet and go and sleep elsewhere so that she can be comfortable in bed.",

She doesn’t see him very often as he is working and going to school full time, as is she, and neither of them has a car. He also lives about half an hour + traffic away. Again, both of them are very happy with the relationship, even though I personally haven’t seen them interact with each other in over a year, and I’ve never really met him. \n\nMy other friend (F2) is also 16, and he thinks F1 is being abused. Why, you ask? Because apparently he is “controlling and doesn’t let her do anything she wants to.” I personally think this is bs. He thinks this because F1 skipped out on study hall in order to fuck around last year even though she had homework, and BF wasn’t a huge fan of this. She’s done other things like this previously, but I guess he got upset about it this time. They sat down and talked about it, and it worked out. F2 thinks BF overreacted and is abusive and controlling because of it. \n\nWhen F2 asked me about it, I said “I haven’t seen them interact, but it just seems like BF wants F1 to do better in school. It seems like he just wants her to succeed, and when she skips out on study hall, doesn’t do her homework, and fucks around, BF thinks she can do better.” I told F2 that I think he’s reading into this WAY too much, that he’s paranoid and cynical. He told me I’m an asshole and that I don’t care about our friend. I really don’t think this is a bad relationship, as F1 says that she’s super happy and there hasn’t been another situation like this that’s been brought to my attention. \n\nSo, AITA for not thinking my friend is being abused?",

      "description": "Preface: I love my boyfriend dearly and this is something we have talked about already.\n\nSo, my boyfriend is already showing signs of losing his hair. Tons of it when he wakes up on his pillow, in the bed, on clothes. We’ve joked about him losing his hair and even tried to see what he would look like bald. Honestly, it wasn’t good.\n\nI know it sounds superficial, but I just don’t think I would be sexually attracted to him if he is bald. Our sex life is already a point of contention between him and I- he’s not interested in it as much as I am, and we’ve already spoken about how I felt. I’m just worried I’ll grow to resent him because I won’t be attracted enough to him to go through with sex whenever he decides he wants it. \n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend is losing his hair and I feel like I won’t be sexually attracted to him if he is bald. WIBTA if I broke up with him?",

      "description": "I originally posted this on the relationships subreddit a while ago, but lately I've been thinking about this whole situation and I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong here to be essentially holding a grudge against my parents for the things they've done in the past (as well as fairly recently). I want to know if I'm being the asshole here for giving up my relationship with my parents and having stopped trying to fix things. Or maybe everyone's the asshole here, or maybe it's just my parents. Anyway, you be the judge, here it is. \n\nThrowaway because it's possible this will contain enough info to potentially identify me to friends/family. \n\nThis post is going to get VERY LONG, but I will try to be as concise as possible. There's so much involved here I'm really not sure where to even start. Maybe the best way is to provide some personal anecdotes with my parents, leading up to why I tried to cut ties with my dad, leading to why I now don't talk to both my parents. Yes, there is a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nGrowing up my dad would constantly tell me stories between him and my mom's parents that made him seem like the victim and made my grandparents seem like the bad guys. The greatest extent my mom would go to stop him from doing this was to just say \"Stop it, it's not nice\", but he would continue and she would enable it. As a result, in my younger and teenage years, I kind of feared and didn't 100% like my grandparents, because I've been given the impression that they secretly hate my dad for no good reason at all. On top of this, every time we were going to go to my mom's family's place for different holidays, my dad would make a huge fuss about going over, calling them names, complaining about the time we're supposed to make it there, purposely going slow to make us late, etc., resulting in either my mom or me (or both) being really mad at him for the entire visit there. Looking back it must have been very obvious to everyone there that we were always in a bad mood when we went to visit, while my dad pretended to like them all while there. \n\nLet's back up a little bit to middle school. My English teacher had us read the newspaper once a week and present or write reports on different articles. One of these days, the teacher asks to see me after class. He shows me an article on the front page of our local newspaper (which I just realized wasn't included during the activity in class) that says someone with the same name as my dad has been arrested for money laundering. At the time I had zero idea what was going on, and when he asked me if I was ok or knew about it I just said I was fine and didn't know anything about it. That day, my mom picks me up from school, and I ask him about what was in the paper. I don't remember as many details from this point, but basically my dad got so pissed off he and/or my mom called the school, saying it was none of their business and the teacher shouldn't be showing me things like that. \n\nFast forward 2 years, right before high school is about to start, my mom ends up driving me to the courthouse because my dad just got sentenced to like a year or something in jail. At this point neither parent has yet to fill me in completely yet, and the only part they tell me is that somehow their counter case for \"age discrimination\" got dismissed and that my dad's ex-job was a bunch of assholes. What follows is several months of visiting him in jail until he gets parole. During this time, he makes all kinds of promises such as getting along with my mom's family and not making going to see family such a catastrophic hassle every time. In addition, he starts guilting me to not hold what he did (the stealing money) against him. For a while I didn't, because I thought he realized what he did was wrong and that this was an isolated incident. \n\nFast forward to me turning 18. Now, growing up until around 16 I would usually give birthday+holiday money to my parents to put into my savings account. I remember being like 9 or something and getting this little handheld balance tracker (bankbook?) and for a while I would keep track of the money I saved. I probably stopped tracking it after a while, and in my teens I kinda just figured my parents were handling it for me. So, having turned 18, I asked my parents about the savings account. They both denied its existence, saying that whatever money I was talking about I must have already spent myself. I didn't buy this, because I specifically remember at one point this account being at least $5000 several years ago, and I never touched it myself. So, one of the (rare) times I was visiting my grandparents, I decided to ask them if they remember this account's existence. They did. I told them my parents were denying remembering me having anything like that, so the following weekend they come visit me and my parents and confront them about it. My mom confesses that they took the money to help them pay off their bills. Then my dad says \"It wasn't even that much anyway, just a couple thousand dollars.\" This is around when I generally stopped trusting them.\n\nLet's get caught up to what's happening most recently. About a year ago at Christmas, my dad was proudly telling me and my mom how he decided to call my grandma (who was 91 years old and fairly recently widowed by my grandpa) and \"tell her off\" for all the ways she's mistreated him over the years. This made me super angry. Then when we went to visit my mom's family for Christmas, he told me to watch him as he went over to apologize to my grandma. As soon as he finished talking to her, he turns around and sticks his tongue out at me like a 5 year old in full view of pretty much everyone else there. The entire rest of my visit there I'm livid with him, and on the way to the airport when my parents are dropping me off, I finally snapped. I told him off how he's spent my whole life trying to make me hate half my family, and how I've absolutely had it with him. As this is going on, whenever I brought up a specific time he's been a shitty dad that I knew my mom was aware of, my mom took his side and would deny it was true. I told my mom she enables his shitty behavior. For several months, I didn't talk to either of them, but then my grandmother ended up passing away so I had to fly back for her funeral. Instead of saying anything remotely apologetic or kind, my dad starts again with me by saying that he's never done or said anything for me to dislike my mom's family and that if I feel alienated from them or feel like I barely know them or missed out getting to actually know them while growing up, it's my own fault. I call bullshit and repeat everything I'd said before, and my mom continues to stay silent or take his side. Meanwhile during this timeline, I was sending countless emails to my mom explaining why I'm so disgusted with my dad and specifically why I want to cut ties with him, yet she never replied or acknowledged any of it. Fast forward to a couple months ago, at this point I was back to talking with my mom, but not my dad. It was my dad's birthday and my mom texted me over and over all day begging to call him for his birthday. I repeatedly tell her no. Finally at like 10pm he ends up calling me, asking me the real reason I don't like him, as if I haven't wasted millions of breaths or thousands of words repeating it over and over to him. Rinse, repeat, except this time my mom 100% takes his side rather than mostly staying silent. At this point I'm pretty much not talking to either one of them. \n\nI should wrap up all the remaining background info before this turns into a life story, so I'll just list off the rest here. I recall at one point my dad saying he wasn't sorry at all for stealing money from that job because \"he deserved it.\" Following his parole, he never did stop causing arguments over visiting mom's family for different occasions, claiming that his side of the family 2000 miles away was my \"real\" family. Growing up I watched both my parents gamble away thousands of dollars plus multiple vacations to Las Vegas with their 8 year old kid (me) in the hotel room left to play video games. The house I grew up in was owned by my grandparents (mom's side), not my parents, and this whole time they never had to pay any kind of rent towards the mortgage. Until I was 12 they both had full-time jobs with very minimal bills to pay. Yet, they didn't have money to pay for my college, and my grandparents ended up helping me pay for it. When it came time to decide where to go to college, my dad told me I \"better\" pick the one closer to them (spoiler alert, I chose the farthest). Once I graduated, my grandparents told my parents to make the payments for the student loans I had to take. Ever since I stopped talking to my dad a year ago, my parents stopped sending me the money to pay the student loan payments, and now I've been doing it myself. Consistently in public and with mom's family, he would essentially act like a toddler in different ways such as loudly mocking other people, making poorly timed inappropriate jokes, or otherwise talking trash about others (mostly my family) behind their backs then pretending to like them in person. He lacks very basic pragmatics. He would also do what I call \"selective listening\", where most of the time he pretends not to hear what people are saying, until as soon as he thinks he's being talked about he suddenly has perfect hearing. This in particular has led to me and my mom constantly having to repeat things for him even though I'm pretty sure most of the time he truly heard us, or was making us repeat things to be funny. And if it hasn't become clear yet at this point, all these years my mom let him behave like this and enabled his embarassingly childish and egotistical behavior. As far as all the stories he told me about my mom's family ove",

      "description": "So here's  what happened :\n\nI ordered a burger from a local burger place via an app (lets call it company A). The order arrives ,I pay the delivery guy without checking at the moment and he leaves. When i do check my order it has a packaging seal of another company B (one of the main competitors of company A). So I grew a little suspicious and opened it to find the burger and it looked a bit different . It came in a different package, it had a different seal so i had a personal bias thinking they mixed up my order . I'm usually the kind of guy that lets things like this slide but i felt like I was duped .\n\nSo I get on the company A's app (which had customer service) and told them about my experience and sent a picture of company B's seal on my package. They apologized and offered a replacement without charging me and so I accepted their offer.\n\nSo the replacement arrives and I check it out on the spot to find out if the packaging was different but surprisingly it still had company B's seal on it. I asked the delivery guy (different guy) if it was normal to have company B's seal  on it and he said that they do locally use company B's seals. Now I was having a TIFU moment and opened the package to find an almost identical burger.\n\nI ate the burger but wasn't able to enjoy it. It tasted great but I felt bad for troubling a lot of people just because my burger looked a little different. I still have the original burger with me so i feel like I duped the restaurant because I got two burgers for the price of one. Feels like I'm gonna have to eat there for the rest of the year to make up because  I won't be comfortable bringing this up with the restaurant. So am I the asshole for requesting the replacement and what do you think the best course of action would have been?\n\n **TL;DR** : Asked for replacement without checking properly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "**TL;DR My mother died this week, my girlfriend started a fight days later over my inability to talk about it, then she ignored my messages for about 40 hours, and is now thinking of cancelling plans to come visit me and my family. I'm a bit stunned because this feels super insensitive considering the stress I'm already under, and is very unlike her. I know that I often don't help alleviate conflict, but in this case, I really don't think I'm in the wrong, so please correct me if I am.**\n\n\\----\n\nMy GF is British. I live in the UK with her, but I'm in Canada now where my family is from. I should mention that we BOTH have problems letting fights sometimes last longer than they should and allowing things to escalate.\n\nMy mom was battling cancer for years and in recent months she took a sharp decline. I quickly came back to Canada to spend her last month with her. During that time, my girlfriend (who is genuinely the most loving and caring person I know) would ask me every day how she was. After a while, this became very difficult to know how to answer, as my mom was barely conscious and the only answer I could give was \"she's dying.\" I told my GF to stop asking me because it was difficult for me to answer, and I told her I would let her know if anything major happened. I appreciated her thinking of me, and I'll admit, I was a little blunt in how I said it (I was under stress but it's not an excuse, I know) and she understandably didn't take it well. We got past that though and everything was fine for the next few weeks.\n\nMy mother finally passed away last week, her funeral was a few days ago. I called my girlfriend for the first time in a while; we chatted, and eventually she asked me how my family was doing. Again, this was difficult for me to answer, because we're not fine and I just wanted to talk about other things. I gave her a very basic answer and probably sounded like I didn't want to be talking about it. She took this as me telling her off again, which I absolutely was not doing. I immediately clarified and said it was just difficult to answer, but as I previously mentioned, we have trouble letting things go, so she kept going. She insisted I was making her feel stupid. I asked her to please listen to me, told her it was just difficult to answer, and to just drop it and let's move on (considering the circumstances I really didn't want to fight), but she kept going. It then obviously escalated into a full fight. It ended when we had to go to sleep.\n\nThe next day she messaged me like nothing had happened, but I felt like she had  crossed a line, starting a pointless fight days after my mother's funeral, when I had begged her to just let it go. So I explained this to her; how it made me feel and asked if she could acknowledge that. The conversation kept going all day, heated at times, but she eventually apologized, and it ended with her telling me she would \"leave me alone.\" I didn't ask her to leave me alone, but she then proceeded to ignore my messages for 40 hours (I was no longer trying to discuss the situation, just trying to talk about her day and other regular stuff because she had already apologized, so to me it was over). But ignoring me made me feel awful again, especially considering what I'm already going through. When she finally did respond, she told me she was worried about our relationship and that she might cancel her plans to come out to Canada (I've paid for the flights already).\n\nI still want her to come, and I don't want our relationship to end over this. But I feel like I have to stick to my values here. To me, she's being unnecessarily heated and petty on an awful week for me. If she decides not to come, I feel like that might be the end of our relationship. I do try very hard to be self-critical, so if you all think I'm in the wrong here, need to just let this go or even apologize to her to prevent things from getting worse, then please tell me. Or else am I justified in feeling this way?",

I always answer yes, because I don’t really want anyone talking about it. Yesterday though was the final straw. \n\nShe came up to me at lunch when I was with my normal group of friends (also there’s a bit of bad blood between her group of friends and my group of friends. Me and her were still quite close though). She asked if I had eaten, which I actually had (just a sandwich and a drink). I said yes. \n\nAt this point it was a little annoying, and after school I texted her to stop. She said she would, but I’m worried I came off as mean and now I’m worried I could have possibly ruined a friendship.\n\nI didn’t want to stop being friends, I just wanted her to stop asking about what I eat as it makes me uncomfortable.",

      "description": "I am going to try and keep this short as possible. I'm a long haired male and have been for many years. When I first started growing out my hair, I found that not using any products in my hair kept it looking good and healthy. I take showers as normal, but simply massage my scalp without using any form of shampoos/etc. So, before you may think this is gross, it really is not. I have not had any issues in the real world. My hair looks healthy and grows very full. You would not recognize it as being un-shampooed hair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, my mother knows that I don't shampoo my hair. When I first started it, she would throw fits until I would shampoo my hair. If I refused, she would go on and on for hours about how bad it is, etc. It was an absolute nightmare. She is a very toxic person in the first place, but this is one of her many triggers. So, over the years after much defense on my end, she has become less explosive about the subject. However, she still manages to be annoying anytime we are together in person. If I'm going to take a shower, she will continually ask why I don't use shampoo. She will put shampoo in there and keep telling me to use it. You get the point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, we were talking on the phone. I live in a different state. So, this is how we communicate. She is very toxic, but I still care about her and try to keep in touch. We were talking about all sorts of things. When she brings up how I need to start washing my hair. I kind of exploded and said, \"if you ever say this to me again, I'm not coming home anymore.\" I told her how annoying it was and that she's probably said it about 1 million times. Obviously, her opinion is fine, but I already know her opinion. She is not going to change my mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, AITA?",

      "description": "This happened to me over the summer and I just found this sub so I created an account to ask. It’s kinda long and Tl;Dr at bottom. \n\nSo I’ve worked as a lifeguard and a swim lessons instructor over the summer at a Country Club for the past 4  years. It’s a good starter place to work, minus the crazy owner, but I stay because I genuinely enjoy my lifeguard staff (30+ people we watch a man made lake). The head of maintenance I’ll call him “Jenkins” has harassed the lifeguards since I’ve started working. He’s a middle aged man and has no authority over us but likes to boss the guards around. Everyone knows this including the aquatics manager (my boss not the owner) knows and deals with this. He would even put random pieces of trash on the lifeguard stands just to show his distaste. \n\nNow my first 3 years I just shrugged it off. I prided myself on being a good lifeguard who was always attentive and a great swim lesson instructor. I didn’t really care what he thought. After coming back from my first year of college I got promoted to the lead life guard of the lake and tried to make an effort to appease Jenkins. I did every arbitrary task he asked and stuff that wasn’t my job to try to get on his good side. If I saw him sitting down I’d ask him if I or anyone could do anything for him. \n\nSo here comes the asshole part. We throw a party on the lake for all the members and it’s a stressful day for everyone. My younger brother (also a lifeguard) and another lifeguard/good friend set up everything we need to do for the lake before the party and take a  break before the aquatics manager gets here. We sat down for literally 30 seconds and Jenkins starts yelling at us. He yells at us telling us to do more arbitrary things and how we suck as lifeguards. The conversation goes like this after my brother and friend walk to do what he asked.\n\nMe “Hey next time talk to me or another lead guard when you want us to do something do not try to scare the other lifeguards into doing it”\nJenkins “I don’t know who they are”\nMe “okay they are me and (two other lead guards)”\nJenkins “How about if you actually do something instead of sitting around on your asses all day.”\nMe getting irritated “we did everything that was asked of us and were waiting for our boss to come back you saw us working across the lake.”\nJenkins “you guys shouldn’t just be sitting around doing nothing while we work way harder than you.”\nMe visibly pissed off “how about you stop yelling at me and do your job it’s not my fault you have had nothing better to do than yell at us for the past four years.”\nJenkins “you need to not treat this like a summer kiddie job where you get paid to do nothing and more like a career. I’ve seen you on your phone on the stand (lie) and putting people at risk.”\nMe (asshole part)- “that’s the problem Jenkins this is a job for me not my career. I go to college. Im getting my degree. I’m sorry that’s obviously not the case for you and now you got stuck here the rest of your life. I’m gonna do a lot more with my life than you  ever will  and when you see me lifeguarding today I hope you remember that.”\n\nHe storms off and files a complaint but nothing happens after that.\n\nSo AITA for blowing up in his face? I’ve always been calm and rational at work so it came to a surprise to everyone. I know I don’t know how he turned up there and I felt kinda guilty at the time. On the other hand he really shouldn’t be taking his problems out on us.\n\nTL;DR- I’ve worked as a lifeguard for 4 years with a bully head of maintenance. The last day I snap when he yells at us for nothing and sarcastically apologize for his life sucking and how mine is going to be so great.\n\n",

      "description": "I've been seeing a guy for a few weeks now, we've been on a few dates but haven't done anything sexual except from making out. I always like to take things slow because in the gay community there are a lot of purely sexual relationships, but I personally prefer monogamy and want to know someone is interested in me and not just my genitals.\n\nAfter a few weeks, this guy and I got on really well together and we were clearly both attracted to each other, I felt comfortable enough with him that I thought we could take our relationship to \"the next level\" (which he wanted to do on our first date so I knew he would also want to… this is sort of relevant later on!). We were texting and I pretty much said that I was fine with moving the relationship forward and he then told me that he is HIV-positive, but is on medication which means it can't be passed onto sexual partners.\n\nI know this is bad to say but all my sexual attraction to him disappeared in that very moment. I know that if I had sex with him, I would be worrying the whole time about HIV transmission. I also know it's illogical because it's not transmissable but I just wouldn't feel safe. I'm very very very careful with sexual activity because I know HIV is a bigger problem in the gay community than for straight people and it's something I really don't want in my life, even though I know people can live completely fulfilling lives and normal lifespans with it.\n\nI didn't have the courage to tell him that I didn't want to have sex with him because of his HIV status so I sort of wrapped up the conversation and then deliberately brought up politics (which I know is a big issue for a lot of people) a few days later and pretended to end things with him over that saying that \"we just didn't see eye to eye\". In reality I couldn't care less about his political beliefs, I just can't see myself being intimate with someone who has HIV.\n\nI told my sister about this and she said I was being judgemental and ruining what could be a great relationship. It's sad but I see her points in some ways. This guy was really respectful of my wishes to not have sex which can sometimes be rare to find in the gay community, he's really attractive and intelligent and very caring + kind. But I just can't seem to get past his HIV, and I wish I could but I can't. Also, on our first date he wanted to hook up and I'm 99% sure he wasn't even going to tell me he was HIV positive which makes me question if he's the person I thought he was.\n\nI know no one is obligated to have sex with anyone else, consent is important and I think rejection for any reason is fine, but I can't help feel like I have a stigma in my mind and I feel really guilty about even thinking like this… am I the asshole?",

She cooks very repetitively so I know every single dish that she'll make and I've tried them all without salt but I know that salt would make the dish taste 1000x better. It's gotten to the point where sometimes I can't even finish my plate because of the blandness of the taste (usually pasta and rice and stuff). I've tried talking her through this but she keeps saying that it's rude and ungrateful for me to keep salting her food. While I understand that it's food I'm getting for free and that I should get what I can take, I don't see what the harm in adding something extra to make it taste better is (it usually leads to me having even more food if I salt it).

Again English is not my first language so sorry for the mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory: I have a sister who is only 14 years old and is dating. But she brought another boy in our house and claims they are just “friends” even though they were holding hands and acting like a total couple and OH I also found out she is sending him pictures :))!! Also the other reason why I am upset is that the boy she brought calls her a whore and I can see why since my sister IS dating but yet she is doing stuff with him. After the boy left I told my sister to either stop the bullshit since I don’t want people calling her easy because she will flirt with any guy even though she has a boyfriend but my sister just called me a weirdo and too get on her level and other stupid stuff. Anyway, I know it wasn’t my business but I told my sister’s boyfriend to please dump her since she is cheating on him but you know he didn’t listen to me and told my sister and my sister came to me and started hitting me and telling me that cheating is nothing and that I am just jealous that she can flirt with any guy and the other humiliating stuff is my mom supports her and blames me that I made her a whore like wtf?  I know that’s not true so I didn’t take it by heart but it hurts me that my mom blames me and is threating to kick me out if more people find out that my sister is cheating on her boyfriend. ",

Last week he did somes angle shooting that I'm not even sure he did it on purpose but I was pretty annoyed and called him out.

Most of the teachers don't really care all that much, but a few seem to be semi annoyed by it. Additionally, some of my classmates are bothered by the fact that I'm \"lazy and don't try\" but somehow still have good grades.

We had both periods to study and we were getting along fine until my friend who I will call \"M\" asked a question to the group. M and I have a shaky friendship but we've always gotten along fairly well. As M asked the question I went to answer, I hadn't answered any questions previously but as I started to speak M told me to shut up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis went on for a while with her telling me to shut up every time I tried to answer a question until after about 5minutes, I tried to answer another question, this time instead of being told to shut up she slapped me on the leg. This surprised me but I didn't think much of it. As the studying went on she continued to slap me every time I attempted to answer a question, slapping me harder each time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I while I got pissed and told her she was being \"a little bitch and she should be physically abusing me for trying to get good marks in a class.\" She lost it and starting attacking me over and over again by repeatedly slapping my arms which were raised over my head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sent her a text apologizing for insulting her later that day but she still hasn't answered my (this happened two days ago).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I called my friend a bitch for not letting me answer questions in our group study group and slapping me when I tried to answer them.",

      "description": "So ive been talking to a girl for about 2 months now and I really like her. She has a child already and I have yet to meet him because we are taking things slow. We arent \"officially\" together but we do everything a couple would normally do. Including sex on a regular basis. Now this is where I fucked up but I didnt wear a condom any time we had sex. She is on the pill and in my previous relationships ive never used a condom if the girl was on the pill and never had an issue. Now, she is very conservative and doesnt believe in terminating a pregnancy no matter what the situation is. I on the other hand believe that would be the best option considering im really not finacially or emotionally ready to raise a child. Especially with someone I feel like I just met. I told her this and she looked at me like I just stepped on a kitten. She's really not happy about it either and also thinks its a fucked up situation but she doesnt think she could live with herself if she got an abortion. I really dont know what to do and im scared out of my mind that I could potentially have a kid with someone I hardly got to know. Am I an asshole for wanting her to get an abortion? Im also curious as to if anyone else was in a similar situation and what there decision was.",

      "description": "So the title maybe doesn't put me in the best light, but hear me out. I had a crush on this girl, we flirted, she apparently told her friends about me, she told one of my friends she liked me, and then she basically got a bf, out of nowhere, after months of (apparent) relationship building, where she was very touchy and flirty. I took it in stride and basically abandoned her, I stopped speaking to her for months, I ignored her messages and pretended she had never existed or mattered to me when my friends brought her up.\n\nAnyway, a few months back we kind of reconciled I guess, and she's been more open with me. She's stayed at my place a few times, though I wasn't interested in touching her. She said I love you to me and I said it back. A few days after that I told her about a girl I've been crushing on, and a while later I told her the other girl sent me underwear pics. She seemed off, but I kept flirting with her, and spending time with her. \n\nBut, I've been getting incredibly bored of her, and I've frankly never trusted her or enjoyed her company that much ever since the initial rejection over a year ago. I started by ignoring her in public, in front of her friends, when she saw me at coffee shops and so on. I also posted a snap story, a private one with only me, her and a few others able to view, about this amazing girl I've met, and who I'm falling for (not true, no such girl exists), and she basically stopped speaking to me.  \n\nI know this probably makes me look bad, but can people understand where I'm coming from. Or am i an asshole, who wasted her time and hurt her out of spite? A friend told me something of that nature yesterday.",

      "description": "My parents are going through a pretty rough divorce right now.  It's been especially tough on my mom.  She's feeling betrayed and hurt and to top it all off, she's basically been functioning as a single mom as my dad currently resides in a different country.  Being the oldest sibling, I'm more than willing to take part of the load of parenting my two younger siblings, and she knows this, but she's been especially distant lately.  She started using Tinder to meet guys and she goes on frequent dates.  When she is home, she spends all of her time in her room.  She's been drinking alcohol and she started smoking again.  I'm worried about her constantly.  All of the problems that she's shouldering are crushing me.  I've tried confronting her about the smoking, but when I bring it up she denies ever smoking even though it's painfully obvious that she has been.  She leaves a pack of ciggarettes and two lighters in plain sight right next to the front door.  I guess the thing that's been bothering me the most is the whole dating thing.  It's like her whole world now just revolves around trying to find the next guy to marry.  I've tried to tell her to slow down, but she's in her 40s already and so she feels like she doesn't have time to.  When things are going great with a guy that's all that she wants to talk about.  I try to be there and listen to her, because she doesn't really have anyone to talk to about these things, but if I'm being honest it makes me a little uncomfortable.  She goes on dates with people I don't know to places an hour or so away.  There's literally no way for me to get into contact with her besides her cellphone and she doesn't answer most of the time.  The largest problem is that because she's so preoccupied reliving her teen years, my sisters and I have taken the backburner; it's not so much a problem for me because I'm 18 now, but my sisters are going through their teen and pre-teen years and I'm not sure I can provide everything they need emotionally.  I'm mourning the loss of a functional family and I'm not sure what to do at this point.  I don't know if I should confront her about how I'm feeling (if it'll even make a difference) or stay quiet because she's already going through so much and I don't want her to break under the pressure of it all.  \n\nAnyways, this is my first post on redit (I pretty much just made one for this).  Any feedback would help. ",

At first this girl was a little selfconcious because of me and maybe got jealous.\nBut they became more and more attached to each other, while I didnt really care and was on my way to break things off with him. But I started to hang out with the girl once in a while (also because she was super pushy towards our \"friendship\"). So we went out together and got super drunk and of course this had to happen: we made out, went to the guys house (he was playing RedDeadRedemption2 and probably felt like in a dream) and we had a threesome.\nIt was nice and fun. But yea.. Do you know the feeling when you had sex with someone you dont really care about and afterwards you're even more like \"meh\" than before? At least that was it for me.\nSome days later I told the guy I dont want to hang out anymore and he was pissed. Like.. ok? Sorry for not wanting to continue this thing? To be fair, I said that I'm not interested anymore and maybe it gets better if we dont see each other for some months. That got him pissed. But I honestly dont feel like this is a super bad thing to say?\nThe girl then regularly texted me if we wanted to hang out and I said no a couple of times. Then after a while she sent me this super pissed message saying she lost trust in me and is sad. Right now I'm working 50 hours a week and really couldn't be bothered with it. Normally I really dont want people to feel bad because of me and I would never ghost a friend. But for me she was a one night stand and I'm actually kind of annoyed.\nOf course it's not the best way to handle all of this but AITA?",

We had been friends for over a year and after a while we realized that we liked each other. There are a whole bunch of guys that she flirts with although in a rather playful manner but I feel like some of them aren't are actually interested. A few weeks after we started dating, this one guy (24)  (who was good friends with her at this point according to her, and also does not like me for some reason) started flirting with her in front of me. I don't want to get in the way of telling someone how to behave but she started flirting back. I didn't really feel good about this so I walked out of the room. This happened a whole bunch of times and it would bother me quite a bit. Whenever I confronted her about it she would just say that they were really close friends. ( I need to mention that she was interested in him a short while before we started dating and even turned me down because she was confused between us at one point). I don't know, and I guess it's absolutely her right to behave how she wants I guess but it upset me and when I talk to her she either says that's just how I am or that was in the past or I said sorry why do you bring it up again? Then she proceeds to get annoyed with me. \n\nAITA for getting upset in this situation?\n\nTldr: girlfriend flirts with lots of guys including one that she was interested in before we started dating.\n\nI might be overly sensitive and stupid here so genuinely don't know if I'm just being annoying and wrong.

It is a long distance relationship (Like more than 3000 Miles, NV to MD) and We've been going incredibly steady and we have very busy things that we tend to alot. Me being work and school since I'm close to graduating. \n\nFast forward to around this week, things were getting stressful and to a breaking point. Since family, work, and a whole lot of life thoughts get in the way. Now, we are both dealing with a bunch from both sides. I wanted to come visit A, and speak to her dad so he can get to know me. She said she won't let me talk to her dad because he doesn't want A distracted but she told him we're really close and are dating. He says in about 3 YEARS I'll be able to talk to him. This sounds insane to me just to say hi and to gain permission to date his daughter. \n\nThis is where the AITA part comes in.\n\nFast forward to today and I decided to break it up and say that I think we should be friends for the time being and that we have alot going for ourselves and plenty outside things are putting tons of pressure on us. Especially if A wants to be a nurse/doctor and I want to go into auto. At first she was in hysterics and cried which crushed me. So I thought (and it really hurt me to think it) if she cares like she says she does, then she should take a flight down here so we can see eachother and we can be together again. Note that I did alot for her, sending expensive gift packages and making sure I listen to and play everything with her. On her end, she probably thought she did the same. (Come to find out she's been having a depression for so long and has yet to tell me. She also openly said after I asked where our relationship is going and she said \"i don't know\" and \"nowhere\" Ouch.) So I told her if you care about me like you say you do and that you'd do anything for me, come down here and show how much you care and we can be back together.\n\n\nHer friends and such are saying what I did was a dick move but I felt like it was necessary for the circumstances. AITA?\n",

      "description": "Alright let's just jump right into it. \n\n\nSo, I have this freind who's a senior(I am a sophomore) and I met  him two months ago when we were both casted for the same play at our school. We had to spend a lot of time together after school because of rehearsals and things like that. He was pretty cool but he showed me weird videos that he thought were funny but I personally didn't \n\nEverything was fine. \n\nHe was like me and he loved to tell jokes! That's probably why we'd get along so well. But the difference between myself and him, I know my limits. I'd never ever tell a joke that could probably come off as an insult because I care about people's feelings too much. But him well.. \n\nHe would constantly make jokes about how he could bear to look at me because of how ugly I am or how I'm fat and things along those lines. Now, I get he doesn't mean them,  but hearing those kids of things constantly gets tiring and annoying and it doesn't help that I'm self conscious. \n\nSo I started scolding him and calling him an a-hole. He, of course didn't take the hint that I was annoyed and contiuned. He honestly wouldn't stop unless I scolded or just ignored him all together. Today he approached me and told me he doesn't mean any of it and he's sorry but funny enough, despite knowing I was self-conscious he kept doing it. \n\nSo my question is... If I stop talking to him altogether. Am I the asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA for Kicking an Old Lady off a Machine at the Gym?",
      "description": "I go to Planet Fitness a few times a week.\n\nThe gym has a 30-minute circuit area. You work out at a station for a minute, take a thirty-second break to wipe up the station you used and move to the next one, and then repeat. In front of this area is a light that alternates between green (work out) and red (clean and move). Next to it is a sign with rules on using the area, which including doing the stations in numerical order.\n\nAlmost nobody follows these rules, especially during the post-work rush. People like to hog the circuit’s machines since the gym is small and the unrestricted machines elsewhere in the facility are often occupied. When people are at a station I have next, I politely ask if I can have it and they get off with, at worst, a bit of a huff.\n\nNot today.\n\nAn old lady got on the leg press while I was two stations behind. When I caught up to her and it was my turn, I did my usual routine of gently asking if I could have the machine. She ignored me. I thought maybe she did not understand why I was asking, so I explained the rules. She ignored me again, so I explained again. This time, she told me, in a brusque tone and with a somewhat thick accent, that she was going to do one more set.\n\nIf she had *asked* if she could do another set (which most people who get to this point do), I would have been fine. However, her tone was exceptionally rude, so I said that I would get the staff. She continued ignoring me. I explained to a nearby worker that someone was not understanding how the area worked.\n\nBefore we could return, the lady jumped off the machine, rampaged over, and began swearing. The staff tried to explain the rules for the circuit, but she would not hear any of it. Some choice words included, verbatim, “I said I was gonna do one more fucking rep!”, “You’re not behaving like a fucking gentleman!”, and “Fuck you!”. Essentially, every sentence involved her dropping f-bombs like she was trying to carpet bomb a World War II city.\n\nI remained silent the entire time she was going off. The staff went to grab the manager and the old lady moved to a different machine. I resumed working out while listening to her yell things like “Fuck you!” and “Some people just like fucking drama!” while turning to look back at me with a glare.\n\nThe manager came over. “There are so many other fucking machines! Why doesn’t he fucking use those?” and “He was so fucking rude!” The manager calmly explained the rules. The stations are supposed to be done in order. You cannot stay at a machine for more than a minute. She seemed uninterested in hearing any of it, but at least she quieted down.\n\nI feel I may have been asshole-y for involving staff. I could have gone to a different station and just chalked up her rudeness to her lack of English proficiency or cultural differences but chose to act on my irritation. As a result, everyone’s day was shittier than if I had said nothing.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "AITA For just generally being quiet and not speaking to my family? Decided to post to reddit because I am at a loss as to how to continue.\n\nI will do my best to balance the argument so I don’t convince everyone I am some kind of saint like a lot of posts I see here. Basically like a lot of us on reddit I have always been socially anxious/easily embarrassed and subsequently have zero friends, girlfriend, and hobbies minus video games because I have to fit the stereotype just perfectly...My life consists of working 50hr weeks labouring on site then the rest at home. Hopefully you get the picture that my life is pretty shit/unfulfilling currently although I am going to uni soon to try and get a decent career and better my life.\n\nAnyways my problem is that my mum her partner, brother and sister are all unhappy with the amount of ‘chat’ they get from me. Starting with my brother the reason I don’t speak to him is essentially because he always hyped up helping me socialise but there was always an excuse when an opportunity arose to go out together eventually the truth came out that he was embarrassed to be around me asked why to no real response. I will just say I don’t consider myself attractive but I am not some Frankenstein monster either, have good hygiene, dress etc... so ya real confidence booster similar situation with sister.\n\nMy mums partner is very confrontational if anything is not to his liking. Calls me a cunt, weirdo, and is generally a very elitist and my opinion is superior to your opinion sort of person. Finally my mum who unfortunately has a severe disability similarly will complain about anything and everything I do but still expect me to do jobs around the house after a 10hr day I know it sounds really childish but I pay her a significant amount of rent and the lack of gratitude for the jobs I do complete really sours any goodwill I have towards her.\n\nThe asshole part comes in as I have just been threatened to be kicked out the house mainly my mums partner suggestion for simply not talking to any of them and making a ‘hostile’ environment. I am not violent or angry just simply ignore them most of the time. So am I the asshole?\n\nHopefully I have explained the situation good enough to get some other people’s perspectives feel better just for having a online word rant tbh. Thanks.",

      "description": "So a bit of backstory: my grandmother is 87, and losing her memory a bit. My mother is part of a sewing group that makes bereavement dresses for parents of infants who have passed away. They have too many dresses right now, and have a backlog waiting to be used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Nana and I had talked about me using part of the lace from her wedding dress to wear as a veil on my wedding day. This was important to me as I am hopeful, but not positive, that she will make it ten months until I get married. Her dress is handmade lace. We had even talked about me wearing it, but I'm a good four inches taller and not built like a ballerina, so it likely wouldn't fit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had told my mother about this, and also my fiance. Nana, when she found out about my mother's group, she donated her dress to be used for the cause. She says she told my mother to save part of it, my mother doesn't remember, and it's really possible that either of them could be mistaken. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. Would I be the asshole if I asked for part of the lace skirt back and offered a cash donation to cover other supplies for the organization? If they were short on dresses I would never consider this, but knowing they have a lot of extras I am rationalizing that I could help cover thread, needles, etc for the volunteers.",

I was devastated. I didnt eat for days .. didnt shower, laid in bed for days. I still am in a very dark place. It has not been easy. I'm the loneliest I've ever been\n\nSo I reached out to my friend for support. I would write paragraphs of what I was feeling and at one point she said he isnt a bad guy but he is young. Okay ..

THEN she would flip the conversation about how she thought her bf was going to propose soon and that's all she talked about while my heart was breaking over the break up. Shes been going out with the dude for 6 months and when I said it may be too early she got really defensive so I just dropped it and let her continue to talk about it  . This when on for a while. I would vent and she would respond with a face and flip to talk about her bf.\n\nShe suggested we take a trip in December.  I've started planning and found a cool cheap trip to Canada for us. Under $300 for a weekend. I was super hyped but she kept saying how she needed to get an ID to leave the country and was looking into it. She said she didnt have a passport but at one point said she needs to attend a wedding in Columbia and will need a passport. I told her to get a passport and she kept saying its expensive but I figured itll be cheaper then the ID?anyways this went on for about two weeks. I even took the day off ahead of time. She came up with another excuse about her family and then I got a text msg with her and a picture of the ring with her bf. Okay he proposed. I told her congrats but was still kinda upset she kept leading me on about the trip\n\nThen she outright told me she couldnt go on the trip because shes engaged now and needs to save money??? Mind you we are both working woman and the trip was under 300. I was really hurt because I was looking forward to this trip so bad and I felt like rather then tell me she didnt wanna go she kept giving me excuses and rather then support me thru the break up she just kept talking for hours about her possible engagement  \n\nShes invited to my friendsgiving today and kept asking about the time and date.  I told her to check fb and she said she didnt have the app so to just tell her( she posts on ig ALL) he time. I've been giving her short replies and tbh I really wanna cut her off. This whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. I wanna be happy for her engagement but I feel neglected and lied to\n\nAm I the ass hole?",

      "description": "I am clinically diagnosed with depression and I’ve struggled against severe episodes in the past few years.\n\nI am currently dating the nicest girl on the planet. Let’s call her A. A is a smart, attractive, and independent woman and I think that I do not deserve her. We met each other over a year ago and got attracted right away. \n\nI like her; the thing is, I am not ready to get into a relationship right now. I had just broken up with my fiancée of three years last 2017 and we did not have any closure. I’m broken. I cannot feel anything, much more love something or someone.\n\nA and I got closer in the last year; closest that I’ve let anyone been with me in an emotional and intellectual sense. She would cheer me up when I am not feeling well; call me out when I’m being an asshole; and, essentially, walked me through my worst days. She has been very patient with me and she showered me with so much love. She is perfect and I only want the best for her. Except that, I know I am not capable of being so. I am still finding myself and I am unsure of what I want yet. \n\nWe parted ways last month and it was the most painful goodbye I’ve had. I cried really hard. She now lives ten time zones away but we still keep in contact. The other day she asked me where things are going. She said she is at a crossroad and she is planning on building the next five years of her life and she would prefer if I am in it. However, she wants to know whether I want her in my life so she can decide whether to hold on or let go.\n\nThe question drove me insane. I like her so much. It’s just that I am not sure about ANYTHING right now. I am not sure about her but I don’t want her out of my life as well. I have never been a better person until she came. It’s just that, I know I am not ready for another long distance relationship. All I want right now is to determine what the next few years of my life would be and I don’t want to build my future around one person nor do I want other people to do the same for me. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling her that I cannot decide for now?

I have the second biggest room in the house (biggest is the master bedroom) and I’m an only child (in case you’re wondering).\n\nI bought all the furniture in my room except the mattress (I paid for my bed frame, desk, desk chair, bookcase, and a small loveseat couch, TV stand and TV). This money came from my own work (mowing lawns/odd jobs until I was old enough to work as a waiter).\n\nLast week, my parents told me that my cousin was moving in with us because she needed a place to stay while she does her grad program. She’ll be paying rent (for reference, I don’t pay rent.) Because she’s paying rent, my parents want to give her my room and have me move into the guest room. The problem is that the guest room is very small and it can’t fit all the furniture I own. I expressed this to my parents and they said “why do you need to move your stuff? Just leave it in the room for your cousin.” I got pissed because I bought all my stuff with my own money but they just expected me to leave it and let her use it.\n\nI told them it was unfair but they told me that I don’t pay rent and have been living there for free so I don’t have a say in the matter. I can’t really afford to pay rent (my cousin is gonna be paying $900/month and I can’t afford that at all). I still think it’s unfair and haven’t talked to them in a few days. AITA?",

      "description": "She \\[20F\\] and I \\[20M\\] have been dating for a semester an half. We just yolo'd the relationship but I'm her first relationship ever, so I am afraid to break up with her. We are close friends with many people and breaking up with her could potentially cause a lot of awkwardness within our group. \n\n  \nGetting into my reasons for wanting to break up with her: She is very social with every guy she meets. And I don't mean being very conversationalist-ic. She doesn't notice often but she flirts with nearly every guy she meets. She goes partying often and gets drunk with her friends, usually to the point where she doesn't know what is going on or is only vaguely in control. Last time this happened, apparently a few guys tried to hit on her and her friends pulled her away after a few min and tried to tell her she already has a guy (me), but she \"didn't know\" they were flirting with her. She even sc's a lot of the guys she meets and \"talks\" with them a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I get she might want to look around at other people because I am not the best looking (I am guessing, most people say I look decent). But it seriously bothers me and I have spoken with her about this because she used to bring up a guy living near us a lot, joking she wanted to date him if she ever got really lucky. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that bothers me the most is that I heard this all from her friends, not her. I am overly honest with her, she knows everything about my past and prior relationships/crushes, etc. I know a lot about her too but since she has been going to more parties and stuff, I have been knowing her less and less. She is personally quite immature and often glorifies guys she meets. Another thing is that she gets really touchy-feely and close with my roommate and its starting to make me feel uncomfortable. Other people have noticed this and pointed it out to me, but I don't want to talk to either of them because I don't want to seem like a jealous asshole. So AITA for feeling like this and WIBTA if I chose to have a very serious conversation with her (I talked with her like this recently about her maturity to no real avail) or break up with her? Could you please help with any advice? I am looking for real help, so please don't be overly cruel with responses. ",

      "description": "So most people here will probably say that it's just a game and it doesn't matter, but here I go.\n\nSo recently, I started playing this game with my friends called Warframe, a MMO/RPG. In the game, you are able to make a clan which allows you to research new abilities, trade with your clanmates, and be able to build things in the \"Clan Dojo.\"\n\nA couple of friends and I started a new dojo with one of us as the clan leader ( they are able to kick anyone, destroy things, etc.). We soon realized that some rules would need to be put in place in order for the whole clan to not be a mess, so one of these rules was that it was not allowed to build anything without the clan leader's permission. \n\nFast forwards a couple of weeks and the clan leader made two rooms. I asked them what they were for and they said that one of these rooms would be mine (personalized rooms are not necessary for a clan, but it made it more fun) and I could choose which one mine would be. \n\nThe next day, I decided which room I wanted and started to build things in it (doesn't really matter what's in the room) without the clan leader's approval. I finished laying out everything I wanted in the room and started to farm for about 2 hours for the materials needed to get them. After the farming, I started production on everything... it would take about a day to finish.\n\nThe next morning I log on and I find that everything in the room was gone; all destroyed by the clan leader. Now, when things are destroyed, you get all of your materials back, but I was still very mad. After talking to the clan leader on discord (all be it in a very angry way), they said that they destroyed it because I didn't get permission from them. \n\nI'm still pretty mad at my friend for destroying what I built, but I also see how I was in the wrong. So AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "About last week I got sick two days before my test and I tried to take stuff to make me feel better. Next day I feel better so nothing wrong there. The day of the test in the morning I was feeling way worse as my sickness came back. I was talking with my brother about how I was sick and afraid I would fail the test even though I studied a lot and even got a lot of help from my tutor. He told me I shouldn’t go because in his experience he has always failed tests when he’s been very sick. I’ve had the same thing happen in the past. I called my mom and she said she was ok with it but she needed to get approval from my dad so she dialed him up for a three way phone call. In short he said no and we had a huge argument which ended in me going to school. During the test I was blowing my nose like every 3 minutes and sneezing a lot. It was so hard to think and I tried my best but I just couldn’t think as well if I wasn’t sick. Well yesterday I got my test back and I failed even though she curved it. I was angry because my teachers tests are very hard and now it’s going to be practically impossible to bring my grade up to an A again. I was mostly upset as I could have gone back to school when I was not sick and have passed or at least have gotten a decent grade. I told him I was upset and why and he tried to justify it so I stormed off to my room and didn’t talk to him for the rest of the day.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I am mortified by what happened, it was totally out of character:\n\nTLDR: I attacked my ex-boyfriends ex-girlfriend kinda badly after she put her foot towards my face saying she'd love to kick me.\n\nThe ex boyfriend and I are good friends, we haven't really broken up and we are staying exclusive, we still see each other like normal. We broke up because I couldn't handle being in a relationship when I think he's always lying, this is due to me finding out he was texting his ex behind my back the whole time &amp; some other ladies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ex had to come over to say goodbye to her dying cat which my ex and she owned for a year together, before she cheated on him multiple times. And I have been with my ex &amp; the cat for the past 3. \n\nMy ex went from not wanting to tell her, to not wanting to invite her to the house, to saying he would allow her only 30 minutes. I told him from the start she had a right to know, I wasn't thrilled but she did own the cat for a while.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day comes and she is at his house for 2 hours now while I was travelling down. I arrive, and my ex asks if she should leave, I felt bad and said I didnt mind in these circumstances but I'd like my own time with the cat without her presence. I had actually called her a long time ago to make peace so I had no bad intention towards her, but expected the same level of respect. Long story short, she was refusing to leave. My ex's parents were blaming me, my ex was yelling at me because I was getting upset she wouldn't leave.\n\nNow shes had around 3-4 hours with the cat and I barely got an hour. And I was made to leave, she was good to stay. \n\nI felt upset that I had considered everyone but no one considered me. I get my ex was crushed about the cat, but I am basically still his girlfriend, he still said I was his number one but I really don't feel it. It's almost principle that he should've defended me., even if he just considered me a friend \n\nI feel like an asshole though because this almost became about me and the ex instead of the cat. ",

      "description": "My ten year old son has a good friend named \"Stevie\" who lives with his grandfather.  A couple of weeks ago, my son asked if he could invite Stevie over and I said \"sure.\"  About an hour later, when Stevie arrived, my son came into my bedroom and told me that his grandfather wanted to talk to me.  When I walked into the entrance of my home, Stevie's grandfather was already inside (a big \"no no\" for my kids.  They are never to allow strangers into our home but since this was his friend's grandpa, I understand why he didn't hesitate to let him in.\n\nStevie's grandpa was a nice, older man.  He started talking to me about his life and started inquiring about mine.  I felt a little uneasy but I didn't want to be rude so I engaged for a bit.  I didn't think that this conversation was going to last for nearly an hour.  It got to the point that I had to use my body language to usher him out of the door.  Even then, he didn't really respond to my cues until I finally walked to my door, opened it and told him that it was nice to meet him and that his grandson would be in good hands with me.  I didn't pick up any negative (or perverted) vibes from him.  From the looks of it, he just seems to be a lonely older man who wants to be able to talk to people.   \n\nThis past Sunday, my son invited Stevie over as we were having a Super Bowl party for close friends and family members.  When the doorbell rang, I saw Stevie and immediately allowed him to come in and told grandpa that the party should wrap up at about 9:00 pm or so.  I then saw that he had three little girls with him (his granddaughters) and he said, \"Well, we're here for the party too!\"  I'm sure he saw the look of confusion on my face but of course, I was NOT going to be rude and led them to the outdoor kitchen where we were having the party.\n\nI introduced him to everyone.....well, I asked him to introduce himself because I had forgotten what his name was, to be honest.  I offered him a seat at the bar and he gladly took it.  He then started barking orders at the guys who were grilling (my husband and his friends).  He was demanding beer, plates of food, refills, etc.\n\nThe next day, my husband was incensed.  He asked, \"why did you invite a COMPLETE stranger into our home for a private party???\"  I assured him that I had NOT invited him but even then, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?  There is no way in hell that I was going to ask this man to leave.  That would have been cruel on my part.  Then my husband asked, \"so now, where is it going to end?  He feels comfortable just coming over because YOU engage with him.\"  He told me that I was naive and saw the world through rose colored glasses.\n\nI don't know what to think.  Basically, AITA for allowing this to happen?  I think I would've been the AH if I had asked him to leave.  Thoughts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "First serious post to this sub so be gentle please\n\nI'm 15 years old and just moved back to my birth country with my parents. ( I was born here but lived in a different country since I was 6 )  \nWe've been here for a few months in a pretty nice house and with a puppy and my parents have gotten their new jobs. The only problem is that school-wise I havnt been doing much. \nI got into high schoolwhen I was 11 turning 12 (normal for the country since I was only like a year younger than everyone else in my class). That high school was terrible and is literally being shut down after the last two years graduate because of how bad it was. I left that school due to the bullying I got and the staff being the worst. I got into a small homeschool housed in the back of  kids cafe and was in it for maybe 2 years i think (enough time for it to get its own building and we went from 6 to 18 students). I was doing pretty well in that school until I had to move countries. Now here's where everything I just told you becomes important. When I want to that home school  I choose the subjects I'm supposed to study when I entered second year (I had to re do first year). In normal schools you're supposed to do this after your third year. So basically now I'm trying to get into this popular \"\"rich kids school\"\" (im not rich or even upper middle class by any means but my friends and i always called big schools with mostly white kids rich schools). I took the placement exam yesterday where the tests were math and English. I am absolutely without a doubt terrible at math and totally bombed the test and felt terrible but I'm praying that i did good enough in English (my best subject by far) for them to place me in a year with kids my age. The whole me already choosing my own subjects thing could also really hold me back.My parents and i want me to get into third year (I would b in fourth year I I never left my first high school) but there is a chance they could put me in SECOND YEAR. And my parents arnt even stressing about it at all ?????? Idk if it's my anxiety but the thought of being put in second year scares my SO MUCH. I just dont want to feel stupid by being in a class with people younger than me AND being so far behind in my schoolwork. Since my parents arnt stressing about it I feel like I might just be an asshole ??? Some opinions would be very appreciated.\n",

My parents had a really messy divorce and since they both had custody and I like both my parents I would spend an equal amount of time with each of them. Growing up they would try to make each other’s lives harder and I was usually caught in the middle of it. They would constantly say mean things about the other to persuade me and my siblings to hate the other parent. Overall pretty bad experience as I see most of my childhood in a negative way. Fast forward to today, my mom is getting a divorce from her second husband of 6 years and it is equally as messy. However this time, my real dad has decided to comfort my mother in her time of grief (my dad was never re-married). They now constantly go to dinner and they wouldn’t tell me and my siblings they were hanging out and I feel a little betrayed that they didn’t tell me, and that they act like lifelong friends. With thanksgiving approaching my mom invited my dad to thanksgiving dinner, which would have never happens in the past. I am having a hard time talking to my parents as i am put off by them being friends now and I really don’t want to talk to them. Both my parents are upset that I’m not speaking with them often and don’t seem to think they are doing anything wrong. AITA for being upset? ",

      "description": "This happened a few months ago (September) but it's been eating away at me since. Long read, sorry!\n\nI had this friend who I met during my first year at university; we were both studying the same subspecialty in our major, so we had a lot of classes in common and we were fairly close friends. We would collaborate together on group projects, study together, and hang out after class fairly often. However, earlier this semester, she started becoming really closed off and distant and wouldn't really engage me when I tried to talk to her. It was like a complete 360 in attitude and I was really concerned; I really don't expect everyone to talk to me but it was a complete shift in her demeanor towards me despite me not doing anything. I got concerned for her and thought she might have been struggling with some personal problems so I asked her if everything was fine, to which she replied everything was okay (really brusquely though). Here's where I'm not sure whether AITA: I was still concerned for her so I decided to privately ask a mutual friend who was much closer to her whether she was doing okay, to which I got no response (seen on Facebook messenger though). I later told my friend that I asked her friend about her and she wasn't happy, claiming that she was allowed to be upset without having everyone snoop on her. I get that I may have crossed a boundary, and I  know how annoying it is to have someone not believe you because I have helicopter parents who frequently \"check\" on me through my friends. It's just that we attend a really stressful school, and multiple people I've known have committed suicide this past year due to overwork and mental health issues, with several more people I know committing self-harm in general. I really kicked myself for not being a good friend and recognizing that my other friends were suffering so I really tried to help this friend early on before things got out of hand but it's obvious to me I've only done more harm. I really miss having this friend in my life (we're still in the same classes, it's just really awkward now). I'm the kind of person that really wants everyone to be my friend, so I've been really down this entire semester because of this conflict. AITA here? If I am or am not, what should my next steps be to repair this friendship? ",

      "title": "AITA for signing a co-workers leaving card passive-aggressively?",
      "description": "A little background. I worked with this woman for a few years. I did not like the woman for various reasons and it culminated in the signing of the card when she left.\n\nAt work, she would do the bare minimum that was required of her and generally just didn't care about the people she was meant to be there to help (we work with teenagers). When she went on maternity leave, she spent the last few months of her time at work slacking off and not having her students do the work they were meant to do, which we didn't find out about until after she'd left; she'd effectively downed tools because she knew it wasn't going to be her problem when she was gone. We ended up having to redo all of her work on top of our own. She would also be the only one referring to our transgender students by their \"old\" names and pronouns, even when they'd never been referred to as those names and pronouns and they were only on the system because they hadn't legally been able to change their name yet.\n\nThen a while back she was renting out her apartment because she was moving in with her long-term partner, and I was looking for a place with my best friend at the time so we ended up renting the place from her (this was before quite a lot of the stuff in the first paragraph had happened, we'd only been working together for about a year at this point). Turns out she was a bit of a nightmare. She refused to do basic things such as put locks on the bedroom doors telling us that \"if you're such good friends, you shouldn't need locks\", and even when we offered to pay for them ourselves said she wouldn't allow us to have locks and it was \"non-negotiable\". It basically became a running theme that if we wanted it, we weren't getting it regardless of if we would pay or not.\n\nShe also wanted nothing to do with my friend who was paying half the rent. If my friend asked her a question on the groupchat, she would often answer in a separate chat or phone call to me specifically. When it came time after a year to renew our agreement, she send a list of amendments that straight up said \"All communication regarding the apartment is to be between me and IFeelRomantic\". After a while because of this and some other warning signs I figured out she was committing fraud, pretending to her mortgage company that I was the only person living there. I could have shopped her, but I didn't want to cause problems at work by essentially turning a co-worker into the authorities. We were planning on leaving as a result of all this, but she ended up selling the apartment anyway after we'd been there 18 months.\n\nSo essentially due to all this ... I wasn't her biggest fan.\n\nShe quit the job recently, and a leaving card was going round the office. I was trying to pretend I didn't see it or I was just too busy, but it eventually got dropped specifically on my desk and I couldn't. I didn't have it in me to write a love-dovey message after the crap she'd pulled. So I just wrote *\"Bye bye! - IFeelRomantic\"* in the card. I could have made up some fake BS, but I didn't.\n\nAs she's leaving the building for the last time we happen to cross paths as I'm coming in from break, and she has a go at me for writing the message in her card. She says \"that's all I get for all these years working together, all the things I've done for you?\" (referring to letting us rent her apartment presumably, since she damn well never did anything for me at work) and says she knows I hate her even though she doesn't know what she possibly could've done to deserve it. I just tried to get out of there as quickly as possible since I didn't want anything to do with her at this point and I was hoping to avoid all contact whatsoever.\n\nAITA in this situation?",

      "title": "AITA - Moving on fast after a 2 year relationship?",
      "description": "Hey guys! First post!\n\nHere’s more info:\n\nI (21F) have an ex (21M) that I met in college and have dated for two years until last August. Our relationship was amazing for two years and I even lived with him for the summer. I understand that he’s a really good person despite the relentless fights we had during the last 6 months of the relationship.\n\nOur last 6 months together was in the summer and we even went on a trip. While the trip was fantastic, I realized there was huge problems in our relationship. \n\nFor one, he was obsessively too caring? Not sure how I’d phrase it. For example, I have ADHD, so I have a HUGE problem leaving my stuff everywhere (phone, keys, wallet, etc). Instead of reassuring my of my lost items, he would get angry/mad that I would do such a thing. I’m also the type of person who wants to do everything myself, since I want to overcome my ADHD and not feel reliant on others to keep track of me. So as a caring person, he would offer to hold my stuff so I won’t lose it, but if I tell him no, he’d get angry. If I lost my stuff, I’d blame myself, and do what I can to retrieve it. \n\nIn essence, his aggressiveness with my care, and my refusal for help really hindered our relationship.\n\nAnother problem with his aggression was that he’d get angry at me for no reason. \nEx: one day he was playing fortnight (I know...) and lost. The next thing I know, he looked at me and yelled at me for just lying in bed for taking a break from homework (I never had a problem with late assignments, I was just tired). \nEx2: He would also get mad at me for not giving him sex. We would have sex pretty often in the beginning, however as a busy person, I was never in need of constant sex. He attributed this to me not being attracted to him anymore despite me telling him that it was absolutely not true. I would often get scared a little for how angry he gets sometimes and even have provided sex when I wasn’t feeling it so he wouldn’t get mad.\n\nWe did confront eachother about our problems and tried to fix it but towards the end of the 6 months, I knew it wasn’t going to work out. \n\nI felt extremely bad because his family also hooked us up with plane tickets but it was never my intention to use him like that.\n\nAnyways, we both agreed to end our relationship and possibly put it on hold. However, once I started to hang out with a guy I really had interest in (only a week later after we broke up) because he was so similar to me and the opposite from my ex. My reasoning to moving on fast was because I was already starting to dissociate from my ex for six months. Also I’ve been so happy around my new partner during my personal stressful period. \n\nAfter I told him\nAbout the new dude, and that it was not just a “break” anymore, he became mad ad told me that if I really cared about him, I’d turn the other guy down. \n\nI was upset because I still saw my ex as a good person and didn’t want to end things on a bad term, but I also really saw a huge potential with the new person. \n\nHe’s definitely not the asshole, I was just wondering if I was. And if I really am a bad person for moving on even if he told me that it would hurt him. \n\nAITA - for moving on for own happiness at the cost of my ex’s? \n ",

      "description": "Background: Currently rooming with a friend, both at the same air force base for pilot training. I got married recently and my wife (also in the military) got assigned here and is moving in a few weeks once she completes training. I want to live with my wife, but she has a cat and my current apartment isn't pet friendly. I've talked with my landlord and she isn't willing to budge on the lease at all. Which is fine, it's a legal contract, I just figured I'd ask. We've already found a pet friendly apartment in the town, and have put in an application. \n\nThings get complicated now. When my buddy and I first moved in together, we discussed the fact that I was planning to get married in the spring. We didn't know when my wife would be able to come here, so we got a 12 month lease which ends in August. I had to change my plans and get married earlier so she could get the join spouse assignment to come here. So we got married in November, and a couple weeks ago she got her assignment to this base. I was excited that she got this base and told my roommate, and he was happy for me but was concerned about what would happen with the lease. Before we agreed to room together, I discussed with him that I would be moving in with my wife whenever she came here. I don't think he remembered our previous conversation (it was like 7 months ago so there's that). I told him I'd talk with our landlord and see if she could get him a one bedroom instead of the two we currently have, so he wouldn't have to pay the full rent on this one. I went to her with my idea, and she said the only option was for him to stay and pay the rent for our current unit. \n\nHere's my plan: I'll move in with my wife at our new place. I will also pay my roommate my half of the rent for March (since I'll live here for at least half of March) and then I'll pay him the difference between the one bedroom he was fine with and the two bedroom we have now (745-675=70 per month for the rest of the lease, so 350) at once before I leave. I may even bump that up to like 500. I feel bad for dipping out halfway through the lease and leaving him with more apartment than he wants, but I want to live with my wife and don't think that's a crazy thing to want. \n\nWIBTA if I go through with my plan and leave my roommate paying most of the rent for the remainder of the lease?",

      "description": "So last year we thought my husband and I could possibly save money by \"renting out\" our car and using public transportation. It honestly probably would've worked out okay, even though it proved to be a bit more difficult to use public transportation than we thought. The reason it didn't work out and we ended up *losing* money was because, instead of trying harder to find an agency that would but our car or finding more respectable people, we just settled on this couple in their early 20s that we didn't know and had faith that, because they were \"nice\" and we were also just a couple in our early 20s trying to make it in the Big Bad World, they would pay our car payments.\n\nWe made no legal contracts with them, just planned to put them both on our insurance. It soon turned out that the girlfriend didn't want the car afterall but the boyfriend did. So we put him on our insurance and he had our car for about 3 months. He only made 1 car payment(this includes the loan and insurance bill).\n\nMy husband was suppose to handle all the communication and make sure the guy made payments but apparently, that didn't happen. He just casually asked the guy when he was going to pay once out of the 2 months he had our car and didn't pay.\n\n\nSo I took over all communication with him and told him that I wanted the car back and didn't want it \"detailed\" like he had offered because we needed the car ASAP. He gave us the car back covered in stains and dog hair, smelling like wet dog's ass.. but I was glad to have it back as some things had come up and we needed the car in whatever condition it came in. Finding a job and keeping the job as proving difficult without the car as well.\n\nIn October, he tells me he'll definitely be able to pay off what he owed before Deceomber 15th. In November, we get a notice for $300 fine because of a traffic violation the guy had apparently committed. He didn't pay until the very last hour that the bill was due. We had the $300 to cover the time beforehand, but we were out of that money for a whole month. The day he was suppose to pay the $300, I asked him around 5pm where he was, as he was suppose to meet me with cash or check. He said messaged me back.. after I called him twice at 7pm saying, \"Sorry, I just got a gig in the next town over. Can I venmo it?\". I agreed to the Venmo and he sent the money saying \"That's all the money I made tonight.\"\n\n\n\n\nHe assures me, again, that he will *definitely* pay the rest of what he owes us by December 15th. On December 15th, I call and I text. He gets back to me at some point saying \"Sorry. I don't have the money since I gave you all the money I had last week.\" \n\n\nBy Christmas, we became absolutely broke. My husband is a student who just ended his semester(no more student loans until sometime this month), I've had some medical issues come up and we had just moved into a new apartment on that Decemeber 15th, hoping for cheaper rent and that we'd get those car payments back. As the end of the year was approaching and we stared down the barrel of the new year, we had to stay at my parents place for a week for heating and food, they were so gracious to take us in. We had no money for upcoming bills and had to warn our landlords, who said we'd be served an eviction notice if we could not pay and I was calling local food banks.. all of which were to be closed for the next couple of weeks. All other financial resources were also closed. \n\n\nScared and frustrated, I called and messaged the guy again. I felt bad because I know a lot of people struggle around the holidays but I was grasping at straws, hoping that at the absolutely worst, he just forgot about us? He just ignored me and hasn't at all gotten back to me about when he will ever be able to pay us back.\n\n\nFor any context I have on his part, he and his girlfriend broke up shortly after he took the car. He went to see his family, (at the time he went for the visit, his excuse for not paying was that there was a family emergency). He lost his job because he was seeing his family and was not able to get it back, then he begged his parents to let him stay. On Venmo, I can see that he's recently made a \"tranfer\" to his ex girlfriend for some let related thing and had paid rent to someone else. \n\n\nMy husband just got a job with his old moving company a few days ago and that should definitely help us out until we get his student loans again but he gets paid bi-weekly and we have about $100 for gas and food and emergency with no food in the apartment. Fortunately, my husband often gets fed at work. So we are still hanging in there, we can try to buy some food that will stretch into the next week maybe. I would go to food bank but my husband has the car all day and late into the night everyday until Sunday. \n\n\n\n\nAnyway, it's just really rough this month and next month will definitely be better. All my conversations with this guy have been very nice and understanding and I haven't at all made threats or been angry at him.. but I *am* getting pretty frustrated that he can't even answer his phone anymore or let me know what's going on.\n\n\nAm I being an asshole for demanding the money on holidays and bugging him about it?? Should I just wait another month or so to ask him about it again? Or am I being too nice and should I try to take legal action, if there is any legal grounds?\n",

      "title": "AITA For wanting to fire a team member in grad school that will jeopardize their degree.",
      "description": "As part of my graduate program, I am teamed up with three others that, for every non-elective class, we are required to work on every-group project together. The teams were assigned over the summer and last until graduation in May 2019. As part of the program, the school requires that a student has to finish with their team in order to graduate and receive a degree. Group projects are a significant part of those three class's grades (\\~50%); the rest of the grade is exams (one did have a small homework component). Teams are allowed to fire a member of their group if there are issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the members of my group, will call him X, stopped showing to team meetings a bit after midterms in the fall semester. We never really had a set official meeting time, but we did have certain time slots that worked most of the time, that the rest of us assumed would be open if/when we needed to meet given a few days notice--the \"Meet up same time next week\" or \"lets do it after Thursday's class again\" sort of deal. Up until the midterms, there were few issues with scheduling times, but everyone, including X during the first half of the semester, would promptly notify us, either in person or over group text, if they had a conflict and X regularly attended those project meetings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after midterms and a week-long fall break after, X stopped showing up to the three classes we have together (only showed up 2-3 times in two of the classes, and only showed for the final for the third); the few times X did show up where when there was no group project in that particular class. None of us shared any electives with X so we do not know if X attended those other classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the team members who knew X in undergrad, messaged X a few times to see what was up, and in one of those messages X casually mentioned that they were taking some serious drugs. X said that they would be better with attendance to meetings, but nothing changed. We also know that X did \\*really\\* bad on one of the midterms and we think that is a factor since it was right before the issues started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe talked with the program director about this mid Nov and she told us not to put X's name on the case study paper that was due shortly after, and to see what they do with the remaining project. She also said that she met with X in an email after, with the pretext that he was missing class, and asked if it was affecting the rest of the team. X denied that there was a problem and told her that there were no issues with the team or X's academic performance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter X found out that we didn't put their name on the paper, we had a meeting with everyone and the program director. X got defensive thinking that everything was fine, that the problem was we didn't give X enough time to block out their schedule for the meetings. We countered saying that X didn't respond to any texts about setting up meeting times, that even a \"sorry cant make it then\" would have been okay and since they didn't go to class we couldn't get their input on meeting times face-to-face. We reached a sort of half-compromise of \"finishing the semester strong\" and the program director told us she will meet with us a few weeks after spring semester starts to see where we are. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nX did some work on the final project on their own and sent us the file to work off of (most of the math stuff was done), but a) we had issues following along with out them there, b) I felt wrong accepting their work after this mess with out contributing and c) we wanted to use the project as practice for the final exam, so we redid the work. We finished the rest after a meeting &amp; finished the final part of the write up on a google doc over the last week at everyone's own time, which X didn't contribute to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the rest of us finished studying for our last final (X didn't attend any of our study session either), we all said that we had enough and wanted to fire X. I said that I would take care of it over the holiday break, since the other two members planned on leaving campus the next night so I haven't talked to them again until today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToady, I wrote up an email draft to the director saying that we wanted to fire X, what is the procedure, and sent it to the other two to review before sending. They are starting to have cold feet and are no longer 100% onboard, and now I'm trying to convince them over group message to fire X. Classes resume next week and I want to get this done before then (didn't want to ruin anyone's Xmas but now I think that was a mistake for waiting this long).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to condone/enable/overlook someone who is using hard drugs. I don't want to give credit to this teammate when they don't do any work anymore. I don't want to carry the burden for someone who doesn't attend class. We gave X extra chances, and I don't want to give X another. If X gets fired they have to find a new team to take them in, which could be difficult; other teams will know something is up if X got fired and they may not want to pick up damaged goods. There is a good chance that this fucks X's degree up since they won't graduate and X's previous year will be a waste of time &amp; money. I don't know if this will make X's drug issues worse and spiral out of control. However, maybe this is a trigger to get their life back on track. I'm also feeling like an asshole trying to convince the other team members, who I like and respect very much cause they also don't want to ruin X's life. But I'm on the edge of pulling the \"its me or X card\" mostly cause I'm having ethical issues enabling substance use and looking for another team because I don't want to 'work' with X anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TLDR: A team member stopped contributing to group projects, no longer attended lectures and drugs are a factor; I'm trying to convince the rest of my team to fire them and potentially screw their degree and life up for a few years.\\*\\*",

      "description": "  I have a hooker friend that trying so hard too look classy and superior. She do sex for money and recently get married with a old guy. She show off. She like to bring me when she is shopping to show off how much she spend and she always pay for our food. She like saying thing like \"i'm rich..\", \"let me pay, i'm rich\", \"I only want rich man\", etc\n  We both in early 20 and meet at school. I come from tbh a quite rich family, my father have few company (she know, and that probably why she being friend with me, last time we go holiday to other country, all expend my family pay. But my parent raise to be \"humble\", my pocket money is like most of my friend, i never brag and i try to be kind and all of that kind of bullshit).  I actually never feel any pressure because i know i have more than her. \n  The things is, she like to bring me down. She have a bad self esteem and i think that's why she do it. She like to say and treat me like i'm dumb (she drop out from college after a lecture get angry to her because of her stupidity, marry her loser sugar daddy, and she trying to say that to me? LOLS ) And you know what i do? I will try to kill her with kindness (which is easy because i'm known as sweet innocent girl)\n\nSo here some things i do:\n\n-her: you are a failure\n  Me: hahaaha whats failure about me? I just finish my degree and i'm going to master soon. \nHow about you?\n\n-her: my get ** dolar every month.\n me: wah, really? Is that enough for you? *act like i'm feel bad for her*\n(fyi my father earn so much more than her husband, her husband income is only twice of money i spend every month. My father have two kids, and he always saving more than he spend)\n\n-her: am i ugly\nme: yes *with a honest and kind face\"*\n\n-her: *trying to brag about how much she spend for a bag\"\nMe: why you spend so much? your husband income is only xx etc *show her i'm worried*\n\n-her: you are bimbo\nMe: no lah *act like i don't care\nfew hour after\nMe: i know you are a prostitute HAHA\nHer: bla bla bla no\nMe: really you are not? Good because it's disgusting lols\n\nAnd so many more thing happen but that's basically what i do every time she try to act shitty and bring me down. I will try to destroy her with a kind face (why being hysteric or violence when you can left some kinda permanent mental problem with your sweet voice) \nEverytime i do that i can she hurt in her face and she trying so hard to act cool. I know i hurt her. I don't feel bad because i think i'm some kind of justice warrior.\nI can easily just avoid her because our friendship is little toxic, but somehow she entertain me with her pretentious act (like look at a bitch trying so hard to pretend she is a rich classy lady, but in the end she is still a dirty bitch. It's funny. I feel more superior than her. I feel good,) so we still meet and hangout sometime.\n\n\nAITA? What should i do? Is she deserve it?",

Yesterday, I was parking my car in a remote lot because we aren’t allowed to park on campus (college students), and as I was walking back in the 25° weather, a girl asked me if I had a snow scraper. I said yes and proceeded to go grab it and give it her. After she scraped off the car, she offered to give me a ride to wherever I needed to go since it was freezing and I have her the scraper. Anyways, long story short, she and I had a pleasant conversation and she dropped me where I needed to be. A few hours go by, and if SO calls me and we start taking. I nonchalantly bring up for situation and she immediately changes her mood. I feel like something so small  shouldn’t be a big deal, but I have tendencies to overlook these things. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So, the background.\n\nI have been with my girlfirend for almost 5 years now, and every year we always go to her families home to celebrate big events ( New Years, Name-day, our country version of chrimas ect). Often this involves her parents and her little sister.\n\nThis year she had been through alot of stuff in a short space of time (Car accident where she broke her wrist, insurance issues and suing other party for injury). as a result of her broken wrist, she could not do her job effectively enough, so she was not to go there  for  5 weeks. so she has worries about keeping her job too.\n\nWith a week left to healing was complete, we planned to go to her parents house again for holiday celebration. But I was away at work the week before this, and said I would catch up and appear a few days later than normal (but before holiday main day happen). \n\nBut I got ill, I had a sniffle and a temperature, normal cold stuff, so I just gave a heads up to her that I might not be 100% when I get there, but I was still coming (was finishing packing my clothes, it was only a 2 hour drive).\n\nShe texted back saying she was sorry I was ill, and that it must suck, but said don't come over for holiday, because she did not want to get ill and maybe miss time off work more. and also later mentioned maybe not getting her parents ill, who are in their late 50s (But it felt like excuse, as it came many texts after the 'I dont want to be ill' text). and her little sister always came over every year ill with cold and others got ill from her. so that is good, but not me? \n\nSo I was short in my text reply and said 'Have a fun  holiday', and she said we should talk later, but I did not want to because I felt hurt and rejected in family time holiday, so I did not speak to her yet, and she is back tomorrow (after gone a week).\n\nShe said it was understandable, I am still hurt and thought she was freaking out too much and was selfish.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for not including my husband into my new friend group?",
      "description": "To start this story, I am a pretty fresh immigrant to the US, less than two years now and married (F24 with M32).\nMy husband is a US citizen and grew up here. He has a pretty steady group of friends that I pretty much all know, and I am offered to hang out with, but only do so sporadically because I feel like they’re my husbands friends, he grew up with them, they’re older and ultimately, I very much support him going to the bar with them or play games or whatever. If it’s like a party or an event, I am happy to go and they are all great people.\nI started a new job where are I FINALLY after almost two years of not having proper friends and missing everyone back in Europe, made good connections and I hang out with group of people (about 3 to 8 people) pretty regularly after work (we all work at Disneyland, so it’s easy to just pop in for a few hours after work without going home). \nThe thing is, as much as I love my husband I also enjoy being a stupid 20 year old and hang out with people my age or a little younger, which is all of them in this group. It makes me so happy that I finally have connections of my own and ‘my’ group, because as a new person in the US I had to rely on my husband for that and had to blend in in his group, otherwise I wouldn’t have anybody and I didn’t have the luxury to have someone I grew up with or like a high school friends I would know for years, and this really bothered me. My husband always encouraged me to make friends, too. \nHere is the thing.  My husband now keeps asking why am I not introducing him to my friends (which he met at least 3 of them when he was with me after work, not in a group but I introduced them, but we never hang out) and wants to hang out with us, but its not what I want. He feels like I dont include him.\nI feel like in general I am very independent person and I was never clingy or have the need to spend all my free time with any SO in the past or include them in every little thing I do - I like to think that people dont merge all of a sudden to one entity and have to intertwine everything theyre doing and have like shared friend group.\nAlso, as much as our age difference isnt an issue in day to day life, I feel like I had to grow up a lot and didnt enjoy my early twenties at all, which  I get to enjoy now with my new friends - my husband being older would totally not fit into this group because of it. I dont want to think about if he is entertained and having a good time with bunch of stupid 20 year olds . \n\nTo add more info, i mostly hang out with them right after work, like once or twice a week, rarely stay out late, they are all good people, no drinking, all very safe and mostly at Disneyland. I would not prioritize my friends over my husband but I sure value my own happiness as well. The time spent with my friends doesnt shorten the time spent with my husband. Also I said majority of these reasons to him but he arguments with that I got to hang out with his friends so its only fair, but i dont value those things the way he does.\nAm I the asshole here for wanting my own friends?",

I asked for it back, saying “I don’t want you to snoop in it!” He says that I sounded suspicious, and that I am hiding something (I agree that my phrasing left some to be desired though). \n\nThere is evidence that if he has access, he will try to look through my electronics. Once, he told me he knew my password and that he and his brother had tried to unlock my laptop after I left the house with no success. I feel as though this further encourages me to keep passwords to myself. \n\nI don’t want to share my passwords with him for my laptop or phone. I don’t have anything to hide, but I feel that I have a right to privacy. He is a critical person and would find things to pick on me about (“why are you texting your ex-boyfriend? Who is this male that you had a conversation with 8 months ago?” etc). I also feel that it goes both ways. He has never shared his password with me, and I am fine with that. But, this morning, I asked him if, in the same situation, he would give me his passcode, and he said, “no because it’s my password to everything.” \n\nAnyway, he is super pissed now.

      "description": "Hi all, I’m using a throwaway for this. \n\nThis happened a little while ago, around October. I (14) knew this girl who I kinda liked, and I knew she liked me. Honestly I was too scared to really push for a relationship, so she and I were just friends, mostly. Anyways, I was hanging out behind the school at a football game, and she came over and after a while she kinda leaned in, so asked her if it was okay if I kissed her. This was my first kiss. We kissed, and I guessed I realized I wasn’t ready. Not like, ready for a relationship, but ready to kiss someone. You know that feeling? It’s hard to describe. Immediately  afterwords I just had this gut feeling that I was in some way *wrong* and *dirty*. If I had to describe it I would say it felt like I lost a part of my innocence I know l’ll never get back. I just wanted to go home and cry. \n\nSo I kinda ran away. It was a douchey thing for me to do, I know. But after a while I knew I had to explain to this girl why I did that, so I found her and talked to her. I told her that I really didn’t feel ready for something like that, and I apologized for running away. I thought i cleared things up with her, but . . .\n\nThe next day, I wake up to my phone being blown up. It was her friends, calling me a dick for “using her”. They said the only reason I talked to her was to fuck her, and that when I found out that she wouldn’t fuck me I ditched her. They called me worse things and are still talking about it. \n\nI’m really confused. Did I really do something *that* wrong???",

      "description": "So my sister's soccer team was playing today (all the players are 15-17) and their coach couldn't make it so I filled in for the game.  Both teams didn't have any subs, but our team was just way better than the opponents and we were 4-0 up after just a few minutes.  The final score ended up being 10-0 and we were cheering our asses off after every goal.  I don't think there's anything wrong with celebrating my sister's success but after the game my mom told us that we were cheering too hard and it was rude to the other team.  I don't really agree with that, I feel like it's part of the game, but I wanted to get some outside opinions on it.  We weren't trash talking the other team or anything, we were just celebrating our own players when they did good",

      "description": "So to make a long story short, I'm in a Spanish II class. I sit next to this one girl, who spends almost all of class period texting her boyfriend on her Apple watch, and uses her Apple watch for almost every single quiz and test. My professor never even notices this - I don't think she's even aware of what Apple watches are. \n\nAnyways, I admit it pisses me off, because I (and others I know in the class) spend a LOT of time studying for that class - I feel like Spanish is something that you really just have to commit to learning in order to actually succeed in, and it definitely takes time and effort. So when I see this girl just cheating on every single assignment, it irks me. I ended up shooting the professor an email, with this verbatim:\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Hello Dr. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_! \n\nThis is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ from SPA 102. I just wanted to give you a quick heads up, that you might want to have students remove their Apple watches before quizzes and tests. For the last quiz, I noticed someone was using theirs to look at the vocabulary words. Apple watches have a lot of features, including looking at pictures and texting people.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWas this an asshole move of me, though? I literally wouldn't have given a shit if she'd done it once or twice - I get that sometimes things happen. But the fact that she does it every single class/test/quiz bothers me. She's getting an A for free while the rest of us are getting lower grades for hours of studying. Is it none of my business, though?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any advice!",

      "description": "So my friend, let's call him H, has been my best friend for a long time, we've been through thick and thin together, and we usually get along very well, there's hardly any arguments between us. However, this weekend was different, an argument arose, and I would like to know if my handling of the situation was asshole behavior.\n\n\nSo H has been dating my other best friend, W, for about a year and a half now. Seeing the two of them being happy together is always great, but there are some downsides. The two of them essentially use me as a free couples therapist, because I've known both of them very well and because I am an ok listener. This does mean that a lot of the times I get one on one with each of them is usually spent listening to their issues and trying to help. Now, I don't necessarily mind this, I like to help when I can, but it's seemed like when I want to talk to them about something either something comes up or they're unavailable because they're going on a date. This weekend, however, they were going out on Friday night, meaning that I could hang out with one of them Saturday provided they were available, so I asked. H said he was busy all that day, but W was free, so plans were made for Saturday. Then comes the weekend.\n\n\nWe get to Friday and H calls me up asking if I want to hang out out of nowhere. I told him that I had taken a shift for that night, and asked what happened to their date. He told me she wasn't up for it that night, but it was all good, because they were just going to spend Saturday together instead. So there's me all of a sudden having made plans around their schedule being thrown to the side, and I wasn't having it.\n\n\nI got mad, and started going off on both of them, telling them how it felt like i wasn't really a friend to them anymore I was just free counseling, someone who listens and tries to help, and that I didn't really matter to either of them because whenever I needed help they weren't there. Their response was 'Sorry you feel that way, but you need to get over yourself, you're acting like a selfish child.’\n\n\nAre they right, am I being the selfish asshole here and should I have handled this differently?  \n\n\n",

      "description": "(Sorry if this looks bad I'm on mobile.)\n\n   So here's some back story, I'm a senior in high school and this friend is a sophomore now I have a rule called 1 up 1 down meaning I'll only date someone one year above or below me not any higher or lower. She likes me I do not because of my rule and I've never broken that rule so she doesn't like it. For a while now she has been super touchy and over obsessive and even when I would ask many times for her to chill out she wouldn't or stop for a while then start back up. Also whenever I would leave school she would get mad if I didn't give her a hug as if she deserved it or I owed her. Now this alone causes me issues first off she talks to her friends about things like hugging me for 7 minutes and things like that which messes with my reputation because it looks like I'm dating someone two years younger than me (and that's what a lot of people think) and one of her close friends is the girl I like and this magnet of a person has been messing it up for me.\n\n   Now I've been able to handle all of this so far but the new issue she has caused is that she is now jealous of my other Freshman friend because she thinks she likes me which I know she doesn't because we talk about people we like and she shows no signs at all of liking me. I told her this but she persisted saying she likes me and that she was going to make me get rid of my rule. I did all I could but she wouldn't listen and would get mad that my friend poked me ONCE. After all of that, I couldn't take it anymore and just told her I don't want to be friends anymore and I stopped talking to her. \n\n   Now to me, it seemed like I did no wrong but my friends have made me seem and feel like the asshole so tell me Reddit AITA.",

Dad and I (but mostly me) bought loads of stuff and snacks that I ended up having to store some of my things in his luggage, and we ended up paying extra for overweighted luggage :)) \nSince my cousin 1 found out that I was going, he has been asking for lots of stuff from Korea and Japan ranging from large amount of a specific candy to designer clothing to skincare.

I don’t mind buying presents if it’s small and light, but it was quite the opposite for half of the stuff (cousin 1 wanted me to buy a denim jacket???) \nI did promise to look for it IF I HAD SPACE but I never once felt reassured that it was fine if I didn’t bring anything home and in a way feel pressured to buy their stuff if that makes sense? \nMy passive aggressive dad wasn’t too fond of the idea of buying presents and kept asking whether or not they brought stuff home for me when I asked for it. My boyfriend agrees with my dad and stresses that I should just buy stuff for myself and not go around looking for stuff for others. \nI managed to buy one thing for cousin 1 and cousin 2 and none for cousin 3. \nI sort of feel bad now for coming home with not much when they are expecting stuff. \n\nIATA for not buying my cousins stuff from Asia? \n\n- I am also sorry if nothing makes sense and apologise for any grammatical errors.

Recently we were assigned to write a small program, and had the whole 3-day weekend to do it. It was a fairly easy assignment considering what we have had already.\n\nA friend texted me over the weekend about how to do a specific part. He is a bright kid and would like to pursue a career in programming. I figured the part he was asking about was easy enough that he could figure it out in a few minutes with some thinking, so I just told him to figure it out.\n\nToday, the Tuesday after MLK Jr. day, I learned that he was really bitter after that exchange. In hindsight, my offhanded comment seems lazy and/or snobby, but I really did think he was more than capable of doing it himself.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Sorry for the length in advance. \n\nEarlier this year my family and I went on a trip. It was quite spiritual and some could call it a life-changing experience. It was our first time to this place which holds great importance to our religion. \n\nThe trip was planned about 6-8 weeks prior to us going and was kind of spontaneous. \nI had been sick for a while before this trip ( like for 8 months). \nAnyways, for about roughly 3-4 days on the trip (the trip was a total of like ~23 days I think) my condition escalated to where I was in bed and struggling to get up and even leave the hotel room. I repeatedly told everyone it was okay and I just needed some rest and all the stress and jet lag was getting to me and maybe triggering some symptoms. \n\nThe first day it happened and I got through it, I even ended up going out with them all that night. The second time my husband stayed back with me and then later in the day my sister volunteered to stay with me for about an hour while he went for a prayer. My mom was worried so she stayed back too despite me telling her to go. \n\nAfter this I was fine for a few days ( by fine I mean my sickness was okay enough for me to get out of bed). I was still struggling to feel okay and could definitely feel the decline in my health but I kept it to myself mostly. I really wanted to take advantage of the trip and every opportunity. So I stocked my purse with anything I would need for the day (extra sweater and socks, pills, water, etc) and would go at it and give it the best I could. I even started doing things to prove my own strength to myself (I know, it’s weird) like standing even if I knew I needed to sit or continuing to walk even though I knew I needed a break. I didn’t want this stupid sickness to get in the way of this wonderful meaningful trip with my family. \n\nAfter a few days I was in bed for a day again but convinced everyone I would be fine and to go ahead the next day while I stayed back. Well next morning everyone wakes up and my little sister has a fever so we decide she will stay back with me and I will watch her for the day. That was great actually. It worked out for everyone and we were kinda like sick buddies. That night we both felt better enough to go out with them all. \n\nAfter that there was one more day I struggled a bit to get up but I forced myself to anyways. \n\nAll in all, we deemed the trip a success and we had an enjoyable time (or so I thought). \n\nSo fast forward to a few days ago. We’re talking about planning a trip we’re thinking to take in the new year and someone brings up the trip from earlier this year and my brother says “well let’s hope constant-curiosity isn’t sick as the last trip or else nobody will enjoy this one either” to which everyone was kinda shocked and nobody said anything. My mom told him “what do you mean? We all enjoyed that trip “. Then he replied “well it’s not enjoyable when your sister is just sick all the time and then ruins a family trip”. \n\nI’m not gonna lie it hurt. But then I realized that I could be guilty of this. I ruined the family trip because of the days I spent in bed? Since the trip I had thought about how maybe it would have been better if I stayed home and even had a conversation with my mom and sister a few times and brought it up. But it never occurred to me I could have ruined the entire trip for him and them all. \n\nI could really be the asshole here by even going on the trip. I’m starting to believe I should back out of the one we’re currently planning before I sabotage a trip again. \n",

      "description": "The starts at lunch. Earlier that day, all of our teachers made us watch a video that discussed the problems of living below the poverty line. It mentioned welfare checks. \n\nDuring lunch, my friend brings it up. I say how I think welfare is good, but some people use it to purchase expensive clothing. My friend (who is very conservative) says “I think that’s a problem because black people spend their welfare on nice shoes.”\n\nI call him out immediately saying how incredibly racist that is. He defends himself by saying “well it is true that a lot of black people like nice shoes”\n\nI reply by saying other people also like nice shoes. I said that he could have said that certain people who receive welfare spend it on nice shoes, but he opened it up to only black people and assumed that all black people who receive welfare spend it on shoes. \n\nDuring this discussion, the table next to us (which is all black people and one white guy) starts yelling at him for being incredibly racist. The next day, he doesn’t go into school. I get called down into the office to explain what happened, so I did. They said that I did nothing wrong at all. This kid, let’s call him Gym, calls me asking why I always challenge his political views. I tell him because if I were to say something very liberal (which I am), would he not argue it? \n\nHe always gets mad at me when I talk to him about politics, even when he starts the discussion, because I always win because I look up numerous articles. This is not the first time he said something racist around the table as well. AITA for calling him out?\n\nTLDR; I called a friend out for being racist, and the table next to us got mad. He didn’t go to school the next day.",

She then rambled on about other news in her life and ignored ours. I kind of expected this from her as she is very negative about everything and the world revolves around her, I’m pretty certain she’s a narcissist. But it still really hurt me and I have been ignoring her since we told her, just over 2 weeks ago. She finally texted today asking if something was wrong as I have not been answering her texts and she feels cut out, this is after having a convo with my brother where he basically told her why I’m ignoring her as she didn’t pick up on it. So AITA for not wanting to talk to her? I don’t really even know what to say to her as I’m still so mad and upset that she cant just be happy for us. ",

      "description": "So just over a month ago I matched with this girl on Bumble. Super cute, nerdy, we got on insanely well. It was the only time I really felt that dating apps might actually yield something meaningful. Every day we'd send these long messages back and forth, which was awesome, and eventually she asked me for my details so we could talk outside off the app. This was also great for me given how easily I tend to get lost in small talk with matches until they fizzle out, and I appreciated her taking the initiative. We started speaking more regularly until last Friday where I plucked up the nerve to ask her out in a roundabout way. \n\nNo reply for 3 days.\n\nThis morning she gets in touch again and apologises for not responding as she was busy over the weekend and exhausted from some personal stuff. I don't push it as the rest of her message was still conversational though I did sense something was a bit off. We make small talk about her weekend, but her messages are starting to get a bit erratic. Do you know when can tell that someones tried to edit a message a few times before sending it because the sentence structure and punctuation doesn't quite make sense? Like they've tried to rewrite a message but didn't properly read it through before hitting send?\n\nYeah it was like that. I figured out why. \n\nShe was waiting for me to notice her Facebook relationship status (lol). She'd posted earlier in the day (about the time she got back in touch) that she's now in a relationship. Naturally I was thrown, but clearly I wasn't the only one she was talking to.\n\nI mull it over for a bit, then just send what I think was a courteous message despite how I felt. I just said how I noticed her status, that it'd been fun talking to her but because weren't looking for the same thing anymore I should probably bow out. I tried really hard to not be an asshole about it, though I was (and still am) a bit hurt that she didn't bring it up first.\n\nShe replied literally 10 seconds later simply saying \"Fair enough, all the best :)\". I didn't wait for anything else, but then proceeded to delete/block her from all social media etc.\n\nI know it's just a Bumble match, but after like five weeks of fairly intense conversation I can't help but feel a bit of a fool here. I wasn't an asshole about it, but I kinda feel she was in waiting for me to say something and give her an out instead of her being upfront about it. \n\nI kinda feel like an asshole here for wishing I'd been more confrontational about it, but on the other hand I question whether or not she was actually being an asshole herself or was just not sure how to bring it up (meaning there were no assholes here).",

      "description": "Sorry for the long story.. there's a lot of history here. Tl;dr below.\n\nWe hired a photographer around the time we got engaged and our package came with an engagement photo session. We paid the required deposit upon booking. After we did the shoot, a couple months went by and we didn't receive our photos. We reached out and she said she was editing them and would get them to us soon, and apologized.\n\nWeeks went by and we still didn't hear back so we checked again. She said she had already uploaded them and sent a link, but we couldn't find anything in our inboxes so we asked again. She replied, saying she was thinking of a different couple and would upload them asap. Not long after, she sent a message stating her hard drive crashed and she lost all photos from every shoot she didn't back up, which included ours. She apologized profusely and offered a reshoot, along with an extra photo session in the fall to make up for it.\n\nShortly before the reshoot, she told us she needed to reschedule for reasons I can't remember, so we did. We finally got them done, and got the photos surprisingly quickly. We loved them and we were excited for the second session later in the fall.\n\nThe night before the free session (October), she cancelled because her entire family was sick. We rescheduled the session for a couple weeks later. The day of our cancelled session, she was posting photos and videos on Facebook of her daughter's birthday party. Everyone, including her, looked happy and healthy.\n\nThe rescheduled free session (November) was a sunrise shoot, and since it was fall, it was bitter cold outside. We were outside with no jacket or warm clothes for well over an hour during the shoot so it was miserable, but it didn't seem like a huge issue at the time.\n\nWe just got a link to the photos a couple days ago, January 31st. Every photo looked extremely awkward and uncomfortable, pretty much because of the cold weather. We weren't happy with them at all.\n\nThroughout the whole year, she always took a really long time to respond to emails, and constantly created excuses for her lack of response or cancellations. A few days ago, she even casually told my fiancee her husband (the videographer) is going back to school and won't have as much time to practice filming or editing, and said she'd have to pick up some slack taking care of their kids so she'd be busier.\n\nAfter talking it through with my fiancee, I emailed her this morning explaining we'd like to part ways and be refunded our deposit, minus her standard rate for a 1 hour session. We liked the first shoot and think it's fair she be paid for it.\n\nShe didn't reply, and instead Facebook messaged my fiancee, explaining her confusion, and said she's extremely upset about the situation. After my fiancee replied and listed some more specific reasons we weren't comfortable with her anymore, she didn't respond. I emailed her again, stating we'd like to keep correspondence over email to keep things professional. We're now working through options for our refund per our contract, but it feels like a really awkward breakup and we both feel horrible for firing her. All her emails have a bitter, petty vibe. It wasn't meant to be personal or emotional, but we know she's making it personal and that's very uncomfortable to us.\n\nTl;dr Our wedding photographer took forever to respond every time, lost our first engagement session photos, and gave us a free shoot in return. She canceled/rescheduled both reshoots and gave excuses. After firing her, she made it personal and uncomfortable for us.\n\nEdit: I just remembered that we only found a couple reviews of her business because she seems to delete them, and they're both negative.\n\nEdit 2: She stopped arguing and said she will refund us the amount we asked for. She said it will have to wait until her husband's school loan arrives this week, because he's going back to school. It's clearly just a freelance side hustle because I feel like any legitimate service should have its own financial system in place, but I'm no business owner so maybe that's completely normal.",

      "description": "I’m 15M (sophomore), the girl is 16 (almost 17, she’s 01’ I’m 03’). So basically, this girl and her friends have been bothering me pretty much every day since the start of the school year. We all used to be cool but the girl caught feelings for me that I couldn’t reciprocate so eventually I guess she began to despise me or something. I didn’t mean anything by it and I still wanted to be cool with her and her friends, and for a short while we were. \n\nOut of the blue a couple months ago (start of the school year) they all became toxic asf and constantly disrespectful. Anytime I snapped back they would play the victim. On numerous occasions they tried to humiliate me by getting all together and “jumping me” which is basically them all pushing me around, punching me, slapping me, and pulling on my hair. For some reason I brushed this off and still tried to be cool with them, (probably my own ego and not being able to sit with the fact that a group of girls basically bullied me) I tried to flip the positions of power and act like I was the bigger person by ignoring their tirades of assault. \n\nEvery day it became more and more obnoxious until today. I finally snapped. Before I was never really hurt or cared too much about it, but today... The girl brought up some pretty personal and insulting things  about my family and said it loud enough so she could “expose” me. She then punched me, right in my nose. (It was actually bleeding) I couldn’t take it, I lost my cool. I ended up pushing her and kicking her to the ground as she turned around. Her friends jumped in and beat on me too. They were much smaller so I could easily ignore them, she was the biggest and quite close to my size (I’m 6 2 she’s 6 0 and quite strong) She proceeded to get back up and slap me a couple times, real fucking kangaroo slaps, I was going to reciprocate with real man punches but my boys had to hold me back. Then I realized everybody was looking and realized how crazy and abusive I must look. A man beating on a girl. I really don’t have a temper until someone really gets me heated like by doing what she did, I just lost it though. \n\nObviously I don’t like hitting women and I don’t think it makes me hard or whatever. I would never put my hands on a woman but today... idk it’s like when someone hits you hard enough so you really feel that physical pain combined with when someone brings up such a large emotional trigger in you, you have no other option than to get physical. Maybe my logic is backwards, AITA?\n\nTL;DR\nUpper classmates and her friends jumped me. They were all beating on me until he biggest girl who is basically my size brought up very personal things about my family and my own life and used it to insult me, while shouting it so everybody could hear. She then proceeded to throw a big ol hook right at me, striking my nose (it was bleeding later), I reciprocated by pushing her and kicking her to the floor. (Not stomping on her) Her and her friends continued to beat on me. The big girl slapped me with all the force of her backhand like three times and I was going to punch her in the face until my friends held me back and cooled me down.\n\n",

      "description": "My parents have always thought that me (14, almost 15F,) should be able to get my permit when I'm 15 and then drive when I turn 16. They both agree that driving is an important skill to have and they want me to drive me and my brother to and from school. I brought up this topic after dinner the other day, seeing as I'm turning 15 very soon, and turns out my mother had a change of heart. \n\nShe now thinks that I don't need to drive until I'm 18 and it would be worthless to let me get my license. Now, I strongly disagree because I want to be able to hang out with friends, and more importantly, drive to school and any summer job/internship/volunteer work. I argued with her a bit, asking if she would be willing to drive me around during the summer and she agreed. I know this is not viable AT ALL because she has a job definitely would not be able to drive me to and from the zoo everyday for me to volunteer.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, completely agrees with me. He thinks there is a very good reason why I should be able to drive and fully supports me in this argument. \n\nI am pretty upset with my mother because she's always been okay with me driving when I'm 16 (perhaps even more than okay, seeing as she offered to buy me a car) and now she suddenly thinks driving is a dumb idea for me. There are plenty of good reasons why I should be able to drive, but in my eyes, it seems like my mom is flat out ignoring all of them.\n\nSo what do you think guys? Am I the asshole?",

We've been struggling to find players until bff said his friend (R) had a D&amp;D group and could use extra players. I've actually meet R before, super nice, easygoing. However one of the other members of the group said she didnt want me to join. She actually said, \"it's not because shes a girl, it's because we shouldn't let friends of friends join.\" (I thought this was weird because gender was never mentioned). However bff was still invited and because he has a hard time making friends with his social anxiety I told him he should go. He responded by saying he would make sure they meet me soon so I could join too, after all the whole point was to play together. But it's been a while though and it doesnt look like they're even trying to make plans to meet me, especially considering I dont think the girl who made the 'no friend of friends' rule wants to meet me at all. I'm feeling hurt and left out because the whole reason to get into this sad to play together, but I feel selfish saying that because I told him he should go in the first place. I want to bring it up to him but I also feel like I should know before I talk to him if I'm the asshole",

I don’t think any thing happened while me and her were together but within a seemingly short time(not sure how long exactly), a few months I know, they were sleeping together after we broke up. So I can’t help but think that at least mentally they had a thing going. Besides, that is just shitty I think? \n\nMoral dilemma:\n\nIs this a situation where I can’t get mad because technically we had broken up right? If it makes a difference, I broke up with her.\n\nSo here is the AITA part: \n\nMy ex wants to get back together (it’s been a few years) and in restarting talking to me admitted the sex with best friend thing above. I thought they just continued their friendship. I didn’t hang around my friend while he was with my ex and he never mentioned this to me or even having feelings for her. I connected the dots in the convo of her trying to reignite the flame and getting her to admit to my suspicions was like pulling teeth. Her saying, “it shouldn’t matter”/“I was in a weird place”, and me saying “but it does to me”. I don’t talk the friend anymore for no particular reason, he was just kind of a bum I realized as I got older. So she also argues that he was never really a good friend anyways.\n\nIn short I think they crossed a line that can’t be uncrossed. \n\nNote: The relationship is past reigniting. There’s no way we could or should try again with this toxic cloud hanging over us, or at least me. But really, AITA?",

We found out shortly thereafter that she was pregnant with what turned out to be also purebred (but not papered) puppies. My brother doesn’t work, so I paid all of the vet fees, food and supplies -which added up to a few thousand dollars. We decided to adopt the puppies out since I already have another dog and don’t have the space to keep them all. Anyway, we decided on a reasonable adoption fee and posted them once they were 8 weeks old. We had several people inquire, almost exclusively looking for female pups (there were 2 females and 3 males in the litter).  One couple emailed us saying they couldn’t pay the fee, but they are disabled vets who homeschool their two kids and also somehow care for 40 animals and train companion dogs and could we please give them a pup for free, and they specifically “need” the red female. I offered to give them a discount on one of the male pups (basically asked how much they could afford), but they “needed the red female” and she had to be free. I said no for the following reasons:\n\na) if you can’t afford what we’re asking (and it’s not much) for a purebred puppy, there are PLENTY of mixed breed puppies that need homes\n\nb) I did pay for all of her care, food, supplies, shots worming and vet checks for all the pups and would like to recover some of that, especially since I didn’t know she was pregnant when we took her in, so it was an unexpected expense that came from my savings\n\nc) the red female is the one everyone wants\n\nd) if they can’t afford an adoption fee, how will they afford vet bills?\n\nMy brother (who has paid for nothing) got pissed and thinks I’m being a bitch and should give them the pup for free because of their sob story.

      "description": "This is gonna be a long one. So, to summarize, my parents 20 years marriage was shit, with physical, financial and emotional abuse ensuing. Mother was always adamant about not leaving, for multiple reasons (money, love, me, etc) but actually she was just stuck in the co-dependant mud and didn't want anyone to know. Last year, father left her for his cousin, and she was BATSHIT. Random tinder dates, drinking, etc. When one of the dates left her, she was actually drinking a whole wine bottle in 1-2 days (she doesn't drink), and emotionally blackmailing me when I was out for \"abandoning her when she most needed\". Recently, she met this guy, whom she has know for 5 months, and they're planning to live together, with marriage and children in mind (she doesn't even earn enough for supporting just the two of us). It pisses me off how irresponsible and boy-crazy she can be, as this poses a risk for us both, since we're women and she barely knows the guy; and as an abuse victim, she should know WAY better than this. He's already living with us, and she plans to sell our house and buy another with him. So I've been pretty avoidant, staying out of home as long as I can (even choosing to study at another town so I can be out all day), and I might or might not been a bitch when I see her, because the guy is always there, and I remember I don't feel safe at my own house. I already talked to her about this and she threw a lot of shade at me, like \"why do you mind? you don't even stay home anymore\". I told her I'm planning to move out if the guy actually stays, and she was devastated. Maybe I am being an asshole, but I don't know where and what I can do about it. \ntldr: After years of abuse marriage, mom calls tinder date she has know for 5 months to live with us and I'm pissed.",

My cat got out of the house about 3 weeks ago and while we searched everywhere for her and tried every possible idea, it is likely she has died. She was my first pet and my home still doesn't feel the same without her.  I teared up when I saw the cat my boyfriend was considering, she reminded me of my own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would be completely on board this black cat had it been slightly different in size or male instead, even that exact cat had some more time passed. He argued that focusing on another pet would help me move on. I told him I wasn't comfortable replacing my cat with an identical one rather quickly, and would prefer if he chose a different animal.  He accepted my request, but has brought it up a few times, he would go get her immediately if I agreed. I feel bad for rejecting the one cat he attached with, am I overreacting here? AITA for getting in the way of adopting a pet he really liked?",

      "description": "So I [21m] have been friends with her [21f] for three years and we've been living together for two. We share a lot. I could give a pretty graphic description of her vomit from a couple days ago because she told me without my asking. There are a few things she's told me about her childhood that even still she keeps secret from her own brother, whom she is generally pretty close with. I also know the play-by-play for just about every date she's been on since we met, and she knows almost as much about mine. I more or less consider her my closest friend.\n\nAnyway she started acting very suspiciously, sneaking around a lot to go see some unnamed guy and then lying to my face about it without my even asking (to be clear, I don't tend to ask about things she doesn't want to tell me because it's not my business, but in these instances she simply volunteered false information), having never lied to me about anything before. This was the first time she'd been on more than one date with the same person. There were also quite a few red flags that it was not a healthy relationship (not the least of which was uncharacteristically trying to hide it).\n\nOur other roommate [21f] (who introduced us, has known her for 4 years/me for 7, and is generally closer to her than I am) and I got worried about her because she was making career-altering decisions over this relationship that she couldn't even admit to us existed, so we put our heads together and realized that between the things she'd said to the two of us, there was only one person [32m] she could possibly be seeing and there's a fairly substantial pile of reasons he's bad for her that I won't go into here unless someone thinks it's relevant because this isn't an advice-seeking thread.\n\nMy initial response was that if she's really thought this through and it's what she wants then we just have to let her make her own mistakes, but we didn't think she *had* thought it through because the reasons it's a bad idea are so elephant-in-the-room obvious. I wanted her to know that we know what's going on, that we think she's making a huge mistake, and that if she thinks we're wrong we won't try to stop her but we will be waiting with a metaphorical broom to pick up the pieces... but we had no idea how to even broach the subject, so I took to the internet for advice on what to say.\n\nThe first fifteen or so responses that came in unanimously said I was a bad person for giving it a second thought. \"Who died and made you the Iranian morality police?\" \"You should kill yourself so you can stop being a worthless piece of shit.\" \"What makes you think you have the right to give a fuck?\" \"Mind your business and stop being such a self-righteous cunt.\" At that point I deleted the thread. Ordinarily I'd just brush it off as strangers on the internet being dicks, but the fact that literally every response in a community that I usually see trying to be genuinely helpful kinda makes me wonder if they had a point... Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I'm pretty freaking bummed about this because I have a good job that's easy, walking distance of my apartment and has a union. I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. \n\nI am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. \n\nAs I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. \n\nBefore people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. \n\nNot five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the \"customer is always\" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. \n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n\n",

      "description": "I will try and be as impartial as possible, as I am aware of how biases can come across. I want honest opinions, not just people taking my side because I'm the one telling the story.\n\nThis just happened. My girlfriend (20f) and I (22m) of 11 months, going on 1 year, were at a formal (aka, prom for americans). Everything was fine, she was looking amazing, I was proud to be her date, we both seemed to be having a good time. This was her formal, so all the people we were with were her friends primarily: I'm not uncomfortable with them, but I wouldn't call them close. They're good people.\n\nAfter the formal, there was an afterparty at a local nightclub. We go, and we don't really dance apart from being in our seats, especially since she was in high heels. She had said to me that she was tired, and wanted to leave. I hadn't really got up and danced with her, since she was in heels, and she had said about being tired. Any time I tried to dance while sitting with her, she would mock my style, and laugh at me. I'm not a good dancer, but I'm also not terrible - I'm no worse than any other amateur. Her poking fun at me everytime I try with her certainly doesn't help with my confidence, and being comfortable around her. One of her friends (a guy) had asked me to get him a drink, since he didn't have card, and I obliged. This upset her, saying that I ignored her telling me to say no, saying I didn't listen to her saying she wanted to leave. The friend had said that she needs a drink, to loosen up and go dance with the rest of her friends. Instead she sat in the corner with me, and knowing that I had upset her I just felt bad and didn't talk much. I had thought she didn't want to dance.\n\nAfter she gets upset with me, she says I caused the arguement, and she says I ruin everything for her. She says a series of really hurtful things to me, like saying this is why she never invites me out with her, how I'm the most boring person she knows, and how she knows people who have OD'd over 40 times that have more passion for life than I do. This is all especially confusing because she was giving her numerous signals she didn't want to dance.\n\nAm I the asshole? Did I really ruin her night by being too nervous to dance? Did I ruin her night by getting her friend a drink when she said not to?",

      "description": "Ok so a bit of backstory. I've known this person since we were about 4 years old. Went through nursery, primary and secondary school together.\nThey were born a female but identify as a male so I'll refer to him as he. He is very selfish and thinks the world owes him a favour. The only job he's ever had, he left. He's been to 3 separate college courses, quitting each one because \"the lecturer hates him and failed him on purpose or he was being bullied\"\nThe real story is he didn't study, do any of the work or show up most days and people turned on him because he caused drama. So he doesn't work because, and I quote \" I'm quite happy not working right now, I'm happy just existing\"\nHe lived with his gran and used her money to buy weed. Just a general waster.\n\nSo he's never been a particularly good friend to me. Bullied me in our younger years and now I feel pretty stupid for having given him another chance. He's stolen from me, lied about me, caused issues in my family and called me every name under the sun because I wuldnt give him money. (Money I work for)\n\nSo the main story happened a few months ago. I work in a small supermarket that also sells a few video games. Just new releases and bestsellers. So he wanted this new game and it was still at full price. ( He had a tantrum and cried because his mum couldn't afford to give him the money for it. He said she was ruining his life...he's 24)\nHe walked me to work on this day so he could get the game and bought it even though he knew it might not work due to the disc drive on his ps4 not reading discs sometimes. He took the risk. So all was good and I started my shift. \nLater on I got about 8 messages from him along the lines of \"It's not working can I return it?\". *sigh*. Then this one \"in going to try and return it as faulty. Sorry has to be done\" \nI was pretty livid as the error was his ps4 not the game. He was saying there was a scratch on it. If there WAS, he was the one that put it there. \n As I'm speaking to my co worker at the returns desk he shows up and asks for the refund 🙄 . My manager explains that we can't give a refund but we can exchange the game for another copy. He's not happy cause he knows the game works fine. And another copy wpuld just be the same. He also said it was showing up \"corrupted data\".I say there can't be anything wrong with it and he flips out with me and storms out. I got a few abusive messages and kore of his usual behaviour. He basically admitted In a message he was just saying that to get his money back and somehow I'm the bad guy? I'm blocked on all social media and we don't talk now.",

He said that his game wasn't the reason why I woke up, and told me that he could hear me. I have infected tonsils and my doctor told me to get plenty of rest. At this time, my rest is pretty vital to college (I had mono and was out for a week. Don't want it \\*ever\\* again.) 16 hours later, I hear him bang on his desk multiple times (like the Hulk),  yelling about hitboxes right as I'm doing my homework. This isn't new, he's been yelling over a game at night while I'm studying, doing homework, and even trying to go to sleep. My response was always \"Calm down.\" At this rate, telling him that isn't worth it. Recently, I found I can control my router's time for certain devices connected to it. The question is: WIBTA for limiting his access on my router?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - roommate is toxic and loud over CSGO, thinking about limiting his access through my router so I can focus on studies and/or get decent sleep.",

Aside from that, the mom likes to change the kitchen set-up every day(so before I go to work in the morning I spend half an hour just to find my coffee and a mug.)\n\nThe dad just lies on the couch all day (and all night btw). And I have to defend myself when I want to play a video-game because the dad calls me an addict anytime I pick up a controller. \n\nThe mom is constantly speaking really loudly and is questioning everything we do, and I mean everything (\"Why do you put your underwear in that drawer!?\"). We have no privacy and even our bedroom isn't safe from their constant presence and scrutiny.\n\nThe thing is, my so's parents live abroad and we don't get to see them very often so we are understandably happy to see them.

Odd-number room houses are a little trickier to find, and so we have been recommended to look for a 6-bedroom and either absorb the cost of the extra room or find an extra housemate.   \n\nOne of the girls has a boyfriend, aged 21, and they’ve been together around a year. He goes to a different university but in the same city - she really wants him to take the 6th bedroom.  \n\nHowever, none of us have met him - we obviously can’t ‘vet’ him like other potential housemates if we advertised a spare room. I’m also thinking about what a mess it would be if they broke up and he had to move out - we have to sign contracts with the landlord and it may make finding a new housemate difficult in the event of him moving out.   \n\nI’ve spoken to the group and pointed this out, the other girls were subtly agreeing with me but the girl with the boyfriend seemed almost offended.

      "description": "Backstory: I work at a chain pet store, our policy with goldfish (feeder goldfish) is that if you are not buying them to feed to another animal and want to keep them as a pet, you must have a fish tank big enough. My store policy also states that if I feel like an animal (or fish) wont go to a good home, I am not required to sell it. My managers typically always back me up with this.\n\nM: Me\n\nC: Customer\n\nOkay, onto the conversation that follows:\n\nM: Hello sir, can I help you today?\n\nC: Yes I'd like 5 small goldfish.\n\nM: Oh cool, what are you feeding them to?\n\nC : I'm not feeding them to anything, they're going in an 18 gallon tank.\n\n(I'm technically only allowed to sell them if they're going into a 29 gallon tank. On top of that, I'm only allowed to sell an inch of fish per gallon. So if our gold fish get up to 11\" then I'm only allowed to sell you 1, maybe 2 at the most)\n\nM: Oh sorry sir, I can't do 5 in a tank that small. My store policy states... (I explain it to him)\n\nC: I don't give a F\\*\\*\\* about store policy its retarded, and you can mind your F\\*\\*\\*ing business about what I put in my tank.\n\nAt this point in time he was getting up in my face, but I tried to remain calm. I explained our store policy and told him I'd sell him 3 at the most. He proceeded to berate me in front of a co-worker when I finally snapped.\n\nM: If you don't like my stores retarded f\\*\\*\\*ing policy you can go shop somewhere else.\n\nI finished bagging the fish and left him before he could ask me anything else. I'm unsure if he complained to management, my co-worker said he'd back me up if I received a bad VOC. \n\nI was talking to a friend and they told me I was the asshole, and maybe should have stfu and just bagged him his fish and that I shouldn't have made such a big deal about the stupid fish. I've asked a couple other people about this and they're split about 50/50. Is the customer always right, or do I have the right to stand up for myself? ",

      "description": "Throwaway because he's on reddit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to get into the specific politics we were discussing because I feel like that's just an entire rabbit hole that isn't really relevant.\n\nI have a friend. We've been friends for a few years. Every time politics is brought up (usually by him), it ends in frustration and I end up feeling generally unhappy. See, we both have very different political views, and we're both very set on our views. It doesn't seem like there's any point in arguing them, because neither of us are going to ever change the others mind. In one specific incident in August he even went so far as to say my opinions are \"uninformed\" and he wants to \"see how much I'll hold onto them\" by bombarding me with various news articles and long texts. \n\nI waited, cooled off, and sent him a text saying I was hurt by what he said and don't appreciate being spoken to like that. He apologized, and I thought it would be the end of him bringing politics up with me. Since then when he would send me things politically charged I would ignore them or change the subject. \n\nWhich is exactly what I should've done yesterday. \n\nI made a post on facebook concerning recent events. Again, not going into specifics - I don't think they're relevant. He sent me a text in response to that, going off on how no one cares about xyz because zyx and all of my responses were very short and, I felt, conveyed how much I didn't want to talk about it with him. He kept pushing, so finally I sent a long response of how I felt on the situation. I'll admit, I was upset with him for pushing it, and my response wasn't very nice. I ended with \"I'm at work, I'm putting you on mute, peace.\"\n\nWithin the texts he'd sent me earlier, he kept saying that if I was going to make posts that are politically charged then I should be ready for someone to challenge me. Which I get it. But I just feel like with the history of fights we've had talking politics, I thought it would be fair to expect not to get a response from him. \n\nHis response to my last message included saying I always \"conveniently\" bow out of conversations which is what \"people do when they know they're wrong\". \n\nI haven't responded since last night. I want to tell him that I think for the sake of our friendship we should not, in any context, discuss politics. WIBTA for doing so?

      "title": "AITA for uninviting my girlfriend to Vegas?",
      "description": "Over a year ago, my friends and I were planning a trip to Vegas. One friend, Adam, really wanted to go to Vegas, and was the one who initiated the idea and the trip planning in the first place. Adam also lived out of state, so he couldn't see the rest of us on a frequent basis. Our lives were all really busy, but we finally agreed on an autumn weekend we could all go out. At first, the trip started with bringing our SOs as well. We all pitched the idea and the date to our SOs to see if they were interested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I pitched the idea to my girlfriend, she was really excited to go, but was pretty apprehensive about going with a group. Because of my work, we didn't get to see each other often, and she made side remarks about how we had to go with other people. She was also still in school, so she had a limited window where she could go. The weekend we chose happened to be a weekend she had a couple extra days off school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI discussed with the rest of my friends, and most of their significant others couldn't go. Only one said that she could, and she was on the fence about going. Shortly after this, we received news that Adam, the one who had planned this trip, had a scheduling conflict of meeting his girlfriend's parents for the first time, which he'd forgotten about when we'd first discussed. He could do any other weekend around that one, but the only one we could all agree on was one weekend past. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked my girlfriend if she could move the trip back one weekend. She refused, saying that this was the only weekend that would work for her, and she'd be too busy with school and test prep the following weekend. She also stated she fully expected to spend her extra days off with me, and would be pissed if she wasn't able to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I was stuck in between a rock and a hard place, but I had a few options. I could try to tell Adam he couldn't go (despite him planning the trip), and force it to be on a weekend my girlfriend could attend. I could tell my girlfriend she couldn't go, subsequently turning it into a guys trip, since the other girlfriend who could attend wasn't that interested. Or I could just stand in solidarity with my girlfriend and refuse to go to Vegas all together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI chose to turn it into a guys trip. But, to compromise, I promised to take my girlfriend on a romantic, 2-person getaway to Chicago instead. We had both wanted to visit Chicago for a while, and it seemed like the perfect weekend to do it. She agreed to go on the Chicago trip, but she wasn't pleased at all about being excluded from the Vegas trip without having a say in the matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend and I had a wonderful trip to Chicago, and the guys had a great weekend in Vegas (no strippers or promiscuous activities, I promise).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since then and over a year later, we still have arguments about this trip. My side of things, as I said above, was that hardly any other girls could go, the whole trip was Adam's idea, and I substituted in a romantic getaway instead of hanging out with a bunch of guys in Vegas. She didn't know many of the guys at the time. I also don't feel bad about the decision I made, because I feel I found a solution to make both parties happy, and I didn't create the scheduling problem in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer side is that I uninvited her without asking her opinion or including her in the decision to make it a guys trip, that taking her to Chicago does not excuse removing her from the Vegas trip, and that I chose my friends over her. It would have been both our first times to Vegas, so she also feels I took a beautiful first experience away from us, and shared it with other people. She's also unhappy that I still don't feel bad about the decisions I made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've since taken her to Vegas with a group, if that matters at all. Also, to be clear, I was the one who suggested making it a guys trip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I The Asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Invited GF to Vegas, then uninvited her when the trip planner changed the weekend. Took her to Chicago as an apology but still went on the Vegas trip.",

Who married who, and how it all went down etc. I was really excited by this new information, because I felt like I was able to get closer to another part of my family  background that I didn’t know about. \n   \n   As we finish talking, she tells me that it doesn’t seem like I’m  proud to be black, and that I feel like I am better than her for being mixed( she’s black).

I told her she can think what she likes but I feel like she's being pretty irrational and shouldn't have given back the things. I get she was hurt, yadda yadda, but I feel like that was a petty and impulsive move on her part cause she did it to \"symbolize the love I threw away\" (I ended things for good reason). \n\nI'm curious as to what your opinions are.

      "description": "I hope this doesn’t come across as a post looking for validation if my actions were inappropriate, I’m genuinely curious if I went about things the wrong way.\n\nMy boyfriend told me last week about a friend and coworker of his whose dog got badly injured and would be needing a costly surgery totaling over 3k. He mentioned that everyone at his job was putting money together to give her. They are all just bartenders and so is she so I understand that they are not in a place to each donate large sums of money and I understand that she will most likely struggle to pay off such an expensive surgery. I’m a huge animal lover and I know the pain of worrying over a sick pet. I decided I wanted to get a card for her and give her $100. It’s not a huge dent in the bill but I assume every penny counts.\n\nI brought it to my boyfriend and asked if he would give it to her. He said he would give it to her but only if I put his name on it. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable with that, since it was a gesture I wanted to make, and he had already donated money for the group card.\n\nAfter I told him I wouldn’t put his name on it, he said it would be weird to give her money since I had only met her once. He also claimed it would look like I was trying to one up everyone by giving one card with my money and my name on it when everyone had already given her a pooled sum of money and a group card.\n\nHe ended up telling me I just shouldn’t do it. This made me very sad and uneasy. I feel like I was trying to do a good thing. \n\nAITA in this situation? I know my motives aren’t wrong but would this looks asshole-ish from her perspective?",

But I still feel like TA. Help me out here:\n\nWe went out to a family friendly restaurant with our two children, relatively early in the evening. The restaurant wasn’t full, and the kids were hungry. \n\nAfter being seated, no waiters appeared. We waited 10 minutes, then flagged a passing waitress. She promised someone was coming. Ten more minutes pass, no one comes. Meanwhile, the tables around us are being served. We try again, and see two waitresses arguing over who should get our table. Finally, 35 (!!) minutes after coming in, someone comes to take our order. By this point, the kids are super hungry and we know the food still has to be prepared.\n\nOnce the food comes, things don’t get much better: the waitress brings the wrong order to the table, then brings out a replacement, except it’s still wrong (standard dish off the menu with no changes). During the meal, we can’t find the waitress at all, even though we were desperate for water. We have to wait 15 minutes after we’re done just to find the waitress to ask for the check. It takes her 10 more minutes to get it, except it’s another table’s check. We then wait 10 more minutes for our check to come, at which point we’re frustrated enough not to tip. \n\nThe waitress asked why we hadn’t told her we were unhappy and all I could think was “because you were nowhere to be found”.\n\nA meal that should have taken 45min took 2 hours, but the extra time was all spent waiting for the waitress. \n\nIn this situation, are we TA for not tipping?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I recently moved into an apartment in Manhattan, and it is fairly smaller than our last place. So we've been finding various ways to get rid of a lot of our stuff, and one of the larger items we have is a big box of art supplies. As much as we'd like to sell it, there's a lot to go through and it would be a lot of time and stress to sell. So we took some photos and put the whole thing up for free on Craigslist.\n\nNow, I have some experience with Craigslist people. Craigslist is one of the best ways to find the biggest idiots in your area. With this knowledge and the experience that I have from years of selling/giving away on Craigslist, we tried to make the posting as clear as possible. At the top, middle, and end of the ad we wrote, in all caps, \"YOU WILL NEED A VEHICLE AND SOMEONE TO HELP MOVE THIS BOX, DO NOT SHOW UP ALONE.\" I don't remember the words exactly, but it definitely covered the basis of needing a vehicle, additional helping hands, it's a big heavy box. We wrote it three times in all caps to make sure everyone sees it.\n\nOne of the first people to say they can pick it up headed down from the Bronx so it took a little over an hour. We exchanged a few texts just confirming that they are on their way and when they would arrive. I've transcribed the texts we exchanged when they arrived:\n\n&gt;Them: Hi am here is there anyway you can come to the lobby I can't turn off my car the battery keep dieing\n&gt;\n&gt;Me: No. It's a large box and I can't carry it. The ad said you need to bring help.\n&gt;\n&gt;Them: Ok I'm at the door\n&gt;\n&gt;Me: Did you bring help?\n&gt;\n&gt;Them: My daughter is pregnant?\n&gt;\n&gt;Me: It's a walkup. If you want, I can leave it in the stairwell and you can take it down in multiple trips\n&gt;\n&gt;Them: SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS I WILL REPORT YOU ON CRAIGLIST YOU SCAMMER I SHOULD CALL POLICE DONT SET PEOPLE UP BECAUSE WILL KICK YOUR ASS\n\n\nClearly she was acting like a manic at the end there, but I talked to some people about this and it didn't seem as black and white to them as it is to me, so I'm curious what you all think.",

      "description": "So, for context, on Wednesdays at our school, we have this thing called 8th hour. School lets out 1 hour early, and we have about 1 hour until buses arrive. That one hour is called 8th hour and we can use it to do homework, basically do whatever.\n\nIn the morning, my friend asks me if he can play Smash Ultimate against me in the morning(I usually see him in the orchestra room every morning). I said yes, but I got there late and wasn't able to. So I just told him I could play during 8th hour.\n\nSo, come 8th hour, and it seems like there's a mock recital for the Solo and Ensemble performers going on in the orchestra room. Friend is still there. The orchestra teacher is giving tips on everything the performers need to fix, etc. So, I was wondering if I could still play on my Switch if this was going on? I saw multiple people on their phones and there were some people talking as well. So, I decided, if I turned the volume down and didn't talk loudly, it would be fine. So, I start the game. We played through one performance. It didn't seem like we had affected the performance in any way, and the orchestra teacher didn't notice as well. No one had called it out either, so I thought we were in the clear. But cue halfway through the second performance(we still hadn't said a word), teacher sees it, gets mad, and confiscates my Switch until the end of 8th hour, meaning I couldn't leave either. I still don't get why it was a major issue, because it had already been about 10 minutes of playing before she confiscated the Switch, and we didn't make any noise, and neither did the Switch. Not only that, she seemed to be okay with people being on their phones. But, I can see where I'd be in the wrong. So, AITA?",

This colleague has a fiancé, who works for the same company as well, and they have a two year old together. After she left the company, my ex confided in me about everything for some reason. He said he was feeling pretty upset as she claimed to have split up with her fiancé in the midst of their affair and promised to be with him, but also said they must continue seeing eachother in secret as she and the fiancé are still \"pretending\" to be together until they can get their own places, but then ghosted him once she moved companies, and had never actually split from her fiancé. I didn't feel very sympathetic, to say the least, but I digress.\n\nI was sceptical at first, but when looking back, everything made sense. Me and her were actually pretty close and were friends before, and I confided in her a lot about some personal things, but my ex always wound up knowing everything I'd told her. One time I told her about a time my ex slept with prostitutes, and for the rest of the day she was crying and arguing on the phone outside but I couldn't hear what was being said, and at the time I thought she was arguing with her fiancé, but of course later I found out that she was angry with my ex because he never told her about the prostitutes and she felt she'd been exposed to catching diseases. My manager at the time also commented on how close the two had gotten, even though for the three years prior to this, they had claimed to hate each other, and she said she had seen them texting and calling each other a lot, which the girl would always act secretive about and sneak outside or turn her phone over to hide notifications.\n\nAnyway, I have since moved workplaces but within the same company. All of this happened sometime between April and July last year. I've always got on well with the girl's fiancé, but could never face telling him. I thought it would make things awkward at work seeing as he is colleagues with the guy his fiancée had an affair with, plus they get on like a house on fire (which makes me feel sick and guilty when I see my ex and him together). I don't have proof either, just my ex's word/how everything adds up based on what he told me, and the messages he showed me on his phone. I always felt that the fiancé may not believe me, and then I would be seen as an instigator/shit-stirrer, and he could raise a grievance. Also, I was not part of this affair and I wasn't with my ex at the time (although at times I have wondered if this started before we split up, since he had cheated on me before, but I have no proof of this), so it kind of feels like it's not my place to say anything.\n\nAlso, the girl's mum works for the same company as well (yeah, everyone's kinda related it seems) and she is like a work mum to me even though we are currently based at two different locations. That extra complicates things. I basically feel like I would be labelled as the meddling bitch and it would ruin all my work relationships. To make matters worse, the girl started making bizarre accusations a few months back that I was spreading rumours about her cheating and sleeping around and all sorts and also gossiping about what her and her fiancée get up to. I hadn't mentioned anything to anyone and kept myself to myself, but it feels like she's onto me knowing about it all (I did stop talking to her altogether after I found out, even though we were friends). It seems she has tried to put it in people's heads that I am crazy and have something against her before I'd even have the chance to tell anyone.\n\nHowever, if I was in the fiancé's position, I would definitely want to know. I would also feel betrayed if someone I got on with knew all along and never bothered to tell me. This is the bit that makes me feel like a massive asshole, regardless of everything else. So I guess I want to know once and for all if I am actually an asshole, at least according to Reddit.\n\nTl;dr: after we split up, my ex was sleeping with a colleague who is engaged to another colleague, I used to be friends with the cheater and do get on very well with her fiancé, but never told him because I can't prove it to him, I don't want to complicate things at work and also feel it's not my place as it didn't involve me. But, I still feel like a massive asshole (because what if roles were reversed etc?)",

      "description": "I won't say what show I was at but we had floor seats in the very back row. They were $80 dollar tickets.\n\nI'm a pretty tall girl, so I can usually step on my toes or move over a little to get a line of sight to the stage. I still have to look through the heads of the very tall men ahead of me but it's floor seats...I pretty much expect that to be the experience.\n\nA rather short girl and her boyfriend took their seats ahead of us and when the music started, I saw her craning her neck to get a view. I'm thinking \"damn that sucks, being short is the worst.\"\n\nShe proceeds to get up in the seat and lean over her boyfriend's shoulders. She asks the guy next to me if it's ok, he says yes, but she doesn't ask me.\n\nNow half the stage is blocked from my line of vision by her ass. Normally, not a problem, but in this case I'm here to see the band, not her ass, and I'm stunned that she didn't ask me if I minded since I would've told her \"yes, I do actually.\" She seemed like a perfectly normal, likeable girl wanting to have fun. But in that moment I just looked at my husband and said \"seriously?\"\n\nA security guard happened to be walking by at that point while I was wrestling with wether to poke her and say something. So I got his attention, pointed at her. He nodded, had her get down, then walked by and I said \"thanks.\"\n\nShe saw me tell him thank you and I'm assuming put two and two together. \n\nI proceeded to enjoy the show, full of heads in my vision but no butts. She proceeded to feel up on her boyfriend while glaring at me. \n\nSo while I don't think I'm the asshole for not wanting her to stand up in the chair right in front of me, I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for not asking her personally to get down. Maybe she would've said sorry and been fine with it. Maybe she would've gotten down and still think I'm a tall bitch with no empathy.\n\nI'm thinking it's not my obligation to spend all that money and open up a conflict and the security guard was doing his job. \n\nMaybe it's like the countless home owner association things where the person is a dick for not handling it themselves. \n\nI just wanted to watch the show and not delve into drama.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "There's this girl I used to be friends with. We met halfway through our freshman year of college, and had been friends up until the beginning of our sophomore year. We had a falling our when I finally snapped at her because she kept subtly calling me stupid and trying to one up me all the time. \n\nOne example is when we got on the topic of scholarships. My sister had just gotten a 5k/sem scholarship, and I was telling my friend, lets call her Alice, about how awesome it was and that my sister beat me in our little bet on who could get the bigger scholarship (mine is only 3k/semester). Alice then turned the conversation to her scholarship (which is a full ride) and followed it up with \"but don't feel bad that you barely got any money, some people just aren't college material\". She knows that I study hard at college, never miss a class, and got my scholarship because of my ACT score (28), but she still tries to subtly convince me I'm not meant to be at our uni. \n\nAnyways, while we were friends Alice would never take school seriously. She would constantly skip class and pay other people to bring her clicker. We shared a calc class together where missing even 2 classes worth of clicker points could ruin your grade, and she almost never showed up, but still managed to get good grades by using chegg for homework, using the tutoring center before an exam to cram all the stuff she missed, and by, like I said, paying people to click in for her.\n\nFor one of our general studies classes, we had to take an online final exam where it was monitored through your computers webcam, and the usage of notes would result in a zero. Alice wrote notes on sticky notes and put them around her computer screen. She got a 93%, and ruined the curve for the whole class (class average was a 72). Her cheating isn't just about her, now it had effected all 180 of us in that course.\n\nNow, I happen to have documentation (texts, snapchats, videos) that's more than enough proof of academic dishonesty on her part. I even have a snapchat she sent me from right before her final exam with all her notes around her computer. There are so many people that could have used the scholarship and would love to be at college and take education seriously. WIBTA if I send all my proof to the dean of students and possibly result in Alice's scholarship being lost, credits dissolved, and possible expulsion.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend to stop talking to a girl?",
      "description": "So me (20M) and my girlfriend (21F) have been together for about 8 months. I knew since the beggining or our relationship that she is attracted to girls, which I didn’t really mind, because it has never previously been an issue for me. To give this story some background, she was on anti-depressants for almost a year (she stopped taking them recently) and they fucked her up a bit, they have some horrible side-effects and affect your behavior. I didn’t care much because I was willing to help, I knew she needed someone to support and take care of her. Now, for the actual story... She started uni again this year and she made some friends. She also met this girl (we’ll call her Sara) which is a year ahead of her. Sara is a lesbian, she dresses like a guy and that’s pretty much all her Facebook profile shows. A few months ago my girlfriend and Sara went out to talk about uni and other stuff. My girlfriend told me parts of the discussion they had, which involved Sara encouraging my girlfriend to try MDMA, because it’s cool and similar stuff. Knowing this person could be a bad influence on my girlfriend (as she was on antidepressants, which means not even alcohol is allowed), I told her it doesn’t sound like a good idea for them to hang out too much, but she didn’t listen to me. Time passed by and I realized I was right. Sara was some kind of female fuckboy by what my girlfriend was telling me. I asked her why won’t they stop talking, which resulted in girlfriend telling me she has a crush on her. I felt pretty weird, I didn’t know how to react.. I felt jealousy and I talked with my girlfriend about this but she told me I shouldn’t worry. After some time, I think they got in an argument or something and they stopped talking. Honestly, I was happy.. Girlfriend came to me and promised she’ll listen to me from now on, told me I was right and that she won’t talk to her anymore.. Not much after, she started acting weird. She didn’t want to tell me what’s wrong at first but after a few tries, she told me she really likes Sara and that Sara broke her heart. That made me feel useless. I felt betrayed..  I felt broken as well. My girlfriend and I had all the reasons to be happy but she’s sad over some hoe. Recently, I saw they were talking again so I confronted her and asked her why would she do that. She told me she feels like talking to Sara. I have to admit I got pretty upset and felt jealous because last time she was feeling sad over some bitch and I didn’t want that to happen again. I asked her if that girl means more to her than me. She said no, and I asked her why would she do that after she got hurt by that person and I got a typical response that sounded like ‘I wanna see where this goes’.  I told her she has no respect for me as she knew it hurt me last time to see her suffer over Sara and I told her to choose between me and her, and they stopped talking. \nA few weeks later, here I am again, they started talking again and my girlfriend even told her to go out. I told her I don’t want them to talk anymore but she says “it’s a girl, it’s not the same thing”. AITA? what should I do?",

      "title": "AITA for cursing out my former high school bullies?",
      "description": "It has been 20 years since I graduated from high school. In high school, I bullied everyday by a particular group of boys. They were very tall/large, popular, and played baseball. It was the 90's and I was a kid who dressed all in black - nothing way too over the top. Some black lipstick and pretty standard black clothing. I didn't have a whole bunch of money at my disposal. (I remember being so excited when, for my sweet 16, my mom actually sprung for a very expensive pair of black doc martens. That was my big gift for the ol' milestone.)   \n\n\nAnyway, \"mean\" is an understatement to use on these guys. It wasn't just \"being mean\" - it was psychological, and at times physical, abuse. Stalking. Harassing. You name it. They did things like going through my purse and breaking my stuff and vandalizing my car. I remember once I was so sad when they'd pulled out a \"Link\" (legend of zelda) keychain and colored all over it with permanent black marker - kinda of a message because all I wore was black. It was completely ruined and a very close friend had gifted it to me. Such a small thing, but it made me very sad. Beyond that, things escalated to \"Freak\" and \"you want to suck my dick?\" every time I passed them in the hall. There was a lot of sexual harassment that eventually surfaced because I am female. The worst was when one of them left a note on my desk, after having heard a rumor that I was a lesbian (I am not a lesbian). The note read, \"Faggots like you belong locked up in cages. If you weren't a girl, I would smack you so hard that your eyes would fly to the back of your skull.\"   \n\n\nI had some close friends in high school but I definitely wasn't popular. I was a troubled teen because my 21 year old brother died my freshman year (brain cancer) so I was dealing with that on top of these bullies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway... fast forward 20 years later. I managed to never attend a high school reunion. I had absolutely no fond memories of the place. I still have close friendships with some of my good friends from that time period, however. We are friended on social media. Last week, a friend of mine sent me an invite to an upcoming reunion event. When I read the event description, 3 of the aforementioned bullies were the ones hosting. My friend justified the invite with, \"Well... obviously they've probably changed. I want to go...etc.\" So I rsvp'd \"maybe\" (with a strong likelihood of NOT going). As soon as I did that, all 3 of these guys immediately sent me a friend request. I hesitantly accepted, placed them on a restricted list, and contemplated removing them later on down the line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on, I re-read the event description and something caught my eye. They listed each of their names in the description and in parentheses beside their names, they posted the company at which they worked. One worked at a mortgage lending company. The second worked at a realty company. And the third worked in homeowner's insurance. My alarm bells went off and I began speaking to a few other friends of mine about this. \"Doesn't it seem like we might be walking into a sales pitch?\" was what I asked. Each of them agreed that it seemed very off. Then I visited all three of these guys' profiles and every update on their profiles was a sales pitch for a house, an insurance rate, or a home loan. One of them even used an insurance ad for his company as his profile photo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n And, by the way, my friends said that as soon as they rsvp'd the event, each of these dudes turbo-friended them as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... I sent a private message to these guys. I called them out on their profiles and the event description, saying it seems like this is a sales event disguised as a high school reunion. I also asked why any of them would friend me because each of them hated me when we were kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne guy responded and told me that I was crazy - that none of them hated me, that they were \"just having fun\" and they were \"just immature kids.\" Then he went on to say, \"And so what if we maybe sell something at the reunion? IF we sell our services great - if not, at least everyone can have free food and fun!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI responded back saying that everything he said about high school was the most dismissive, gaslighting pure bullshit I'd ever heard, citing that the things they did to me led me to having to seek therapy in later years. Then I basically said, \"Fuck you...\" and blocked them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI probably would not have held a grudge this long had they been sincere in really wanting to hold a reunion, but I feel like these guys are still bullies - just in a different, slimy way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for cursing them out like that? It felt really good and you could almost hear the mic drop at the end of my message. And hitting that \"block\" button was cathartic as hell. ",

She has secret intentions about everything, and has my roomie wrapped around her fingers. She's encouraged him to do things (get certain jobs, spend money) based on what she wants and not what's best for him. She also expects her friends to always support her and her opinion, whether she is right OR wrong, and you're a traitor if you don't. She expects us to be enemies of her enemies, and to always support her actions. I've tried to talk sense into my roomate but he is smitten. \n\nTHEN, she applied to work where i work, and due to job-related experiences plus knowing her as a friend, i did not try to help her get the job. She got the job anyways but was mad that i didn't put a word in. I also refuse to dislike people just because she does. \n\nSo AITA, or are there \"friendship rules\" i'm not following?",

      "description": "I have an 11x9 ceramic baking dish/casserole tray that I use fairly often when I cook. It's my only deeper bakeware (I have several baking sheets but this one is about 4 inches deep) so it's good for things like brownies or baked mac n cheese. About a year ago, my roommate at the time used it to cook something herself. This is fine, we had an agreement where we shared the different kitchenware we had brought, but everyone knew what items belonged to them. At some point while she was using it, my roommate did something that created a few large but thin cracks throughout the tray. She told me this straight up, and I told her it was okay, but asked her if she would replace it. She reluctantly agreed, but she said she didn't have the money right at that moment. I said that was fine, she could Venmo me any time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, she never paid me back. The semester ended, then she studied abroad for spring semester, and this year we don't live together anymore, and I rarely see her/talk to her, although we are still friendly. I didn't bother to hound her for the cash. The tray still worked anyway, since the cracks were hairline and I didn't use it all the time. However, the cracks are starting to get noticably bigger, and I would like to replace it. It'll probably only be $15-20 to replace, but I'm a college student who's tight on money, and while I can afford it, I wish she had just paid me back or got me a new one when it initially broke.

      "description": "Throwaway bc my mom will occasionally go on reddit and not log out of mine. This was about a week ago.\n\nTl;dr at bottom\n\nSo some context. My girlfriend lives in Germany and I live in the United States. We have been dating for about a year and a half. Anyway, so I decided to stay for her birthday. I stayed there for about 3 weeks. I left 2 days after her birthday. I did not plan on getting her anything considering this was kind of an expensive \"gift\" of my own. I didn't surprise her, this was planned months before it had even happened. So the day of her birthday, I decide to take her out to eat. We spend the whole day with each other, and then there was a party at her place. A small get together you could say, but nothing too big. As we get home and get her house ready, she asks me out of nowhere, \"Soooo, what did you get me?\" I look at her kinda perplexed. \n\nMe: \"Um, what?\" \n\nHer: \"My birthday present?\" She says laughing, but very serious.\n\nMe: \"I thought me coming to Germany for you would be a gift enough.\" I was super tempted to bring up how much the ticket was, but I know it would make me the asshole by default. \n\nHer: \"So...you didn't get me anything else?...\" Her heart dropped. Like her whole world was shattered.\n\nAfter an awkward and silent party, we argued for the better part of an hour in her room. Saying how she was under the impression I was going to get her something. Anything. She hasn't been dropping any hints at all. No \"Wow, this purse looks soooo good.\" Or any obvious signs a man would've picked up. \n\nAm I the asshole? Should I have gotten her a gift? Was I right not to? Thanks for reading. Any questions you guys have, I'll try to answer them asap. \n\nTl;dr: Went to visit my girlfriend in Germany and stayed for her birthday. Didnt get her anything because I thought me coming to visit her was already a big gift. She insists I should've got her something. I say I shouldn't have.\n\nI am on mobile so forgive me for the bad format.\n",

      "description": "I'm an 18 year old guy and I'm about to finish my first semester of college. Since about my freshman year of high school I have been in this friend group that has had a few guys come in and out of but it's mostly been Myself and 2 other guys, for their security ill call them Randy and Tyler. \n\nRandy and I have always been very good friends and we have never had any problems with each other. Tyler on the other hand would very randomly have these what we would call \"man periods\" and would be super moody, aggressive, and hostile for no real reason. However about 80% of the time he was a super relaxed guy who was genuinely a fun guy to hang out with. Over our course of high school Tyler and the friend group had a few not so small arguments but nothing that was enough to break up the group. \n\nFast forward to the summer between our Senior Year and college. Tyler had this huge road trip planned that would last 9 days and involve myself, Randy and our other friend Jerry (again, not his real name.) The first few days of the road trip went very well but Tyler was out of place for almost THE ENTIRE TRIP. We came close to just saying fuck it lets fly home several times but didn't. We finally get home and we don't really talk to Tyler at this point much anymore as we are all pretty pissed at him for his behavior and his lack of apologies. \n\nThen the first day of college hits and my friend group stays in the same area they did before high school, Except Tyler. He moves to a school about 50 miles outside of where we live to be at the dorms. He cancels his xbox live subscription because of school (This is how we talked 75% of the time.) and that was that. My friends would all be happy if he were to just slowly drift apart from us.\n\nNow for the conflict. He texts all of us a few days ago apologizing for his behavior during and leading up to the road trip, along with most of our high school experience. He explains that He had been struggling with depression throughout most of his high school experience and that was the reason he acted out so much. He says that he is in a better place out of the house now and that he would like to start hanging out more on the weekends when he is in town to visit his parents. My friends and I accepted his apology but are still actively avoiding him. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: My high school friend who has a history of acting up apologizes for past rude behavior because of depression and we still actively avoid him due to past behavior ",

Basically, my SO and I are huge Bojack Horseman fans and one night we were discussing who our favorite characters are. He said his was Mr Peanutbutter so I asked him to expand, if he saw his personality similar to his, how he feels about XYZ, etc. it was a nice discussion with him talking about his personality and how he perceives himself. \n\nThen when I said he should guess who my favorite character was, he immediately replied that he didn’t need to guess because he already knew that it was Diane. I was surprised and asked why he knew with such absolute certainty. He said “it’s because she’s Asian and you’re Asian, of course.” (I am Asian, my SO is white). I was surprised because her being Asian is not at all the main reasons why. I said “I like her because of her personality, what about her being a feminist? For being wickedly funny? For calling people out when they need to?” And he said nope, it was because she was Asian, and if she wasn’t Asian then would she still be my favorite character, probably not?  And i was annoyed, but it’s true that Diane being Asian is a nice bonus to me having some connection with her, so I left it at that. But a week later I still can’t shake this conversation because I don’t get why he stuck to his guns and announced I formed an emotional connection with a tv character just because of their Asianness. I was born here and pretty whitewashed so it’s not like I’m declaring my Asianness to everyone all the time.  Ive mostly shaken it off but it feels weird to me every time I think about it.

      "description": "So i meet with a church group a few times a month and each meeting there is a different public speaker that talks and answers questions before we break up into small groups for prayer and discussion about the points the Speaker makes.  \n\n\nThis week cops came in and talked about public saftey and whatnot, but their discussion was completely derailed because all of these ladies wouldn't shut the fuck up about the homeless population and mentioning how they fear for their safety and their childrens saftey if they are just anywhere near a homeless person in a public setting. And they kept asking the cops if it was legal to call 911 on a homeless person asleep at a park because \"It scares me that they are spending so much time at a park where children play and I fear that they might attempt to kidnap my children or follow me home\" \n\n\n\n\nAnyway, we broke up into small groups and talked about the homeless most of the time. I was biting my tongue the whole time because I am sort of an \"imposter\" in the group. Like I am not a religious person/never been baptized or anything, and I'm not even sure where I stand on God and all, but I like to keep an open mind, and i have met some awesome friends though this meeting so i keep attending. But ot got to the point where I just couldn't keep it in any longer. Some woman said something along the lines of \"You always need to be so careful anywhere you go. There are so many terrible and sick disgusting men in this world. The rec center is the worst, but certainly never let your kids go to any trailer parks even if you are having a mommy and me play date. Like if you find out your friend lives in a trailer it would be best to never go to her house. Trailer parks are just disgusting. And the rec center is even worse because theres creepy old men there and the homeless go there to shower and shave since its cheap, and they spend all of their time in the hot tubs and just wait for the perfect time to abduct a child!\" \n\n\n\nAnd I shit you not. There was numerous stories about how the homeless were so scary and its just best if you never make eye contact and just bassically pretend they don't even exist.... \n\n\n\nThis is where I lost my shit. I interjected and let them know that I have spent so much time with the homeless population, and that I,myself, have actually panhandled/begged for money as well as lived out of my car when i was a young teen. I told them some personal stories and tired to show them that not ALL homeless people are looking for an easy way to support a drinking/drug habit, and I even encouraged them that it is totally possible to talk to a homeless person and not magically get abducted. But i certainly let them know that the gross judgement they were making was not only sickning, but also extremely non-christian. \n\n\n\nThey immediately changed the topic but i could still sense the tension, so AITA for sharing my opinion/experience when I was so pissed off that a group of women could be so judgemental?

      "description": "Yesterday I had a couple games, and I had asked my boyfriend throughout the week to make sure he could come. We’re both almost done with high school and have been together for a year. He had plans with a childhood friend, who happens to be a girl, to go out on Thursday and then hangout at her house. \n\nFor some reason she couldn’t go through with it on Thursday so they decided to go on Saturday instead. Because of this, he missed my tournament. Now, I’m pretty easy going and not really the jealous type so I would have been okay with them hanging out (for the most part; I know her through him and I trust the both of them).  Anyways this is one of my last tournaments ever, because I love my sport but I feel once I get to college I’ll need to focus on education and won’t have time for practices. I still have one or two more, but a) he didn’t ask me if I’d be okay with them basically going on a date b) I kept saying how important it was to me for him to be there for me, and c) he could have picked any other day for them to go out. \n\nHe also told me he’d be seeing me after my games but then his family made plans and though I know I can’t be angry about that, it just made me more upset, because broken promises you know?  I brought all of this up to him (except the part about us hanging out after) and he said they’ve been friends since they were 3 and that I just like finding fault with everything he does. He says it’s hard to always think about my feelings before he does things, and I think that’s utterly ridiculous. I believe if you really love and care about someone it shouldn’t be hard to keep from hurting them. \n\nOne last thing about this girl: we went out to see her musical recently and their families go camping together frequently. It’s not like they never get to see each other. However, and I did forget about this part, she is moving across the country at the end of this year for college. Like I said though, i don’t mind them hanging out, just the way my boyfriend had it happen.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I really never thought I'd have something to post here.\nTL;DR at the end since I might as well just explain the entire event.\n\nSo, my girlfriend moved in with me almost 2 years ago. About 6 months in she kept looking at cats on her phone and asking if I wanted one. We all know how this goes.\n\nOne day, I came home and my girlfriend asked if I \"wanted to meet the baby.\"  I immediately understood she had gotten a cat, and figured it was a kitten based on her language. Now, we are an adoption ONLY household as well as immediate family. So, when I opened the door to our office and saw a fully grown, 13 pound apex hunter male cat staring back at me, I was surprised but not shocked. \n\nFast forward about a year later, and I love this cat almost as much as my dog. One night, the cat got out when I let my dog out to pee. Since he was such a healthy, predatory cat, I had no fear for his safety when I find out in the morning. UNTIL, we didn't see the cat for 48 hours including a thunderstorm.\n\nI had mentally accepted that the cat was gone or would be back in a week or two according to what I read online. \n\nIn this time, my girlfriend had posted on our neighborhood page that our cat was missing. We got a message from someone we went to highschool with (we're in our early 20's), and he said it looked a lot like his cat that got away. The name our friend gave us was exactly the adopted name the cat had when we got him. He even has a sister that still lives there. \n\nI found my cat stuck in my neighbor's perfectly stacked woodpile (square cut) 3 days later. There were pieces missing from it that fit where he was stuck at. I'll leave what I'm saying for your imagination. The police had me grab him (she wouldn't let me on her property), and told me if he gets on her property again, my cat will have to \"find its own way out.\"\n\nWhat's also crazy is that our friend lives two streets away from us, but my girlfriend purchased the cat 6 miles away during a humane society outreach program that brought him from another 9 miles away. So, it's not like we found him outside.\n\nAnyway, he obviously wanted his cat back and we told him no; it's our cat since we paid for him and have loved him as family for a year. If it had been any early before I gained feelings for the cat, I definitely would have given it to him and even felt good doing so.\n\nTL;DR\nAdopted a cat. The cat got out and our friend from highschool recognized the picture as his cat. We didn't give the cat back since we bought him and had a close bond with him for about a year.\n",

I said since the begging that I was against because I never liked those kind of tattos,either way she did it and obviously I didn't like and we had major fights because for her I had to support every single decision that she made.\n\nBut when I make a decision without her consent she freaks out and tells me that I need to do better in this relationship because I don't care about he opinions, I cannot even have my own friends without her starting to say shit about them and telling me that I should get better friends. \n\n\nNow she told me that she wants to do another anime character in the other arm, my response was that I cannot date a person that my opinion but whats me to do only what she approves. \n\nI told her that if she makes another tatto of a anime character, I'll break up with her.

      "description": "I (29m) have been dating this woman (30f) for a little under a year.  She has some issues with self-esteem but has plenty of male friends that she talks to.  A few months in to dating I asked her if she wanted to be official and she said she wasn't ready to be my girlfriend, which I took to mean she wasn't ready to be exclusive.  I didn't date anyone else this whole time, waiting for her to be ready, but I assumed she was seeing other guys as she would mention her tinder matches and snap stories of her with other guys alone.  One night this past week she sends me a picture of her text message page which has my picture/messages and a few other men as well.  However in the message my portion is cut off and all I see is a bunch of other men she's texting.  I was confused and asked \"What is this supposed to prove, all the other guys you're dating?\"  She then explains that I'm part of the picture, I open the picture and see this is true and apologize.  She says that I cut her too deep and just wants to be friends now because I thought she was dating other people.  AITA for thinking that she was seeing other men?",

She is 37 weeks pregnant right now. \n\n\nWe bought the house from my father and are currently renovating and cleaning it. He's still living here for another 2 years as part of the agreement. It's been his house since it was built in 1992. He's been the sole owner since that time up until recently. \n\n\nMy wife is with maternity leave and making sure everything is ready for our baby. I go to school and work after. I'm only home in the evenings. She's been cleaning the entire house. She constantly complains to me that there's black mold everywhere and things haven't been cleaned for what looks like years. \n\n\nI asked my dad a few times when the last time he cleaned certains items was. He said he didn't clean the top level of the house EVER. Certain other things too such as window frames and doors. There's mold literally on every window frame. \n\n\nToday, I come home to find my 37 weeks pregnant wife on her knees scrubbing the house. She's in pain and complaining about the mold. My father however is only interested in where his newspaper is. Turns out my wife used it to paint something on. He is pissy about it.\n\n\nSo I tell him how she's on her knees cleaning the shit he never did and that he can stick the newspaper up his ass. I go off about how he let mold grow for 25 years and never once lifted a finger to clean it, and now my wife has to do it and he just watches her and doesn't try to help at all. I find him very disrespectful and I lost my temper. I shouldn't have yelled or said the things I did but I don't know if I'm in the wrong here. \n\nAITA for being pissed? ",

      "description": "Me and my friend live in the countryside of Thailand for work. We both make only enough to eat, live, and go out sometimes as this is purely for gaining international experience, so we try to pay for things as minimal as possible. In Thailand, whenever we go to Bangkok, we use a ride hailing app to call rickshaws as they are cheaper than the local ones (I would be paying for the local ones if I wasn't so poor). For example, instead of paying $3 for a ride, I would be paying $1. A smartphone is needed to use these apps of course. My phone recently broke and gave it to a repair shop for it to fix, so for the day, I relied on my friend to call the rickshaws for us. However, we also have a \"work\" phone which is a small phone and I carried it in my backpack for emergencies. For the weekend in Bangkok, we were staying at different hostels.\n\nFast forward to us hanging out at a cafe at the mall with our laptops, my friend decided to go back to the countryside a day earlier, so he decided to order a rickshaw using the ride hailing app to take him to the bus station. I asked my friend to order a rickshaw on the ride hailing app for me once he arrives to the bus station and for it to take me to my hostel, which is a 30 minute walk, and he says okay. Once he arrived at the bus station, he messages me on Facebook messenger and tells me that he ordered a rickshaw to the front of the mall. I pack my laptop quickly and run to the front of the mall to look for the rickshaw. In front of the mall, there are tons of people ordering rickshaws as well using the app, so I have to ask each one individually if it's for my friends name. I take out my work phone from my backpack because I want to call my friend and ask him where it's at and what color is it. I see 2 missed calls from him a minute ago, meaning he called me while I was running to the front of the mall and I didn't hear it. I decide to call him back as I am looking for my rickshaw. He doesn't pick up, so I call at least 10 times. Unable to find my rickshaw, I continue to call, but no answer. I go back into the mall because I couldn't find the rickshaw and continue to call him, but he doesn't pick up. I get so mad that he's not picking up my calls and walk back to my hostel in the blistering heat. Once I get WiFi at my hostel, I hop onto Facebook messenger and message him saying he's the most unreliable friend ever. I drop F-Bombs in the heat of the moment of having to walk back in the blistering heat. He says he called me, but I didn't pick up (the two times when I was running towards the front of the mall). He also says that he saw on the ride-hailing app that I was picked up and in transit to my destination, so assumed that I was fine. I yell at him with F-Bombs saying that the 20 missed calls did not spark a sign that I was not fine? He says that he only got 1 missed call from me. I then say that he shouldn't at least called me back asking if I got on and if I was fine while dropping some F-Bombs again. I dropped a lot of F-Bombs because I was really really really mad that I walked back to my hostel in the blistering heat and how he didn't pick up my phone calls once. (he has a history of not picking up my calls when I try to call him, but messages me fairly quickly for some reason). He then says how I should not be speaking to him like that He says he tried to help me and it's my fault that I didn't pick my my phone and I should never contact him again (for the way I spoke). I then respond with okay fine, good riddance.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole? Are we both assholes? Are we making a big deal out of nothing?",

      "description": "Lemme start off by saying that I’m not a materialistic person. My bf and I have been together for 4 years, and for most of it, I’ve been the one to pay for everything. We don’t really get each other Christmas, anniversary, or Valentine’s Day presents. \nHe recently got a job, so this year he insisted that we actually buy eachother presents for Vday. I went all out, and he kept saying he felt bad cause my present was gonna be a week late cause he was gonna get a lot of stuff for me and needed to have money for it. \nYeah well, a month has passed. Every week he keeps saying “oh shit I’ve gotta order your present” and keeps complaining that he won’t have much money because “I’ve gotta order your present”. It’s to the point where he told me what it is. Ruined the surprise entirely. \n\nIt’s just kinda lost the value at this point. The whole point was that it was a present he WANTS to get me for VALENTINES DAY. Vday was a month ago and he keeps acting like it’s SUCH a drag to have to get me something. \nI don’t even want it at this point. I kinda liked the surprise aspect. One of the items is a sweater and spring is already coming pretty soon so....\n\nMy feelings are just kinda hurt cause I don’t understand why he didn’t wanna get me something nice. He kept talking it up and now keeps acting like it’s a bother. I put so much thought into his gifts. I didn’t even wanna do presents this year but he insisted. Now it just feels like I put a lot of money and heart into it and wasn’t really given any thought in return. \nThis was the first time in a while that we were gonna get eachother nice gifts. \n\nAITA for being hurt and kinda angry that he didn’t follow through??",

He’s wanted one for years. \n\n2) they literally just had a baby in November and were asking us for money for diapers and formula just two weeks ago. But they had enough for a $400 game system?\n\nI called her out on it and she called me a bitch but I’m still feeling like I had a right to call her out when she tried to make me feel like what I had gotten my husband wasn’t special because she had done it on Christmas. Now she’s mad at me for calling out her parenting skills. \n\nShe is 20, he is 26. \n\nI am 24, husband is now 26. We have and will always have 0 children. If any of that matters. ",

I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight.

      "description": "My roommate and I live in a suite-style double room and have been having some conflict since the beginning of the school year. Apparently the walls are super thin and she can hear everything, including whispering. She goes to bed really early and wakes up early as well. I don’t have as much of a structured schedule so I stay up later sometimes. \n\nEarly on I would have my bf over and we would study or chat pretty frequently and until late at night in my room. Not yelling or shouting, just regular conversations. She approached me and kindly requested that we have quiet hours starting at 10 pm and I agreed. We tried whispering and spending more time in his room. \n\nA few weeks later my roommate approached me again about the noise. She said it was super frustrating for her to come home and try to nap/study but have to listen to us making out all the time. She asked if we could refrain from doing that while she’s at home, so usually after 6pm. I told her that since her door is always closed anyway it’s hard for me to know when she is or isn’t home. So we decided that she would put up a sticky note (2 different colours) on her door to indicate if she’s here or not. That way, if I’m aware she’s here it’s a reminder to be more mindful. \n\nAt this point I have to admit I was getting annoyed by the situation. I thought quiet hours after 10pm was reasonable but to tell me that making out with my bf is distracting her, I don’t think that’s fair. She can go to a study room or stay at the library but it’s not like there’s any designated area for us to make out. I think I should have some liberty in what I do in the privacy of my own room. \n\nAnyways to avoid dealing with it, my bf and I agreed to just comply whenever we remember and try to go to his room when we want to be intimate. He has roommates as well but they game all day so I don’t think they’re bothered (hopefully).\n\nWe’ve just came back from winter break and I guess I forgot about some of the rules we set up. I was on the phone (indoor voice, not yelling or whispering) for about an hour from 10pm to 11pm and then received a text from my roommate saying “I’ve been trying to sleep for the past hour...”.  I get these texts all the time and usually reply with something along the lines of “sorry I’ll try to keep it down” but I was annoyed and impulsively replied with “ok, why didn’t you message me earlier? why do you assume I know when your bedtime is” \n\nI think my reply was asshole-y but what is a reasonable expectation on her part? If we agreed to quiet hours, does that entitle her to expect complete silence?\n\nShe said she’s tried everything including earplugs but they hurt her ears. We also seem to have conflicting temperature preferences but that might need to be saved for another post lol \n\n\n\n",

Spoiler it wasn’t me. Turns out to be this guy named, Riley. Well after learning about his large member, instead of getting mad or dropping it I decided to tease her from time to time about it.\n\nAnyway, one day I had my brothers and friends over and we ordered some pizza. Well the pizza was rather under done and soggy. We were all laughing about when my brother pulls it out of the box and it drops over both sides of his arms.\n\nMy gf immediately quips, “haha that thing is big and droopy just like Riley’s dick.”\n\nShock hits the room as I now have to explain who Riley is, that I was inferior to him in that department and it was awkward.\n\nSo everyone leaves and I’m a little salty. I mean I would joke with her about it every once in a while, but to hear her talk about his penis as large, as if it was on her mind didn’t sit right with me.\n\nNow, I didn’t get seriously mad or anything but I told her that me making fun of it was different than her bringing it up. She says I’m being a hypocrite but to me there is a clear distinction. I do it I guess because it’s better to laugh at the situation than to get my feelings hurt, she does it, well I don’t know why she did it but it bothers me that she’d do that in front of my friends. She says my jokes never bothered her and she doesn’t see the big deal.\n\nAITA for having a double standard?",

The job is not hard in any way but there is an amount of work we are each expected to do each day. Mainly prep. Wings,  sauce, pastas, dishes, boxes, etc. \n\nI work morning shift and there are a total of three drivers in the morning. Me, the one I snapped at, and one that wasn't involved. We split the prep while dealing with school lunches and normal deliveries.\n\nThe one I snapped at we will call R. R was having a bad attitude from the start of the day. Not wanting to work, blowing off what people said, and just generally being an asshole. We got most of prep done and we're just working on boxes by late afternoon. We we're chatting about random stuff till the subject of OCD came up and the conversation goes as follows.\n\nMe: ya OCD sucks I hope I never get it.\nR: no I'd love to have it my room would be so organized.\nMe: I think you're thinking of OCPD not OCD. OCPD is where you like to organize stuff. \nR: same thing\nMe: no quite different. OCD is Over Compulsive Disorder. An example would be you have to touch every surface in a room or else something terrible will happen. OCPD is Over Compulsive Personality Disorder. An example of this is needing to straighten things up because it annoys you.\nR: *super smarmy* ya same thing\n\nAt this point I am quite annoyed by his attitude. The conversation went on about another co-worker we have who likes to straighten the boxes in to perfect stacks. I won't bore you with the details but I finally snapped at him when he started making fun of said coworker for straightening the boxes like a \"maniac\" \n\nI snap at him and tell him his attitude needs to stop. He avoided me the rest of the day. I brought it up with his dad who also works there and his dad said that he was happy that I snapped at him.\n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n",

      "description": "I know I probably am an asshole but I just want it confirmed.\n\nBackstory:\n\nSo my mum was married to a guy for 12 years, he was my 'dad' for that time ages 5 to 17 until they broke up and me and my mum and brothers moved out. So the step dad had a son from a previous marriage that broke down he was 3 years older than me so we were really close. He lived with us when we were younger and moved out when he was 16 and I was 12.\n\nSo the 'dad' sexually abused me for years. It was a very traumatic childhood for me. I never told anyone about it because I was always scared no one would believe me. 6 years ago My grandad on my mum's side passed away and at the funeral I received a text from the step dad who wasn't invited saying that he was glad he was dead but he wished it was my mum instead. I was in the bathroom when I received this text and I just broke down. My step brother heard me and came in (we were all still close to him so he was invited to the funeral). It all came out and I told him everything. We cried and hugged. Then he told me it all happened to him too but much worse. So my mind was totally fucked and we never talked again for the next 5 years.\n\nNow to the asshole part:\n\nWe live two hours away from each other and going through the process of court to get the 'dad' taken down. We phone maybe once a month to talk because tbh we are both really struggling, this court process is rough and find comfort in each other. I met him last week for the first time in 6 years and he has changed he looks crazy like his dad I mean like his dad's DOUBLE. I Was so excited to see him and when he opened the door I had a full on panic attack. I had to try and ignore it as he was all excited and hugging me. I went by myself so we went into his house and I was watching him and he has exactly the same mannerisms  as his dad and I really struggled to cope. I had to find an excuse to leave after 30 minutes because it was just triggering me in all sorts of ways imaginable. \n\nSo I got back home and I don't know but I've kind of distanced myself from him. He phoned me last week and he was like help me I need space from my life do you think it would be okay if I came and stayed at your house for a week. The first thing I did was totally panic!! I was like let me talk to my husband and hung up. I still haven't got back to him about it. I have a 2 year old and I try to Keep my head above water to be the best mum I can to him but I'm scared this will push me over the edge. He really needs support right now and talking about killing himself, I  can't have that my responsibility if I say no !! I know he is a victim just like I am but he is literally his dad walking. I keep thinking about seeing him in the dark or whatnot and having mental breakdowns, if I had a panic attack the whole half an hour I met him how am I gonna cope having him staying here for a week???\n\nIf I tell him no then AITA!???",

I like to be alone after a long day at work.\n\n\nA few nights ago, I was having a terrible day at work and got very little amount of sleep. Work has been terrible these past few weeks with the looming thread that I might get fired. After grabbing dinner from a nearby restaurant, my friend wanted to invite people over while I wanted to go to bed. I've told him about my lack of sleep to him for the past few days, however, he insisted on his co-worker coming over. After a few back and forth, he was relentless about having his co-worker over.\n\n\nThey ended up going to a nearby bar when the co-worker arrived at the door. After a few days, we both ended up apologizing to each other.\n\n\nI realize that it his apartment too and he has every right to invite anyone he wants.

      "title": "WIBTA for uninviting my ‘best friend’ to a concert we bought tickets for together and taking someone else?",
      "description": "I’ve only know this girl (Sara) for a little over a year, but in the beginning of our friendship we got really close really fast and hung out multiple times a week. She is so sweet and I genuinely do like her, but ever since she got with her boyfriend ~7 months ago she has been extremely flakey. Suddenly ‘had homework’ or a ‘family emergency’ every time we were supposed to hang out and such- she even cancelled on coming to my 18th birthday dinner an hour before. She was the only person I had invited. She has lied to me before about having to work doubles so that she could get out of our plans, but I don’t call her out because I hate confrontation. I did mention something about her cancelling all the time once and she went into a monologue about how everything’s been so hard with her Dad going through cancer treatment and her anxiety about college and her being away from her boyfriend, which of course made me feel bad for bringing it up. It feels like all she talks about with me anymore is how awful her family treats her, how her dad’s threatening to kick her out, stuff like that.\n\nWe have gone to two concerts in the past, we always buy the tickets together (I’ll be on FaceTime with her while we pick our seats), I always pay for both of them up front, and she never pay me back for hers until the day of the concert despite me asking for the money beforehand multiple times. \n\nA few months ago her boyfriend moved across the country. She flies to visit him or vice versa every 3-4 weeks (no I’m not exaggerating). We were supposed to go to a concert together this weekend, we’ve had these plans for 5 months, and she just now told me that the day of the concert is the day she’s flying to see her boyfriend again and ‘the airline won’t let her’ cancel or reschedule the flight. So this leaves me scrambling to get a refund or resell the tickets with the concert just a few days away. Also, I saw on her Snapchat that her flight was actually today, not the day of the concert.\n\nAnyways, to the point- a few months ago we planned to go to a big concert together. We were on FaceTime together and picked our seats, then of course I paid for them ($350) and of course she hasn’t mentioned paying me back. It’s not till May but I’m worried she’ll cancel at last minute and I’ll be out both our ticket money (I wouldn’t go alone). I’ve recently gotten close again with my childhood best friend (Chrissy) and I really want to invite Chrissy to go with me instead of Sara because I know Chrissy will be genuinely excited, pay me as soon as she can, and not flake out. \n\nSo that finally brings me to my question- WIBTA for doing so? I feel terrible that I’m even considering it, because I really genuinely do like Sara, she’s great company when she actually shows up to our plans, but everyone tells me that she walks all over me and she’s a manipulator. I don’t feel like she is but I have a history of letting my friends walk all over me so I can’t be sure. Any opinions appreciated!!",

      "description": "I 33f have a friend 37m. We worked together for 6 years and since he left the company a year ago we've kept in touch and will occasionally grab lunch. He's a very open person, we read each other well and nothing we talk about ever seems awkward even when it's something I wouldn't feel comfortable discussing with other friends. Religion, politics, sex, family, child abuse, the death of his parent it's all on the table. However, he has never talked about or mentioned his SO. \n\nI never saw a problem with this. I figured we were don't ask don't tell and if he wanted to talk about someone he was seeing he would bring it up. I'd heard through mutual work friend he had a long term gf since HS and they were a little on and off. I never considered it might be inappropriate for us to be friends.\n\nLast week, I ran into him having lunch with two ladies I assumed were coworkers. I stopped at his table to say hello. This was my mistake. I had clearly made him uncomfortable. He gave an overly  enthusiastic account of who these women were (they went to HS together) and who I was and why I would be saying hello. I got the dirtiest look of my life from these women. I slunk back to eat with my campanion. \n\nI sent him a text later jesting at the awkwardness. It was clearly still awkward for him so I just asked him if I got him in trouble. I bring up that he's never talked about his SO and is it something he wants me to ask about. He launched into a whole thing about being a really private person and not wanting to talk about his personal life since he's from small town and everyone gets in everyone's business. \n\nI call bullshit. Its fine if this is something he doesn't want to share with me, and he's open with others about it so it's not a secret. He says its the only thing he considers personal. Dude. Really?\n\nI tell him if my friendship with him will hurt his relationship he needs to tell me and I'll stop. I'd be pissed if my SO was friends with a woman and I didn't know about it. Boundries are important in any relationship and it shouldn't even appear anything inappropriate is happening. He's sulking and ignoring me. \n\nTl/dr: Am I an asshole for wanting my friend to tell me when he has a gf since male/female relationships can cause trust issues for couples?",

      "description": "So basically my friends and I enjoy travelling a lot. We’ve been many places together, both domestically and abroad. They recently found some cheap tickets to Australia and pulled the trigger to go there at the end of 2019. \nHere is the issue. My girlfriend and I spend a lot of time together. Probably 5-6 days a week. I’m happy with this and everything, but we have had issues in the past where she gets upset that I make plans with other people because she wants to spend that time with me. For the most part, we get over them and she apologizes for being too controlling of my time. Early in our relationship, I went on a trip abroad with a friend of mine and it was kind of hard on her to be apart from me even though we did a really good job of keeping in contact and talking while I was away. \nNow, we have already taken a few trips together, but nothing internationally. We talked about maybe taking a trip abroad, maybe to Europe sometime in the not so distant future. She mentioned that she’d really like to go to Australia or Europe, but we had talked a lot more about going to Italy or Spain. Now, when my friends mentioned that they were ready to make plans to go to Australia, I wanted to jump in on it. \nThe problem is that my girlfriend got really upset that I wanted to go to Australia, a place she specifically also wanted to go to. The thing is this is a trip that was initiated by my friends. I would love to go with her to Australia, but when its just her and me. If she comes with me and my friends, I fear that I will only spend time with her while we’re over there and I won’t really get to share the experience with my friends the way I would like to. I tried to compromise with her and promise her that we can go there another time, or we can pull the trigger and go on some other trip that she wants to go on, just the two of us. None of that worked and both of us were upset because she wanted to go with me to Australia, and I wanted to go to Australia with just my friends. I am really trying to be compromising and finding the best way that we can both be happy.\nAfter fighting about it for about a day, she had some other plans and we split apart for most of the day. In the evening I saw her again and she apologized for being controlling of me and in her words “just because I can’t go, doesn’t mean I should stop you from going.” I felt a lot better after that and even bought the tickets. But now, a day later, I feel really guilty of the whole thing. I don’t know if I was in the right or not, and just want to know if I’m being unreasonable about the whole situation. \n",

      "description": "I got this friend, lets call her Cindy, that I know since elemntary school. We are both in our late 20ies now. She is now married to «John» and they have a son.\n\nHer family moved away so we lost touch. When I was 18 y/o, I've made some new friends and there was also John. One day John told us, that he met a girl and that they were dating.. Turned out to be Cindy. Fast forward, they are now married since 8 years and having a son.\nAs life would have it after a few years of marriage, everyday life took over and they wanted to spice up their sex life. So they tried swinger clubs (I know this, because Cindy shared the information with me). Not really my thing, but whatever floats your boat. Right?! In the case of John and Cindy I had my doubts. Both are kind of jealous people. However, they tried it a few times and seemed to like it. To have some security/controll they set one rule - The partner is always there, we do not swing separately.\n\nSo last weekend, we were having a girls night out due to her birthday. The evening started very well until she got drunk. We were having fun until I wanted to get some fresh air. Outside she told me, that she is having an affair with one of the guys from the swinger club. She showed me the whatsapp messages and deleted them in front of me. According to her, John is getting suspicious and is checking her phone. I told her, that this is not fair and since she does it behind John‘s back, this is cheating. This was ignored by her. Later we helped a girl that was getting harrased by a stranger. The girl and Cindy started to dance to make the guy disappear. As a thank you she wanted to buy us drinks. I refused and went to the toilett. Meanwhile Cindy and the girl went to the bar to drink a few shots. When I returned, the bartender which is a friend of mine told me that they were making out. I confronted Cindy but she just shrugged her shoulders. I told her that I wanted to leave and that we should get our jackets. She agreed and we went to get our jackets. Somehow on the way to the wardrobe, she managed to disappear. I found her in a toilet cabin with the other girl. It was clearly Cindy. They were clearly making out.\n\nOn our way home she asked me if she should tell John what happened. I said YES within a second. She then tried to make some lame excuses. She said something like \"I am just not attracted to John anymore / I do not know if I still love him.\" When I asked why she wouldn't leave him, she said that she does not want to be alone with two kids. She also admitted, she does not feel guilty about making out with the girl. Should I tell John what I know? I gave her time to tell him but she hasn’t until now.\n\nTL;DR: My friend cheated on her husband/babyfather with a girl, in front of me. In addition she admitted that she is having an affair with another man and deleted messages from this man in front of me. They visitied swinger clubs-only rule was, partner is there too. She has not told him yet. Should I tell him?",

      "description": "As a college graduation gift, my mom and I are going on a cruise. My dad and sister will not be be invited to go. My sister isn't going because she will get a gift as well when she graduates. There are a few reason why we aren't bringing my dad with.\n\n1. We would need to get two cabins instead of one \n2. It's a lot easier to coordinate what we are going to do and when since there would only be two of us\n3. Having my dad with us can be kind of stressful. I love him, but our personalities clash and it's easy to set him off, so there is ALWAYS a fight when we go on vacation\n4. I want to spend time with my mom because I don't get to spend a lot of time with her since her working hours are so long\n\nWhen my mom told him, he was pretty disappointed. I feel really bad about it, but I also don't want to change it so he would be going with (the cruise is still a year away). It's not a regular thing where he gets left behind (I can only remember one other time where he didn't come with us and it was because he was doing his own trip somewhere).\n\nAITA for leaving my dad out for this vacation?",

      "description": "I’ll try and keep this as short as possible I really just need some opinions here.\n\nSo my first girlfriend ever, I’ll call her Kay had a really close and intense relationship for a year. A she was in a terrible spot when we dated as she lost a couple family members in the time we were dating and we ended up breaking things off because she was not in a place to have a relationship. So we stop talking for about 6 months. \n\nThen we all of a sudden start talking again have been close ever since. We’ve talked , we have been intimate in these 6 years, we said how much we love each other and now just isn’t the right time for her but I’ve chased her and chased her and chased her. For 6 fucking years. Everytime is never the right time, even tho she says how much I mean to her and so on. We have both had other relationships in these 6 years but mother ever worked out because we both still aren’t over each other. \n\nWell everytime we talk we talk for a week then she stops talking to me until she texts me, then we hang out exactly twice, then stop hanging again. She says she never has time but seems to always be out with her friends and other guy friends. I have asked over and over again why can’t we work this out and her response every time is that she’s afraid of it doesn’t work out we won’t be close anymore blah blah blah and I mean more to her than anyone else. I’ve been trying for 6 years for this to work and everytime something always happens where it doesn’t. So I stop talking to her and She’ll randomly text me again and I’m right back to square one. Hooked. \n \nI’ve told her that we need to stop talking so I can move on and finally be happy but everytime she brings me back in and gives me hope. So I’ve came to the realization (finally) that she is probably just using me even tho it’s hard to believe just from how close we HAVE been and what she has said to me. So I really feel like I need to tell her to leave me alone. \n\nSo am I the asshole for finally cutting of this relationship? Everytime I bring it up she kinda puts me out as an asshole and how she could never just let me go like that. Love makes people blind (like me) and I think I just need to man up and move on from this shit. It’s the same cycle everytime. Thank you for your time. ",

She has pretty strict parents so I figured it would be nice to help her develop outside of her parent's control. Shes 23, is usually polite, and helps around the house. Well not even a month in and she brings her drunk bf and his brother over with no heads up. Then proceeded to kick me(not literally, she just talked shit about sleeping on the couch till I got annoyed)and my brother off the couch(hella comfy) so her bf's brother can sleep there. I wasn't trying to jump to conclusions so I assumed it was some sort or emergency. Well I went to my room and within 5 mins all I can hear is their sexual noises. That's when it kinda ticked me off. \n\nOnly reason I feel like asking here is because my wife told me I was overreacting and \"slut shaming her\". We never layed down any house rules either, but I didn't think she'd pull something like this. \n\nSo am I the asshole for getting upset over this or...?\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway account\n\nSo in my friendship group there are 5 of us, one of them who we shall call \"N\" has slipped away and has become the odd one out of our group since he moved away. He isn't involved in our group chats on facebook and I have a feeling that the other 3 in my friend group don't really like him either. One of my other friends in the friend group is \"J\". J and I used to go to local boxing matches together for about a year, and we really enjoyed it. Now I'll admit, I've always had a soft spot for N and I let him take advantage of me sometimes, but I still like him as a friend, whereas J doesn't hate him, but finds him to be cringey and intrusive at times. J and N used to be really close, but like everyone else in the friendship group, J has drifted away from N recently. J made it clear to me that he didn't want N to start coming to the local boxing matches with us, but I decided to invite him along anyway as I still like N, a lot.. In fact, I've started gaining romantic feelings for N but he doesn't know, as I'm gay and he's straight, but I really like spending time with him anyway.\n\nJ ended up getting a bit upset with me, because he felt like I ruined the boxing matches by inviting N with us, because N isn't even really into boxing and it feels kind of awkward for J when he is there. We also have to take N home all the time as he doesn't drive, which adds about an extra 1.5 hours to the end of our night, which is when J and I used to hang out and watch cartoons at his place.\n\nJ is still coming to the boxing and likes it, but AITA for inviting N along when J told me he wasn't cool with it, or should I have a right to invite whoever I like?",

      "description": "So we're going to call the person I am talking about B.  \n\n\nBackstory: One time last month a couple co-workers asked me if I wanted to go to Whole Foods (or a similar place, that sells lunch.. I can't remember the name) so I decided to go, it was a holiday so it was closed and we ended up eating at some random Asian place, basically this day we took a 1.5 hour break, I felt weird about it.   \n\n\nA week after the whole thing happened, other coworkers invited me to go buy food one day and they also invited B. Now normally I stay away from B and was feeling weird that I was about to have lunch with B.  \n\n\nSo B ended up confronting me during lunch in a pretty aggressive way and that made me feel extra uncomfortable, but I played it cool and said we were stuck in traffic.  \n\n\nHere is the story:   \nLast Monday I messaged B and asked, \"B, how can you come to work every single day late but try to confront me for my lunch breaks?\" and B's reply was, \"Yeah yeah. I know. I'm trying to get better about it. The last couple of weeks have been hard I've been dealing with a lot of shit\", so then I said, \"Feel better.. life is kinda hard, yeah.\" then B asked, \"As for the lunch break thing, I was talking about the fact that it was an hour and a half break that one day. \" so I said, \"You said it in a very aggressive and confronting way. I think you need to reevaluate how you talk to people sometimes.\", then she just went on about how she didn't mean it that way, then asked me if she really needed to reevaluate how she interacts with people. I lost it and said, \"Yep, I think you need to reevaluate it. It makes people not like you that much.\" then she goes on about how not many people like her anyway. So in a helpful way, I said to her, \"Then don't you think there is some type of social skill you need to pick up. Like.. I'm not saying there is something wrong with you.. I just think you are lacking a social skill.. I don't know what it is tho.\" then she goes on about having BPD, lacking many social skills, and understanding dogs way better than humans. I said, \"Alright, are you going to therapy for it?\" then she said, \"Every month, it's one of those mental illnesses that you get to go to therapy probably until you're 50 or 60 for\", in the end, I just wished her good luck.   \n\n\nSo she turns around and says, \"Can I ask, how is that I talk to people that they don't like?\" (I've talked to other people and they definitely do not like how she acts sometimes, but I mostly gave her my account of why I stay away from her) so I said, \"Okay, I'm not trying to do this because I don't like you or anything, but I truly feel put off by you because 1) cutting into conversations with a very loud, very assertive voice 2) the assertive voice you have going on, is indeed normal in some situations, but I feel like it isn't useful in EVERY. SINGLE. INTERACTION. YOU. HAVE. 3) I feel like when I talk to you, or hear you talk to other people - I can analyze in most of your conversations that you seem like the kind of person who wants to \"one-up\" the other person whenever possible - this is why I stay away from you. 3) The tone you speak in is just an overall I-think-I'm-better-than-you type of tone.. which.. makes me also want to stay away from you and stuff.\" and finished off with a, \"But overall I think it's just in your actions.  \nI truly think you can be a good, nice friendly person.. but yeah...\" and then she thanked me for the feedback and tried to tell me her life story and it went like this, \"grew up in a situation where if you didn't assert yourself you were ignored, or worse. Didn't matter what was happening. Trust me when I say this, I was way worse years ago\" and I replied, \"But you're on your own now.. it's time to heal and change yourself. (My family home wasn't that good but I'm on my healing path tbh, but yes I understand you came from an abusive family). Tbh I'm not that good with socializing either.. like I've been trying to teach myself how to improve my social skills, people watching skills, etc. and I'm noticing stuff about myself and actively trying to change it.\" and she said, \"I'm aware that I'm a \"large personality\"\" and asked who doesn't like her so I said, \"To be honest.. it shouldn't matter. What should matter is yourself, your mental health, and stuff. All I wish is for you to maybe find of peace of mind, make more friends, etc.\" and I tried to give her more advice but she said she was feeling really bad. I just said sorry and left it at that.  \n",

      "description": "My boyfriend, two of his friends, and I were out at a diner. We all ordered (intending to pay separately, as usual) and I ultimately wasn't that hungry so halfway through I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to finish my plate. This is pretty common and the two friends would've almost certainly seen me do this before. He agreed so I pushed my plate over to him. \n\nOne of the friends said \"well, *I'd* like some too\" in a pissed off tone and started helping herself to my leftovers. The other friend said \"yeah, me too\" and took a piece of food from my plate as well. My boyfriend didn't say anything so neither did I, but the tone struck me as somewhat rude.\n\nWas I the asshole for not offering them any to begin with? I felt like since it was my food, I would get to choose who ate it. As far as I can recall we never shared food while eating out.",

      "description": "Just the day after I (19yo m) came back home from a trip abroad, me and two housemates decided to go out that night. One of my housemates had already invited two of her friends (f) (they had dinner with us) and me and my other housemate invited some of ours too (they arrived around 10pm).\n\nAnyways, we drank a lot and played a few drinking games. Around 11:45pm I had to go to the toilet, but so did one of my housemates friends. We kinda stayed on the hallway of our dorm and we kept talking. I liked talking to her, I've always been a guy who loves a good conversation and this was one of them. We also discovered that our birthdays were on the same date, which was quite surprising.\n\nAnyways, my housemate had told me that the girl I was in a conversation with has been in an relationship for two years, but that she was waiting for the right moment to end it. \n\nWe talked for 1,5h. After that we went out. Once we were settled in a nice club we started drinking some more and after some shots we started kissing. I ended up taking her back to my home, which isn't that far because i live right in the city centre, and we had sex. After that we just went back to the club to our mates.\n\nAnyways, since I'm quite a sensitive guy, i kinda started feeling guilty, \"should i have done it\", \"was it the right thing to do\". I kinda do blame myself, eventhough I've asked several people, and they all say that it was hers. \n\nJust to illustrate, I am quite sensitive and really unconfident, shy and careful when I approach girls. \"Fixing\" girls in a club has never been my thing, it only worked out because we had talked a lot. I also dont identify myself with the term \"f*ckboy\", I am not trying to \"fix\" as many girls as possible.\n\nPs. She ended the relationship the day after it happened, even though she planned to wait two more weeks.\n\nFeel free to ask for more information, I'm trying to be brief, but if you wanna know details I'll be more than happy to provide them. If it seems like a chaos: welcome in my  head, I'm still trying to grasp what happened, I'll be happy to clarify. All I wanna know if i really should be blaming myself like I'm doing now.\n",

There’s usually a bit of clutter on our dining room table and the bathroom may not be sparkling clean at all times, but it’s far from old food laying around or visible grime. I try to deep clean each room every couple weeks so it doesn’t get too bad. \n\nAnyways. My brother in law moved in with us a couple weeks ago. Nobody knows how long he is staying. Whatever, we have a guest room, it doesn’t cost us any extra to have him there until he can get back on his feet. A couple of days ago I flew home to see my parents and help them through a tough time. Important to note, before I left both my husband and I cleaned the house so his brother would be comfortable while I was gone. I thought it was looking pretty good.\n\nToday my husband texted me that my BIL deep cleaned the house and now it looks great. My immediate reaction was to annoyance and embarrassment. I’m ashamed that a guest felt like they had to clean up after us and I’m kind of mad he just took it upon himself to clean up our house. I didn’t think it was that dirty. I told my husband to tell his brother thanks but then told him how I felt. He thought I was being ungrateful and unwilling to accept help. So reddit, am I the asshole here? I know his brother was probably only doing it to be nice but I am still upset that he spent hours scrubbing all our stuff. \n\nTL;DR: my brother in law cleaned my whole house, am I wrong to be unhappy that he did it?",

      "description": "My housemate and I (both guys) are both in our mid 20s and share a house together. There is a small kitchen/living room and two bedrooms upstairs. Ever since my roommate started dating his GF they are inseparable. They are always at our house and never hang out or sleep at her place. They cook together, eat together and constantly watch movies in the living room. My computer and work area are in the living room as well, and while they say they don't mind me being there, I can't help but feel uncomfortable and annoyed that I can't enjoy playing a game or working in peace. It's to the point where if she's not over at our place, I am actually surprised. Out of the last 30 days, I would bet she's been here 25. Now she doesn't do anything in particular that annoys me too much. She is friendly and tries to talk to me and invite me to hang out, but I don't want to be a third wheel and we don't share anything in common. I want my roommate to be happy and it is a shared house, but I feel like I'm living with two roommates. Also, recently I came home to her old friend from college there hanging with my roommate and her. I'm being very presumptuous, but I can't fathom why she bringing her friend that my roommate doesn't know over instead of her place. I talked to our mutual friends and have received mixed advice, but ultimately I think the consensus is it's not really my place to say anything to my roommate.

      "description": "I have not been in a relationship for over 8 years now. I'm 30 and I don't exactly feel desperate to be in a relationship, although I will admit that it would be nice to have a significant other.\n\nI've been talking to my therapist about my loneliness and various other issues and I told her that my reason for still being single after so many years is because I'm looking for that \"special one\". I wouldn't exactly call her a soulmate or somebody who will take my breath away. But somebody who is more me. Somebody who has the same kind of introverted personality, and who has the same type of hobbies and interests as me (I'm a very nerdy person). Girls like that can be hard to find which I guess is why I've had so much trouble meeting girls that I'm interested in.\n\nI've told my therapist that while I have no problem going out there and meet new girls it also scares me if the girl isn't exactly the type of girl that I'd want, then later if I do meet that one perfect girl, I will constantly be kicking myself for not waiting until that special one came around. Like I'd hate to have to settle for somebody that isn't ideal to me and then later on I meet somebody who fits all my criteria but at that time I'm no longer single.\n\nThen I'd not only feel annoyed for having settled with somebody who isn't exactly to my liking but I'd also feel like a horrible person to leave my girlfriend for somebody else who may share the same hobbies as me for example.\n\nMy therapist however told me that this is just how life is and that there isn't anything wrong with realizing that sometimes somebody you meet is just better for you. The fact that I'm holding off for so many years and never committing to a relationship is going to only hurt me in the long run since there's no guarantee that I will meet that \"special one\" so it's better to just meet someone and even settle.\n\nWhat do you guys think? On one hand, I'd feel like an asshole leaving a girlfriend just because I met somebody else at a function whom has all the checkmarks in a partner that I want, but at the same time I can also see the logic in my therapist's advice, that constantly waiting isn't going to do me any good since there's no guarantee that I will ever meet that one girl and I've already wasted 8 years of my life holding off.",

      "description": "I started dating my (18F) girlfriend just before the new year. Things have been excellent. Before I met her I had a tough mental health patch but I have gotten better with her help. Basically, things have been going quite well. We see eachother often, we laugh, we love eachother, and things are good. However, she’s not very affectionate. I’m over the top with affection. I say “I love you” at the end of every phone call, I buy her gifts when I can, I treat her like a queen every day. On the other hand, it took her a couple of months to tell me she loved me, and even though she told me she wouldn’t be as OTT with it as I am, she still hasn’t said it again. I can live with this, as the look on her face when I do something nice for her or when we’re together says more than that. Last weekend I picked her up from a night out, and I expected her to be all drunk and inlove and excited to see me, but she only seemed drunk.\n\nSometimes she’s not receptive to me being mushy and lovey. She refuses to be “in a relationship” with me on Facebook, or to post any pictures of me and her on either Facebook or Instagram, despite having pictures with her exes on both. She made new social media accounts to get away from people she didn’t speak to and to make new memories with me, but still frequently uses her old accounts. Until recently she mentioned her ex in conversation often. She normally followed them up with “but I’m with you now and I wouldn’t change it”. She’s apprehensive when I talk about our future as well. I AM moving country in summer, But i want things to continue. She says things are still early and we never know how things may end up, even though she wants the same, but the apprehension is something which you don’t expect, especially in the “honeymoon” phase of a relationship. \n\nIn the past couple of days we had a few fallouts and arguments over things like her being incredibly dismissive of me being romantic after being receptive when we were together, or her not replying to me late on a night when she’s been active and talking to her friends. I know these things are stupid but I feel like I’m putting my heart on the line and not getting anything in return. \n\nIt doesn’t help that she’s SUCH a stress free person, and often won’t entertain my worries about this stuff, and dismisses it as stupid. Deep down I believe she loves me and is happy with me, But sometimes I get paranoid and go moody.\n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR: My (18F) girlfriend is incredibly not romantic with me (22M), despite me being overly romantic and optimistic about our relationship. It’s causing me to have moods and little arguments with her which isn’t what I want. ",

      "description": "So months ago me and my buddies planed a trip for our winter break . I was really excited to go  since during the semester I stick to the books and really don’t go out much . I told my brother months ago about this trip and that he needs to cover for me at our family store since one of us has to be around to help our father. He said no problem. ( We have had trouble with customers in the past so we always make sure one of us is around if anything happens)\n\nFast forward to this past Thursday he tell me that his going on a trip with his wife  this weekend to visit her  parents since they are leaving on a two month trip.  I tell him he can’t go since I’m leaving this weekend for my trip. We get into a argument and he acts as if all of this was it of his control. I ask him why couldn’t he go the previous weekends his excuse was it fell on holidays.  Which I found to be a bullshit excuse since he knew of my trip and could have planned accordingly So I end up not going on the trip since someone always has to be around for the store. \n\nSo later I ask him to repay me the money I spent for the trip (tickets and hotel) but he decided it’s not his fault and that I should get it from my friends.  This just pisses me off even more and I tell him to fuck off at this point and find his own ride to the airport. He almost missed his flight since I canceled on him. My brother ends up telling our parents, which results in my parent yelling at me saying the it’s my fault and I shouldn’t be mad at my brothers.\n\nSo I decided to ask you guys am I the asshole?\n\n\n\n",

Debbie had a \"everyone who loves me, leaves\" narrative, and eventually confided that she had a personality disorder. We became very close very fast, and while most of our hangouts included getting very drunk, we always had a good time.  We had a lot of talks about our mental health and bonded over our histories of depression and anxiety. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually things started souring. Debbie drank A LOT, and daily, and signaled some concerning behavior- showing up to events blackout drunk, passing out on bathroom floors at bars, etc. I then noticed that whenever I called it an early night (which really wasn't often) she always had something very concerning happen the next day, beginning with her informing me she did hard drugs with a homeless man she met on her way home, and eventually that she passed out on the street for hours on a night when I had offered to take her home. I tried to support her through it all and even suggested that we hang out without involving alcohol, but it ultimately got worse when she began dating someone emotionally toxic, and possibly abusive. I tried to support her decision in different ways, from encouraging the relationship (before she told me all the awful things he was doing- she admitted she hid it from me), to voicing my concern for her safety/well-being, to telling her to simply not talk about him in front of me if she was to continue dating him. They had a very off/on relationship and she regularly admitted to lying to me about them getting back together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got to the point where I simply couldn't watch her make these very toxic decisions, especially when she played them off with \"I'm so stupid for doing this lololol.\" She also told me that her therapist thought I was a bad friend for her, although Debbie thought that was funny. Combined with the fact I was miserable when I actually hung out with her, I decided I couldn't be her friend any more. And so, I followed through on our last few plans together and then slowly stopped responding to her texts and attempts to hang out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've gone back and forth between feeling guilty and justified for ghosting- mostly because I realize if I explained to her why I no longer wanted to be her friend it would be \"because I can't watch you self-destruct and our friendship has become toxic\"- which is exactly what she told me her worst fears were, as people had previously stopped associating with her for those reasons or her personality disorder. I don't see how a productive conversation about this could happen, but I also know it must've been very painful for her that I simply disappeared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for ghosting her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I found via text that my friend F wanted to end our 18 year friendship. It completely blindsided me. I made F talk to me on the phone the next day and found out she had been harbouring resentment on me for the last 1.5 yrs. She said that what caused it all was when I didn’t visit her at the hospital when she gave birth to her daughter. \n\nTwo months prior to her giving birth (April), I had a miscarriage (Feb). It put me in a severe depression and maybe this was my fault but I didn’t know how to deal with it except socially isolate myself from friends, especially those pregnant or with kids, until I felt more emotionally stable. One week before my friend’s due date, I threw her an impromptu baby shower and spent a lot of money on it, buying her dinner at a fancy restaurant and buying baby stuff. By the end of the shower, I went back into a depressed state - the talk about babies and motherhood really reminded me of what I couldn’t have and it just messed me up. I didn’t make a scene at the shower but didn’t say anything to my friend. I decided that I would just hide for a while. My husband decided we should get away and we decided to go to Hawaii because we had the next week off. Without thinking about my friend or anyone else but my husband and I, we went and it helped us. While I was in Hawaii, my friend texted me the news about her birth and I congratulated her. We talked on the phone one time after she was out of the hospital, but I didn’t visit her for the next three months. It partly because I was anxious about it, but I also got pregnant shortly afterwards the trip. Having gone through the miscarriage, I ended up focusing my energy on trying to concentrate on my new pregnancy and seeing if I could make it through the first trimester. \n\nWith that said, I didn’t think about seeing my friend or her baby for 3 months until I felt more secure about myself. I figured she was busy anyways. After our first meeting in a a while, we started spending time together  and when my daughter was born, we started seeing each other more, maybe 1x a month, which I thought was fine. \n\nWith that said, we carried on as if everything was normal and I didn’t know she resented me that entire time. She says that a real friend wouldn’t have gone to Hawaii and that I should’ve been at the hospital (she had some complications and believes she could’ve died from the birth). She also feels we are not close because I should’ve let her help me solve my depression with the miscarriage. I mean, I did tell her about it when it happened and I don’t recall her knocking at my door or calling me, but for me, that was fine. I had no expectations. My thought at the time was, why would I involve a pregnant person in dealing with my miscarriage issues? I felt it was an issue for my husband and I to deal with alone.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "Throw away because some people I know in real life know about my real reddit account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 16 I got diagnosed with PDD-NOS (a form of autism). If I say so myself (and what I hear from many others as well), you usually don't really notice that I have a form of autism aside from some social difficulties, which is why it went unnoticed for majority of my life. I'm 20 now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the problem is, ever since my diagnose my father finds the need to tell everyone he knows or meet about my autism. And I mean literally \\*everyone\\*. Even people I don't even know or know who I am. Even when the conversation has nothing to do with autism in the slightest he still finds a way to tell people about it. Now let me get this clear, I'm not ashamed of having what I have and I usually do tell people about it after I've known them for a while. It's just that in this society there's such a negative stigma on having autism and a lot of people don't understand it. I just want people to know me for who I am instead of knowing me for my disability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last time I told him that I'd rather not have him telling other people about it. My problems are mine and mine alone and I don't want him to use it as a subject of conversation without my permission. Especially not with people who are complete strangers to me. But upon telling him he got super offended and said that as his daughter, he should be able to talk about my problems however he wants and I shouldn't make such a big deal out of it. AITA here?",

We tell him to get his dog under control and that we invited him and not his dog. He leaves. I'm walking outside a week later at night, and he is with his dog again. It charges up to me and I say 'Dude, get your dog under control, and put him on a leash for God's sake'\n\nHe then says that he's a member of the HOA (he is) and says 'who's going to turn me in?', and then he says this: 'isn't your lease up for renewal?' And that was the last straw.\nWe got (mostly) everyone to report his ass to the HOA.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Very classic setting. We're in the library studying for our exam and we see two very cute looking girls at the copier, giggling away and making us smile in the distance. He told me \"You see those two at the copier?\" I literally answered \"Say no more fam. I had the same thought.\" And he had his eye on the girl with a yellow headband. \n\nThat was the same I wanted to talk to and I told him \"Yeah I would've gone for her too, but you shoot your shot man I'll leave her up to you.\" I have a little more confidence and experience just talking to strangers in general while he doesn't. I told him he should just go for it, walk up to her as it is the hardest part, and then just stand your ground and say whatever come to mind first.\n\nHe kept hyping himself up and I helped hype him up too, but he wouldn't move no matter what. I hated that in that moment, he was all talk and no walk. I got kind of irritated by him not going for what he wants to go for simply because he has sweaty palms. Told him it'd be worse if he let this go than if he got rejected. Well, he didn't learn and so I said \"If you don't go for her, I will.\" \n\nWell, half a minute like this goes by and the girls were done copying there stuff and were about to leave, I went up to her and got her number. Came back to my friend and he was just pissed. For some reason he went off about how I was on a power trip, and \"I get you can do this better than me\" and \"is this funny to you? Pretty asshole thing to do man\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm baffled. He didn't go for it no matter what, I encouraged him and he didn't move. Was it really an asshole thing of me to do? Personally I don't think so.",

      "title": "AITA for thinking my girlfriend is using sex as a power play?",
      "description": "So I earlier today I was trying to make plans with my girlfriend for later tonight. She asked me if we could not have sex tonight since we do it pretty much every time we hang out and she just wants so time to chill and do other things. I told her no problem as I know we do it often so it doesn't really make a difference. We continue the conversation trying to figure out exactly what we want to do on this boring Friday night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided what we would make for dinner (I was gonna cook some pasta) and start trying to figure out how to spend the evening. I suggest she bring over one of her game systems and we could just hang out and play some video games. (I have 2 TVs so we would be able to do more than one game at a time) She tells me she wants to do something together instead of playing video games next to each other. I told her I really wanted to play some video games since I haven't be able to in a while (Midterms) and I finally have a chance to. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter to me as long as I get to spend time with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe then tells me that we can have sex tonight if I don't play any video games. Obviously I told her of course I choose that option. I said that it is fine I can just play before she comes over (There is like a 2 hour gap in between when I get home and when she was planning to come over) She then clarifies and says that in order for us to have sex tonight, I can't play at all today. I try clarifying as well by telling her that if would be in the time before i see her and not during. She says its fine we don't need to have sex and we can do something else instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I get pretty upset and I tell her WTF why is she trying to hold sex over my head. I reason that it makes literally no difference if I play games before we hang out. I agreed not to play anything DURING our evening but there is absolutely no reason I should be prohibited to enjoy myself before we hang out. I told her that its pretty fucked up to use sex as a power play just to see if she can get me to bend over for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe says that she doesn't see it that way and that it was just an offer. She says I have every right to decline and we would just go back to the original plan of not messing around tonight. My reasoning is that an offer would have a benefited outcome on both sides. (For example no video games while we hang out = sex) but this situation has no benefit for her by me not playing games before we hang out. I said that this makes it a power play and I am not okay with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe doesn't see this and is just telling me it is a difference of opinion. Now we aren't speaking and as of now NOTHING is happening tonight at all. So AITA here? Am I missing something and looking at this from the wrong perspective?",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nFor context: My girlfriend and I live in a southern state known for racial profiling in traffic citations. She is black, and owns a luxury brand used car. This is important later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend currently does not have her driver's license. She also doesn't have a valid permit. This is largely no fault of her own---she didn't have a car as a teen, or the financial ability growing up to pay for car insurance, payments, etc. This has been a source of extreme frustration for her---anything pertaining to getting her license, driving, or getting a car causes upset.  However---recently, she got her first car and has been ecstatic about finally having a way of getting around. Now, all she has to do is get her driver's license and she's good to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTypically, I am her main source of transportation and would drive her wherever she needed. We more or less shared my car, but only I would drive it. Now, normally this isn't an issue at all, but unfortunately my car broke down and I haven't been able to drive. We live apart, and her car is currently with her at her apartment, meaning if I had to drive her somewhere, I wouldn't be able to without finding a ride to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, she needed to get to a store to go shopping for an event that was planned as part of her job. The event was later that evening, and she had a window of a couple hours to get there and back during what was essentially rush hour evening traffic. She insisted that it would be fine if she drove the ten miles or so to the store by herself, and that driving without her license wouldn't be a huge deal. The road to get to these stores is a main thoroughfare that is traffic-heavy, has a higher speed limit than the city, is wreck-prone, and is generally more heavily policed. Because she's black and would be driving a luxury used car, it's possible that she's more likely to be pulled over on that stretch of road. I tell her I think it's a bad idea for those reasons, and that she should wait or find another way of getting there if at all possible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the state where we live, if she were to be pulled over and cited for driving without a license, they could slap her with jail time even as a first offence, on top of fines. It would also make it much, MUCH more difficult for her to get her license properly in the future. I understand that she feels trapped without her ability to drive herself places, but we're working towards getting her her license as soon as it's possible to do so. So...am I the asshole for insisting that she not drive without her license?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:\\*\\* Girlfriend doesn't have her license yet and insists on driving herself places anyway, with no regard for potential legal consequences if she's pulled over or worse. Am I the asshole for telling her that she shouldn't be driving until she gets her license?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Ok, so out of the blue today I got some weird texts from a girl I was friends with through middle school before she moved at the start of high school.  I am a senior now so it's been about 3 years since I've seen her.  She is still good friends with one of my good friends and took her phone today to text me that she loved me.  I was so caught off guard I didn't know what to do, and I didn't even know it was her at first, but in the ensuing texts something tipped me off it was her (shall be referred to when needed to by K).  \n\nSo after I didn't really say much to her she claims I rejected her (even though I hadn't actually said anything about the \"I love you\" text), and when I asked what I was supposed to do, she said I was supposed to be happy because she thought we were friends.  So I told her yes, we're still friends, but I don't share feelings for her.  Only after this does my friend whose phone she stole say that K was just trying to reconnect and used \"I love you\" as an icebreaker joke.  \n\nBut then K starts acting hurt that I rejected her even though she said it was a joke, asking me whether it was because she was ugly, or her personality was bad, and I didn't know what to say.  It ended with her saying she wouldn't be able to see me any more and then saying THAT was a joke too. \n\nI feel so guilty now and I have no idea what I should have done or even what happened.  \n\nBut is my guilt warranted? Was I an asshole? \n\nP.S. I can post the texts if need by but not in a good place to do so right now.",

      "title": "AITA For Cutting Ties With This Individual?",
      "description": "So, back in 2016 I met an internet friend in a Facebook group I adminned. This internet friend has always been sort of sketchy and has refused to show me his face or send a recording of his voice (he says this is because his English skills are poor, he lives in an Eastern European country). Anyway, despite this I have still remained friends with him. When I first met this friend, he told me he was gay abd breifly had an obsession with me. I told him I was not interested in men and he seemed to tone it down, although he would still get jealous when I posted pictured online with my girlfriend. More recently (this past year), he has been tuning up the sketchy levels by repeatedly asking for me to give him my address so he can “send me art” (he always draws art and is quite good at it, he likes to draw cartoon/comic characters and he always draws me and him as cartoon characters hanging out and stuff). He also always tells me about his homelife and how shitty it is and how his parents are abusive and how I’m his only friend and etc. Anyway, I refused to give him much address because I didn’t feel comfortable giving it away, and so he accepted this and stopped bugging me. However, like a week later, he sent me my fucking neighbor’s address and said “is this ur address :3? I want to send you a birthday gift” and I questioned him on how he found that address, to which he responded that he just googled my name and that address came up listed as mine. After this I decided to cut ties with him. I’ve blocked him on all social media. He’s tried messaging me on multiple platforms to apologize and say that he didn’t mean to be creepy. It’s also worth noting that this friend has horrible social skills (even for the internet) and I often question if he’s autistic or lying about his age or something similar. He claims he’s 2 years younger than me but I often think he’s much younger than that. Am I the asshole? Sorry for the terrible jumbled post, my brain is fried. ",

      "description": "It was my birthday a while back, my husband was on work trip. He messaged me a sweet birthday wish at 12 am on my birthday. Just to be clear on his birthday I hand picked many items I knew he'd love, and wrapped everything in a very cute way for him. Every birthday I do something nice/thoughtful for him. I put a lot of effort so he can feel special. \nAnyway, then after coming back from the trip 2 weeks later, he kept asking me what I woukd like to receive as a gift. I said I don't know. We went out to the store once and he tried to get me the latest iphone, I told him I don't want a phone my current phone is still new. He said okay.. then a week passed and he did nothing, two weeks.. nothing not even flowers,  a month.. nothing. By the way he is not busy, he is a on a month vacation. \nI started feeling sad that he put no effort into my birthday even though he knows it is important to me (I explained to him the previous years that feeling special/appreciated on my birthday is important, he already knows that).\nI got frustrated so I told him I feel unimportant and unappreciated, he felt really sad , I knew he felt truly guilty and he apologised. The way he apologised I felt he knew he had to make it up... but guess what, the next few weeks he still did nothing!\nI tried to ignore the fact he put zero effort into my birthday but I could not. I feel like I'm not at the top of his list of priorities by that, I see him lazing around doing nothing but watch tv and cannot help but wonder why won't he dedicate at least a couple minutes for me to to at least send me flowers. \nAt the same time I can't helpt but feel bratty. Like I'm upset I'm not getting something that is actually a privilege not a right.\nBtw he is a very loving husband, he treats me so well except for this birthday thing.\nAm I the asshole here, or are my feelings of being upset validated?\n",

      "description": "We got together when we were 20 but soon turned to long distance relationship. I was a small guy to begin and she was bigger than me but we never minded then. Four years passed and she gained 20 kgs to become around 85kgs with 152cms and I gained 10 to around 66kg with 173cms. She also became quite sick in this time with diabetes and arthritis which made it harder for her to exercise and lose weight. I still do love her and don't wanna make her feel conscious about her weight. But it's just that I don't feel attracted towards her anymore. We do have sex when we meet and sometimes I feel a bit suffocated but we do love each other and make each other feel good. I love her company and she understands me very well. But in my heart I also feel the urge to be with someone fitter and sexier and that makes me guilty for even about thinking about leaving her in bad times. I think I'll probably just decide to keep her happier this way. AITA here?",

      "description": "I know this sounds really bad but just hear me out. it's been eating me up inside so I'd like some feedback. \n\nWe're currently college seniors and we started dating only 4 months ago. For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?",

      "description": "Context. \nI live with 5 other people in a two story house.\nSo recently the social area has moved to the upstairs living room for whatever reason and I typically go to bed before everyone else. The issue however is that everyone now congregates right outside my room and are usually laughing and screaming until the odd hours of the night. (Past 3AM) \nPreviously it wasn't an issue because it was downstairs where there are no bedrooms but as of late I've been woken up or kept up because they can't control the noise level. \nThat's fine whatever. But if the noise level gets too loud I let them know I'm going to bed or just bear with it. This happens several times and they usually forget I've told them and get loud again. \nSo I get back from the winter break and try to fix my atrocious sleep schedule and fall asleep until I'm woken up by some very loud roommates. I ask them to move the socializing downstairs because they're loud through group chat but they don't see it because they're too busy hanging out or whatever. At this point I'm frustrated because it seems like they don't bother to be considerate of others and it's already 3AM and I've been woken up. \nI come out of my room and tell them \"to shut the f**k up and that they're loud af\" and slam my door. Things quiet down but then I get a very passive aggressive message in group chat saying that I need to tell them when I'm going to go to sleep so they can keep it down and that I don't need to be so confrontational.\nThat's great and all except 1) I was already asleep and 2) that didn't work the last couple of times I've tried it. I get that I didn't handle things very well but I don't necessarily feel like I'm entirely at fault for being upset. I also feel like it's rather unreasonable to ask me to let them know that I'm going to sleep every time when before it's fallen on deaf ears. \nI can see there are points where I could have handled this better but idk what do you guys think?",

I don’t want it though, I already have a car myself (2005 model that’s been paid off this past year) and I’m struggling as is with the upkeep and all that but do to credit issues I can’t trade it out just yet. I don’t want the truck cause it’ll cost me more in gas money and also it’s needs the same if not more maintenance then my current vehicle. I know my mom wants to me have it because it’s one of the few things of her mother’s that’s still here. I rather her sell the truck and pocket the money for herself then to create another financial burden. ",

      "description": "So to give some context about the situation. My dad and I are not on speaking terms for a variety of reasons. The most important one being, that through out middle school he physically abused me.\n\n\n\nIt started around the time I was going into middle school. He started getting into meth and drinking alcohol more. When he's drunk, he is very intimidating and has extreme disregard for others around him. I remember once that I went downstairs to ask if I could spend the night at my friends house. His gf at the time (who he also abused frequently) tells me and my friend that he's been drinking heavily and just passed out. Me being young and not knowing what was about to happen, woke him up. As he got up he fucking hit the wall and broke it. I was scared shitless since this has never happened before. I turn to run, and as I was going up the stairs, I turn around and see my friend get hit into the fridge that was down there. When that happened I rushed down there to help my friend, right as my dad turns to me and kicks me in my chest. I lost air in my lungs and I was completely scared. Well long story short me and my friend run to his house and called the police.\n\n\nWhen they arrived they talked to us separately. I told my side of what had happened, after they went to my house to talk to my dad. I was under the impression that they were going to arrest him. They didn't. My friend has bruises on his face, and I had a big one on my chest. They didn't do anything but tell me to call them if another incident like this happened again. \n\n\n\n\nThis was the first of the numerous times I would have called them. I ask AITA because my grandma who I am living with guilt trips me into forgiving him. I tell her over and over again I will never forgive my dad for the things he's done. Hell he's also been violent with her on multiple occasions. I love my grandma to death, but I hate it when she pulls that shit with me. \n\n\n\nSo AITA?\n\n",

My GF(we’re in 7th grade) comes by and says “there’s no more seats, I’m sitting here.” At first I’m like ok, I like to sit alone, but I had no choice here. But as she sits down I see a empty seat in the bus. So I say “Let me go sit there.” And she just sits there. I keep asking her to move, it’s nothing against her, it’s just that I’m a heavy claustrophobic person, and I like my space. So I keep asking and she just sits there. She seemed a little annoyed, which I am sorry for, but small spaces make me go crazy, the seat is empty, and she won’t move. Now the bus is moving, and we’re still sitting together.\n\nAITA for wanting to sit alone?",

      "description": "Hi reddit!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago I managed to sell a project of mine to a company, for a somewhat large amount of money (about 30k USD). My mother asked me if I could give her 3k of that to pay some debt she had gathered from back when her and my father had a fast food place. I accepted and gave her the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome months later she asked again to borrow 2.5k as an advance to pay 3 months rent on a new restaurant she said they wanted to rent to start a new catering business. She said she would give this back to me once the restaurant would be set up and running for a couple of months. This ended up never happening. She said she would get the money back but she never did. Since then my parents, along with my little brother have moved to another country. Now she says she will only be able to get it back when she comes back from abroad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a couple of months ago and one night my father calls me to tell me that my mother had cheated on him with one of her friends. My aunt then told me, at a later date, that my mom gave a lot of money to said friend to fuel his gambling addiction (which I suspect was a big portion of the 3k I initially gave her and probably all of the 2.5k I gave her later).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now, the situation has since been amended and my parent decided to remain together. Now, my mother talks to me as if nothing has happened and I just can't stand it. I don't want to talk to her anymore and I avoid most of her calls and I plan on telling her how I really feel.

      "description": "I'm sorry that the topic is something so sensitive, but this has been bugging me for the longest of time.\nA little bit of a backstory - I've been diagnosed with C-PTSD, and I experienced the lowest point of my life so far back on the 18th of June 2018 (1 day before my birthday). Since then I have recovered,and I am nearing to getting therapy, but I do have scars on my arms.\n\nAnyway, here's what happened.\nAt my school there is this girl, let's call her M. M is not very liked at our school, for various reasons. She hangs out with the worst people at school, one of her friends once got suspended for brining in beer to school and police got involved.\n\nAnyway, a few days after my attempt I was back in school with bandages on my arms, and we were lining up for P.E. I'm assuming she heard what happened to me and came up to me.\n\nI was just chatting to my friends while she, in front of everyone, pulls her sleeve up and says \"Oh, K (me) I did bad!\"\nAt that point, I still have not fully been over my attempt and yelled at her, \"Step away from me, don't show me that shit\". I looked away very quickly too. \n\nThis is where I think I was an asshole, I should've have explained to her to not show it to people, especially those who haven't themselves recovered from nearly being hospitalised because of cuts like that. I think my reaction was from impulse and general shock, but I should've handled it better. \n\nShe promptly put down her sleeve and walked to the back of our line. One of my friends noticed and asked me if I was okay, I said yes and we continued on with our day.\n\nI had heard that M did it to loads of other people around the school, and most of us think that she either does not know how to get help, or is doing it for attention. She literally walked up to classmates that tolerated her and showed off her cuts to them.\nI mostly dislike her because of her personality too (in my opinion she can be unbearable to be around sometimes), but this is a big reason as to why.\nI do not wish anything bad to happened to her, but I was very annoyed and shocked after it happened, and thinking about it that day almost made me want to do it myself. I do hope she stopped doing it, and she feels better. But I still pretty much hate her for it. \n\nI'm sorry if this is a bit difficult to read, I wanted to get this out of my chest, and get some opinions.\nAlso, I apologise if I don't respond to some messages, I struggle talking to most people online.\n\nTL:DR -\nGirl shows off her cuts to a large group of people, and classmates. When she shows it off to me, I yell at her to not show that shit to me. I feel extremely bad for it, but at the same time I'm not sure how I feel about myself. ",

We've since talked and are on a \"break\". \n\nMy girlfriend has a history of depression, anxiety and self harm.

I have no plans to do anything further since I'm not completely broken up with my current girlfriend.

      "description": "A little over 2 months ago gf and I were hanging out at my apt drinking and she got beyond shitfaced.  She passed out hard and I went to bed soon after.  I woke up in the middle of the night and my ass and legs are soaked.  I jump out of bed and turn the light on and she didn't stir at all, she had pissed the bed.  I was able to get her up and get the blankets and sheets off and replace them with a couple extra comforters, but it was still nasty.\n\nI could tell she was really embarrassed the next day and she kinda just bounced before I could say anything about it.  I figured she was pretty hung over so I'd give her some recovery time before I brought it up.  \n\nThe issue is I'm not working right now, I'm on disability.  I scrape by and replacing my mattress would take months and months of saving every extra cent.  She lives with her parents and works part time.  She has no bills.  I really feel like she should replace the mattress.\n\nI tried being as understanding and non judgmental about it as possible.  These things happen, at the same time I need a new mattress.  I told her I was fine with the cheapest option she could find that would fit the box spring.  She was just kinda quiet and agreed to replace it. \n\nAfter about a month of sleeping on a bed that still reeks (febreeze and bleach have done almost nothing) I asked her if she's been able to save up enough to get the mattress soon.  She blew up at me and told me she said she'll buy one and that's what she's going to do, but I need to stop bringing up because it's humiliating.   I get that and I backed off on it.\n\nWell it's over two months now and yesterday I saw on her fb selfies from the salon she goes to.  I know she spends well over $100 each trip there because one time she \"jokingly\" told me I should pay for her salon trips because she does it for me.  The only furniture I have in my apt is a couple folding chairs and my bed.  So I can't even sleep on a couch and wait for her to replace it.  It's gross.\n\nI don't want to embarrass her, but I'm sick of having to smell it.  I feel like she's just ignoring the situation I'm pretty irked that she'd treat herself to an expensive salon visit and show it off on fb, while I'm still living with her piss smell every night. \n\nI know I agreed not to bring it up again, but she's not following through and I feel like she's not going to unless I push the issue again.",

I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn’t want to see me anymore. \n\nI was upset but I gave him space thinking I’d talk to him and explain he doesn’t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it’s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.\n\nI get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don’t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.\n\nI apologize if there isn’t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn’t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. ",

Her immediate reaction was \"WHAT IS SHE DOING?! That's not a boy!!!\" Her aunt told me and my fiance about it and he refuses to tell her something simple like \"well, just like how a man and a woman can love each other, so can two girls or two guys.\"\n\nHe says \"let her be a child, she's too young to know about that stuff\". I say if she's old enough to know about heterosexual couples, she's old enough to know about gay/lesbian. To me it's the same if she had said that about a white/black couple. \n\nThis has been an ongoing issue with us, he says I'm too hard on her, that I need to just let her be.

      "description": "Jesus, I have a lot of these recently.\n\nSO, my last meeting, literally 3 days ago, the shift manager(SM) said Wednesday is the last day to set schedules, as that's when she makes them. To my knowledge, it was only the next week's schedule, as after that, within 2 days, it is printed out and put on the restaurant board. I asked my GM today about it, and he told me to notify him later, as well as the SM, and my immediate supervisor (IS) in a group chat. I thought everything was all well and good.\n\nHowever, I am desperately searching for a job to start my career. In an IT related field. And have an interview Monday and Tuesday, and had them scheduled literally 2 hours before I walked into work to ask my GM, *today*.\n\nAfter work, I put them in a group with myself, and asked. The GM said it was all well and good, the SM, however, was a different story. She told me *last Wednesday* was the last day to make schedule changes to that week. Not the Wednesday before. Then immediately posted to the main group the same general message, and that changes could not be guaranteed if it was done the week before. I gave them a *near exact* 7 days notice.\n\nI will be approximately 200 miles away. Days given off (or the less preferred, first day off, morning after that off, and work the second or closing shift. The drive will be a speedy one) or not. I need one of those jobs for the experience to a GREAT job I am targeting specifically, and the past two months *alone* have been dodgy on getting a call back (only 2, not including these, out of a modest minimum of 100 applications), let alone an in-person interview. They do know this, as I have talked about the potential of this happening before.\nAnd, despite the fact they told me I could walk out and not leave a two week notice if I plan to quit, I still plan on doing a wholehearted two weeks notice, as they have been accommodating, and I like my coworkers.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "I had a buddy that was my best friend for 15 years.  He went out on a couple of dates with a girl and that was the last I ever heard from him.  No reason, no responses from phone calls or texts, wouldn't answer his door if I swung by his house to make sure he was ok after not hearing from him.  After a month and a half of trying to contact him I called it quits with trying.\n\nFast forward 5 years to when he ran into my mom at a gas station and then all of a sudden he got my number from her and wants to hang out.  I've since started a family and he doesn't really know a thing about me anymore.  I end up hanging out with him and his now fiancee.  I don't even recognize him cause he's not even close to the same guy he used to be.  \n\nA couple months later I get an invite to his wedding and then a text to be part of his bachelor party.  I then come to find out that all of his groomsmen are the same guys we all grew up with and from the group texts I was in for the bachelor party that none of them ever got cut off like I did with everything they were talking about.  He never once gave me a reason for dipping out of my life for 5 years, even though I was the only person he did it to.  \n\nAITA for not going to the bachelor party and for sending in my rsvp for the wedding with a no?  I personally don't feel like going and hamging out with all the guys I grew up with who for some reason weren't shut out?  Not to mention that between the bachelor party and wedding it would cost me over $1,000.  \n\nTL:DR - Best friend of 15 years stopped talking to me out of nowhere and then 5 years later wants me to be part of his bachelor party and wedding and I said no.",

      "description": "My grandmother recently told me she wants to leave me her house when she passes. I'm not a fan of this for a number of reasons, but I said it was fine. She's stubborn and typically gets what she wants, so I figured it was best to accept and figure it out when the time comes. \n\nHowever, this eventually turned into \"I want to transfer the property to your name now so that the nursing home can't take it when I go in\", and now I really don't want to have anything to do with it. I've tried explaining to her that the nursing home can't seize her house, and that Medicaid would only place a lien against her house if she can't pay for her care and it's within 5 years (which is not likely to happen). She's in good health and it will likely be several years before she has to go into a home. During that time, the house will be in my name, but she will live there and continue to pay the mortgage until such a time that she needs to go into a nursing home. \n\nI don't see the point to it being in my name. If anything happens to the house, I'm liable for it. If the worst case scenario happened and she needed the cash sooner sooner than later, I'd sell the house and give her the money anyways. Even if neither of those things happen, at best I'm left with a $80k mortgage on a house that I don't want and can't afford, so I'd still sell it. She's still under the impression that I'd move in once she goes into a home, despite my insistence that I would likely no longer live in the same state and have no desire to own property in her city. She still wants to do this her way, and I'm incredibly uncomfortable with it. \n\nWIBTA for refusing to put her house in my name? I'd I do, there's a good chance she won't leave me the house in her will, which at this point I'm okay with. ",

      "description": "Our dog has been with my family for over 8 years and she is around 13 years old. Half a year ago she developed cancer in her mouth and the doctor said it's terminal. I moved out of the house and across country before she had cancer so I didn't see how it happened (or spot the tumor). I'm visiting my family now and she is in a really bad state. Her tumor is the size of a golf ball in her gums. When she eats she is constantly piercing through the gums so it is an open infected wound. She bleeds so much that her fur is stained with blood. Her tumor is so infected that you can smell it 5 feet away. They can't even bathe her because she cries hard and they're scared of hurting her. Not only that but she is going blind and deaf. She doesn't play with the other dogs anymore, she doesn't recognize or acknowledge us, and all she does the whole day is stay in the corner of the garage sleeping. I suggested that we euthanize her because for me it was obvious that she is suffering. But they do not want to be because she still has appetite and she takes painkillers so she doesn't feel the pain. I would be happy if she continued living out her life and died naturally IF they gave her a good quality of life but they don't. She has always been an outdoor dog but during the day she would stay in the house. Now, she isn't even allowed in the house because of her smell. She is covered in filth and no one cleans her. These are supposed to be her last moments and she should be pampered and spoiled, but it's like she is avoided. It breaks my hear to see her this way. \n\nAfter suggesting this to my family, they reacted as if I was a monster for wanting to kill our dog. I got extremely emotional about it because I believe it is the ethical thing to do. I don't want to wait until she is in extreme pain. I want to give her a good last couple of days (shower her with food and love) and end her life in a controlled situation where she isn't alone. When I got emotional, they acted as if I was being a huge drama queen. I've been going through this situation in my head for the last couple of days. I'm trying to understand their point. She isn't technically my dog anymore since I don't live here but I grew up with her too. So, am I the asshole for wanting to put her down even if she isn't in pain (so they think) and still has a good appetite? ",

      "title": "AITA for not taking her to the concert after all?",
      "description": "This happened a year ago but now that I found this sub I'm curious to see what people think.\n\nSo last Christmas, my parents got me concert tickets. I was really excited about it. They got me two. I mentioned this to my friend, Ellie, just in a \"Oh my parents' got me this great gift!\" kind of way and she immediately started squealing, all excited that \\*we\\* were going to a concert. I didn't really correct her- the concert was not for another couple months, and it was very likely that I would invite her, but I hadn't then. Ellie comes from a LOT of money, and is pretty entitled with a lot of things. She once threw out a manual can opener because she wanted an electric one and \"manual can openers are for poor people\". Yes. Really. \n\nHowever, here's where I think I effed up. My parents got me two tickets. Ellie, assuming I would of course take her, asked if I could buy an additional 2 tickets so that her fiance and the guy I was talking to could come. I pushed back, said I didn't want to plan so far out, that I was just getting to know the guy I was talking to, that I didn't want to risk it. The tickets were expensive. After more back and forth, I did buy the tickets. Ellie was very much under the impression that I was taking her and I was definitely not correcting her, again because there was a good chance I would've taken Ellie and her fiance had everything stayed as it was. Also important to note, Ellie picked me up a bottle of wine at some point at my request. When I went to pay her for it, she declined and said something about how it was her concert ticket payment. I assumed she was joking, the bottle of wine was maybe $15 and her and her fiance's tickets combined were over $200. \n\nAnyways, like I said, I likely would have taken Ellie to the concert had things stayed the same. But they didn't. She started blowing off my texts and calls, and our plans in general. We made plans to go get lunch after classes one day, and she was going to pick me up from campus. It was raining. I waited for her for 20 minutes before she texted me and said she wasn't coming after all. Whenever I tried to talk to her about it, she would tell me she was busy and that I couldn't understand because my major was \"basically basket weaving\". If it matters, she is a nursing major and I am political science. My closest friend is an engineering major, and my other good friend is biology and pre-med, I totally understand when they don't have time for me, but I do expect the common courtesy of \"hey, I'm not going to be able to make it\" instead of just not showing up. \n\nAny time we did talk, she had something cruel to say about my other friends, the guys I liked, the clothes I wore. Hanging out with guys made me a whore, and the guy I liked wasn't good looking enough, and I was giving people the wrong idea by drinking at bars. That kind of stuff. I wound up blocking her and her fiance from viewing my social media because whenever they did, it opened the door for them to be critical. \n\nSo with the concert coming up, I hadn't seen Ellie or had a pleasant nonconfrontational conversation with her in several months. The guy I liked had broken things off. So I went with three close guy friends of mine. Ellie \\*\\*freaked\\*\\* out. Her text to follow:\n\n \"You literally were such a weasel about this whole situation I didn't even want to have a conversation with you about it bc I would rip your head off and I've been so busy I haven't wanted to get worked up about it.  Do I need to just draw it out step by step? Bc obviously humanities has drained all your neurons.\n\nA: you gave away the tickets without even asking which is a weasel move. If you wanted to just give them away bc we haven't been hanging out then you could have just told me before hand and had the consideration to alert me\n\nB: even tho I only bought you 1 bottle of wine and have all the money in the world it was rude as shit for you not to offer to pay me back considering I bought it for you in exchange for a ticket and had gotten you another already \n\nC: the fact you made it look like you weren't going to the concert yourself and that you gave away all the tickets but actually you just sold the ones that me and (fiance) were going to use\" \n\nIt got uglier after that, I eventually cut her and her fiance both out of my life. I've never felt I was in the wrong but I'm curious what other people think. To be totally clear, I paid for/was gifted all four tickets. The closest thing to payment Ellie gave me was a $15 bottle of wine. I didn't even know about the second one, if that matters, because I thought who the hell would think that is an equal tradeoff. And I have no idea why she was under the impression I wasn't going to the concert myself. I never said anything to that effect. I think probably because she figured out I'd taken her and her fiance off my social media, but that happened weeks prior. \n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:\\*\\* Made loose promises to take friend and her fiance to a concert, she started to act like kind of a crappy friend so I took other people, she FREAKED out. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So my step dad has been living with my mother and I for two years. He's 40 now, doesn't do the dishes, cook, complains if  we make food with too many brassicas, is way to defensive of his dog (who has literally bitten multiple children, including myself), listens to heavy metal music way too loudly (even if you ask him to stop) and if you try to bring any of these things up to him he throws a hissy fit and leaves. So I have a tendency to criticize him for his lack of doing things (or just doing things in a really strange way that either doesn't work or barely does), because I honestly feel like no one else does.\n\nThe problem is that he and my mother had a daughter last year (she's not the problem I love her). But I think my mom feels trapped with him, she's even admitted that if she didn't have my little sister the two of them would have split up a long time ago. She feels like she can't she can't leave him, and I understand why she feels like that and I don't think she should unless she really thinks she needs to. \n\nsince you probably want an example: \n\nThe other day, he put my little sister in her high chair and didn't buckler in or put the tray in front of her so that she couldn't fall out and proceeded to wheel her across the kitchen while she almost fell out. I told him the he should strap her in, and he started ranting about how I shouldn't tell him to how raise his kid, he knows more than me because he's older, ect. Even thought I spend more time with his kid than he does.\n\nOur room mate (his long time friend) won't tell him when he doesn't shit wrong, and has the tendency to say \"Oh that's just how he is\". My mom sees that there is a problem, but whenever she tries to bring it up they either end up kiss (without actually resolving the conflict) or he gets all pissy and leaves.\n\nSo am I the asshole for criticizing him, even when I know he's not going to change no matter how much he needs to?",

I told him to take it or leave it, and he continued to argue and berate me, so I assume he won't take it.  So from here on, I'm only giving him his legal visitation of 2 hours every other Saturday.

      "description": "*High School moral dilemma alert*\nSo, I met this guy (I'll be calling him A) in high school and we were nothing but classmates, I actually don't recall ever talking to him at all, that is until I talked to a teacher about one of his friends (Let's call him L) making unwanted sexual remarks to my friend and I and overall making us feel uncomfortable, for all I know L didn't have any consequences but that didn't stop him from telling his friends (Including A) lies along the lines of 'I just asked her for a pencil and she got all offended and freaked out on me'.\nThis prompted to L and A having a public conversation in the classroom groupchat where they called me uptight, ugly and basically too undesirable and not sexually attractive enough to be treated the way I said I was. This is common behavior with girls they don't get along with and if it wasn't obvious by L not getting consequences, the school doesn't usually take action in reprimanding students so I let it pass.\n\nMonths after, A failed a couple of subjects, but there was one in particular where he failed HARD, and that's a class that i'm particularly good at, and to be fair it was quite a hard and long exam, so when he got the chance to redo it, A contacted my friend and I separately, asking if he could borrow our exams to study. Long story short, we ignored his message and later his mom would come out to talk about how his son asked for study guides to a couple of classmates but didn't get an answer, and she was quite angry about it.\nI talked about this with a couple of people and some of them told me i should have helped him, and I'm honestly conflicted because a part of me thinks I could have easily taken a weigh off his shoulders if i hadn't been petty about something that happened months before, where he was probably being misled to believe i brought L's behavior to light out of need of attention, and that he was in a way supporting his friend and not doing it out of malice, but another part of me thinks it's ok i didn't help, because he was talking that way about me in a public matter where he knew I could see it (God knows what he might have said in private) and then nonchalantly asking me for my exam to \"study\" from it instead of opening a book and studying like the rest of us.\nBoth seem perfectly valid and i'm just kinda looking for guidance to apologize if i should, so, AITA?\n",

      "description": "[20M] Yesterday I uploaded a picture to Instagram where I was in a nightclub with a friend. In the picture I'm wearing a cap, a blue flower patterned t-shirt, and holding a bucket filled with booze that we two and other friend, who took the picture, were drinking from.\nLater on I get a text from my mother saying that the picture made me look awful upon others, asking who my friend was, and also saying that I had awful taste and was shaming my family (yes, literally). At the time she also told my dad to check out the \"embarrassing\" and \"tasteless\" picture, and I had a talk with him but it doesn't add anything here. \nWhat I answered to my mother was something like this:\n\n\n\"I knew this time would come, and this is exactly why I blocked you until some months ago. It's my own Instagram profile, not yours, and I think I have the right age to know what I can and can't upload. As I also think I have the right criteria to dress by myself and get the haircut I want (I'm balding so I shaved my head), without caring about you approving it. If you don't like what I upload you're free to unfollow me, nobody's forcing you to follow me.\"\n\n\nAbout my mother's side of the story, I don't know too much because she's away at my uncle's house. Supposedly my uncle saw the picture and told my mother that I was making a fool of myself or something like that. And there she went, messaged me about it and also told my father. She never approved me wearing caps, argumenting that they are lowly and tasteless, but as I shaved my head that day I was feeling kind of conscious and went to the club with a cap on, which I bought myself and really like how it suits me. My friend was also wearing a cap and a Hawaiian shirt, two pieces of clothing she hates (I also have some Hawaiian shirts myself) and so she came to the conclusion that my friend, who I talked to her about before, is sort of a bad person because of the way he dresses. \nI'm guessing that my flowered t-shirt isn't a problem since she bought it for me. \n\n\nTo conclude, she read the message but didn't reply anything. I've been feeling kind of shitty and depressed because I'm sick of her trying to control me and shaming me for the things about me that she doesn't like, but also because I feel that I was too harsh on what I said. I felt like this was the last straw but maybe I was kind of a bastard as well. So, am I the asshole here?\n\n\nNote: my mother doesn't know all my friends, including the one from the picture who I know from college: she only knows the ones I have since preschool. ",

      "description": "This is a bit long so there’s a TL;DR at the bottom\n\nA little background first. I have two friends that I’ve known for awhile that in the last couple months I’ve introduced them to each other. They hit it off and the guy has a thing for the girl. She’s made it clear to me on many occasions that she does not want to date him but continues to accept his attention (they’ve hooked up before). Though I suspect that she does actually secretly harbours some feelings due to some of her actions.\n\nNow the issue is while hanging out with the guy a couple days ago he ends up asking me if she likes him or if she’s said anything to me about it. This puts me in a weird situation because I don’t want to lie to my friend but I don’t want to betray the others friends trust. The gist of what I say is “I don’t know for sure, she might, or she might not. Don’t ask her on a date unless you know for sure” Female friend texts me later that night and she’s livid. She asks me to explain myself and tell me what I said to our friend. I pretty much tell her the contents of this post and that I didn’t say any actual info. Friend proceeds to ignore all my texts and calls for the next couple days and I’m left trying to figure out what happened. \n\nTurns out male friend ended up getting wasted that night and drunk texting his crush (my friend) which leads her to believe I’ve told him things she’s told me in confidence. My issue is that I didn’t find out that he texted her until now and I was left confused and concerned after she ghosted me for days ignoring my texts and calls without letting me know what happened. \n\nCould I have made a better choice? Should I have not said anything? Am I a bad friend? AITA?\n\nTL;DR: friend ignores me for days without telling me why she’s mad because she’s upset that I told our  mutual friend that she may or may not like him.",

      "description": "I love my boyfriend dearly but he's really close with this other girl. Close as in not just friendly, but physically. They do things that make everyone think they're a couple like laying on eachother's laps, hugging for the entire hour, laying heads on shoulders, runing hands down hair, sides, and thighs, and sitting on eachother's laps. My friends even tell me that my boyfriend gropes her breasts and crotch and she lets him do it\n\nI have anxiety issues in general, so this is really messing with me and giving me nightmares. I don't mind him being friends with her; he has plenty of female friends, but he's not that touchy with any others.\n\nI've talked to him about it and cried about it because it really bothers me but they just won't stop. He took me to therapy about it once. He told me he won't grope her private parts anymore, but they're still going to be touchy everywhere else.\n\nSome context: my boyfriend has cheated before; He actually cheated in his last relationship which was back in the summer, which is why I'm so paranoid. He has also dated this girl before, but now they're just friends, and since they've known eachother for a while, that's why they are like they are... the thing is that they didn't talk for a couple years, and just as of late November they got back in touch.\n\nAm I being too jealous?

      "description": "Throwaway because of personal info\n\nA bit of backstory:\n\nI’m 18 and I moved out of home when I was 16. I’m back temporarily because my university course was correspondence only for this term, and now that it’s over (it ended a week ago) I’m job hunting so I can move out again. I’ve been home for about 3 months and am likely going to be here for another two. I’ve paid my parents rent the entire time I’ve been here, every week on the dot, the exact amount they request. I also pay for my own food and rarely eat theirs unless it’s a dinner they’ve specifically made for everyone. \n\nMy car is 100% mine. Even though I’m only 18 I purchased it with completely my own money that I earned from working full time. I pay all my own insurance and registration and gas. \n\nNow, I’ve often woken up at around 10am (it’s my uni break week, cut me some slack) to find my keys gone from my handbag and my car gone. My dad is usually the one who borrows it but my mum does occasionally too. They NEVER put gas money in and right now gas is about $1.60 AU per litre in my part of Australia (according to my math that’s $4.60 US per gallon). \n\nThey rarely return my keys and I have to go looking for them myself. If I hide my keys, they get upset and make excuses that “your car has better aircon so it’s not hot” or “your car is safer in case of a crash” and “your car is better to put groceries in” as I have a large SUV while my mum has a small sedan and my dad has an uncovered ute. I’ve even been woken up at around 6 because my dad wants my keys to take my car to work. \n\nWhy I don’t want them using my car:\n\nMy dad leaves my car a mess, and always changes my radio station and leaves the volume on max. I keep my car completely spotless as it’s a relatively newer car that I’m very proud of, and it pisses me off to get in and find used soda bottles on the ground and receipts everywhere. My mum is clean but she is an awful driver and her car is covered with dents and scratches from her hitting things. Both of their cars are perfectly usable, they just want to use mine because it’s newer and nicer. \n\nI feel obligated to let them use my car because they’re letting me live with them while I job search. Would I be the asshole if I straight up told them I don’t want them using my car? ",

      "description": "So I'm roommates with one of my best friends in the world. I love living with her 90% of the time but recently she has been getting on my nerves. \n\nWe've always been very open about sharing things. It's usually not a problem for me - we only have so much cabinet space and we don't need 2 jars of every spice for example. As long as no one uses the last of my stuff or replaced it, I've normally been very chill about. She has never used my stuff excessively. Until this year. \n\nShe has been exclusively using my stuff. And not just a little bit. I had a jug of olive oil from Costco and she probably used 75% of it without paying a dime for it. She uses my cheese all the time. I was really excited to eat see Mac and cheese only to find that she had helped herself to the best flavors in the variety pack. She doesn't even ask and just helps herself. \n\nIt would be one thing if she helped pay for this or if I used the stuff she bought equally as frequently, however she only buys things that I don't like (and therefore wouldn't buy). \n\nWe only have until May in this apartment (we'll be graduating college). I'm kinda at the end of my rope with this. I don't want to rock the boat and have a miserable last semester of college and be an asshole to one of my best friends by suddenly reversing my open sharing policy. But I also don't want to subsidize all hereals because I really don't have the money to do that to begin with. I don't have a meal plan in order to save money but she still has a meal plan. \n\n\nSo, WIBTA if I told her she wasn't allowed to use my stuff anymore? ",

      "description": "So I already know this subs opinion with trans women and dating. I’m always very open about it and always inform the guy/girl that I’m talking to that I’m transgender well before the first date. Yes, I do it to be fair to them, but mostly I do it so I can reduce the chances of me getting my dumb ass murdered. And if the gender settings have a transgender option,  I’ll chose it. But on top of all of this,  I also put that I’m trans at the very top of my bio, which is usually the only thing people actually read. \nMy issue is that I keep on attracting guys who only either fetishize me or just want me as a notch on their bedpost and I’m going crazy because of it. I’m super tired of hookups and just want a genuine relationship. So I think taking at least that one line off my bio would hopefully class up the kinds of people I’m matching with. \nObviously if I took it off I’d still inform people before meeting up that I was trans in case there are any issues with that and I’d still keep the same gender options.  But I don’t wanna lie to anyone or get murdered( can’t stress that one enough) and I don’t want this to come off as deceitful . \nSo WIBTA if I took off the part in my dating bio that says I’m trans?

She will send me multiple texts, snapchats, or DMs before I respond. Sometimes this is because I am busy, other times I just don’t feel like texting. I just don’t get as much satisfaction out of texting her as I do out of spending time with her in person.\n\nBy no means do I ignore her, but I definitely don’t text her as frequently as she wants me to. If I don't respond to her for a while, she will text me things like “Helloooo” or “You’re ignoring me”, or she’ll just double/triple text me until I respond.\n\nI’ve come to find this kind of annoying, but I’ve mostly kept it to myself because I didn’t want to make it into something big, but the other day we got in a argument and I kind of blew up at her for “pestering me.”\n\nI know ITA for the way I told her about this feeling, but AITA for feeling like this in the first place?",

Today, we had a bell ringer on molecular electron shells, (electron dot structure, pi and sigma bonds, that kind of stuff) and she did quite poorly. Since I had to grade it, I noticed this and told her that she needs to pay more attention in class. After that, she just put her head down and nearly started crying. I didn't say anything because I have the social skills of a broken dust pan, and just kind of left her to sit.\n\nLater, at lunch, she yelled at me for not apologizing. I told her that if she was having trouble with the lesson in the first place, that she should have gone to ask the teacher. She said that she didn't ask him about it because she didn't feel safe around him because of something that happened with her mother's student teacher a few years back. \n\nI feel awful about the whole thing, but I still think that she should have asked someone, even if it wasn't the teacher, about the lesson, and I've agreed to help her out with the lesson.

      "description": "So back when I was dating my ex we both got back into Old School Runescape, she had an account, and I had two accounts. Her account got banned for botting, so I decided to let her use my other account as her main. \n\nI broke up with her about half a year ago, and around the time we broke up I had recovered my other account back that she was using. \n\nSeems like a dickhead move right? - I can understand that. Keep in mind though, I took this girl on a business-class trip, full expense paid Vacation to Europe, I bought her food all the time since she wasn’t working and always claimed to have “no money” (she gave her dude friend $20 to hit on an older lady at the bar, obviously she ain’t as tight on money as she says) and she was a very dependable person in the sense she can almost never be alone, so I had little to no free-time of my own and she lived an hour away while she was going to school. I wasn’t a dick to her besides the occasional arguing and yelling, I definitely made some mistakes but that’s not really the point of all this.\n\nI had quit OSRS before we broke up, and at one point I had given her absolutely all of my items worth value. I messaged her one day asking her if I can have some of my stuff back, to which she says no because she sold most of it and is actively playing so she needs the money. I said alrighty then. It was at this point I recovered the account. The account hasn’t been used for months, and was not a member. This made me pretty pissed off, she was that spiteful as to lie over something as so stupid as virtual items, so in my head I just said “Fuck you, I’m keeping this account. If you can spend $20 on something as stupid as a joke you can buy yourself a fucking OLD SCHOOL RUNESCAPE ACCOUNT.”\n\n1. If she had simply helped me out I gladly would’ve just let her have the account and we can just live our lives.\n\n2. Once she figured out I recovered the account, she started blowing me the fuck up, I’ll provide a blurred screenshot of all the things she said. But even when trying to talk about it rationally she just swore me and condemned me, telling me to commit suicide, etc. you get the gist.\n\n\nI pretty much said go fuck yourself at that point.\n\n\nFew months later, \n\nI had a bit of a personal and very emotional event happen to me, and in the anguish I decided to text her because I just needed help in the moment. We established some sort of middle ground again, and it was actually kind of nice. I was reflecting on the previous events, and I knew she put some work into that account (graceful outfit) so I asked her if she wanted it back. She said she would appreciate it, so I changed the password and told her she can change the email to her own. \n\nThis is how the convo unfolded:\n\nHer:“You took my fucking stuff?”\n\nMe: “Yeah, it’s been months and this is my account. Aren’t you glad you’re even getting it back at all?”\n\n“You’re a piece of shit give it back to me now”\n\n“I mean I can give you some gold...I’m literally giving you an entire account to be yours and you’re really talking to me like this?”\n\n“Lmao fuck off”\n\n\nEnd of conversation. \nI sent her a final goodbye message and I’m never letting her back in again, and I’m not even as spiteful as to recover the account again a second time, I care nothing for it. This bitch didn’t even wish my father a Merry Christmas when he provided her with a job to pay off her car. Even after informing her that my dad was sad she never told her Merry Christmas, to which she replied “I will” she never fucking did. I think I have a little more reason to be upset than she does over a stupid fucking video game.\n\nSorry for the very long post, I just don’t have very many friends anymore and I need some insight as this to me is literally the most childish thing I’ve ever heard of, but let me know your thoughts. I tried to hold back as much bias as I could... but hopefully you can see why there might be some. \n\nAm I the Asshole? \n\n\n",

      "description": "I keep trying to post the full story but despite how I've edited it down, apparently it STILL exceeds the 3000 character limit (even though the word count says under 3000.) So I'll summarise:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Two years ago I'm on a night out and after coming over and asking me for a lighter, this random girl starts basically chatting me up\n\n\\- Two years later and my band are playing a gig with who  turns out to be her boyfriend's band, small world that it is, and she's there\n\n\\- After eyeballing each other for a bit trying to be sure if we actually recognise each other, this girl comes over to me to ask me if I once spoke to her outside a bar. Weird, we both remember each other\n\n\\- We're chatting for a bit, things are going well, then her boyfriend emerges, says he's getting a drink and she leaves me to goes with him\n\n\\- Later on her boyfriend makes a comment to me about how I'm apparently chatting her up. When I ask what he meant, he tells me that when he asked her what she was talking to me about earlier, she said I approached her! Why would she lie about me like that?\n\n\\- Also, I get word that the pair of them have been together nearly three years. So, she was with him that night and seemingly tried to cheat on him with me.\n\n\\- They met when she - surprise surprise - came up to him and asked him for a light on a night out!\n\n\\- At the end of the night I take the boyfriend aside, and explain everything to him. He seems absolutely gutted, and can't believe she'd do that to him\n\n\\- He goes back over to her and a massive argument ensues. He mentions how he's always had suspicions about her. She says that he doesn't care about her. She also accuses me of lying and trying to break them up.\n\n\\- Now, word has it that they're \"on a break.\" He's living at a friends, she's moved back into her old flatmate's flat. And apparently it's come out that she cheats on him all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd like to think I spoke to him because I was doing the right thing. Letting this dude know that his girlfriend is, at the very least, chatting up other guys, while clearing my own name which she tried to slander. But then I feel that part of me did it out of spite. Seeing this really beautiful girl, who I felt I should have been with, spend all night being all lovey dovey with her, admittedly, below average looking boyfriend who seems like a bit of an idiot. Maybe deep down I was just looking for an excuse to throw a spanner in the works.",

The women are usually not in the shot or their faces are obscured so I have not heard many complaints before. I am the subject of the photos.\n\nI also enjoy hanging mirrors in the bedroom so I can watch myself penetrate women. I do this for my own reasons. I take very good care of my body, performing routine daily exercise with a strict diet, coupled with my application of a variety of skin care lotions and face masks. \n\nBefore intercourse my tinder date verbally protested to both the mirrors and the camera when I asked, even though I explained that she would not be the subject of the photos. \n\nShe was very offended by me asking and we did not fuck. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

It when reading through comments here its just way over the top with the negative judgement to the point that a person may not learn anything from the situation presented but in turn get defensive because their character is being destroyed.\n\nThis is not to say that if someone is wrong to not let them know they are (even with some tough love at times) but saying they are the worst person is just alot. This is a place to learn from another perspective what you've done wrong and correct it not offer yourself up to the hangman. \n\nNo one is perfect. Not everyone is the same age, or has had the same upbringing, or same experiences in life.

She attends our local college. Me and both my parents work full-time. About 2-3 times a week, I'll cook dinner for the house. I do dishes,  vacuum, clean the pet tanks, snoblow as often as I can when I'm home. My sister on the other hand will never in her life jump to help with anything that doesn't benefit her. She won't do the dishes because she \"doesnt like doing them\"  and that is literally the only chore we ask of her, since we can never convince her to do any other thing. \n\nToday, she needed me to drive her around to and from college, so since she had an hour before departure, I asked her to do the half sink of dishes, to such she replied LAUGHING \"No, I'm gonna watch some videos before I leave\"  Things begin to get heated with me explaining she needs to help and that she does nothing. This is where I'm curious if I'm the asshole. She says \"You don't even do anything, why should I?\" So I snap, calling her a manipulative selfish piece of shit that wouldnt get off her ass to help anyone, screaming at her face almost to the point of tears. \n\nAm I justified or was it too much? The anger of her being so lazy and the audacity of saying I do nothing just built up in me and I lost control. ",

I go to investigate and I found out that my roommate with the 2 other people he had over were smoking weed in my basement. I asked him what the fuck he was doing and explained to him that we could get evicted and possibly expelled.

So we technically have two bosses.\n\nUs three coordinators do a pretty good job of covering for each other.\n\nI woke up today feeling sick. I was shivering but sweating, with muscle aches. I would have called out sick. However, 'C' has been out on vacation for a week and comes back tomorrow. Monday mornings are crucial because it's when we all send out calls and go over what came in over the weekend. I did not want to just throw 'L' to the wolves so I went in. I told everyone to not get close to me. I covered my mouth when speaking. I told everyone I was just in for an hour so I could get everything lined up in a way 'L' could easily take over. Everyone told me to stay the hell away, thanks for being a trooper, but go home asap.\n\nI called my supervisor and told him my plans. He asked me to tough it out and stay until noon. \n\nI was pretty upset and mentioned it to 'L' that I would be staying because my boss didn't think she could cover all the divisions, even though we have all done it before.\n\nAbout thirty minutes later she came in and said \"Please go home, just tell me what you need me to do.\" I called my supervisor on the way home to let him know.\n\nNow he's upset because he asked me to stay and 'L' doesn't have the authority to send me home.\n\nI already felt like an asshole for showing up sick, even if briefly.

      "description": "So today I saw a post in Overwatch University after about an hour had its upvote/downvote counter still hidden, had zero comments, and reddit gold.  I was surprised to see that the post with seemingly no public response at the time of viewing had already gotten gold.  So I in jest posted the first comment on the post asking \"did you gild yourself lul\".  After about an hour I came back to see the post had spiked a little in popularity but my comment had struck a nerve with OP.  My comment had been downvoted into oblivion and OP had replied to me saying how hard they worked on it, how fucking awful the assertion would be if i was wrong, that its pretty scummy to pull shit like that and how I should keep my \"witchhunty\" comments to myself.  I saw the error in my ways and apologized stating that personally did see anything wrong with self advertising via gilding the post especially with an informative guide and that I thought I was finally viewing the phenomenon first hand.  I felt bad and was trying to make it clear that I wasn't trying to discredit OP merely attempting to point out something that I initially felt was obvious.  OP then again responded saying that they appreciated the apology but that comments had damaged their reputation and that my downvoted comment has been hidden mitigating the damage.  However I later noticed that something people shared my view in that OP did nothing wrong if they gilded their own post, but those comments were also downvoted even though they were in support of OP regardless of the situation.  Overall I feel bad for hijacking their post, but i feel a little brigaded in my attempts to soothe and remedy any hurt feelings.  So i guess again AITA for thinking that gilding one's own post isn't all that bad and suggesting someone did that after seeing a post with seemingly no exposure.\n\nAnd if any one wants to see the post I can make an edit, but I don't know if thats against the rules, and I certainly don't want to counter brigade or make any more trouble/drama.",

Right after she told me I went to get tested and thankfully everything came back negative. I feel so bad for leaving her because she was born with the disease so it’s not her fault she has it. When we started seeing each other she started making an effort to take her HIV medication on a regular basis, workout, eat healthy, and even decided to go back to school I...As someone who still loves her, I want her to continue doing all of those things even without me in her life.

      "description": "I just wanna know because I'm feeling pretty bad about it. Names were altered for privacy.\n\nLast night me and 4 squad members were coming home from a road trip. We're all 17, having fun and staying clean. We had scouted an isolated nature reserve hike on the way there, and figured we'd climb it on the way back. It was a tad cold (we live in a very warm place). The drive was at a high altitude, so the air was thin.\n\nOnce we had gotten to the hike, we discovered it was pretty steep. We had finished the hike up in about 10 minutes. My friend, Daniel, was having a bit of trouble with the thin air. He said he was alright so we continued. One of us mentioned that we should make sure to not split up.\n\nThe top of the hike was cold, and not particularly interesting. We had spotted a wide path downwards into a spooky forest. Before we even realized, our friend John was running down the path, probably as a joke. I ran after him, and we kept running. We probably wouldn't have run as far if I wasn't chasing him.\n\nOnce I had caught up to him, we thought it would be funny to hide and scare our boys. We started climbing back up the path cutting through trees rather than the designated path. Our friends knew we were hiding, and had discovered our location relatively quickly. We were about 50 feet away, hiding behind trees in the forest. John got a call from one of them, calling him some bad names, but I didn't hear most of it. \n\nOnce we had found our way back to the top of the hike, we sat down to take a breath. We heard them on their way back up. We played a song out loud, hoping they would locate us at the top (it was very dark). \n\nOnce they had found us, Daniel fell down onto his knees and started hyperventilating for several minutes. We were all comforting him, and the other two were angry at me and John. I didn't realize it at the time, but they were pissed. Me and John thought it was in good fun. \n\nThin atmosphere and exercise is not a good combination. What I didn't know at the time is that Daniel is an incredibly superstitious person. I found this out several hours later. While me and Josh were hiding, Daniel was freaking out. The forest was scary, and he didn't wanna split from his friends. Since there were three of them, any sort of split to avoid going into the forest would mean someone was alone. So they all went together.\n\nAs Daniels hyperventilating slowed down, me and John were feeling awful. We made our way down, comforting Daniel as much as we could. We returned to the car, and everyone was able to calm down. John was beating himself up over it. He said he would just call an uber, but we obviously wouldn't let him; we were 40 miles away from civilization, it was night time, and it was cold. \n\nThere were no hard feelings after it all; we went to Daniel's house and played some Jackbox. Me and John still feel bad about it. It makes me wonder, am I the asshole? And while you're at it, is John the asshole?",

This school is kinda different because all classes are in French and the students follow the French programs but it's not in a French speaking country.\n\nAnyway, they recently did a mock version of  the final exam. A couple of them did good enough and the rest were disastrous, their style was awful and most of the time it looked like an alien language, because they mix French with other languages (English and their mother tongue). Keep in mind, this particular group of students is specially focused in literature.\n\nAnyway, so of course I started scolding them, since most of them want to study in France I told them that the French students would eat them alive and that I couldn't understand how some of them were applying to prestigious schools or to study Literature.\n\nThen I saw one of my students look stricken. She's one of the few who did well in the exam and also one of the few who intends to study Literature. At the moment I didn't think much of it, but a few minutes after I let them go home I saw her crying.\n\nI'm not sure wether she was crying because of me but I wonder, AITA\n",

      "description": "So the other day I had to get a certified copy of some personal documents. After waiting in line for half an hour or so it was my turn to go up to the window. I had a few questions but before I could get a single word out the lady behind the counter demanded for my ID. I attempted to ask some questions but she kept talking over me. In addition  after that I tried to pay for the copy fees with my credit card and the lady snapped at me and said NO I cant take this payment this line is cash only.\n\nAt this point I got angry and snapped at her and said \"That is ridiculous. The sign says cash taken right over there.\" Immediately after the lady behind the counter acted as as if I snapped at her for no reason and implied I should giver her a apology (I did not I walked off with out saying another word to her after she gave my back my ID). Anyways I was able to find the right line and pay for and receive my documents at the end of the day so nothing too bad came of the whole incident. \n\nAs a side note I noticed that the lady who I had trouble with was pretty impatient and snappy with other people in line as well. I heard her snap at another person in line \"I am the one who is asking the questions here not you\" And she had a whole other patience issue with some people who had trouble speaking fluent English.\n\nNow as a cashier at a restaurant I had my share of bad days and people to deal with and maybe the lady I had a problem with had something happen I did not get to see. But at the same time I expect better service especially since I know exactly what it is like to work behind a counter and work and deal with other people. And furthermore if I did half of what the lady did I would definitely have revived a talking too from my manager about providing better service and being more patient with people. \n\nSo would I be an asshole if I filed a complaint against the worker and the government office in question and would I be a less of a asshole if I tried to resolve the issue with the office directly instead of getting higher powers involved?",

She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "A little backstory. I struggle with mental illness and trauma and have tons of triggers that I’m currently working on getting over but it’s exhausting to see them all the time. When I see them I usually just scroll past or block the post\n\nNow onto the conflict.\nOne of my good friends constantly posted triggering content on Instagram, including sexual posts even though she’s 15 and things about gore and wounds. I expressed my discomfort with what she was posting and said that I was going to unfollow because i couldn’t deal with seeing that all the time, and i also suggested that she set her account to private if she’s going to post sexual content or stop posting it all together because she’s a minor. She instantly blocked me on almost every platform and got my other friend to block me and side with her. I lost 2 friends of multiple years because I unfollowed one of them. AITA? Should I have tried harder to work past the triggering stuff rather than unfollow?",

      "description": "Quick background, I'm part of a large group of friends who get together on occasions, mostly via Facebook events.  We all have our quirks, but there's this one guy I'll randomly call \"Freud\" just for so...   EVERYONE'S got something negative to say about Freud, mostly that he's CONSTANTLY making two or three events a month, excessively goes into details about what time we'll start one thing and then start another, and plans these things POORLY because they tend to fall apart halfway through.   When someone makes a suggestion or plans another thing that's on or near the same day, he has a freak attack and demands they reschedule, or if he can't make THEIR event, that they should reschedule to accomodate HIM.   If you decline his event, he demands to know why you can't make it, and tries to barter with you to come anyway....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this holiday, he wanted to host a Christmas gathering, starting at dinner at some resturant, then to someone's home for gift polyannas and games.  Why he won't host it at his own place, I don't know....  But after going through a line of people, he asked my husband and I if we could have the after-party at our apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMind you, our apartment is pretty small and can't hold more than 12 people comfortably for a party.  And we definetely let Freud know this.  He says we're his \"last hope\" and begs us to hold his event there.  I tell him as long as no more than 12 people (including me, Freud, and my husband) are coming, he can have it at our place.  Any more, however, he has to find another venue.   He agrees to this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, low and behold, almost 20 people wanted to come to the after party...  I inform Freud, via Facebook DM, this is too many people, you may need to resort to a background venue.\"  He begs me to let all these people come anyway.  I tell him, \"No, I TOLD you no more than 12.  You have 19 people.  You can't have it at our place.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe goes on and on, trying to convince me that he's SURE there's enough room at our apartment to host everyone...  I assure you, there ISN'T.  Our apartment isn't TINY tiny, but there's no way we could comfortably accommodate 19 people for a party without sticking them in BOTH bedrooms and the bathroom as well...  It was NOT going to work, and I spent nearly 20 minutes trying to convince him of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe wasn't having it.  He demanded my husband and I be lenient and have this event there because he had nowhere else to do it.  I told him, \"It's not my fault you failed to make a Plan-B.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFRUED: \"You WERE my plan B!!!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nME: \"Then Plan-C!  Go to Plan Z if you must!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo instead of finding a way to make HIS party work out, he goes on to blame me for \"cancelling the Christmas party\" if Hub and I don't let him host it at our apartment.  I've had enough and block him, but made sure to screenshot our convos JUST incase....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe cancels the entire thing, saying on the Facebook event, \"Sorry but \\[OP\\] and \\[husband\\] are being unreasonable and won't let me use their place anymore.\"  Furthermore, he went on to make another group chat with our other friends to complain how horrible my husband and I are for \"screwing him over.\"   I know of this because one of my friends showed me the conversation she was sent.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had enough....  So I gathered all the screenshotted pics of every convo we had, took some time to black out his name (didn't want to humiliate him TOO badly) and posted our chats on ny Facebook page publicly, so even those who weren't my FB friends could see them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose in our group of friends knew exactly who I was talking about...  But those who didn't know him couldn't help but agree with how much of a douche he was acting like.    Freud finds out about this, of course, and chews me out via text, saying how I publicly humiliated him and that I was only giving everyone HALF the story...   Mind you, I posted our ACTUAL conversations, and edited nothing except his name.   He demanded I take them down, but I refused and said, \"Maybe you should use this as a learning experience on how NOT to act.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe goes off the grid later.  No one's heard from him for over a day now...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of my friends are angry with me and agree he was being a total jerk, but a few did say I went too far and I should apologize for what I did.  I REALLY don't want to apologize... but I can't help but wonder if I was an asshole?",

      "description": "My brother is 30. Only late last year did he find his first job (a temp physical job). Our parents coddled him due to his Autism. He is perfectly capable of holding a job, he just didn’t see the need to be self-sufficient and he said that himself. He has a good degree. He also dragged his feet for a year while living with me and didn’t do the required steps to get a job until he was forced to leave. This year he finally got a job in his field as an entry level position as a temp to hire. The probationary period ended and he turned down continued employment. He now wants to go find a tech job in a rural area and live in a tiny house and bike to work. He does not have anything lined up and expects to get a job in the next month. This is despite being a horrible person to interview. He has responded to the question “why haven’t you worked before now “ with “I am not very self-motivated” and similar other responses.   He is smart and a good worker, but has the grace of a brick wall when it comes to promoting himself. He was getting better with social skills and learning a lot at that job and he left it because he didn’t like it. Now my parents are going to pay for his living expenses again when he is a grown man. I’m so mad at him and told him “what the hell?” and now he is angry at me for judging him and not supporting his decision. So AITA for being unsupportive? ",

      "description": "First off, I'm a 30 year old woman and I have social anxiety. I didn't take my Klonopin that night because I assumed I'd be okay. I was wrong, very wrong. My friend was throwing a party and invited me. They were the only person I knew at the party and they did not interact with me much. They hire \"atmosphere models\" that are paid to entertain guests. There's maybe 4 regular people at the party, 2 coordinators, and 8 models. \n\nWhen I arrived, I was panicking and went to the room where everyone was. I quickly asked if my friend was there and when they said no, I left to go wait in my room. The coordinator of the party came down to let me know my friend arrived and I can come up now. I did a bee-line straight to my friend and nervously talked to him. All the other \"models\" were congregating near the bar. I talked to my friend for a short while and then asked the bartender for a drink because of my nerves. Looking back, I wish my friend or coordinator had introduced me. It didn't cross my mind to introduce myself to a large group of girls I don't know since they didn't introduce themselves either! I figured they were deep in a conversation anyway. After I got my drink, I sat down at a table nearby and thankfully, the party coordinator sat down with me and talked for a couple minutes. After the coordinator left, I was there at the table by myself. None of the models said hello. \n\nThey said dinner was ready, so I went to the dining table and sat next to my friend. I was extremely cold and was actually shivering. I was extremely nervous and was having a panic attack. I tried to keep my cool (no pun intended) and two of the \"models\" seated in front of me were clearly making fun of me multiple times throughout the dinner. They were poking each other and pointing at me while making a judging face, as if I couldn't see them. During the middle of dinner, I told my friend I was going to head downstairs to try and warm up. Still, no conversations with any of the girls at that point.\n\nAfter I tried to calm down, I went back upstairs and dinner was over. We moved the party to a lounge area and the models sang karaoke. I sat on the couch in an area myself. No one is talking to me, so I'm diddling with my phone the whole time.\n\nThis was a long party. Eventually, one highly drunk model comes over and says hello. She is extremely friendly. I am fine at that point in terms of having a panic attack and being cold. She said multiple times to me that she was surprised at how sweet and kind I was. I was thinking.. Yeah, you guys just spend your night making fun of a sweet girl, so I hope you feel good about yourself!! I told her that I was aware the other girls were saying mean things about me and the drunk girl I was talking to acknowledged it happened and felt bad. \n\nI offer the drunk girl some toiletry items since she forgot them and we go to my room. We cross paths with the girlfriend of the party coordinator. I had been to multiple parties and she and I never had a conversation. I never really saw her at the parties either. She starts the conversation by saying, \"I thought you were a bitch.\" I laugh to myself and ask her to enlighten me. She said, \"I was working at the club at a party [back in July] and offered you a drink. You said no.\" I said, \"What? I don't recall that situation. Plus, I'm not a bitch for saying no. Are you joking?\" She said, \"Well, your body language was bitchy.\" I said, \"I have social anxiety. You can't read my body language like everyone else. Plus, body language can be based on assumptions.\" I'm standing there dumbfounded that she had been harboring that resentment over me simply saying no! I would not be surprised if she repeated that story and tone whenever a model asked about me. She said, \"Oh, I have social anxiety, too! I drink to hide it.\" She said, \"I think you have a little ~spice~ in you. [AKA: You're a bitch.\" I said, \"Hmmm I don't think so.\"\n\nI go back upstairs with the friendly drunk girl from before and she gets a guy from the party to talk to us. We are all friendly now and I'm sure the other models can see. \n\nThe friendly drunk girl wants us to go to the bar and all the other models are there. None of them introduce themselves or acknowledge me, but I'm really just talking to the coordinator, the guy, and the drunk girl. One girl randomly acknowledges me by saying my dress looks nice. I say, \"Thanks.\" Nothing else the whole night. \n\nI felt like I was back in a mean girl high school situation. Was I wrong for not introducing myself when I am not an atmosphere model? I do not party or socialize for a living. They knew I was not from an agency, nor was I being paid to socialize like they were. I feel like since they were hired, they should have gone out of their way to socialize with me! Am I an asshole for expecting that? I'm aware my social skills are poor due to social anxiety, but I'm not a monster - barely anyone came up to talk to me and when they did, we had a friendly conversation to the point where they said I was \"so sweet.\" It didn't help that the other models made it very clear they were not fond of me and were making fun of me.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Some additional explanation; \n\nI am a parent to a 14 year old who is involved in a couple extracurricular activities. Each of these activities decided to have white elephant parties this year. Dollar limit for one of them $15- $20; the other $20. My daughter only told me about this yesterday so of course I’m a little annoyed already because this mean I am actually the one buying the stuff (paying); which as I’m sure most of the rest of you, I’m hit up this time of year for $20 every time I step into a room. \n\nAnyhow, we come up with two different gifts for these two parties and one gift was right at $20 and the other was $17-$18. She has just returned from the first party which was held after school today and what she got in return for her $18/ gift? A $5 blanket (literally tag was on) and a pair of fuzzy socks from the dollar store. In other words- $6. \n\nSo l am annoyed. She wants to know why bc she picked these gifts since it was white elephant. I told her I am not annoyed that she got what she wanted and she is happy with it, I am annoyed that someone the $15-$20 gift limited somehow became under $10. Truth told I’d much rather have spent $10! But when I am given a limit I feel obligated to make sure that is what I spend. \n\nSo AITA? ",

      "title": "AITA for asking my mom why she took 2000€ from my account and getting kicked from home for that?",
      "description": "Throwaway as this is still happening.\n\n\n\nTo give context, my parents, as they had done with my brother, made a bank account when I was born and put my savings into it. This included random money I got from family, and a monthly allowance the government gives parents for, well, being parents. Parents have no obligation to give this money to their children, but my parents do it because they want to. The account has me as the main holder and my mother as the legal representative. The spoken deal is that I'll be free to use the money from this account once I graduate from college. My parents are also divorced.\n\n\n\nRecently, I turned 18. I have another bank account which I use daily, from the same branch. Yesterday, I had to go to the bank to sign some papers to get everything sorted. When getting account access, aside from getting access to my day to day account, I also got access to that savings account, since they're from the same bank. There, I noticed that there were a lot of movements, way more than the supposed monthly deposit. \n\n\n\nAs it seemed to me, my mother was borrowing money from my account and then depositing it again. But on one of the movements, 2000€ were taken and they were never put back. I found that odd, but I didn't know how much money I had there before as records only went back 12 months. I still found it strange though, and consulted with my father.\n\n\n\nWell as it seems, this wasn't normal at all, she never asked for my permission or even mentioned a thing to me or to my father. After confirming this wasn't normal, I decided to confront my mother.\n\n\n\nWhen I got home, I showed my mother the bank transactions and asked her to explain what was going on. She started screaming at me, asking me how I got access to that, saying that I betrayed her and went to speak with my father before speaking with her, and that she didn't have the obligation to put the money in that account. I told her that I simply didn't like that she took the money without asking me, since I had no problem with borrowing the money. She was having none of it, she kept screaming at me and insisting I acted wrongly and should have spoken with her first. \n\nShe also said that first thing on Monday she was getting a loan and giving me the 2000€ back, but that wasn't the issue for me and IMO she blew everything completely out of proportion. Also, she said that she didn't want me living with her anymore, and that my father did something similar with my brother's account. She told me to go live with my father, and asked me to pretend that she doesn't exist anymore. That includes meals.\n\n\nI believe I handled everything maturely, I simply went to my father first because I didn't want to accuse my mother of anything unnecessarily. When I approached her I did so calmly but she instantly turned it around on me. I barely spoke, she just screamed at me the whole time and didn't want to hear me. She didn't apologize at all and showed no regret.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my historically unfaithful girlfriend to sleep in our bed every night or I'd prefer to break up?",
      "description": "I'm kind of afraid to ask this. Reddit can be unreasonably harsh.  But fuck it. \n\n  \nMy girlfriend is younger than I am by 18 years, so I accept that she's either less mature than I, and in many cases downright immature. She's difficult and stubborn and demanding all while being, at times, cruel and cold. On the other hand, she's also funny and loving and bubbly and giving to my children, thoughtful to those who I care about and affectionate. The sex is amazing, and she's adventurous. We do things that most of my friends envy when it comes up in conversation. All this is to say that, like every one, she has her positives and negatives. Far more positives in my eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the last year, she cheated on my several times (admitted to only one). I broke up with her for 3 months during which she low-key stalked me, mostly just to remind me that she's still thinking about me. I held strong, however,  until a moment of weakness and loneliness caused me to reply to her 1,000,000th text message from the 1,000,000th phone number she generated to bypass the blocks I put on her.  \n\n\nWhile broken up, I had been talking to an old friend who I had always had feelings for. We talked and talked and realized we wanted to make a go of it. To compare the two on the most basic of levels, as we all do when forced to choose, I say that they are equally as beautiful, each have their own personality flaws and charms that attract me intensely and just by being them, offer some things that are very important to me. A difficult choice, and I didn't want to be in the position to choose.   \n\n\nBut I WAS in that position, and I had to make the choice. At first I chose the old friend. The scales weighted in her favor because she knows how to apologize and accept responsibility for the things she should, unlike my current girlfriend. In fact, the only time I can recall her apologizing, it was for minor things and only when she was fully aware I was trying to make a choice that might involve her being set aside for something more trustworthy. I digress - I chose the old friend, and told my ex that she needed to stay away, stop stalking, as I was spending the weekend with the old friend.   \n\n\nThat made the ex lose it. She suddenly became every single thing I wanted her to be. She was thoughtful and kind and didn't offend with sideways comments, followed the basic guidelines for any respectful and mutually beneficial relationship and made me feel like I always wanted. I didn't fall for it right away. I still went through with the weekend with my old friend. That went really well, and she professed her love for me, both in the past and currently.   \n\n\nHowever - my ex was there on Monday being the best person she can be - and when she's trying and cares - I have never experienced such bliss. I was elated that the woman I wanted was being the woman I needed. I still said no. I told her I couldn't because of the trust. She promised she would move in and show me she can be trusted. \n\nSo, whether it was/is a mistake or not, I decided to take a break from the old friend, step back and slow things down with her. Thankfully my old friend thought that was okay, and I had a conversation with the Ex about expectations and how we would build trust again.   \n\n\nI made it clear to the Ex that if we were going to do this, she needs to understand that I desperately want to, but can't/don't trust her, and it will take some time and experience with her to get that feeling again. The love and lust and passion was all still there, and even brighter than before, and she said she understood (although she STILL hasn't apologized for cheating specifically), and made some simple promises. 1) She would move back in. 2) She would stop talking about her exes and their sexual exploits in daily anecdotes. (I swear this girl could find a way to weave in any sexual story you could imagine into any conversation, no matter how irrelevant.) When I call her on it, remind her that it's not polite and makes me uncomfortable, she makes it seem like I'm somehow a pussy for caring or makes a comment about me saying my ex-wife's name - despite her being an actual part of my life and being required to talk to her daily about my kids. and 3) she would sleep at home, not end up at a party and crash - that's how she cheated in the single time she'll admit to - \"I was drunk and mad and I regretted it when I woke\".   \n\n\nOkay - that's the long history. So a couple weeks ago, she told me she had plans to sleep at her grandmother's. I was concerned... greatly. This is new behaviour, her grandmother lives 10 minutes away from me, and what 23 year old has a sleepover with her grandparents on a friday night. But I agreed to it, and she, of her own volition, sent me pictures and videos all night long and the next morning to prove to me she was where she said she was.   \n\n\nLet me just say this - I told her that I will not control her actions. I cannot. I don't want to. But I do get to make decisions about what I will do based on her actions. Essentially, I said that if she opts to ignore my concerns and insecurities caused by her infidelity, or if I suspect she's cheating again, I won't be a sucker again.  I would just move on.  And most likely with the Old Friend. I don't want to see any comments about me being controlling.   \n\n\nFast forward to this morning. I agreed to three-way sex with her younger-still girlfriend whom she seems to have affection toward. She's begged me for months to agree to bring a second woman in the bed and when I conceded it was to make her happy. I'm concerned that they're having their own relationship in tandem with ours, but I figured caving in to her desires came with fringe benefits and it would keep her happy and focused on our relationship. \n\nThis morning she said she was staying at her parents house so she could be up and ready for a court appearance at 8am. She said it's easier for her to get up and shower and be ready to go with her dad to court. \n\nExcept that the first 2 weeks, when it was super important she get my attention, she got up every morning and showered here and got to work for 8. She has to be at court by 8:30. 1/2 hour closer than her work. She says it's to spend time with her parents - except she gets home at 9:30, and they are all in bed by then. Especially on Monday. She says it's so she can sleep better. Except she sleeps like a baby here if she's not been drinking all night. \n\nI told her none of her excuses hold water, none made sense, and even if they did, we are trying to work through trust issues. Her staying at her parents for no reason, 3 minutes away with shit excuses is the opposite of that. She said I was being selfish, stressing her out, not being fair, etc. She says she's sobbing at work now, and it's all my fault. \n\nMy friends tell me i made a mistake, they told me i was making a mistake when I took her back, I know I was, and this is not unexpected, but I love her. Intensely. Obviously. I have other, 'better options' from an outside perspective, but from my point of view, she's the only choice.  But I won't be cheated on again.... I'll break up with her first. That's my only protection from feeling like I am that fuckup in Offspring's 'Self-Esteem' song. If I'm not already. \n\nSo what do you think? AITA?  \n\n\nTLDR: too much nuance, TLDR wouldn't help me get an answer I need. ",

      "description": "My sister and I both sleep with our doors open. Mine is open because our cat's litterbox is in my room and the cat likes to come in and out at night; hers is open because she says sometimes the cat goes in there. My sister can only fall asleep with her TV on; I like to sleep in silence. I've asked her to set a sleep timer on her TV, which she does; the problem is she wakes up during the night and turns it back on. I always go to sleep after her, so I ordered a copy of her TV remote to turn the TV off for when she falls asleep after turning it on again (since she doesn't put a timer on it the second time). What usually ends up happening is right after I get in bed she wakes up again and turns it on, usually to something blaring music like The Voice. I've asked my mother if I could put a cat door in my bedroom door so I could shut my door, but she said no. I've asked my sister to shut her door at night, but she gets aggravated that I'm asking her to \"lock the cat out.\" She's told me to just sleep with earplugs, but they hurt my ears and I feel like I shouldn't have to do that in my own home. My thinking is that since I'm not her roommate I shouldn't have to hear to TV when I'm trying to fall asleep. She gets annoyed and offended whenever I bring it up and says I'm blowing it out of proportion. AITA here?",

      "description": "This one is long, and on mobile so sorry for the bland formatting. I am a college student looking to fill the room of a student in my apartment who is graduating. I also was looking for a summer sublease, but later learned from my landlord that we are not able to sublease per pur contract. Overall I had made two posts on Facebook groups, one for the lease and one for the sublease. After I learned that I could not sublease, I tried to disperse the sublease contacts and I deleted the post. Over a month later a girl who had contacted before me asked again if I still had a room available, and I said yes (I thought she was referring to the regular lease). We set up a date for her to visit but I had warned her to make other appointments or find something to do in town to make the trip worth it since she was going to be driving to see my apartment for over an hour and a half and I couldn't guarantee her the room unless we met and decided she would be a good fit. This afternoon she came out and I quickly learned that she was actually looking for a sublease and that our original conversation had been about just that. So she just quietly turned around and left. I looked through our messages from over a month ago and yes, I fact I had told her there was a sublease available, so she must have fallen through the cracks when I told everyone else that the sublease was not available, so when she contacted me a few days ago I had assumed she was just looking for a regular lease. I immediately messaged her and took responsibility and offered to venmo her some gas money. I truly dont know if I'm the asshole in this situation or if she just simply should not have driven almost two hours just to see one apartment. Obviously I made a mistake, but AITA?",

      "description": "Okay, let’s just get in to it. I was going with a few friends to see Bohemian Rhapsody, which turned out to be a movie with a lot of music and more dramatic quiet moments than expected.\nMy friends and I don’t see movies often and decided to just kinda go all out, so we went to the nicest theatre we could afford. Don’t know if this is a thing at all theaters, but at this place we had to choose our seats before entering.\nAnyways, turned out that the seats we chose were convieniently next to a guy that quickly began doing stuff like humming at random times, talking, and singing along with the movie some.\nWe all kinda brushed it off at first, sure it was annoying but it wasn’t too terrible, but it slowly started to get worse. \nNow, at one point in the movie, Freddie kisses a dude in a decently frantic quiet scene. And the guy next to us started freaking out. He wasn’t yelling or screaming, but he was at least talking loud enough for the majority of the theater to hear him complain and groan loudly. At this point I was kinda sick of it, so I leaned in to him and said something along the lines of “Hey, we all love Queen too, but could you please just stop talking?” \nHe gave me a death glare and talked less, but didn’t completely shut up.\nI feel like I was kind of an ass for calling him out because he seemed like he might’ve had some sort of thing wrong with his head, and looking back on it I definitely should’ve just tried to tell the staff about it instead of directly confronting him. I don’t really know. \n",

      "description": "I’m a 24F and boyfriend is 43M. I’m a broke college student who’s completely dependent on parents. Before I was in a relationship with him, I used this app where I talked to guys and earned money. Never had any emotional feelings whatsoever, never sexted, the worst being something like promising snuggles. I did it completely for the money.\n\nBF just went thru his 2nd divorce (he revealed this to me 3 weeks into the relationship) and immediately met me a month after his separation. I helped out emotionally and financially.\n\nAs things were getting serious, I was starting to feel guilty about being on the app. He’d tell me how he was wronged by all the women in his life (ex wives cheated on him, were awful, abusive, etc) and called them all sluts, whores. He makes degrading comments towards strippers. I don’t shame sex workers, and while I have not and am very against *myself* doing it, I felt that this attitude was really telling of his bitterness towards women. He got counseling after his 1st divorce about how not to be bitter towards women. He also doesn’t think I should have male friends, because “they all want to fuck me”.\n\nI should add that he has a schizophrenic sister and a violent crack addicted brother (whom he recently has a restraining order against because he threatened to kill my bf). His mother is a Xanax addict. This is very stressful and I have been nothing but supportive.\n\nA few months in the relationship, I confessed to him what I was doing. He had explosive anger and called me a whore over and over again. I felt absolutely guilty beyond my life, but I did not feel like I was a whore. I am absolutely committed to him and explained that I have absolutely NO feelings towards these guys who would pay just to message me over the internet in light conversation.\n\nI felt the pressure of my family (if they found out I was dating my bf who is almost twice my age, they would not financially support me). The only stability I felt I had was having money. I have a lot of anxiety about the future financially. BF has $10,000 in debt in student loans and from an emergency ambulance he had to take when he OD’d on heroin a few years ago. His mom and sister blow through money very quickly, and when his mom passes away, we’ll have to take care of his schizophrenic sister.\n\nIn my apology, I gave him $1000 to show how serious I was and how sorry I was. But it hasn’t changed. He’s threatens to break up with me many times. He says he can fuck anybody he wants, and he says I’m an idiot for thinking that he’ll even do that.\n\nIt’s been a year since I’ve been off the app. It’s almost like... every week or every other week we argue about this. If I knew he would’ve been hurt this way, I would have NEVER done it. My last bf did not act this way at all... and actually encouraged me to support us both through college.\n\nI was a dumb young kid but I feel like he is so hard on me.",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom\n\nI’m 18, a cashier, and I’ve been working at the same privately owner pharmacy for 4 years. my mother is the front end manager of the store I work in.\nI haven’t had many problems with my job, other than this coworker. We will call her L.\n\nSo my boss &amp; manager hired L and things started off great. She came in on time, was enthusiastic, asked us how she can improve, etc. after a few weeks this all changed. She would talk as if she knew more than the pharmacists and that got her reprimanded by our boss.\n Later on she started coming in late, bc she would stop by McDonald’s to get breakfast. Everyday. She’s heavily overweight (about 5’5 and over 350lbs) &amp; diabetic. She will stand at the front counters &amp; eat sugary/fatty snacks all day and drinks about 3 Mountain Dew’s &amp; 2 Coca-Cola’s a day. I mean to each their own, it just bugs me for her to stand there and eat instead of helping customers, answering phone calls, doing work, etc. We told her whatever time is on the schedule for her, she needs to be in here BY that time not AROUND that time. That didn’t help. If anything L started showing up later.\n I have an eating disorder, depression &amp; anxiety + insomnia which I’m currently getting help for. L tries to act like she knows me better than me, knows what my diet should be,  and what meds I should be on. I’ve told her off multiple times over the past 7 months for it.\nL has recently gotten super childish. she’s single, has no kids, lives with her 2 sisters, her younger sister’s husband, and L’s ex boyfriend, so I get why she would get a bit antsy. But she’s 54. And she acts like a child. She will scare us if we go down the hall, flick rubber bands at us when we’re working near the front shelves, etc. \ntoday when I was helping a customer, talking to them about insoles they were buying from us, and I stretched my leg backwards slightly and L grabbed a wooden ruler and slapped it against the top of my thigh. Right where I cut(over recently made cuts) I know she doesn’t know I cut but even if I didn’t it’s still dumb to do that to a coworker trying to help a customer in a professional environment. So as soon as the customer left I pulled L aside and told her as calmly as I could to never ever do that again because it’s beyond childish to do that, and that I wasn’t being payed to babysit her (my side job is baby/house/pet sitting that’s why I say that). She got upset and started pouting. A 54 year old adult pouting because of an 18 year old. What the fuck?? No apology. She just walked away and sulked until she left. \n\nAITA for telling her off for being childish?\n\n(Will be posting a separate story after regarding the same coworker)",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrowaway because my GF knows my main reddit\n\nI've been with my GF for almost 2 years, and I really love this girl. I can seriously imagine myself proposing soon if it weren't for her ADHD..\n\nI moved in with my GF 6 months ago and honestly she's been getting on my fucking nerves the entire time. Everything is fine the sex is great (kind of), we communicate well, we like the same things. But she just gets distracted so much, I'm reconsidering if she's capable of being a wife or the mother of my future children. Here are some examples: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  She takes way too long to clean the apartment when it's her turn to clean up. The apartment we have is pretty small and it can take up to 2-4 hours for her to clean up, because she constantly gets distracted. While it only takes me up to an hour and a half. Even then she misses things, for example she forgets to turn on the dishwasher at night, or she forgets to scrub down the counter. It wouldn't bother me so much if this were a once or twice scenario, but this happens every time.\n* She spaces out when I'm talking to her, and forgets to do things I ask her a lot. Like a few nights ago I called her from work and mentioned if she could put a few of my beers in the fridge so by the time I come home they were cold. When I come home, guess what? No beer in the fridge.\n* She talks to much, and about nothing. Everytime when we both come home from work she somehow is able to babble about her day for an hour straight, even if her day was pretty boring. She still for some reason thinks I want to know all the details about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the list goes on, this is just a few of the things she does. I usually never point it out but I got tired of it after her most recent \"mistake\" and told her: \"Look I understand that you have issues with concentration and memory but you really need to learn how to get some more self-control\". She told me that she's trying to get her ADHD under control, but it's been dificult for her. Honestly it really bothered me how she used her ADHD as an excuse, and I told her that and she seemed really upset and hasn't talked to me much recently. I feel bad but at the same time I don't think its fair that she gets to blame her ADHD when they're are so many successful people in the world with ADHD. My brother has ADHD and he has a sucessful career, and I never had issues with him when he was my roomate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My GF uses her ADHD as an excuse for being clumsy with her chores and being annoying, I told her this and she's upset. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I always loved my grandparents growing up. We had a good relationship, they were fun when I was a kid, and even when I was a rebellious teenager I knew we didn't have the same views on pretty much anything, but I still respected them.\n\nIn the last 5 or so years however, they've made it progressively harder to find reason to respect them other than the whole \"you're my moms parents\" thing. They've always been conservative, but they've fallen HARD into all the shit that's going on today. We have a family rule not to talk about politics at family gatherings because it always ends in an argument, but my grandfather always finds a way to inject some racist remark into the conversation. It's gotten to the point where no one even enjoys getting together anymore because everyone's tiptoeing around each other trying not to set someone off. My entire family is being held emotionally hostage because no one wants to say something that would trigger grandpa and get him ranting about some racist , xenophobic shit.\n\nMy fiance and I have been together for four years, and we've lived together for almost three of those. Everyone in my family knows except my grandparents who would throw a fit if they found out. It's to the point where if we're spending the night at my parents on a holiday we put our things in separate bedrooms to keep up a facade that we're not going to sleep together. And in conversations I often find myself having to lie to pretend we're still living apart. I put up with it because it's just not worth the shit it would start, but I'm fucking tired of it.\n\nMy brother and his wife just announced they're pregnant. Super exciting, until I find out that when they told my grandparents, my grandfather decided to lecture her about how a child needs their mother and it would be irresponsible of her to keep working after having the child. She just started working her first job in the field she went through six years of intense schooling for last year.\n\nNow fast forward to a couple weeks ago. We were in the process of calling everyone in our family to announce our engagement. As expected everyone was very excited and congratulatory, then we get to my grandparents. The first words out of my grandfather's mouth were \"well you better hurry up!\" as in, \"you better do it soon or we won't be around to see it\".\n\nMy fiance and I laughed it off, but on the inside I actually thought to myself for the first time \"good\". There's a lot of other shit going on in our lives right now, so we were planning on a long engagement anyway. We're not planning on having the kind of traditional wedding they'd be happy with, so I'm sure they'd have something to say about that, and I really just don't want what's supposed to be a fun celebration sullied by their bullshit. I'm over it, and I'm tired of them assuming their ignorant opinions have any weight at all in the way I live my life. I really don't care if they're there or not, in fact I almost prefer they weren't. AITA?",

      "description": "My boyfriend “Nick” (25M) and I (23F) have been together almost five years now. Last year, I got pregnant, and while we were surprised and a bit worried, we decided to keep it. We told his mom “Sabrina” and my parents around 8 weeks in, with plans to announce to everyone else at 12 weeks. At 11 weeks, I had a miscarriage. It was extremely emotional, and happened on top of a bunch of super stressful stuff (we work at the same company and I got a promotion which meant transferring from Florida to NY, so we were temporarily long distance).  We were devastated and it didn’t help the rough patch we were in, so after a few weeks I ended up quitting my job, dumping him and moving back home to Philadelphia in a weird rom-com style “finding myself” move. During this time, Sabrina reached out to me to share a story of her own miscarriage and told me that she loved me and wanted to stay in touch, no matter what my relationship to Nick was. My mother was sympathetic of course but we aren’t really that close, and even though I was staying with her, she didn’t really know what to do with me and my mopey ass. \nNick reached out to me two months after I left New York to let me know he was thinking of me and hoping I was doing alright - one thing led to another and I moved back in with him in our house in Florida and we’re talking about marriage. A few weeks ago, I realized I’d missed my period, took a test, and SURPRISE - five weeks along. Nick and I were overjoyed. We had a trip to Puerto Rico to visit Sabrina already planned, and while we were down there (I was 9-10 weeks along), Nick hinted that I was pregnant again at dinner with his mom, so I told her when she asked me about it after. \nOn Valentine’s Day (13 weeks in),  Nick and I posted an announcement to social media to inform the rest of our friends and family. My mother doesn’t have social media, so I made sure to text her the announcement/photo, and also texted her that I was so grateful to her for letting me live at home with her while Nick and I were figuring stuff out. I would have called but she’s unable to get phone calls at work and I couldn’t remember what her schedule was that week. \nShe called me a few hours later to say congratulations and then randomly asked if I’d told Sabrina yet. I was honest and said that we’d told her while we were in Puerto Rico. My mom was LIVID. She said that not only was it disrespectful to not tell her earlier than everyone on social media, but that it was doubly disrespectful to have told Sabrina before her. She accused me of playing favorites and then she said “Well, next time you and Nick have trouble being adults, you can go be a bum on Sabrina’s couch instead.” It was really hurtful, although I’m hoping she just said that out of anger. Nick doesn’t think I did anything wrong and he’s pissed at my mom (they have never liked each other). My dad says I should apologize to my mom. Nick told Sabrina about the incident (I wasn’t going to tell her about it) and she called me to tell me that my mom is an asshole. I want to believe I did everything right, but my mother seems really hurt. Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "My best friend started developing feelings for this girl back in March. A few of our friends and I decided that we were going to try to help him get with her. \n\nAt first he was excited and really wanted to get with her, and I was happy to help him. But for 6 months straight he was constantly talking about her, with no action. Now, I get it, he liked her and he was nervous to talk to her, but for 6 months straight, every topic in a conversation turned into a talk about her, and I couldn't just tell him to not think about her. One of the most frustrating parts was when he kept repeating himself on what he wanted to do, \"I really need to talk to her one on one in person\" etc, but he never followed our advice .\n\nJump ahead to the end of the 6 months and he actually began going out with her. GREAT. I can finally stop talking about how he can get with her. Nope. This was his first relationship (he has also never kissed a girl), and I completely understand why he would be a bit nervous about doing things with her. But being messaged nearly every day hearing about their dates, or how annoyed he was at himself for not going for something, it got to the point where I just ignored his messages for a couple hours because I was sick of talking about it. \n\nAfter 2 months they broke up, and he claims that he is over it, when he clearly isn't. Any time I mention a girl he tries to give me advice like he is some guru, \"Well when I was with my ex\" \"Bro honestly from past experience I know that..\" , but he barely even held her hand after 2 months. \n\nHe still talks about her to this day and it has gotten to the point that I don't even like hanging out with him anymore, especially when it's just us two, because I know he will just bring her up and I have to say the same routine phrases over and over again, \"No you're not in the wrong\" \"No I understand why you were nervous\" \"Don't be mad at yourself\" etc etc.\n\nTL;DR\nAITA for not wanting to hang out with my friend anymore, because he will just talk about his ex girlfriend, who I had to hear about every day for the past 9 months?",

      "description": "So this was several years ago, and she and I are broken up. However this was a major factor in the breakup, and something that I still think of.\n\nIve taken a week off work every year for the past 5 years to volunteer at a local charity around the holidays. It benefits low income children. It's well supported but I'm the only one whose less than 50 years old and in relatively good physical shape. They really appreciate my efforts and I love to be there. I get there around 10 and I'm usually out by 5.\n\nMy gf at the time would message me every day on my days off and hint that she wanted me to come by her school with lunch or to volunteer in her classroom. She only ever brought this up when I've already committed my time. Never did she ever suggest I do this at a different time of year, or ask. I usually couldnt come by, but I did bring lunch by 2 of the 5 days. I would go by her house on my way home from work almost every day by 5-530. And when I was volunteering it'd be about the same. She evantually got upset with me on this after I told her I'd be there around 545, and told me I was spending to much time volunteering instead of committing my days off to her. \n\nI couldn't believe she would get upset over me volunteering at an organization that benefits children of the area vs spending time with her. I spent on average 6/7 days of the week there at her house, from after work to 10-11pm. I felt like we were on the same page except for this holiday time. \n\nThoughts? What other info can I provide? \n\n\n\n",

That alone is not my reason though, its the fact that hes a backwards asshole and is a constant source of misery for me, my wife and my mother-in-law. A few examples of his bullshit is, he excluded his wife from the rest of his family while aggressively inserting himself into hers, stays at her place and eats her food, and runs up almost all of her bills while blaming me and my wife for it. He ruined christmas by insisting to go to the family's christmas party, then complaining that he wanted to leave 30 minutes in, and then starting a huge argument over it. He bought her a truck, then loans it out to his kids who then steal everything in there, then claims its his. Prevented her from returning an important test to the hospital so he could buy his granddaughter dresses, cheated on her, etc. And I am tired of it. Its cost me alone over $900 from both bills and replacing stolen objects, let alone my wife or mother-in-law who has it the worst. Ive considered turning him into ICE or whoever, but I dont know how I could do it secretly and it would cause a huge argument if it got out it was me, cuz for some unknown, unknowable reason my mother-in-law puts up with him and loves him.",

      "description": "*Disclaimer, no real names were used in the making of this post*\n\nCouple details that are necessary: I am friends with this tag along(Nyla), but I am not that close with her.\n\nWe all (there was a group of us) used to hang out back in high school but it was really mostly parties and other social functions when I would see them (plus high school)\n\nWhen I went to college I didn’t really speak to Nyla that much (at all). However my friend (Jasmine) has pretty much been in contact with me for the entirety of these for years and even came to live with me in college for a couple months sophomore year.\n\nNow, I’ve graduated back from uni (just graduated a couple months ago) and am happily back in my hometown working in a career that I love. I’ve been hanging out with all my old and new friends (ones I had in highschool and new ones I made in college). Life is generally okay for the most part. \n\nSo that’s all the important backstory really. To my issue, Jasmine is someone that I like to hang out with and I routinely invite her out to go to happy hours (I treat) and just to come over and smoke or something (weed)\n\nOn the evening of I invited her to come to happy hour, she invited Nyla without telling me at all. I pull up to her house and they both come out and just hop in the car. I’m like “okay” but I know I can’t really say anything because she’s already there, so I just try to make the best of it. I try to be a roll with the punches kind of guy so fuck it, we all go out even though I only invited Jasmine.\n\nJasmine then asks me if I mind dropping Nyla off at her house, I accommodate and take her home  because she needs to get back and feed her baby, even though its the opposite direction from my house and takes us 30 minutes out the way, if it was closer I don’t think I’d be making this post.\n\nSo now in my mind I’m irritated at this uninvited guest who I have to leave my happy hour for in order to take her home, which is 30 minutes in the opposite direction of my home. I didn’t let on that I was irritated at this nor did I say anything to my Jasmine, I simply let it go.\n\nWell, I asked this same friend to hang out and specifically mention that I’m just inviting her, without saying anything else. She says okay but just now I received a message from her saying Nyla is coming too. All the irritation instantly came back because I’m don’t want to hang out with Nyla at all to be completely honest, we’ve never been close like that and I truly don’t enjoy her company.\n\nI’m not sure if I’m being an asshole and excluding someone, but this is how I truly feel and I don’t really know how to broach the topic with Jasmine about maybe leaving Nyla at home. If they have become some sort person package where if I invite Jasmine then Nyla has to cone as well, I don’t know if I’ll want to continue hanging out with Jasmine like that.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "My employer gave me the the opportunity to work from North America for a couple of months. So after having discussed it with my wife we descided to go for it. Financially it made more sense even when taking into account the fact that she's now on unpaid leave. plus we're enjoying ourselves a lot, not to mention we have a lot more time for eachother.\n\nFor Christmas I asked her for an expensive tool. The tool is something that makes my job easier. I had been delaying the purchase because of the cost but since it's considerably cheaper over here, the time had come.\n\nThe manufacterer made a mistake and the tool still has not arrived to this day. She called the company and mailed them a couple of times. To apologize they sent their latest model noise cancelling headset. So she was super proud of herself. \n\nThe evening before yesterday we got back from a superb citytrip and were both nackered. The noise cancelling headset had arrived at the lobby and my wife went to pick it up with some excitement in het trot. I prepared my stuff because I needed to wake up at 0345 for a very long day that included taking 2 flights on loud turboprop airplanes. I decided to make those flights more enjoyable and put the brand spanking new noise cancelling headset in my bag while my spouse was already in bed. I had the intention of telling her but it slipped my mind.\n\nFast forward to halfway through the next day. I get a text saying it's not nice that I took them with me. The seed for an argument is planted at this very moment. I get that it would have been beter if I told her. She was excited about the product and looked forward to playing with it that day. What bugs me is that I get the impression that she's claiming the item followed by the phrase  \"but you can use it from time to time\". \n\nWhen I got home at 2230 a part of my brain had  already decided to call it a day. So at half capacity we get into an argument about it.\n\nHer arguments were: I should have told her, I could have used her noise cancelling headset I gave her 2 years ago, she wanted to experiment with it first and \"We got the headset thanks to me, because I complained about the late delivery\". So I can use the headset but she has priority. \n\nMy arguments: I agree that informing her would have been better. Don't know though if that would have prevented rather than moved the start time of the argument. But mostly I reject that it's primarily her headset, the \"We've got it because I complained' argument doesn't go down well with me. If that's a valid argument then i can think of many arguments that would validate my claim. That being said, I feel that it's a item that belongs to both of us and that I don't need to be told off for having used it that day. \n\nThe discussion started in bed, I moved to a different room because my bucket of things I could handle that day was full. After a while the frustration subsided, she was the bigger man and invited me back into bed. \n\nThe argument is kind of petty, we both know that. We're over it and we love eachother dearly. The dispute still requires a final verdict though: Who was the asshole?\n\nPS: This was proofread by my wife.",

      "description": "I’m a line cook at a reasonably nice restaurant. At my workplace, that the first couple weeks of a new employee’s time there are their “probation period”; if they miss any days at all (outside of having 100% proof from a doctor) or get written up (even for something minor), they’re at **huge** risk for being fired on the spot. My employers are not mean people, but they see these as big red flags if they occur so soon in someone’s employment, and know that it’s easier to get rid of a person very early on (more protection from being sued, no severance package, still have a pool of other applications for their position).\n\nMy workplace got a new guy in his early 30’s early last week, John, who was supposed to, several nights out of the week, assist me in my specific department. The first four nights he did fine, but one night late last week was a disaster. A new dishwasher arrived, and the two guys “hit it off” with one another immediately; began shooting the sh\\*t, horsing around, and getting no work done. While he was supposed to be assisting me, John was doing all this with the new guy, and I fell insanely behind (it was an extremely busy night). I approached John, stressed and tired, a total of **five** times and begged for him to come help me; he’d say, “okay, just a second,” and continue screwing around. The two head chefs had gone home early, and my supervisor was not doing much to help. An hour went by, during which John did **no** work at all.\n\nFinally I snapped, and decided enough was enough. I approached him, and told him, “Okay John. I’ve had it. You’re being reported to the chefs tomorrow morning.” I saw someone whispering to him about their “probation period” policy, and he froze. He snapped out of it and finally came to help me. As he’d just gotten this job after having been unemployed for a long time, this scared him, and he apologized profusely. He stayed an hour later than he was scheduled to do some grungy, undesirable jobs; doing so freed me up the next day to get prep work done. As we were checking out, he said, “Sorry again. Glad that concern about, “probation period” is behind us.”\n\nI stopped John, and told him solemnly that as glad as I am that he stayed late and stopped goofing off, that I’m still going to report him. I feel that doing some extra jobs doesn’t erase the fact that he didn’t help me during his scheduled hours, and I feel as though I gave him enough chances already (5!). He got **furious**, accused me of “leading him on” by not letting him know I was still planning on reporting him that whole extra time that he stayed, and stormed off. I had assumed he had stayed late because he felt bad about the way he’d treated me, not just because he wanted me to let him off the hook. AND, I thought I’d already made it pretty clear I was unquestionably going to report him.\n\nI reported John to the chef the next day, and he ended up getting fired. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA if I stay friends with a guy my fiancé hates?",
      "description": "My friend James and I go way back. We've been best friends since we were about 14. When we were in high school we would spend almost every day together from the time school let out until 9-10pm when our parents made us go home. \n\nWhen we got older him and I grew apart but still stayed very close friends. There's been years where we're both single at the holidays and we've gone to each other's family's houses for dinner. When he introduces me to new people I'm always introduced as his sister. We really are like family towards each other.\n\nHe's had girlfriends in the past that hated me and suspected that we were sleeping together (never have, never will). He's left any woman that tried to tell him he couldn't be around me or talk to me. For the last two years he's been with this girl that I love to death. She's the sweetest. She and I even hang out and go on girl's only adventures without him occasionally.\n\nMy fiancé Scott on the other hand has no desire to get to know James. He doesn't like that we've spent holidays together and had (platonic) sleepovers at each other's houses at times when we were both single. Neither of us cross boundaries like that when we're in relationships. But, if we did things like that in the past before we met our partners I personally don't see why it matters. Especially since we have never had feelings for each other or did anything remotely physical with each other.\n\nJames always asks how my fiancé is and has tried to invite him out to grab a few drinks, or go fishing, or just go for a drive so they can get to know each other. Scott always turns him down.\n\nI honestly don't feel as if we're currently crossing any boundaries and I don't feel as if we have at any point in the last three years I've been with Scott. We don't talk daily, it's more once every week or two we'll talk on the phone for 5-10 minutes and catch up real quick in the middle of the day. Every few days one of us might text the other a meme or something. We live an hour from each other so we only hang out once every month or so when we both have time. 98% of the time we're hanging out with his girlfriend. We barely spend anytime completely alone together anymore but neither of us are really bothered by that. There's always an open invitation for Scott to tag along with us. \n\nHe's never given me an ultimatum or told me I have to stop talking to him, but he has said it makes him uncomfortable and he'd rather me cut ties with him. I could understand his reasoning if James and I had history or if we spent multiple days a week alone together, but this feels more like Scott trying to tell me to cut ties with family. I've tried explaining this to him before but he never really understands. Again, he isn't mean or nasty about the topic. He passively tells me his feelings about James. \n\nI feel guilty about the whole situation because I don't want my fiancé to be uncomfortable, but I'd love it if they could have a similar relationship to myself and James' girlfriend. Am in the wrong for not wanting to lose, a friend that's like my brother? \n\nTl,dr; AITA for not wanting to cut ties with a close guy friend because it makes my fiancé uncomfortable?",

      "description": "I have always been overshadowed because my sister DEMANDS attention constantly. She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?",

      "description": "Background pt 1: I was involved in a lawsuit from starting in 2017 due to an injury related to automobiles (not what you think though). This case ended up settling some time around beginning of October 2018. (This is also the first thing that pops up when you google my name. You can't see the results or anything, just that I've been in a lawsuit)\n\nBackground pt 2: I moved to Milwaukee this past september. I didn't know anyone, so I went on bumble/tinder to try to meet people in my new city. Sometime after my lawsuit settled, I ended up matching with this cool girl, we'll call her L. \n\nFor a little while things go great with L. We go on a few dates, and though our personalities are pretty different we still get along decently well. After the first few dates we start hanging out more and more. After the first week or two, she starts spending the night with me \\~3-4 times a week. About a month later, we're supposed to hang out, and she tells me something came up and she can't hang out that night. No worries, I get it. A few hours later she sends another message saying she decided she doesn't want to be in a relationship and we should stop seeing each other. At this point I'm a bit sad, but hey I understand that we're a bit different, and maybe it's too much for her right now. She's entitled to her own feelings, I'm not going to stop that. After this, she ghosts me on all social media, blocking me everywhere so I can't talk to her (not that I would've since she made it clear we were done).\n\nAnyways about two or three days later, I get a facebook message from her. (she must've momentarily unblocked me). She asks why I never told her about the lawsuit. I just responded saying is that why you just fucking ghosted me? You could've asked and I would've just told you. She says she didn't trust me to tell the truth, and that I should've just told her from the start. After that she ghosted me again and we've had no communications since.\n\nNow I'm not overly distressed that what we had ended, turns out we weren't really that compatible after all. I am sad that I don't have anyone to hang out with now since I work 6 days a week and it's hard to meet people. But I'm wondering if she was right, and if I was an asshole for not informing her about my previous lawsuit right away, especially since it comes up immediately upon searching my name. \n\nAny input is appreciated, thanks!",

      "description": "Okay, so backstory. My friend Betty is very emotional at the best of times, and has a constant craving for physical contact that she often makes people uncomfortable to get; our group are all very comfortable with each other and enjoy platonic contact, but she takes it much too far. We've tried to explain to her that this is wrong, but she's never listened.  She also can't stand falling asleep before everyone else at sleepovers. My friend Liam and I have been flirting online very explicitly for a while, and have been waiting for some time alone to do the dirty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these friends were staying around my house, where there was only one room available for all of us due to my family. Throughout the day, me and Liam have been fooling around underneath blankets whenever we got the chance without Betty noticing, but Betty did notice that we were cuddling up a lot and got madly jealous, often muttering bitter things under her breath which we both just ignored. \n\n\n\n\nEventually, I'm fed up of her shit, so I decide to just pretend to fall asleep while cuddling Liam so I don't have to pretend to not pick up on the hints that she wants to cuddle him instead. Liam gets what I'm doing and starts acting tired too, but Betty gets very angry and rants to him about how he knows she needs physical contact to feel safe and it's so rude of him to be cuddling me instead with everything that's going on in her life right now, etcetera. Liam is giving tired, half-assed responses. She starts crying, gathers all of her stuff, and walks straight out my door.\n\n\n\n\nMe and Liam spend a good 10 minutes really wanting to fuck, but being unsure if the other feels bad about Betty. We eventually both come to the conclusion that neither of us care too much about her melodrama and we just get to it. About twenty minutes after we start, we hear the door open and throw on our clothes as fast as possible to pretend we were asleep the whole time. Betty walks in and turns the light on, walking very loudly, so me and Liam both pretend to wake up. She says that she just went to her sister's and had a panic attack, so she hopes we're happy we had a good night's rest.\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially she calms down and things mostly return to normal, with me and Liam texting each other cockblock memes the rest of the night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "It all started with a Jewish girl on Twitter being hurt by her fave being incredibly ignorant a few years ago and wearing a hat where a small skeleton head + some swastika was printed. Somehow there is a weird fascination of nazi culture in Asia I‘ve heard?\n\n\nAnyway my mutual (the Roma girl; also being a fan of that person) kept harrassing this Jewish girl, telling her to shut the fuck up and that Roma people are the only oppressed people left from that time and that none of them had a right to be offended by a symbol because they haven‘t been born at that time and haven‘t witnessed the genocide themselves. She said it‘s just a symbol to her and that the Jewish girl is victimizing herself and that she should stop because she has no right to.\n\nShe kept harrassing this girl because the Jewish girl disagreed and said it‘s offensive and hurtful. A day before the Roma girl also said to another jewish person to shut the fuck up because she‘s Jewish, also regarding this issue. In general she also said that no Jewish people are being attacked by Nazis anymore anyway, which is a lie.\n\n\nTbh at first I was conflicted what to do, I‘m not Jewish and I didn‘t know at first if she was trolling or no but I remembered that this girl also made fun of people from my ethnic backround (Kurdish) so I decided to write her privately instead of openly calling her out cause we both muslim and it‘s a religious and respectful thing for us to be private in these issues, eventho I wanted to bust her ass.\n\n\nAdmittely I was really aggressive and told her basically that she‘s being antisemitic, stupid as fuck for attacking the girl like that and that she has no right to do that at all. I told her she‘s acting like a moron and she‘s writing stupid shit and that it‘s not all about her feelings. I also mentioned in a few words that I also saw her making fun of my ethnicity a few weeks ago but I didn‘t say anything because I assumed she was just being edgy. But the whole context changed once I saw she was being serious so I questioned myself if she was serious about it too, knowing full well I‘m Kurdish myself. (We had a friendly mutual going on)\n\n\nShe then responded very aggressively back, telling me I shouldn‘t tell her how to fucking react and that I have no right to interferre because the \"oppression is not the same\" and my ancestors were not part of the holocaust.\n\n\nWhich pissed me off because as Kurdish Alevi my ancestors faced genocide and persecution as well, not on the scale of romas and jewish people but I thought I had a right to call her out simply because I know how some historic shit actually can be really hurtful and in some cases traumatic. I also told her that but she was just making fun of it and saying it‘s not comparable and that she doesn‘t care.\n\nI tried to even include her heritage into the debate, saying that her ancestors and jewish people died under that symbol which she doesn‘t find bad. I tried to explain to her many times just because she was ok doesn‘t mean everyone has to.\n\n\nIt went back and forth until she got personal, calling me a pussy because I didn‘t say anything earlier about the Kurdish issue. Why would I, I‘m not in the mood to fight random ass people on Twitter 24/7, however I thought I should stand up because she was being anti semitic in my eyes.\n\n\nBut according to her I had no right to interferre at all because I wasn‘t one of the affected parties and accusing me of being anti Roma and offensive just because I dared to say anything regarding this issue as a non-affected person\n\n\nI personally thought I was in the right but I‘m open.\n\n\nAm I the asshole for telling her my opinion eventhough my historic backround and ethnicity have no connection to the holocaust etc. so I basically have no clue from her stand point?\n\n\nI admit I was not kind to her at all but neither was she to others and me so idk\n\n\nthanks for reading!",

      "description": "My ex-bff and I had been friends for 15 years. In that time we have been roommates, party girls, closer than sisters, and in love with our relationship. Like sisters, we have had our share of fights and disagreements, but we always made it out the other end. \n\nLast summer she had become very abusive. I won’t get into the details, because we both could have handled the situation better, but the basic issue came down to her being jealous of my life. Over the years our friendship had become more of a competition for her as she was constantly comparing herself to my life instead of being proud of her own accomplishments and comparing herself to who she used to be. \n\nWe didn’t speak for almost 6-months until I finally reached out to make amends in preparation for my wedding coming up in the following months. Things were going fine. I invited her to be in the wedding and even offered to help her pay for a plane ticket as she had moved out of state in the time we were not speaking. \n\nWell, she ended up denying my invitation because she had made a new friend in her new hometown and wanted to go to a concert for that persons birthday. The concert was not the same time as my wedding, it was 3-weeks earlier and she claimed the cost was going to be too much to make both the concert and my wedding. \n\nSo the wedding happened, she didn’t show, but we remained friends on social media and didn’t exchange any ill feelings about anything. \n\nTwo weeks ago my amazing husband surprised me with a new Mercedes Benz, my dream car. Of course I was elated, and posted it all over social media. All of the sudden, she’s not following me anymore and we’re no longer friends. I reached out to her asking why she decided to unfollow me and if she was no longer interested in any kind of friendship. She instantly went on the defensive and stated that our friendship will never be the same, that we never could be again because I never apologized for what happened (I did, she didn’t), and that she doesn’t want to see things on social media that cause her to feel like she’s in competition with other people. \n\nI responded that I did try to make amends, but that I wasn’t texting her much because every text I sent took her 2 days to respond to, that she shouldn’t compare her life to my life. That she shouldn’t feel like she’s competing with me because that’s not fair to her. She took offense to that comment and went off on me, back to the abusive type talk that ended our friendship in the first time. \n\nFrom her perspective, my comment upset her and I’m sure that’s what started the barrage of mean comments. From my perspective I was hurt that she didn’t bother showing up to my wedding and then blamed me for the reason why we haven’t rebuilt our relationship when I feel, she’s the one who hasn’t been trying.

      "description": "Possible trigger warning, references sexual assault. \n\nLong story short, my GF and I met online. She was supposed to be stationed near me but then got reassigned last minute to the opposite side of the world. I liked her enough to try and make things work. \n\nShe was there for about a week before she was raped. I won't go into details but it was violent. She was and still is really traumatized. \n\nI had been calling to keep her company at night, because she would have trouble sleeping and panic attacks if she was alone. \n\nToday we were talking and she started having one of these panic attacks, but it didn't stop. She kept talking about how her skin was burning and how she wanted to \"tear it all off.\" \n\nShe then started saying things like \"I can't do this\" and \"I don't want to live like this\" and \"I'm sorry.\" \n\nThen she hung up on me. She wouldn't respond to my messages after that, she was leaving me on read.\n\nI was really worried, the things she was saying had me legitimately concerned she was going to hurt herself. I looked up the phone number for her military base security, and I called them. \n\nI told them that she started a new medication that could cause suicidal thoughts as a side effect, and that she said some concerning things on the phone a few minutes ago, and wasn't responding. I asked them if they could check on her. They said they would look into it. \n\nAbout 15 minutes later I got a message from her asking if I'd done anything. I asked why and she said that three cops had just come to her room with guns. \n\nI admitted that I asked them to check up on her, and she exploded on me. She said that contemplating suicide is grounds for discharge from the military. She said that I had no idea what I'd done, and that I may have just ruined her chances of pursuing her dreams. \n\nWe talked for a little bit and she calmed down somewhat. She told me that there were other support avenues I could've looked into without alerting her entire chain of command to her personal issues. Obviously I didn't know anything about them or I would've done that instead. She did eventually tell me that she understood why I did what I did, but I could tell she was still really upset and depressed. \n\nWhich makes me wonder, am I the asshole here? I admit that I acted out of fear, and I didn't really think of the repercussions of what might happen. I just wanted to make sure someone I cared about was safe. Of course, that doesn't stop me from feeling incredibly guilty, knowing that my actions may lead to her getting kicked out of the military. ",

I don’t know her, or her two kids she brings over...I feel like I’m stuck in my room all the time because of it. So I asked him to tell her to only be there when he is there, which he did, he agreed that we each pay rent and I have the right to be comfy in our place when he’s not there. \n\nThe problem was that her reaction to this was to just not come over ever, she does his laundry, cleans his room, cooks dinner for him to come home to, wifely things she says...they got in a huge fight about it and now I feel like caving and just dealing with it.",

      "description": "On mobile so sorry about formatting \n\n\nSo I go to the gym regularly. I usually go in around 6 or 7 and I'm out by 9ish. With the new time change and my fiancee getting a new job it has thrown me off a bit so I have been going to the gym later. \n\nMy gym pretty much consists of the elderly (I'm 25 myself) with a few other gym goers my age. Now I go to the gym alone as I like having some quiet time and it's a good stress reliever for me. I also wanna add that I keep to myself. I dont talk to anyone or bother myself with other people because I just get in my own head. The reason I add this is because many of the older gym goers like to chat and hangout even when I would normally go at 7am. I really dont mind this aa they dont take up any gym equipment and are pleasant as far as I can tell. Now obviously since I'm at the gym a few hours later then I normally go a few people I dont normally see are here but I assume them to be locals but again I dont concern myself with others.\n\n\nSo now to the cause of me feeling like a asshole. I was doing cardio on the bike with my headphones in zoned out. A group of 2 elderly ladies and 2 eldery gentlemen are biking and chatting next to me I glance over and see they are passing panflets with \"Jesus will save you\" and such back and forth and one elderly gentleman has a vanilla envelope I assume full of them. Whatever right? Not bugging me and they all seemed happy and knew eachother. They walk away and I continue peddling along. After about 5 mins I feel a tap on my shoulder and it is one of the elderly ladies. With a big smile on her face she tries to hand me a panflit, I  shake my head and say \"no thank you\" and face forward again. She then taps me again and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do and say, a little for annoyed, \"yes?\" She then says \"you should take this hun, you look like you need saving\" . I was pretty shocked but responded with \" I dont need anything thing from you maam\" and put my headphone back in. \n\n\nNow i thought that would be it but not 2 mins later she comes back with 2 of the older gentleman. They tap me on the shoulder again and berate me for being rude and not accepting the lords light into me and how I should be ashamed blah blah blah. I dont get to say anything before they walk away. I do however go right to the front desk and ask to speak to a manager.\n\nI explained to her exactly what happened and how it was pretty shocking and if something could be said to them so it doesn't happen again. She then informs her this isnt the first time it has been reported and let's me know she will handle it. I walk out and go back to my bike. She then comes out, gathers the 3 people who spoke to me, old lady included, and kicks them out. \n\nThey actually start pleading and apologizing and looked genuinely upset. I heard them offer to apologize but the manager had none of it. I now feel awful and didnt mean to have them kicked out or worse AITA",

Last minute we had some friends from college, they live like 2 hours a way, roll into town. \n\nSo after our wonderful date we take a cab to the party our \"friends\" are at because we are both drunk. \n\nThe party ends early because of drama, I honestly don't know the details of it. The party host kicks everyone out except a small group of people, us and our friends that invited us are in that small group. The party host decides we should all go to the bar. \n\nI don't really want to because we've already spent a lot of money and are very drunk. Our friends pile into a car with the group they originally came with, not enough seats mind you but they make it work. They inform us that their is not enough room for us or the party host. So we should split a cab with the host.  *bonus I'm the one who knows how to get to the place they want to go*\n\nMind you we've never met the host before. \n\nAnd we don't want to drink more, just hangout. \n\nSo I get mad and lose my temper, I'll admit that. I storm away from the car so I won't say anything stupid. My husband follows me, he wants me to calm down but I refuse to go to the bar. I see the party host get in the trunk and the car takes off down a dead end street. I just roll my eyes. As we're waiting for our cab they make a U turn and pass by us again, someone calls something out the window but I don't pay attention. \n\nWe end up just going home. Then a little later my husband gets a text from the college friends asking if they can stay at our house and I say absolutely not. They can stay with someone they had room for in the car. \n\nAITA?",

He ended up telling her what happened and she basically said that I was acting crazy and that he’s his own person and he can do what he wants but I feel like driving under the influence is not an okay thing to do.\nMy other reason is he’s lied to me about being with her before.

      "description": "I work remotely while also studying in college and honestly it's a lot to do but I gotta because I come from a pretty backward family and I'm a lil afraid they won't pay for me to do a Masters or leave the country cause I'm a girl. So I know I have to be twice as good as everyone else to get a job abroad or study at a uni I like. \n\nI don't earn a lot but I do pay for most of my own things, the deal with my parents is that they pay for stuff like medicines and doctors, except I don't like asking them for money so I just pay up anyway. They also owe me a decent bit of money - about 2 months worth of work. But I don't bring it up because I don't really mind. \n\nI do not get an allowance and I'm the younger sibling. My brother on the other hand is 3 years older and he does get an allowance. He doesn't work (he has an undergrad degree in medicine so I assume he can't do a lot of work atm). But every time he comes home, he insists that I take him out for movies and lunches and drinks. I wouldn't mind if I didn't always feel like he was manipulating me. And so off late I've started saying no. \n\nHe always make it sound like I'm an asshole and IDK if I'm being a bitch? He says that I don't have to save the money. I'm so young and I'm earning so I should just spend it (on things he wants lmao). He says what are you even saving up for. It annoys me that he expects me to answer these questions. But I save so that I can travel and go to design conferences to network better with people in the same line of work as me. I also save up for conferences, clothes and to do things with my friends.\n\nI don't like spending a lot of time with him because he always starts a debate about all of his conservative ideas and starts pushing the notion that women just aren't capable of the same caliber of work as men or some other bull shit like that. Or he tries to convince me to change my dreams and stay in the country because *he* thinks it's a great idea even though he's leaving in a year.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Today, I had a random man show up at my apartment asking for money after mistakenly opening the door thinking it was the matienance man. He looked inside the apartment and comment on our nice decorations. I gave him some change and sent him on his way. \n\nI'm a young woman and my roommate is often off working 90% of the day, working 3 jobs. She sometimes works until 2am in the morning at one of her jobs. She's my only roommate, so needless to say, after opening the door to a random man begging for money, I felt a bit sketched out. \n\nWhile it could be that he needed money, I feel like it's a bit strange that he would knock on random doors asking for money. I want to trust people, but being alone in the apartment most of the day I feel like I need to be cautious of people's intentions. \n\nAnyways, my roommate got home at 8 while I was hanging out in the living room when I realized I'd forgotten to unbolt the deadbolt. I dashed to the door to unlatch it before she finished unlocking the door, but I was too late and she tried to open the door before I could unlatch it. \n\nI quickly unlatched it and she began berating me about how she hates the deadbolt and that I should never use it because what if I wasn't home or I fell asleep, etc etc. (Which the first one makes 0 sense because you can't lock the deadbolt from the outside???)\n\n I explained the situation to her and she got even more angry, telling me that I was overreacting and that nothing was going to happen. I just dropped it after that because I didn't have the energy to argue and had a lot of work to finish, but I'm still somewhat annoyed \n\n\n\n\n ",

      "description": "Please read this because I know the title is wild and seems clickbaity but idk how else to shortly describe the situation? \n\nMonday driving home from work on a country road just a mile from home, a dog suddenly popped out of a cornfield a few feet from the road chasing something and I hit it. I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fiancé picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. ",

      "title": "AITA For ghosting a girl who I think maybe a gold digger?",
      "description": "Over two years ago in Sept 2016 I basically confessed my love for this girl that I met at Uni that I was friends with and I felt like she liked me back because I bought her like 1k worth of gifts and she took them an we always flirted. When I revealed to her that I really liked her she said she always thought of me as a friend and had started seeing a guy even though she never gave any indication of that to me. It was bad and some classic \"niceguy\" neckbeard shit I'll admit I'm pretty sure I even cried in front of her LOL. We basically didn't talk too much since then and she was a year older than me so she graduated and started working. In that time I started seeing a different girl for a year and that ended but I wasn't that sad anymore I graduated this past June and got an amazing job and my parents sold a lot of property overseas and gave me a really large trust fund. I started buying nice shit, bought a Benz a nice condo downtown a few nice watches took my boys on a few vacations. And I guess was posting more on IG and the girl who turned me down saw all the flashy shit I'd post sometimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis past October she messages me and wants to talk and catch up, we text for a few days and she says she'll be in the city on the weekend as she lives with her parents out in the suburbs and asked if I wanted to meet  up. I said sure and we agreed on dinner, I was confused on whether it was a date or not. Dinner went well and she wanted to go back to my place and see my condo and one thing led to another and we ended up having sex, honestly it was amazing I've wanted to get with her for years and it finally happened. Over the next few months she'd come down to the city and we'd hookup and honestly I was in love all over again and we were kinda basically seeing each other but not official or anything. Fast forward to last week and I let my friend know who basically consoled me when this girl rejected me 2 years ago that I was kinda seeing her now and she's like she doesn't like you she only is seeing now that you're doing well and is a gold digger. That made me kinda realize that wow am I being played again? Nothing has changed about me since she rejected me about 2  years ago other than that I have some money now and I'm a tad more flashy with it I guess. It's true that I have bought her stuff in the past and during our about 2.5 months of seeing each other now I spent a lot on dinners where ever she wanted and bought her a few small gifts maybe totaling like 2.5k. Having my friend basically lay all of this out for me made me feel like shit and I realized jesus she only see's me as a meal ticket and it made me feel like trash.\n\nThis was in the beginning of December and after meeting with my friend and her laying it all out for me and making me realize all this I stopped messaging the girl I was seeing and kinda started ghosting her and not wanting to hangout or meetup. I blamed it on it being a busy time at work and I needed to really pull my weight since I was still the new guy and it was my first real job. This led to me at first responding slow, not wanting to meet up to last week and now not responding at all and leaving her on read. This girls friend messages me on IG and calls me a huge dick and asshole and says that it was so shitty to just fuck her for a few months and just ghost her now. I didn't respond to that DM and blocked her cousin. I just didn't know what to do, and felt that I needed time to figure shit out and didn't want to tell her in case it wasn't true that she saw me as a meal ticket. So I guess I thought ghosting was the best thing to do for some reason. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA??",

      "title": "AITA: for resenting my sil and mil for treating my husband like the surrogate husband/father for their blended family?",
      "description": "Let me preface this by saying - I am struggling with what my own feelings are about this situation, and maybe this actually belongs on relationship advice but because i think think it's entirely possible that i'm being a selfish asshole in this situation (and in the brief arguments i've had with my DH about it, its pretty clear he thinks i am) - thought it might belong here.\n\nBackstory: DH and I have been together for 7 years, married for 1 (we are in our early 30s). we live in a large city and his family (consisting of sil, nephew 1, mil, nephew 2 and niece) live about 35 minutes away by car, an hour by public transportation. Until a few years ago, my would be fil also lived in the area but he passed away about 3 years ago after a rapidly degenerating illness, during which time my husband, sil and myself were his primary caregivers (we didn't live with him, but managed his finances, filing the paperwork to get his care, moved him, and generally tended to him as he was no longer able to make decisions for himself in addition to being financially responsible for his care ). I should also mention that my DH is the youngest of 3 - there is another brother who is an addict who fathered nephew 2 and niece and then had them taken away by the state ( and are now adopted by mil).\n\nFor financial reasons, my mil,sil and nieces/nephews all live in the same house and are basically raising the three kids together. My sil's ex is in the picture with her son but he's an ex drug addict and not considered to be a particularly strong father figure - that coupled with the other bil being a druggie who is god knows where, means my DH is pretty much the only stable male adult in my mil/sil and niece/nephew's life. Because of this, both my mil and sil treat my husband as what feels to be to be their surrogate husband/father - leaning on him heavily for financial and emotional resources for themselves and their kids.\n\nThe part where I might be the asshole is that I resent them and it probably shows - I know my husband wished i \"spent more time\" with his family and we've gotten into huge arguments because i see myself as being the the one who who has put effort into connecting with them only to feel that from the minute I walk in the door i'm either a dumping ground for their latest drama, or more typically - i'm the entertainment for the kids for a few hours while my SIL either sits on her phone or talks to DH, and oftentimes i feel like i'm almost intruding on my sil's time with her brother (as if i'm third wheeling on date) which leads me to not want to be there, which leads to me being \"not interested\" in spending time with his family. In 7 years we've been together - i have gone to visit them probably at least 100 times, including multiple weekends in a row for whole weekends and after work when we we go to take care of fil (which went on for about 18 months). My mil has been to see us once, my sil twice. Both times, someone else had to drive them to us and take them home ( a family friend) because they are \"scared\" of any place outside their town ( they've lived 35 minutes from our city their entire life). When my husband had serious surgery last year neither one came to see him ( despite having the ability and time to do so - it was the summer so sil was off and mil is retired) but instead texted me to \"let them know how he was doing\" and from there it was business as usual - which to me felt so wrong and selfish of them, but not at all suprising. When either one calls - it's never a call about anything but whatever their current drama is - the sil complaining about mil, vise versa, or mil talking about the drug addict bil's latest exploits which enrages my DH because my mil has ruined her finances by funding his habit and bailing him out of jail, not to mention caring for his children. I can't ever remember a time when either one of them asked him how he's doing or what is going on in his life. My mil only ever seems interested in him when its his bday or he's around being cute with the kids so she can take photos and put them on Facebook. My sil/mil are constantly dropping hints about things the kids need, or they need for the house, because they know there's a good chance dh will buy it for them- for example, my sil wants my dh to come by so they can go to a furniture store to look at new furniture for the niece's bedroom( hint hint), and somehow dh is always the one buying gaming systems, expensive toys, etc for birthdays and holidays. We both make good money and I know it makes him happy to do it - but its money that could be going to saving towards a house or our own family, and it also seems to be to be more of an expectation from them vs a nice thing he does at this point. They also put what feel to be parenting esque responsibilies on him -like doing father/daughter day with the niece. I try to be sympathetic to the difficult situation they find themselves in, but so much of it is entirely of their own making ( idiotic financial decisions, bad relationships, enabling bad behavior) with no end in sight, that I resent them for being such a burden on my DH and by extension myself. I constantly worry that i'm going to wake up one day to a call that mil has passed away ( she has numerous health issues she dosen't do anything for) and that we'll be asked to take on parenting duties for one or both kids, just when we're trying to get our own life together. I also resent my DH for having what feels sometimes like Stockholm syndrome - I know they are his family and he loves them, but i feel like he's in so deep as the \"husband and father\" of this family that he's semi- checked out of taking our family to the next level.\n\ntl;dr - my in laws treat my husband as their only source of stability in a dysfunctional household without providing anything to him in return (emotionally etc) and i'm worried that they will be a lifelong financial/emotional drain on our relationship. I resent them for it and him as well, and feel like an asshole because my husband is just trying to be a good guy.",

      "description": "So *quite* a while back I hired a small group of like 2 guys to 3D print me an epic diorama of the Mygeeto fight scene in Revenge of the Sith, what with the galactic marines and all. It's stupidly expensive and in hindsight I somewhat regret having it commissioned (slightly more than 1,500$). It's been over a year in the works and progress was steady at first however these past few months have been eerily quiet. I've sent dozens of emails and he's given me vague on vague statements about basic info I already know. Hell the past three months I've been just waiting for pictures of progress. I've had no idea what was going on, until earlier today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI messaged him again threatening to contact Paypal and Etsy (site I hired him from). He contacts me and says he'll have pics of the progress last Monday. When Monday came and still no pics of the progress I was pissed to say the least. I got a hold of him today and as I was spitballing reasons why he hadn't contacted me I threw out that his life must be tanking. He responds back and says it is and that he'll have pics of the project by this Thursday and that the project will be done by January 31st and if it's not I'll only get half my money back for design and plastic costs. I'm angry here and not quite sure what to do as I'm well past the date Paypal and Etsy will guarantee refunds and whatnot. I want to demand all of my money back but then again he has done a ton of the 3d work (There was progress with the 3D modeling I just haven't seen anything printed as of yet). I'm really, really just thinking of saying screw it and staying on hold with ETSY for an hour to try and fight this and get all of my money back, but would that make me an asshole in this situation.",

      "description": "So this happened today\n\nI am 18 and still live at home with my mom, i do a lot of chores at home (like laundry, cooking, dishwasher stuff) and today she planned on cleaning the windows and putting new blinds on them. I got up early and spent a bit more than 2 hours getting all the windows extra clean for her. I ask her if it would be alright, if i go see some friends and if i could install the blinds later on. She agreed and gave me 50$, which i *hesitantly* accepted (she said she would feel bad if I didn't take the money).\n\n3 hours later i come back, finish up my work which took another 1 1/2 hours with plenty of time left to cook. Well, no.\n\nMy mum argues that she is not as important as my friends and that i never finish what i start. To her it was an absolute disgrace that I even asked to go out before finishing the task and that I am a huge disappointment. My mum even shamed me for taking money for such a trivial matter (after basically forcing me to take it) but since i didn't want it in the first place I then immediately returned it. She won't give me any more access to her car (which is fine by me because it is her car after all). What i cannot agree on is the fact that she doesn't even let me use the kitchen to cook something since i have enough money to go out to get some food. Now don't get me wrong, if i hadn't done it after coming home or if i finished it way too late, I would completely get her point, but since neither of those are reality, I really don't understand her point. \n\nMy mum and I normally are really close and have a good relationship but after her shaming me and refusing to give me access to the kitchen to cook for myself, I am seriously infuriated and asking myself if i acted incorrectly. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not installing the blinds immediately?

This was organized by the best man, who I am not on good terms with.\n\nAt some point before the hens/bucks there was a second bridal shower my girlfriend was also invited to, yet another gift.\n\nThe other couple who was not invited seems unphased, though their total gift $ amount is less than the cheapest we bought.\n\nExpressing our frustration to the bride, groom and other members of the bridal/groom party falls on deaf ears, I don't feel they are in a position to tell me that I'm over reacting when they aren't the ones being excluded.\n\nThe bride is constantly complaining that the people she attends church with are awful and my girlfriend/wife of other couple are two of her only truly nice friends. The groom is on reasonable terms with me, though he isn't really great friends with anyone as even the best man was surprised to be in the grooms party (groom is very introverted/family oriented)\n\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset/angry for what I feel is being duped into buying gifts then the expected return favor of being at the reception was not reciprocated?\nSurely being at the hens/bucks night is usually a sign of being close enough to attend the reception.",

When he started walking away i dashed to him and told him “please don’t take other people’s stuff” and i yanked the purse away from him, and that kid started CRYING the loudest shit I’ve ever heard (yes i am sure I didn’t hurt him in any way). Then suddenly a wild mom-zilla appeared in full battle gear “HOW DARE YOU?! GET AWAY FROM HIM!” in a relatively crowded restaurant. I told her that the kid was taking the purse so she told me that i should let the kid do whatever he wants. As i was saying it Mr badass dad also walked up and started lecturing me and half-threatened to fight me and their family was giving me the looks like i had just murdered god or something. Then my friends came around me so the tension got diffused a little, but i was getting weird looks from my friends too. Is doing this really such an ungodly course of action?",

      "description": "To clarify up front: I am female and my friend is male. We also have hooked up in the past, but have been completely platonic for about 2 1/2 years now, and both understand and agree a relationship is NOT a possibility\n\nAnyway my best male friend recently got a girlfriend (yay!). We are both in univeristy and she goes to a separate school a few hours away , so they're long distance, which I understand and respect is difficult. She had come for a few visits and I have gone out with them and I really like the girl! She seems sweet and like she really cares for my friend. Here's where the issues begins, my friend (for some ungodly reason) told her that we had a past and she flipped as we hang out all the time still. She then started making stipulations that we are never together alone together (not just in a room but out at bars , etc. because \"no one will know he's mine and not yours if you start making out\"). \nLike I said, there's truely nothing going on but I totally understand her discomfort and was willing to accommodate sayin we won't  meet to pregame together any more , and if we HAVE to be in a room together we'd leave the door open , however I told her we couldn't always have other friends with us in public.  We frequently will help each other with common classes or go for a quick drink after the library together and always bringing a chaperone along just isn't possible . I respectfully told her this, but said that I'd try to bring a friend along as often as possible, and have him snap her every few minutes while we're out together, just so she can be sure nothing is happening.\nShe didn't like any of the options I gave and refused to compromise simply saying if we didn't agree to the terms that we must be hiding something etc. I then, and I'm not proud, basically rudely told her I wasn't going to give up a friend of three years over a girl he's known for two months .\nAITA ?\nTl;Dr: friend gets new girlfriend says we can't be alone together or in public just the two of us. I try to compromise, but it ends in a fight ",

      "description": "My boss makes my life absolute hell, but he’s a good person. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, he wastes company money and time going after bullshit, and he works my coworkers and me to the bone. For context, I’m one of three Graphic Designers at my company. \n\nI am hired full-time with exempted status, meaning I don’t get paid overtime, and I usually work 60+ hours a week. I’m in the office 9-6, then put in another 2-4 hours every evening. \n\nHe went to a for-profit school that has since been unaccredited... and it shows. I have nothing against any kind of education, but my boss has no idea how to do the majority if his job. He follows a bunch of famous marketing professionals on twitter and buys their lectures and does whatever they tell him, which usually doesn’t apply to the kind of marketing we’re doing. For example, we’re about to launch a new product, so he’s treating it like a rebrand that has nothing to do with the company brand. He has us building a 70-page questionnaire to send to potential clients asking them about their feelings on certain color schemes... his reasoning is that we’re making a focus group without having to pay for a focus group. \n\nHe is hot and cold any day of the week. You never know if he’s going to decide to restart a project one day because it doesn’t feeeeel right anymore. He forgets his original assignments constantly and yells at us for not having work that he never assigned. When he doesn’t like something he tells us, “no,” and when we ask for directions, his favorite line is: “I get paid to say no. I pay you to figure it out.” \n\nOn top of all this, he’s disgusting and racist. I am  half Chinese and the only East Asian in the office for reference. He talks to us like a friend, which is fine, but he’ll talk about how his wife complains about blowing him because she gets an upset stomach, or how he shat himself at a museum once. Stuff I would maybe only bring up with my sister, not even a close friend. He told me he saw a documentary about how Asians are actually from another planet and colonized Earth but forgot about it, but all other races evolved on Earth. He asked me if my parents were disappointed because I wasn’t a doctor or lawyer. He refuses to get in my car because I’m an Asian driver (with a perfect record, thank you!). He has made jokes while pulling his eyes sideways. And he has said stuff like, “well if I was Treyvon Martin’s parents I wouldn’t have let him walk around wearing a hoody like that.” He believes that middle aged white men are the most persecuted group in America, and while I think everyone is entitled to their opinions, he brings it up at work. He asked me if I was the “one night stand type” in a meeting once because a new-hire was talking about her boyfriend. He also does stuff like talk about how he spent $30,000 to go to Peru for three days because he felt like it. He makes fun of me for liking Ikea... \n\nHe also takes random days off, leaves work early and comes in late. His excuse is that he works so much overtime it all balances out. But I get in trouble if I’m 10 minutes late to work. \n\nThe only thing is... I mean am I going to ruin his job if I take this to HR when I leave? I have a catalogued list of all of his worst offenses with dates and location in my phone, but I don’t know if I want to ruin his job completely. He’s a horrible boss, and he makes my life hell, but he’s a good person I think...\n\nTL;DR: my boss is hypocritical, racist, and generally a bad boss. Should I tell HR when I leave?",

      "description": "We've been together for almost a year and my BF lives a **very** sedentary life. He games all day, drinks tea/sweets, and does eat somewhat healthy (veggies, meat, etc.) but I think it's mainly his portion control/inactivity. I have no problem with his weight; I love him the way he is, but I think I may have been lacking the....tactful approach to bringing up my concerns and mentioning his weight/telling him I love him the way he is. I'm basically probably showing the complete opposite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy BF thinks I mention his weight/lifestyle only because I \"want him to be skinny\". Like...hello??? I'm literally in a relationship with you. I still get turned on by him, and thinking about him as a whole makes me giddy. But he feels unloved just because I mention his weight...An important detail to mention is my BF has heart problems/blood disease/CFS/depression. I truly think exercise would help him feel better. It would also help him in every day life; I can't imagine the toll his heart is taking. I'm worried that most of his symptoms/health issues are caused by his sedentary lifestyle. He told me \"my doctors say I'm in good condition\" and \"exercise wouldn't help me\" but come on...not even walking??? And his doctors can't be saying that. ((He's about 6'1 and over 235 lbs.))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe particular situation that makes me write this post is when my BF bought some clothes. He was showing me t-shirts, and I simply said \"they're awesome but you wouldn't pull them off very well, since you don't have many clothes to match\". The shirts were really dark/emo BTW. He thought I was making it about his weight and got upset. Then he said \"it's hard finding jeans I like because of my size...mainly my waist.\" My BF has a droopy pot belly (nothing wrong w/ that, I've given his lower area lots of affection lol), so I told him \"it's probably your stomach making your waist size big\". That basically shut down out convo and he left, texting me after saying \"you always make me feel like shit when it comes to that stuff\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy BF likes my \"straight-forward attitude\" but the second it's aimed at him, he gets sensitive, especially about his health. AITA???",

      "title": "AITA for aggressively yelling at my wife, and more importantly, is our child being abused?",
      "description": "I very aggressively yelled at my wife. I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son… serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said… \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n",

      "description": "I want to preface this post by first saying that along with all of you here, i love my mom. I want to know AITA  and if so how i could help her better.\n\nMy mom is the sweetest person i have ever met, and a phenomenal woman. I am proud of her in so many ways. She is loving, and is always one to hold everyone together. She is my biggest supporter. Without her advice i would not be half the person i am today. I owe her so much. She is the matriarch of our family. \nShe works a fairly difficult job during the night, taking care of elderly folk @ a nursing home as a CNA. For the entire 25 yrs i have been alive this was her line of work. \n\nMany people have hobbies, and ways that they blow off steam, and for my mom her hobby unfortunately (from my pov) is spending her time and money @ the casino.\n\nI don't think that gambling is bad outright, but like many things, an excessive amount of anything can prove to be detrimental. \n\nOver the last decade i have seen her hobby do more harm than good. Again from my own pov.\n\nFor as much as i love my mom, it seems like the reason our family has been in a financial rut is because of my moms inability to discipline herself over her gambling habits. \n\nMy dad is an electrician, and makes very good money. Enough for them to own their own home, but there are times where she would actually take money out of my dads wallet, then proceed to work the slots or bingo cards at the casino. It has been an issue that our family has tried to address time &amp; time again but only seems to get worse. \n\nEvery confrontation has ended in false promises, denial, and a sense that this is a habit that will continue to get worse if professional help is not sought after.\n\nThere was a point where we lost our storage unit that had personal family effects, like Christmas decorations gathered over the years since me and my siblings were babies, family photo albums, furniture, personal belongings, etc. Things that were special to us were all of a sudden sold off in that unit because she couldn't foot the bill that month. I would of helped, but i was away @ college and no knowledge of this until i came home for Christmas break only to find why all decorations and tree weren't set up. Dad couldn't pay it off either because the money that was supposed to foot the bill... went to you guessed it... my moms casino outings. That was a tough christmas. My mom of course apologized endlessly, but she even stated that they were just \"material\" possessions.\n\n To this day i am still bitter. \n\nMy dad has confronted her about her habit, but he rationalizes her decision to go out to the casino as her \"me time\", and that in order to have a happy home, you have to have a happy wife. My mom states that when she goes to bingo nights it makes her happy, and fulfilled. I am deeply disturbed, and crushed that my own mother has to resort to gambling her money away to feel good. \n\nMy parents actually sought out a financial guru to help solve some of their financial situations. Although reluctant, it was eventually revealed that my mom has an issue with her gambling. After some rough calculations, even the guru believed that with all the money my parents make, they could do away with their all their debt, within the next 5-7 yrs and habe raised their credit enough to be homeowners, but if her outings continue, they will forever stay where they are. \n\nMy mom felt committed. And she was adamant to make changes. A month went by, but eventually she was right back where she always wanted to be. At the casino.\n\nShe used to ask me for money to help pay the rent, and i always gave her money, but then i found out that at one point she gambled with it, and lost. I felt betrayed. \n\nSince then i don't trust her with money. \n\nIt hurts to understand that the woman who has always been there for you, raised you, clothed you, fed you, put a roof over your head, and taught you, has an issue. \n\nIt was only when i turned 22 when things got worse, did i realize that mom is not who i thought she was. I always held her in such high regard as a child, but the level of respect for her has lowered a bit. I am ashamed to say that. But thats my truth.\n\n Is it wrong of me to think that? I do understand that no one is perfect. We are human. Everyone has vices. Me included. But i can't help but feel ashamed yet so frustrated that she gives in to those slot machines and bingo cards. \n\nWhen i confront her about it,  admittedly sometimes i go off the rails. I don't raise my voice, but i feel a sense of pity mixed with a loss of respect when addressing the issue. I don't like talking to her about it, so i usually avoid the topic altogether, unless i catch her dressed up ready to leave and she asks me for $20. I have no words.\n\nAITA for not giving her money? Or for confronting her about her gambling issue? Should i leave her be? Idk what to do. \n\n\n\n",

      "description": " \n\nAITA for pulling a prank on my friends?\n\nSo myself and 7 coworkers are all friends. We hang out a lot after work and on the weekends, etc. A few of us are new this year, I’ve been working here for less than a year. The way our workplace runs, our manager changes every April. Our new manager is very nice and we get along great. Last year’s manager was the same way. However, apparently in the past there have been run-ins with managers and two of my coworkers, let’s call them Tom and Steve. Tom and Steve have been at the company for 3 and 4 years, respectively. They also happened to be taking PTO for a week while the transition occurred, and we decided to pull an April Fools prank on them while they were out.\n\nWe have a group chat that we use all the time, and on April 1st none of us were particularly busy, so we decided to pull a prank on Tom and Steve. One of my coworkers sent a message in the group chat saying that we had a meeting with our new manager and it went horribly. We all jumped in and backed him up, and said that the new manager was pissed that Tom and Steve weren’t present for his first day and this new meeting. Tom replied to our messages explaining that he had requested this time off months ago and there was nothing he could do about it. He seemed pretty upset but not that worried about it. The conversation kinda stopped there for about an hour since Steve hadn’t read the messages yet. TBH, based on the reaction we were getting from Tom, I thought this was kinda a lame prank. Tom didn’t seem worried and didn’t really react. Then Steve jumped in finally, and it heated up. He used some rather spicy words to describe his feelings towards this, and after about 5 minutes of going back and forth, we got the reaction we wanted, so we told them it was an April Fools joke. Those of us in the office that day thought it turned out pretty well. Turns out, though, that Tom and Steve were pretty pissed. They messaged back saying that they were upset with us for bothering them with this while they’re trying to relax on their time off.\n\nI guess I understand where they’re coming from, but is this really that big an issue? It’s not like our prank was something that required them to drop everything they were doing and put out a fire, we just told them the new boss was mad at them, and after a few messages we told them it was in fact a prank. I know that they’ve had bad encounters with previous managers that weren’t very nice, but I mean, it’s April Fools and I thought this was a pretty harmless prank. On top of that, the new boss is awesome, so we’re in for a good year under his leadership. Tom and Steve haven’t messaged the GC since Monday, which is unusual for them. They’re back at work now and one of my coworkers saw them this morning and said hi but they gave him the silent treatment. Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "I could go on and on, but I feel like this is the straw that breaks the camel's back.\n\nWe are two people short due to someone leaving and another being out for workplace injury.  It is left to my boss and I to run the store. She consistently changes the schedule to fit her needs. I had a day scheduled off on Sunday and two days before changes it without even notifying me, as well as making me work alone open-to-close the previous day where I had only been originally scheduled on my shift. \n\nNow I totally understand having to cover extra time to keep our store running, but I realize she is making this happen so she can have another weekend off. I haven't had a weekend off in over a month. I have only been getting one day a week off, which is often rescheduled and moved around on the spot. I had a diabetes doctor appointment on a day off and she threw a fit saying I was being difficult when I didn't want to come in for her that day because I had prior arrangements. She also wanted a doctor's note for that even though our company does not require them even on sick days. I know it is a part of the job to work weekends, but I feel like an asshole to think I should at least get one weekend day to spend with my wife this month. My wife is extremely upset because I haven't had a matching day off with her in nearly two months.\n\nI have type 1 diabetes, as my boss knows, and shouldn't be missing meals. When I asked how I was expected to take my lunch on Saturday, she said she will come for a few hours, and I can take it during that time. AITA to think if she can be there for a few hours that she should be capable of working a full shift so I'm not working those long hours unnecessarily?\n\nI've had many friends and family tell me she is a horrible boss, but I really wanted to see what the Reddit community thinks, so I can avoid bias. \n\nAgain, this is only one scenario. I could give many examples. For instance her brother was visiting (and was her 'customer' the entire day) and they sent an upset customer over to me to process a return. She was distraught and in tears. While she pushed the work on to me, while I'm trying to comfort the poor lady, she and her brother heckled her, insulted her, egged her on, and laughed the whole time where she could hear.\n\nTL;DR: My boss schedules herself however she wants on a whim and makes her employees cover with no regard to their plans, lives, or livelihood.",

She's got me on it for our child, and her son's father is on it to. Reason I'm on is because public assistance forced her to do it to me, since.

      "description": "First, some context. My partner and I were temporarily living in her mother’s home. Her mother was not living there at the time as she wanted to live with her current partner. She ended up selling the house, and so my partner and I began looking for places to rent.\n\nHer mother made it very clear that she would be covering my partner’s share of the rent as she is currently studying at university and isn’t able to work much. Additionally, she also made it clear that we were to rent a place that had three bedrooms instead of two so that she could stay if she needs to. She offered to pay the rent on that room as well. So far, no problem, everything is fine. \n\nSide note: My partner and I have a bedroom each as we need our own spaces to do things, such as study for her, and late-night computering for me.\n\nWe found a place, and everything is going fine. We just recently renewed our lease for a year. Now, during all this, her mother has only stayed overnight a few times when she was on a “break” with her partner. In the last couple months, she decided she would rent a place with her partner and go half-half in it with him. She did this after we already signed the lease.\n\nSo now, she pays rent at her place, and at our place. She has suddenly demanded that, because she doesn’t stay over with us and she “doesn’t even like the place” that she doesn’t want to pay the agreed-upon rent. She wants to now go half-half with me.\n\nIf I were to accept this, my rent would rise by around $70/week. I am already at the maximum I was willing to pay on rent before this. I explained to her that we had an agreement and have only recently renewed our lease and it isn’t fair to now back out due to her not having any foresight that renting two places at once is not a good idea. \n\nI told her that I am not prepared to pay half-half, however I would increase my rent a bit to help her out. This was rejected and she then implied that if I had to pay half-half with my partner, that I would ditch her instead. That really pissed me off and she left soon after.\n\nSo, AITA here?\n\nSome side notes:\n-\tmoving to a cheaper 2-bedroom place is something we want to do, but isn’t an option right now due to several factors\n-\twe wouldn’t have a 3-bedroom (and more expensive) place had my partner’s mother not insisted.\n-\trenting the spare room is something we are seriously considering, however we need to get permission first and we also sacrifice our privacy, so this is a last resort.",

We're sharing a hotel room with our parents (half term break) on holiday. I wake up and he's at the shelf that we kept our phones charging on overnight and I ask him if he can get mine. He gets it, and I start scrolling Reddit. Our of the fucking blue, I get a nosebleed. Literally no other symptoms which could've predicted it. So I'm bleeding and I start the basic course of stopping it (pinch nose) and say to J, \"shit, I've got a nosebleed\". He says, \"OK, have fun\". I get up out of bed and go to the bathroom, dropping 2 drops of blood in the process on the bathroom floor.\n\nI clean my face up and get back in bed and continue scrolling Reddit and he goes and has a shower, and when he gets out he says to me \"Can you please clean up the [2] drops of blood on the floor? If it were water then I'd do it (there was lots of water on the floor anyways, which he didn't clear up) but it's blood.\" So I cleared it away without really saying anything but I got a bit miffed that my older brother wouldn't touch 2 blood stains, which were easily cleared up. I cleaned them up and we carried on with the day as normal.\n\nAITA for not immediately cleaning away the blood stains?\n\nPost Script - he may or may not have a fear of blood? I'm not sure at all, I doubt it but he might. ",

      "description": "Title probably makes it sound like I'm just a bum, but I couldn't figure out how else to word it without being too longwinded.\n\nRight now, I'm a junior in college. Last year I had my car with me because my apartment had plenty of parking spaces on site. This year however, I'm living in an apartment complex which doesn't have enough parking for everyone, and I wasn't lucky enough to get one of the spots. So my car is a 15 minute walk from where I live, in a somewhat sketchier part of the city.  So, I've been getting rides from my friend (we'll call him Dave) whenever we're going somewhere because he has his car at his house. Let me emphasize, that it's only when WE are going somewhere TOGETHER, or I'm coming to hang out with him at his place. I've never just asked him to drive me somewhere out of his way. \n\nWhile I acknowledge it requires him to drive the 5 minutes out of his way from his place to mine that he wouldn't otherwise have to do if I took my own car, I feel like it's just more convenient that way rather than me walk the 15 minutes to my car and THEN make the 5 minute drive. Or spend $6 for an Uber anytime we want to hang. Because of this, I've tried to make up for it by making food for him and letting him drink however much of my beer he wants when he comes to visit me at my place. \n\nWell, earlier today, he flipped out and called me a freeloader and an asshole because I always want him to pick me up when we're hanging out, and because I helped myself to some of his beer. I was caught off guard by this, because he's never said anything to me about my asking for rides bothering him. Never asked for gas money either. And he didn't ask for it during the argument either, he just said he was done giving me rides and that I could figure out my own way to get around. And I didn't think just grabbing a beer would bother him because I always let him drink however much he wants of mine.\n\nSo I'm at a loss here folks. AITA in this situation? ",

We were planning on going to a casino, going out and seeing the town, some drinks, maybe the zoo or something too. \n\n   But in the last 24 hours I've learned:\n\n-That my grandpa, who I live with to help pay rent, has a serious gambling addiction. So serious that me and my best friend have only a few months to find a new place.\n\n-My father and his super young girlfriend are having a second baby.(his wife is 21 and they already have a 1 year old baby and take care of my 15 year old FAS brother.\n\n-My grandpa in another state is in the ICU and may not make it another month. My mom is hysterical and I haven't had time off from work to visit her.\n\nThe trip was set for this morning, I bailed last night and all 3 of my friends kept saying things along the lines of \" I understand, but you really have to come with\" and a bunch of super sarcastic remarks like \"ok that's fine I guess\". My close friend then texts my best friend that she wont talk to me and she will be mad at me for months after this.\n\nI spent about 300$ on planning this trip, hell I even lent them the money to book it, but that honestly doesn't matter to me. I told them to keep it and go without me. I know I cant directly help with my dad and other grandpa, but I'm trying the best I can.\n\nTL;DR I bailed on my friends after setting up a trip because I'm sad and anxious and they hate me for it. Am I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "I haven’t seen my family in a while. My dad proposed a nice vacation spot. He mentioned he has friends in the area and he told me he’s been looking at brochures, etc. Awesome, I agree and book my flight and so does my dad, mom and brother. This was about a month ago.\n\nToday, a week before we fly out - my parents tell me to look for an AirBnB. Wtf? I got so gd suspicious of this, I immediately called them and questioned them do we even have a plan? They vaguely say yeah we should spend two days here and there, and meet up with some friends sometime during the week. Turns out my dad didn’t even bother to call ahead, make reservations or even checked out the vacation spot if the well known touristy areas are available next week. I am so fucking triggered, I went to cancel my flight (got flight insurance) so I’m not losing much on the flight. I told them I’m out and they’re on their own.\n\nAm I the asshole for somehow misunderstanding my dad (claims he has friends in the area and claims he looked at brochures), and bailing on a last minute vacation when they order me to plan all the details? \n\nI’m also 100% certain there will be other unknown shit that’ll just appear and drive me insane - random friend will want to meet up but we will still be in a city 100 miles away from the supposed vacation spot, and so I’ll be forced to drive and redo the logistics every goddamn day.",

      "description": "Need some brutal honesty about what I consider to be a morally grey area. \n\nMy boyfriend is really good friends with John (26m), and has been for years. They've been roommates for a long time, during which time John started dating Jane (25f). They became pretty serious and Jane moved in with them about two years ago. I also moved in about a year later and have lived there since. Long story short, the four of us all live in the same house and usually get along. \n\nI became friends with both John and Jane, but wouldn't consider us close. Jane likes to party a lot, loves attention, and always has her friends over -- this is her first time living away from her parents and it shows. John, on the other hand, is super mellow and easy-going. He’d rather spend all his free time smoking, playing Runescape and mostly keeping to himself, but he’s become pretty tight-knit with Jane’s group of friends lately. \n\nIt’s a relationship, so obviously there’s more nuance than that and they work surprisingly well together. I honestly thought everything was fine up until last weekend. Jane and I end up in the bathroom together, drunkenly chatting about exes for some reason when she started randomly crying about how she cheated. I assumed she was referring to something that happened in the past – she apparently hooked up with an ex while she was seeing John. This was a couple years ago, and I was under the assumption that John had already forgiven her for it and that they moved on, but she started crying that “it’s not just in my past, but it’s my present, too”. I didn’t get any details because I didn’t want any, but she was so upset and begged me not to tell anyone, especially John, because she hadn’t figured things out yet.\n\nI wish she didn’t tell me, and I don’t even know why she did. I ended up deciding to tell my bf because he and John are such good friends, but of course now that just puts my bf in the same shitty situation that I’m in. My bf wants to tell John, but we also know that John is so anti-confrontational, that a) he might not even believe us and b) even if he did, there’s a pretty massive chance that he would forgive Jane again. In either case, we look like the complete assholes and I guarantee that the living situation would crumble into something miserable for all of us. \n\nSo, reddit: do we keep the peace and hope that the cheating makes itself known organically, or do we risk making the living situation hell by trying to be a good friend to John? I’m torn between minding my own damn business and letting them do them, or informing John before they get even more serious. \n\nFor clarity, my boyfriend and I are both 27 and are saving up to move out, but that looks like it’s going to be a ways away.\nTL;DR – my bf’s close friend John is being cheated on by his long-term girlfriend Jane. I’m afraid to say anything because the four of us live together. WIBTA if I told John?",

      "description": "I work for a church where my job is to make videos. One of the videos I have to make weekly are announcements about stuff going on in the church. A year &amp; a half ago I began making them funny, grabbing onto any gimmick that I thought was humorous &amp; it has been well received, even the ones that I thought were risky, i.e., cross-dressing, edgy (for a church) jokes, and innuendos. \n\nThis past week I watched a GMM video where they have to make calls to various places while being \"speech jammed.\" For those who don't know that's when you speak into a microphone and delay the audio back into your headphones slightly which causes an echo and makes speaking difficult, my speech slows down and I begin to stutter pretty badly, for instance. \n\nI thought it would be funny to do the weekly video this way, and for the most part, it was. At the start of the video, I explained what it was, &amp; told people the website where they could try it for themselves, then put the headphones on &amp; read my script poorly as intended. Before releasing the video the pastor of the church stopped by my office &amp; raised a concern about it possibly offending someone, he didn't want me not to make the video he just wanted me to make sure I explain what it was at the beginning and then gave me the go-ahead on it.\n\nOn Sunday we show the video, and it sounds like most people enjoy it &amp; are laughing. However, around 4 P.m. that day I receive this email, *\"First off I know you meant no harm with the way you delivered the announcements today. Unfortunately, It was in poor taste for anyone that has a disability that prevents them from speaking fluidly. Anyone with a stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s, etc. I’m only trying to prevent hurt feelings in the future.\"* I forwarded this to my direct superior, and the pastor and the pastor responds to me, *\"I was afraid this would happen, you shouldn't have done that.\"* I guess forgetting that he greenlit it 4 days prior. Now today he forwards me another email from an upset member, *\"I don't mean to be a bother, but today in \\_\\_\\_'s weekly update, \\_\\_\\_ and I were both offended and disappointed.  As you well know \\_\\_\\_ is Autistic with limited speech.  \\_\\_\\_\\_'s delivery on stuttering and speaking with a deficit was definitely shocking in the year 2019. I don't believe it was meant in a bad spirit,  but there are many families like ours, even in our church, who deal with the issue of a disability every day.  A little sensitivity goes a long way.\"*\n\nThe pastor then tells me I need to call these families and apologize for being insensitive &amp; \"get ahead of this situation before he has to deal with it with the Administrative Board.\"\n\nTo me, these emails don't require an apology because they both acknowledge the video had no malice in it, it was more of \"please don't do that again.\" Also, like H3H3 said, \"Just because you were offended by a joke, doesn't mean that the joke was inherently offensive.\"\n\nSo AITA for not apologizing?",

To me, she's perfect; she's loving, caring, and helped me so much with getting through a rough patch of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents think otherwise. See, she's from a poorer economic background. Despite her merits (she earned a merit-based full ride scholarship, for instance), my parents only notice the fact that her family's poorer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt also doesn't help that my parents have explicitly told me that they hold extreme prejudices against people of perceived color. I say perceived, because my girlfriend is actually more Asian than black, but is simply darker than my family and I are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, my parents have given really harsh ultimatums, to the extent that they threaten to pull me out of college just to ensure that I'm not with her. I \"gave in,\" but in the meantime, I'm still in a relationship with her. (My girlfriend is fully aware that my parents do not like her. She hopes that things can change in the future.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was a few months ago.

Plus, my parents pay for my education: I feel like I'm not giving them the most bang for their buck (even though I have my own bank account and I take care of my own personal allowances, i.e. I don't spend my parents money in my relationship). But on the other hand, my parents are only judging this relationship on the basis of race and social background.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost importantly, in the event that I am indeed an asshole, what should I do next?",

      "description": "So, this story is a little complicated and will take a bit of exposition to give you the full picture.\n\nMy best friend [18 F] and I [19 M] have been friends for about 6 years now, but it wasn’t until about 3 years ago that she and I started getting really close. Sure, we’ve had our ups and downs in our relationship; periods of closeness followed by periods of us drifting apart, and so on. There was even a point where we were so close most of our classmates thought we were dating. She knows everything about me and I know everything about her, even all the dark stuff we like to hide from others. \n\nAugust of 2018 comes around and I leave for my first semester of college. The university I’m attending is about a 90-minute drive from where my friend and I live; however, I don’t have a car, so my friendship with her effectively becomes a long-distance one. At this time, we were in the midst of a period of drifting apart. While up at university, I try to maintain and foster closeness by reaching out to her by text at least once every day. At first, she responded to most of my messages. From these, I learn that a few things in her life aren’t going so well and she’s very stressed (for the sake of her privacy, I’ll keep the details vague). I try inviting discussion over the topics, but more-often-than-not, she would change the subject or drop it entirely. This goes on for 2-3 months.\n\nI go home for fall break in mid-October and she and I hang out for an evening and catch up. We were very open and honest with each other about stuff and I get a clearer picture of the things happening in her life and I see how stressful things are for her. However, the night was very fun and it felt like she and I had never grown apart. It felt like we had never been closer. I go back up to university. Early November rolls around, and my best friend all but stops responding to my messages. I start sending them less often (wanting to not add more stress to her life) and I say things like “Hey, are you okay? Haven’t heard from you in a while.” I very rarely got a response. \n\nMid-December comes around and I go home after finals week. I try a few times to organize another date-night, but she blows me off for two of my attempts (which I thought was completely understandable knowing how stressful her life was). Finally, we get dinner a couple days after Christmas. However, this is when I had noticed things had changed. My friend’s personality had significantly changed. Whenever I tried asking details about how her life was going, she would only give me shallow and superficial information. I felt like I had to pry details out of her. The rest of the night felt awkward to me because I almost felt like I was hanging out with a stranger, which hurt a little bit. \n\nThe next night, I ask my friend if there’s another time within the next week that would work to hang out. I wanted to talk to her about how I felt a little hurt that she hadn’t included me in her life as she went through a radical personality change. Over text, she explains to me that a few things in her life just came crashing down and she’d have to face them within the next week. So, she requested that we just have a discussion over text. I explain to her how she appeared radically different to me the other night and that I felt hurt because she hadn’t kept in contact with me as she went through this change. I explained how the fact that she had changed wasn’t the thing that hurt; I was hurt by the fact that I couldn’t even tell that the change was happening because she wasn’t talking. \n\nAfter I got it all off my chest, she said her piece; among other things, she accused me of piling on more stress and making a problem out of something that isn’t a problem. Afterwards, she made it clear that she no longer wanted to be friends with me or have contact with me in the future. \n\nSo, Reddit, I need your brutally-honestly opinion. AITA?",

      "description": "Repost without the whole conversation and added a TLDR.\n\nSo, background. I've been with my girlfriend for about 7 months now.\n\nWe both have difficult personalities due to difficult past, difficult previous relationships and upbringings. We're both oversensitive. During these 7 months together, we broke up more times than I can count. It usually only last a day or two and then we're back together because I really love her, and (I think) she really loves me as well.\n\nWe have a long distance relationship, I'm in France, she's in Germany, although our cities are close and a 2 hours train journey is all it takes so see each other. Last time we saw each other were for NYE, when she came over and spent a few days with my family and I.\n\nThings were dire before that and we broke up for the nth time on December 24th. We managed to move on 2 days later. That's the event that she's referring to in the following conversation when she talks about Christmas.\n\nHer exams are coming soon, and she's in over her head because she has so much stuff to do. Because of our break up over Christmas and her time spent at mine, she also wasn't able to study. She usually can't work when I'm around even though I can.\n\nMy birthday is on Monday, and I was supposed to go to Germany tomorrow so we can spend it together, and come back on Tuesday. Her birthday was two weeks ago on the 7th, I couldn't be with her because I had a work imperative, but I had roses and chocolates send to her. She really liked the gesture, and she was perfectly fine with me not coming because work was a priority. I offered last week to not come if she really had a lot of work this weekend (I've always been alone for my birthdays so they're of little importance to me) but she insisted that I did, but we'd have to work most of tomorrow. I agreed with that. The idea was we'd celebrate both our birthdays.\n\nEarlier today, she mentioned that we really needed to work all day long, and when I asked if we could at least spend a bit of time together she suggested I should cancel the trip if we're not working 100% of the time. Which I did. And now she freaked out and is blaming me for cancelling the trip.\n\nI've been quite selfish in the relationship in some aspects, and I've always done my best to change that behavior and place her needs before mine. However, I think in today's scenario, she really went too far, and she created the whole drama. To be fair, I think she has a lot of unresolved issues, and it's sometimes really hard to tell her she's doing stuff wrong because she won't accept it. I'd like to have some external opinion on this argument.\n\nIf you really want the whole details, the argument can be found here: [http://freetexthost.com/0s6xaqee1n](http://freetexthost.com/0s6xaqee1n). I'm Terry, she's Honeybee.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Offered to go see my GF which I'm in a long distance relationship with tomorrow and monday for my birthday. Say she wants to spend the whole day work because she's in over her head for her exams. I say I'm okay to work but that I'd like to relax and enjoy each other's company for an hour or two. Answers that if we're not spending the whole day working, better cancel the trip. I cancel, and she blames me for cancelling and breaks up with me over that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Alright here is a quick TL;DR of my life the past few months. You can read more in my post history, but basically I met this girl, we fell in love, we both have mental issues, she keeps on pulling me close to her to the point where I would do anything for her, even die, and every time she pushes me away. Last night I considered killing myself because no matter how hard I try to support her with her trauma I fail to keep her safe (She was abused for a long time when she was younger). To the point now, after hearing some kind redditors responses I decided to cut her out of my life. While she was sleeping I texted her that I love her, and because of that I have to cut her out of my life because our friendship is to destructive for the both of us, and I can't see her get hurt.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for cutting the only person I love out of my life?",

I call to tell my sister what happened, and she says something along the lines of “you’re not there in the hospital with him?! How dare you?!” \n\nI truly feel terrible. I wasn’t aware that I was supposed to sit and wait for updates or something as the surgery goes on? I didn’t know they did that. I figured I’d know the same amount of information through a phone call.

      "description": "Our area supermarket expanded last year and now it’s a big warehouse store. There’s like 300 parking spaces, but one of these spaces is reserved for parents with toddlers.\n\nI drive an hour and half to work one way each day. On Wednesday night I was getting back to into town around 9:45pm. I had to go grocery shopping which I mentally anguish thinking about having spent this long in the car. I also had to shit really bad. So I aim for a spot up front near the area where they have the store restrooms. Usually there’s spots at this hour because no one shops this late and the store closes at 11pm. I pull up and discover it’s the reserved parents spot, but oh well.\n\nYou can guess what happened. I leave the store and there’s an unkempt smoking dude by my car with his two little kids. Just waiting there for me to shame me for taking the spot. I didn’t confront him. I waited in the store for about 10 minutes until he gave up and took his kids home. I think he ashed his cigarette on my car though.\n\nNow I’m not falling for this. How does this guy know if I’m not a parent with kids? There’s no special tag you’re given to park there. How can the supermarket possibly have a tag system that covers the whole parent population of the county for that one measly space? There’s no fine either, not breaking any laws parking there. What was his plan if I came out with kids? Is he the only parent on Earth that is expected to shop with children at night? What’s disgusting is this guy is subjecting his kids to waiting in the cold to make a point, and a worthless one in my view.\n\nThis is one parking space out of 300+ spaces on the property and a surrounding population of over hundreds of thousands of people. Many of them parents. How can any parent with toddlers like this guy have the assurance to expect to park in this one parking space every time they go grocery shopping at this store? You’re competing with all other parents, dude.\n\nWhen does being a parent suddenly mean you’re not able bodied? I’m not going to park in the handicapped space, I’d never get away with that in a million years. And I’d feel like shit for doing that to a disabled person. And I’m not parking in the “employee of the month” space that was right next to the “parents with toddlers” space, because the employees who get the carts in the parking lot probably know the cars of their coworkers, and I’d catch shit for that.\n\nBut my conclusion is this: this guy saw my car in the space and probably thought no one is shopping this late at night on a weekday with their children, and that I must be a non-parent , parking in a space that he probably wouldn’t park in anyway given the amount of competition for the spot. So let’s feel special and make a statement. It’s apparently not enough that they have seats in the shopping carts.",

      "description": "I (26m) and my girlfriend (25f) have been in a relationship for a little over two years. We moved in together after a year, both of our names are on the lease. I thought we had a real connection but I guess she thought differently. Two days ago she sat me down in tears telling me she had to confess something to me. She calmed down enough to tell me how sorry she is, but that we need to break up because she has realised she is a lesbian. She told me she has fallen in love with a girl in her workplace and does not want to have an emotional affair while stringing me along. I immediately freak and tell her how can she be a lesbian if we've been having sex. She told me that it felt wrong, but it didn't feel unsafe: she feels comfortable enough with me as a person and she mistook that for sexual attraction.\n\nI calmed down and apologised to her for flipping out (I was screaming) and told her of course I still loved her/supported her in her sexuality I was just hurt. I asked her if she had found other arrangements for where she was going to live because we aren't going to live together. She looked confused at this and told me she was going to ask ME to leave, since I work from home and could, in her words, \"go anywhere.\" She lives within walking distance of her office aka why we agreed on this apartment. I told her that was ridiculous, she cannot afford it on her own and I can (she pays 40% of rent I pay 60%), she tells me as soon as I have found alternate arrangements she plans on having her cousin move in. She also tells me I can take as long as I need to find anything, whether it be a few days or even a few months, just that she wants me to be planning on moving out. I tell her she's being selfish and she is the one who broke up with ME, so she needs alternate plans. She insists that I should leave because I can afford another apartment by myself and she can't, and bc of the proximity of her work. I told it's probably best if she goes somewhere else for the night and we can reconvene in the morning. She agrees. I tell her if she has nowhere, I'll give her money for a hotel, she tells me it's fine.\n\nThe next day she shows back up. I ask her if she found something okay and she tells me she slept on the couch of the coworker she has a thing for. This is absolutely crazy to me since I offered her money for a hotel and she refused. I asked her what they did and she looks guilty and says they cuddled for a bit but didn't do anything. I tell her sure that's what happened because come on, they obviously slept together. I called her a whore and she kicked me out told me she had had enough and I needed to be out by the end of the week and that she had tried to be reasonable. I told her she had been nothing but unreasonable, and she told me she was going back to her \"friends\" and that she wants me packing up by the time she gets back.

      "description": "Afew days ago I went to my local Healthcare Center and had an appointment with my family doctor. I went there because I have Tonsillitis and it reached the point where I have a sore throat and high fevers. I talked about it and asked if I could take any medication to help or if I had to have my tonsils removed. After that I asked if he could write up a note since that day I missed school for that appointment and it's procedure to justify in case a patient is missing work or school. He, insted of helping me, started insulting me saying I always go there and waste his time on useless crap and claimed I was a brat that I couldn't do anything on my own. (To clarify, I'm 17. I mark my own appointments and go there by myself. I only go if I have a pain that goes over a week, or if I have a strong pain and if I have a fever thats 39°C or high. It's a 30 minute walk and I always go by myself. I even by my own medication). He proceded then to ask me to leave his office. I was completly shocked. I knew he was rude, really rude. To the point where his other patients would tell me if he was in a good mood or not. When I got home I told my mom about it. My mom is the type of mom that doesn't make complaints even if it was justified. That day she told me to file a complaint against him in the Healthcare Center. I was thinking about it. I talked to mt boyfriend about it to get a second opinion on the matter, and  he reminded me of something I tend to forget about my family doctor. He's the boss in my local Healthcare Center. My boyfriend then explained that maybe he's rude because he's stressed. Thinking about it made me feel like an asshole for wanting to file a complaint. I'm still torn over it. No one tells me directly it I'm an asshole, but I've had people say something in the lines of \"It it was me, I'd do this, not what you want to do since that seems more logical.\"\n\nSo, WIBTA if I actually filed a complaint about him?",

      "description": "Posting from a throwaway since I use my regular account on craft subs where the sister I just had the huge blow up with is also active. \n\nSo I was at our family's annual superbowl/womenbeatingday party which is usually pretty fun because for the most part it's the only day I see all of my brothers and sisters in one place. I have two nieces that adore me but I truly don't get along with my sister so I see them at this party and the random times my mom will have them. \n\n\nSince I haven't seen them since just after Halloween, I was asking them what the got for Giftmas? We had a great conversation and they were so cute. My sister had to plow her way into the conversation and told me \"in our family, we will call it christmas.\" I told her in my house, I don't. She said that that while I'm talking with her children she insisted I keep in mind the reason for the holiday. I was totally laughing my ass off because when she left I started telling the girls that actually Giftmas is not really \"christian\" at all, it's just a redoing of a pagan ceremony of Saturnalia in order to trick people into giving money to the church. I wasn't aware that my sister was eavesdropping and she told me that she didn't appreciate what I was doing and took the girls away. I asked her what I was doing and she said one of the reasons she and I can't get along is because I'm so \"fucking dense.\"; I told her that was nice language to use in front of her kids. She told me that maybe it was better if I left. I told her that it wasn't her house. \n\n\nMy mom asked me what was wrong, I told her that I refuse to say christmas and that Patty is freaking out because I call the holiday Giftmas. My mom said that it sounded like I was starting trouble, I told my mom about Patty swearing and as per usual she took her side and basically said I should go home. \n\n\nNot wanting big drama, I just left and came to a friends house. \n\n\nAm I the asshole here? I pretty much feel like I should be allowed to use whatever words I want. \n",

      "description": "Some context here. Me and my girlfriend have been together for just over a year, and things have been going really great. My girlfriend suffers with fibromyalgia, and as a result of this also has to deal with vaginismus. The vaginismus has caused our sex life to deteriorate over the past six months, and we haven't even attempted to have sex since Christmas. \n\nMy girlfriend started to see a specialist a few months ago, but has since stopped. I said when she started to see the specialist that I would be happy to go as long as necessary without sex, so long as she was still seeing the specialist. Now she has stopped, and every time I even talk about sex, my girlfriend accuses me of trying to put pressure on her, which I may be trying to do subconciously, if I'm honest. I only want her to go back to the doctor, I obviously don't want to force sex when it is extremely painful for the both of us.\n\nI'm far from the most sexual person in the world, but this long time without sex is really starting to take its toll on me, and in some ways, the relationship. Not only do we not have sex, but it's getting to the point where we are not doing anything sexual. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I was to tell my girlfriend that she needs to go back to the specialist, or I would have to think about leaving her?",

Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool’s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat “if it’s real” to make sure we knew we didn’t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here’s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn’t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I’m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone.

      "description": "So, there is a lot of backstory here but I will try to keep it brief. I am 29 and a single father, my sons mother has him on the weekends. My mother lives in the area (about 30 miles away) and I do not have contact with her and have not in many years. To put it simply she was a horrible mother. I moved out at 16 (junior year of HS) and lived with my HS best friend and his family until I graduated. I have made various attempts at reconnecting with my mother over the years and they always end very badly and left me in a massive depression spiral  and overall bad place (she is very narcissistic and emotionally draining). Following the advice of friends that have known me for a long time I made a choice a few years ago to cut her out completely and it has been very healthy for me and my life. \n\nSo, I recently learned that my Ex has been using my mother as daycare on the weekends so she can do things (run errands, go on dates etc). She is aware of my lack of relationship with my mother and I had previously made it really clear to her that I didn't want our son to have contact with her and don't want her in our lives. I was livid when I found out, not only is she going behind my back but if she needed to do stuff that weekend there is really no reason he cannot stay at home with me (my home is his primary residence, he doesn't even have a room at her house) or her parents who also live nearby. \n\nThis has resulted in a few altercations with my Ex. She tells me that she wont send him over there again, my son tells me when she does, I confront her etc etc.  Now my son has somewhat of a relationship with my mother and my Ex doesn't think it would be fair to him to end the relationship (or at least that's the excuse she is using, I suspect she just likes free daycare). this has been n going on for a few months now and I really don't know what to do. My Ex is treating me like I am a horrible person for \n&gt;\"not wanting my son to have a grandmother\"\n\nBut I just feel like I am doing what's best for my and my sons mental stability and health. The choice to cut my mother out of my life (I legitimately have not so much as spoken to her in 3 years) has not been an easy one. But overall it has improved my life and health and was a very good choice.  \n\nYet, my Ex keeps doing this and I guess there is nothing I can do. ",

We've lived in the same area for years and this is a new thing that she started doing in the past couple of weeks.  My guess is that she's picked it up from some tv shows like the mother on Speechless or maybe the guy from Expedition Unknown.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her I thought it sounds forced.  She replied with an, \"alright then\"  and that was the extent of the conversation.  She hasn't said it around me since.  I don't think the way I did it was the problem, but my concern is that she was trying to add something interesting to her personality by picking something like that up and I squashed that.  What could be worse is that she could still talk like that around others, but not me, which I wouldn't want.  I don't want to be controlling, but over use of words like literally, yeah and \"I know, right?\" really do start to get on my nerves. I suppose I could be over analyzing this, but I figure I'd ask.

Earlier today we had to stop for gas on the way back and my mother thought it was a bit rude that I didn’t offer to fill it up for her (generally I do but I’m a bit tired after a long day). I always thought that the driver’s responsibility to fill up the tank not me just because I am her son. Not really a bit deal but is is the driver’s responsibility or AITA for not just sucking it up and doing it anyway?\n\nTLDR: Had to stop for gas the day after I drove for 5:30 hours and didn’t offer to fill up the gas for my mother saying that it is the driver’s job not mine just because I am with her.

      "description": "Going to make this 3 year long roller coaster as short as possible but still give context.\n\nOf course, this is just my side of the story. I wasnt the best either.\n\nher name is \"Jade\"\n\nWe were together for 2 years and she and after a huge fight and she tried to kick me out. After the dust settled we calmed down and I told her I needed a break. I told her I wasnt going to be sleeping with anyone because Im still all about her, but that I needed space. I realized that I leaned on her too much and she couldnt handle it, no matter how much she said she could. I told her we needed time and I needed to make friends and have something to my life besides our relationship. She would ask me to come over and see her and I did every other week, but it was really bothering her. It was hard on me too but I just... i needed time.\n\nI told her if she slept with anyone else that she needed to tell me, and that I wouldnt be mad but I would have to really end it. Couldn't handle the thought. She said she was paranoid of me finding someone \"better\". I told her that wasnt going to happen but, if it did, I wouldnt lead her along. I tried my best to let her know it wasnt like that.\n\nSeven. Seven times she told me she would never do that and that she didnt want anyone and it was only me and all that. I was skeptical because I know she's very promiscuous and bipolar... but I just wanted us to work so bad and her being my world and the only focus really wasnt working for us. I needed to not smother her so I wanted to meet friends and shit and get some time alone to maybe come back to is with a new perspective. \n\nShe kept contact and talked to me every other day. Good Morning and sending memes etc. After a week i met this chick \"Jessica\" through a coworker. Jessica was very my type. Physically and mentally. We didnt tak about doing anything but we clicked so wel I knew we could and... I just couldnt. I met someone who fit me so well and I just couldnt bring myself to do anything because in my head I was still with Jade and she was my world. it didnt feel right, and I never tried anything because of it.\n\nJessica finally asked me if she wanted me to come to her place one night and I told her I was sick. I knew what she wanted but I got actually physically ill at the thought of hurting Jade like that. That night I immediately texted Jade and said I needed to talk tomorrow. I had decided that she was the one, that I could get over the past and we were obviously meant to be together. It was finally going to be okay.\n\nWe met at the Subway we had our first \"date\" and she thought it was adorable. I told her about Jessica and that I was sorry it took so long for me to get my head right.\n\nWe got back together, and I was the happiest I had been in 12 years. As we ate lunch I got a weird pit in my stomach and asked if she had slept with anyone.\n\n\nShe just looked me in the eye woth a bit of surprise and said \"Yes\". I dont even remember reacting I just said \"Who\" and she said it was the fucking 18 year old bag boy at her work. A few days ago. The one she said i had nothing to worry about and it was just friends and \"He's 18, I might try to set him up with my Daughter\" fucking guy. HIM. She said it was because she felt like she couldnt come to me but we saw each other 1 week before and I was texting her BEFORE AND AFTER it happened. I told her if it got too hard to call me because I still wanted her but I needed her to respect that I needed time away. it's a very sensitive topic.\n\nIm not going into detail about the rest. It sparked an identity crisis and we both said very unkind things to each other the following month. She said in anger once \"I bet I could fuck (him) again, want me to send pics this time?\" and i guess i wasnt ready for something that acidic. I tried to kill myself when I was drunk the night she aaid that to me. Im still alive because I just suck at most of the shit I do these days anyway so I forgot to chamber the round while I was crying and having my little episode.\n\nI changed after all that. for months it was either anger and hatred, or sadness and self loathing. I dont \"feel\" emotions the way I used to, idk how to say it right... im just... unrecognizable. My parents told me the same, that I look \"lost\" all the time.\n\nwell, we split up a month after she told me that, and all the fighting etc. I told her so many times that I didnt want to lose her but I couldnt stand the thought of it and for her to just stop talking to me. I told her to move on like she tried before, because I couldnt do it anymore. every 2 weeks she would text or call and try to talk to me and get back together. I was so fucking sad and defeated and ive never felt more insecure about myself.\n\nShe begged me to have lunch with her and just meet up. it was the first time i had seen her in months. I couldnt help it and I agreed. \n\nShe was so beautiful. The angel I missed for so long was there and I couldnt take it. I completely fell apart infront of her. Looking at her and thinking about what hppened didnt hurt as bad and I agreed to get with her again. \n\nThe last 3 months have been very different. I can tell she is so all about me and she does nothing but talk about wanting to be next to me while im at home. The problem is that Ive changed too, she touches me and I fee nothing. Like actually fucking nothing. Like when you caress your own shoulder. the last 3 months I had been so numb to everything that I just ran with the motions. I figured that this numbness was just who I am now. I told her small amounts of it and t just made her incredibly sad and she would go into am episode. Im scared of telling her now because idk what she'll do\n\nThis is where the AITA comes in. i met someone again. Someone who made my heart light up and made me feel something other than the muted acceptance Ive felt since we got back together. I dont want to start a relationship with this other woman because im 100% certain it's platonic on her end and i'm not about to do that \"rebound\" shit,  but Im still capable of feeling this; and Jade isnt making me feel anything close to this or what I used to feel. Im so scared that our reationship is just done. I tried for 2 years to make us work and it's been my whole universe since. Now I see her and I get uncomfortable when she touches me, I hesitate to say I love you because I feel so void when I say it.\n\nI dont want to string her along, i know thats the worst thing in the world. i'm so scared though. Idk if i'm scared of losing her or thet if I leave her i'll \"lose\" whats left of who I used to be or she might just do something stupid and hurt hersef.  it sounds so fucking melodramatic when i type it out but idk how to convey this.\n\nAm I an asshole if I leave? AITA because im having so much indecision? Was I the asshole from the beginning? Are we both just toxic? I cant shake the feeling like we've run our course and it scares me. ",

      "description": "For years she has been unhappy and I have encouraged her many times to move to another position or company. She had never wanted to quit for a variety of reasons but now has had just about enough and is willing to move on. \n\nShe has a masters degree and a long career that would give her the ability to find another decent job. She makes a decent amount of money now and I don’t see why she shouldn’t try to get more if not at least the same amount. \n\nIf she does get another job at 50% her current salary she’ll essentially be earning just barely enough to cover childcare, healthcare, and perhaps a little towards retirement but nothing else. And I mean nothing else leftover. \n\nIs it fair to me and our children for her to insist on finding a job for so much less in pay? Am I an asshole for trying to convince her to set her goals a bit higher. I don’t want to now have to carry the burden of earning all the money for household expenses and disposable income. I also don’t want to have to follow a tight budget instead of having plenty of income with little to no cash worries. Right now we could live on either one of our incomes but if she takes a pay cut and I am downsized (which has happened) we would be in a bind. \n\nShe’s stressed and perhaps thinks a position with less responsibility will be easier on her psyche (she had a mental breakdown). \n\nI have had some stressful jobs so I get it that’s she wants to move on. But I say to something better. When I bring it up she makes it out that I’m being and asshole for not agreeing with her. \n",

When some of my cousins asked me why I didn’t show up to the Hospital to visit him I told them that I knew he was in the hospital but it was the weekend and I was working. Then I said I was going to go visit him after the weekend was over( he passed away Friday night but I wasn’t going to go to begin with) but I simply lied because I dont want them saying stuff like you’re effed up etc etc. (They bought it. Anyways, Just a few minutes ago my mom called me to tell me to show up to the funeral and I said sure I’ll go and then she said to take my camera and record it and I said sure no problem. And I was actually going to do it for free because all my family will be there but then she said how much would you like to get paid for it and I said “oh you’re paying me? Uhh just give me 100 no big deal” and then my mom said “100?.... ummm okay.. I’ll see what they say..” \nthen I said alright and we said our byes and clicked.\nAITA for charging the $100?\n\nTL;DR: grandpa died and my mom called me to go to the funeral and record it. I said OK planning to do it for free but then she said how much would I charge for it so I said $100 and she sounded taken aback by it. ",

      "description": "My (22/F) boyfriend (22/M) and I have been together for a year, and his roommate (his friend since high school) has made pointed comments toward me about my race almost every time he has seen me. It's almost like he needs to bring up my race every time I come over. Or, if he says something about black people he always says \"No offense,\" even if it wasn't that bad in the first place. More recently, he barged into my boyfriend's room as I was lying on the bed (with pants on) and said \"oh, is that what black pussy looks like?\" A week or so later, he was talking about some DV calls he had to respond to (he's a firefighter) and said \"and of course, they were black. No offense, (my name).\" Which really gets my goat because not only have I dealt with DV in my personal life and work with women affected by DV, he himself verbally abuses his girlfriend and gets incredibly angry and destroys things. I've told my boyfriend that I feel uncomfortable around him and he has brought it up to him, but he justifies it as \"he's just joking, he always does this with people he's cool with. He isn't trying to be racist.\"\n\nMy boyfriend brought up to me last night that he will probably stay with roommate because it's cheaper. Understandable. But I tell him if I still feel uncomfortable in his house then I probably would not come over as much. I don't pay rent there so I have no right to be in the house or demand anything anyway, so it would be better for everyone if I remove myself from the situation. My boyfriend doesn't like this and says I'm giving him an ultimatum (which I can understand, and it is shitty, and I don't want to make him choose). I still live with my parents until I graduate in May so coming over to my place is not an option.\n\nSo, AITA? Should I just stop being a stick in the mud? Thanks in advance.",

      "description": "I've casually dated this girl some time back. I was 17 she was 19, she lived a 45 minute drive from me/1 hour train. We went out for half a year, but i was gone all summer, so we maybe saw each other 9 times in total. Recently we argued more and more because i was always pushing for affection, like for her to be sweeter through the phone or just be calm and laugh, and she just sort of took all of my jokes seriously. Whenever i made specific examples, she just said she was showing me she liked me in her own ways. Shes a shyboi so i just said whatever, blow it off.\n\nI always make myself available to hang out but she was working full time and had some courses in school. she'd never really push to set up a day that works, she would find out what was happening, and if it was a carnival in town or a Zabawa (polish party where everyone just drinks and dances? i don't know how to translate that one) then she'd say yes, otherwise if it wasn't anything special she would usually say no.\n\nEventually she said she admitted she wasn't being as affectionate as she could be because shes introverted and the only way she will open up is once we date, which she'll be ready to once her life \"calms down\" and she's accepted into uni (she took 2 gap years to save up and improve marks). Ok, so if she basically wants FWB, who am i to deny.\n\nNearing the end, everytime we talked she'd fight me on small stuff, and i wouldn't respond well because her anger over small things would fuel my want to antagonize her. We took a couple of days of rest, once we started talking again we argued again and she said \"I don't think a friends with benefits relationship will benefit either of us\", so i stopped calling her and responding, because i don't want to remain friends. We're over right? She doesn't get to be apart of my life anymore.  \nShe says i'm an asshole and was just friends with her to hook up, i don't think we hung out a single time without fucking at some point. But i dont think im the asshole because i pushed for more than just this casual shit, but now that it's gone i don't think it'd be beneficial for me talk to her or interact with her at all. She thought removing sex from the equation would fix everything\n\n  \nWhich got me to think, i've never remained friends with anyone I'd rather date. I don't ask every single girl i know out. I have a couple that are cool people and i enjoy talking to, but I only have really pushed myself to be with girls I'd want a relationship with. Sometimes it would work out, sometimes it wouldn't, but i would never remain friends with them. A littttttttle bit because i was hurt, but mostly because the only reason i started talking to them was with that intention, so once i saw that it wasn't going to go further, and they weren't anything special to talk to, i would respond if they messaged me, but i would stop being the one that called and texted them first.",

      "description": "So there's this person I know, lets call them Ronny. I used to know Ronny a long time ago (but even then only a little) when Ronny was a different gender. Ronny is also not white. I'm both white and cis. I'd be lying if I said those factors didn't contribute in my decision to help them.  \n\n\nSee they are in a bad way - desperately poor, depressed, alone, and adrift. I can tell from their social media, they aren't shy about it. I've been those things. In fact I'm not that far removed from them, though I'm getting better. \n\n\nSo one day I reach out to Ronny for no particular reason, and say like hey I just want to say I've been there, things are tough, stay in it, make progress, I'm rooting for you. They say hey thanks, we go on about our days.\n\n\nWeek later Ronny asks for some money. Not a lot, and I know they aren't lying about their poverty. (I've seen like \"I need to eat\" Go-Fund-Me's posted a lot) I'm still pretty poor myself, paycheck to paycheck, but what they are asking for I can do - and like I said I've been there. I've needed help. Luckily I had people to help me and I suspect that might not be the case with Ronny.\n\n\nSo I'm happy to give. But then they come back again for more money every couple of months now. Never a lot, but it's gotten to the point that I feel like they know I'll give it and their like getting too comfortable with it, like taking it for granted. \n\nEven though I am poor, its not the money that bothers me, its the mindset. I worked hard to fix my shit and get my life on track from the time that it was a disaster. I want to support Ronny towards Ronny being able to support themself, I feel invested in that. But I suspect that Ronny is just stringing out desperate decisions and favors and not moving forward. So I say to Ronny I'm willing to give you this money IF I know its going towards something that will help you help yourself, getting a real room to rent instead of couch surfing, getting formal clothes to interview in, job training whatever. Ronny doesn't really want to tell me about their situation, and is kind of insulted when I hinge the money on knowing about their plan for self-improvement. Then race/gender gets brought into it, like these things dictated their poverty. I mean fine, social stigma happens outside of your control, prejudice exists, I'll grant you that even when poor I had a level of advantage over Ronny. I'm not saying its easy. But you still have to take responsibility despite those things and start working to dig yourself out. You have to focus on what you can control even if the system is turned against you. The alternative is just to be crushed or live on charity and pity. If Ronny is working to fix their life I'm thrilled to help them get there. But they say I just don't understand, privileged, nosy, etc. So I said I don't really think I can keep giving you money. \n\nBut I kinda feel like an asshole because like I said the money was not a lot, and I know sometimes when your life is a shit-pile you don't really want to talk about it or face the mountain of work it would take to turn it around. I wanted to encourage them to start that process but I think I just became another person abandoning them.\n\nTLDR: I start giving money to a poor, depressed person on a semi-regular basis, but cut it off when the person refuses to talk to me about how they are planning to improve their situation.",

I asked him if i had done something wrong and he said no, im busy at work, some of us have to work you know. \n\nI also work full time, have a 2 year old and im currently pregnant, so this obviously got my back up. I replied saying 'ouch.' He then kicked off saying that he cant say anything to me without me kicking off. I replied and said omg, ok, im sorry, but it just escalated.  I started to cry and rang him up and said i didnt want to argue but he called me a disgrace for crying, said i always twist things to make me look like the victim and i never fight my own battles. Then he said he didnt want contact with me until baby was born. \n\nIt's now ended with me saying that ill go to the doctors tomorrow and look at going on medication for depression or low mood or anger issues, i dont even know what is wrong with me. But hes now said he doesnt want to contact me until tomorrow whilst he thinks about this as he doesnt wish to contact me because i have asked him too. \n\nHes 29, im 28, we dont live together, and i will accept it if i am wrong here, but honestly, i dont feel like i am and he is so amazing at the way he words things that i am incapable of explaining my reasoning. \n\nThank you and sorry for the long post.

      "description": "So, I'm (20/m) currently enrolled at my local community college studying carpentry. I worked all of this past summer with a small local contractor who had work going on all around our municipality, and would frequently have us all driving for well over an hour to get to job sites. I didn't have my license at the time so I would carpool with other workers, but when no one was passing by my area, I'd have to bus. Because of this, near the end of the summer I bought a used Kia, and later in October finally got my full license. Now I drive to school everyday instead of bussing/ferrying there, and I've generally enjoyed the freedom and mobility of having my own vehicle. I'm also the only one of my siblings to currently own a car or to have ever bought a car themselves.\n\nMy older brother (23/m) is working to earn his CPA certification at a large accounting firm. He has a license but not a car, since he has no regular need for one. He asked me last night if he could use my car tomorrow to drive to an audit in a nearby area just outside of the city that we both live in, since his usual ride had an appointment. I thought about it for a day and told him that I'd need it for school. He's now extremely mad at me. \n\nHe needs to be at work for 8:30, and my class is for 12:30. Both of us have approximately a one hour commute to our respective destinations if we take transit. He feels that since my class is later in the day it's not a big ask, which isn't totally unreasonable, but I feel that asking someone to give up their vehicle when they would be using it for something important is actually a big ask. I worked my ass off all summer and on weekends during the school year at a butcher shop to be able to afford that car, and he was gifted a car back in high school by my parents which due to poor decision making and lack of care and attention is now in a dump somewhere. He frequently insults my career choice, my hobbies, my taste in music, my clothes, my friends, and even MY ACTUAL CAR. He likes to refer to it as a \"beater\" because it's about ten year old, despite the fact that it's in great condition and runs smooth as can be. I think that it's not unreasonable for me to reserve the right to use my car when I need it.\n\nTL;DR my brother wants my car for a work thing, I won't let him because I use it to get to school.",

      "description": "My mom has 5 dogs and 2 cats in her small surbuban home. Let's just say the house smells like 10 dogs live there. Its disgusting but thats another story...\n\nAnyway, I came home to visit and my heart broke for my sister's childhood cat (she did not take the cat after moving out and has no plans to take her). The cat, Tiger, is about 12 years old, overweight, teary eyes, hasn't been to the vet in YEARS, and she is not grooming as I expect a cat to. She smells like she rolled around in piss and has poop stuck to her butt and shes short haired.\n\nI got upset when I saw her. I asked how long has she been like this and my mom shrugs. I brush Tiger and she can't get enough attention- super affectionate, licks my hand, and follows me around when I stop petting her. \n\nAt one point my mom made a comment that she barely pets the cat. That was when I knew she wasn't getting the love and attention she deserves.\n\nMy ideal plan was to take Tiger back home with me (7+ hr drive), bring her into the spare bedroom and slowly transition her to our home. Problem is, I don't want 5 cats (we already have 4). \"Legally\" my city restricts you to 4 cats too. Once she adjusted and wasn't stressed out, I planned to go through the shelter I volunteer at to find her a quiet home that will actually pet her. I was concerned how stressful it would be to uproot Tiger's life but I truly think after she adjusted she would be happier.\n\nIn the past, my mom has said things like \"dont adopt another cat! I'll give you one!\" So I assumed she would be on board with the plan.\n\nMy mom was not on board. When I offered to take her she was ok, but when I said I planned to rehome her, she didn't want that. My mom started crying and was offended. She said things like: \"she's content!\" \"A lot of cats have it worse.\" \"Its not like I dont feed her.\" \"We've had Tiger for 12 years, its one thing if you take her but I don't want you to give her away.\"\n\nI said things like: \"I thought you didn't want her.\" \"I just want to do what's best for Tiger.\" \"I didn't mean to offend you.\" \"I can just picture her happy in a quite home being the center of attention.\" \n\nAt one point I said, \"You know she doesn't get a lot of attention\" \n\nMy mom replied, \"none of them do.\"\n\nI feel bad that I offended her, and I do realize it was offensive, but I am also angry. I thought my mom was being selfish considering she doesnt have the money to take Tiger to the vet and barely gives her any attention. I apologized and told her I just want to do whats best for the cat and thought she (mom and cat) would be happy. I told her I wouldnt take Tiger since I can't keep her.\n\nI know its not my place to rehome her cat and I feel like an asshole for being insensitive and also angry at my mom. I feel like I ruined my short visit with her too. Despite that, I still wish that I could take her. AITA?",

      "description": "Another post has me wondering. Lately the only way my kid will stay quiet and still for diaper changes is if I let him hold my phone playing kids’ music and sing along. This is fine at home, and if I’m sick to death of Victor Vito and Freddie Vasco eating their burritos up and down the west coast, I can change him on the floor and deal with squirmy worm for a few minutes. In public, he’s tried to climb off changing tables multiple times in the last week, and when he isn’t trying to crawl off the edge he’s trying to pull to stand or he’s screaming his head off because diaper changes are the worst thing that’s ever happened to him.\n\nFWIW, I’m not a bad singer so long as I stay in my chest voice - a bad asthma flare left me with chronic cough, some airway scarring, and a really gnarly transition to head voice. The music he likes is all well within my range, and we rarely make it through more than two two minute songs. I know he can throw my phone, I have a heavy duty case and I’m pretty confident it can take it. If I don’t sing along and dance and make silly faces, or if I just sing alone without letting him hold the phone or without playing music, we’re right back to attempting suicide by four foot headfirst plunge onto tile.",

      "description": "For a bit of background, I'm 25M and work in IT, my girlfriend of 2 years is 24F and works at a museum. We have lived together for the past year-ish and since I make more than her, we split shared bills proportionately by income, which comes out to about 70-30. We have been living below our means and both putting aside $x per month to buy a condo or townhouse together.\n\nMy girlfriend has a male coworker (\"Mark\") that she knew in college, they worked together on their semester-long capstone project for Anthropology and then both ended up getting a job at the same place after graduating, so they are pretty close. I will state for the record that I have no problem with my girlfriend having male friends. She has a lot of friends, both male and female, and is quite the extrovert. About six months ago my girlfriend told me that Mark had told her that he and an archaeologist buddy of his were tossing around the idea of going to Turkey and asked her if she wanted to come. It didn't sound like a very solid plan, so I just said \"Oh yeah, that would be fun if we had the money. Maybe we can save up and go on a vacation next year.\"\n\nWell, fast forward to now, my girlfriend comes to me and tells me that the Turkey trip is really happening, it's in two months, Mark invited her again and she had saved up enough money to go so she wanted to do it. Now that this is suddenly \\*real\\*, I am a little caught off guard and also pretty sure I don't want my girlfriend going on an international vacation with two men.\n\nI'm thinking of telling her not to go based off of how I feel, which is this:\n\n\\- I don't know these guys very well. I trust her, but have no reason to trust them.\n\n\\- Turkey is a volatile country and not safe to visit, especially for a woman. Maybe someday, but not now.\n\n\\- The money would be much better spent going towards the house. The only reason she has that much \"fun money\" saved up is because I am paying 70% of the living expenses.\n\n\\- She doesn't have to go all the way overseas to visit archaeological sites and museums, especially because her career focus is on the Americas.\n\n\\- I just don't think it's appropriate for a girl in a relationship to spend 2 weeks abroad with two guys while her boyfriend sits at home.\n\nI really don't want her to do this and I also feel like she went behind my back planning to go on this trip all this time. WIBTA if I said don't go?",

      "description": "In the spirit of the sub, I'm writing this to get some new perspectives on a small roommate argument that's been consuming my attention. Partially also to sort it in my own head. Here goes: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, a low value item (\\~$5) was traded between myself and my roommate, or rather, I gave it to him with the expectation he would pay me back (this was clear to both me and my roommate). \n\nSome days pass, maybe 3 or 4, during which I semi-jokingly remind them at least once that he still owes me for the item, and that he can just Venmo me $5. I felt what I perceived as some pushback to this, joking that he just wouldn't pay me back, or I should wait until he gets cash. This bothered me slightly; I felt it wasn't really his place to decide the terms on which I get paid or when I get paid, but at the time it wasn't a big deal. \n\nSometime soon after, maybe that next weekend, my roommate leaves for a couple days. I take the opportunity to go into his room and take the item back. \n\nI'm not sure how this will be perceived here, but I can honestly say that at the time I didn't see it to be a big deal; the reaction I expected was along the lines of, \"Oh ha ha, very funny, I'll pay you back now just give me the item back\", and it would be over. I guess I thought this because that's how I figured I would react.  \n\nInstead, I very clearly stepped on his toes, and when he found out the item was gone he barged into my room pretty pissed, and demanded the item back. I gave it to him, and received Venmo payment minutes before.\n\nAfter this point, it kind of died between myself and my roommate. We didn't discuss it, but he was acting cold to me afterwards, the only time I can remember in our friendship that things were this uncomfortable between us. It only came up again maybe 3 weeks later when I was drunk one night and we talked about it. \n\nThe talk started with them asking if I'd realized he was acting distant from me recently, and if I realized that I'd done something to them to make them act this way. This was a few weeks later, so I had to stop a try to recall for a moment what I'd done, but remembered this incident pretty quickly and brought it up. \n\nI'll try and express their side of the argument as truthfully as possible. It was a long talk, but essentially he said that he thought it was petty of me to take the item back when it was such low value, that friends don't do that because they respect and trust their friends to pay them back, that the $5 obviously wasn't going to break the bank for me and it wasn't worth invading their privacy to send that message. \"You're not a mob thug, you don't have to 'send a message' to me to pay you back, we're friends\". \n\nI expressed in return that the price of the item didn't matter, it was based more on principle that I don't like having debts between friends, and I try to pay my friends back as soon as possible to erase the debts because I respect the friendship. I also brought up that, given how little time it actually takes to Venmo someone money, there isn't really an excuse to not have paid someone back asap and that I refused to believe he didn't have 2 minutes of free time in the week after the exchange. I also expressed that going into his room while they were gone was clearly a mistake and apologized for that, saying that if I'd known how it would affect them and the friendship, I would not have done it.\n\nThis is way longer than I thought it'd be now, so to wrap it up, I feel a little bit like I tried compromising, and pushing for us both to accept that I should have respected the friendship more and given him more time to pay me back, while by the same token he should have made it a point to pay me back a bit earlier, but we didn't know how each other would react; I thought paying back friends promptly was the respectful thing to do, he thought giving friends time to pay each other back shows respect for the friendship.  He seemed to view this compromise as a loss, saying that If we both do that he is just conceding to my demands by paying me back earlier. I also have a problem with how long this grudge has been held; it's quite a bit after the initial incident now, and talking about it only seemed to make the friendship even more uncomfortable. \n\nSo tell me what you guys think: Does the price of the item matter? I know I misjudged how invading his privacy would make him feel and I've apologized, that's not really the point of contention, but am I wrong for thinking this is not a grudge-worthy incident? Should I have final say on how and when I get paid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I \"stole\" back my own property from my roommate after he took longer than I thought was reasonable to pay me back. I didn't see it as a big deal, but it has affected the friendship disproportionately (in my opinion, of course), and talking about it has only made it worse. Do friends give each other time to resolve debts, or do friends resolve debts immediately? Do friends hold grudges over this type of thing? Does the price of the item matter? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway as I'm half expecting to get flamed &amp; also sorry if there are parts that don't make sense, I had to condense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContext: my(22M) gf (21F) and I have been together for over 2 and a half years. I'll admit I'm not saint and for the most part she has just been putting up with me. We mostly talk about any issues or concerns that come up and they get resolved fairly quickly and painlessly. She also stays with me 3-4 days a week (Wednesday night/Thursday through Sunday, not important but figured I'd add it.) and lives roughly 45 minutes away from me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday while I was at work my gf texted me saying she had to meet someone she did not know in a local town last night to get something for her mom. No one specific and she was just getting a package but wouldn't tell me what it was exactly. I thought it was weird that she was meeting someone in a close-by town where it doesn't seem her family would know anyone (they keep more to themselves.) I brushed this off though as she made it seem she was only gonna be gone for a little bit (the drive to where she was meeting is about 20-25 minutes from my house.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI came home from work around 6PM and we waited for this person to message her. Well it wasn't until about a little after 9PM that she supposedly got a text (which I wasn't allowed to see but didn't bother me then) about meeting this person. She leaves and even texts me when she gets there saying the person is not there yet so it would take longer than expected. A little over an hour passes and I ask if shes okay. I then get a response around 20ish minutes later saying they \"are just visiting\" (which is weird cause she told me earlier she didn't know the person.) Then an hour later (past 11:30PM) I get another text saying they \"lost track of time.\" At this point I was dead ass tired and I'm pretty sure I passed out shortly after. It wasn't until nearly 1AM that she tries to sneak into the room and climb into bed. It woke me up but I didn't say anything at this moment because I was too tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I woke up to go to work I asked her why she was out so late and she just repeated that they lost track of time. Now I'm not the smartest guy in the world but my gut was telling me she was not being truthful about what she was doing and who she was with. I called her out on it and she told me that she actually went to a mutual friend's (30ishF) house to talk. I still do not know if this is the truth even though this friend texted me later saying that my gf was there. I don't know if I was more upset about her lying or maybe that I really doubted her still, but I told her to grab her stuff and leave. Shes been blowing me up all day, half apologizing and half accusing me for old things in the past to make it seem like what she did was okay. I have not actually broken up with her yet rather I have just been ignoring her to do my work. AITA for doing this?",

I asked my mom why my cats dish was in the sink, as he might get thirsty. She said she has to wash his bowl before she put it back for him. Honestly I’m in my mid 20’s I live at home and I don’t help much with cooking and cleaning. So I was holding a sponge and I asked her if this was the correct one to use. And she told me “no use the older one”. I found an older one and it wasn’t correct. I told her that. Then I saw one in the sink and I asked which one. She rolled her eyes and got up to come to the kitchen. I told her she did not need to and I was just trying to help. She then started complaining how she was at work all day, on her feet, and she’s sick. I then went upstairs and started crying (I cry easily). A little while later she calls my name and I answer “what” from upstairs. She then complains about my attitude when I say it and that I should come down when she’s talking to me. She then once again starts complaining about the fact that she was at work, etc, and I made her get up. I told her all I was trying to do was help. She sees me crying and she gets more angry, telling me I ruined her night and my own. I just go upstairs and I hear here talking to her husband and he says pretty much that she did not have to get up. I then see her one more time in her room because I was handing her something she asked for. She asked me if I was happy ruining the night over this. She said if I actually wanted to help I would/should (don’t remember which) help her cook and clean. And basically saying oh you wash one dish and you think you’re helping me?? As if I made a production out of washing one dish. If anyone even reads this I would appreciate an outside opinion.. thanks ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I, both in our mid 20s are together for four years. There has been an issue with a female co worker of his for over two years. He hang out at her house in secret 1.5 yrs ago, I found out much later. He claims nothing happens. They still work together and text sometimes, but less frequent. He swears he won't hang out with her - she has send inappropriate texts and such.\n\nWe live together in our own house. I leave every monday morning to another city and come back tuesday morning for work issues. This means he is alone for 24 hours.\n\nThis tuesday morning 10am I got out of the bus and saw that girl walking to the bus. We live in a small craphole place, with nothing to do. We have a supermarket, a bakery, one tiny clothing store and that is it. This girl lives in another city, works in another city and studies in another city. I know she has NO friends or family in our town, because she mentioned it earlier to my boyfriend. (\"You are the only one I know that wants to live in that crap place!\")\n\nWhat was her reason to be there, so early in the morning? I came home and my boyfriend was in bed asleep, with the window and curtains open. He always sleeps with the window and curtains closed. Also his jacket lay on the floor near the door. We live together for 4 months and his jacket never laid on the floor before.\n\nI confronted and he said she was not there and has never been to our house. Then I decided to check his internet history. Yes, fellow redditors, I know this is wrong but I do NOT want a rant about this - I know how much Redditors want to burn alive people who do this. I checked it. It was a mistake. I know. Please no rant about how bad it is or how my relationship is doomed already.\n\nSo I saw that the evening before he watched some netflix on his tablet until 11PM. After that, things get weird. He watched youtube on his mobile from 11.00 to 11.19 PM. This is odd, because I am with this guy for 4 years and he NEVER watches youtube on his phone when he is inside the house. He always only does this when he is in the bus, outside or whatever. However no busses drove at that moment so that can't be true. After 23.19 there was no signs of activity anymore on his phone, tablet or computer.\n\nHe set up an alarm clock at 22.59 PM. \n\nThe first next activity was next day 08.04 am when he put off his alarm clock, and then 08.30 on Whatsapp.\n\nHe has a car that he shares with his mom. Wednesday we got into the car and he said; Mom keeps asking bout the car and drives my fuel till its empty. And I said; no she didn't asked for the car for at least 2 weeks why you bring this up? He just said oh it bothers me.\n\nHe kept bringing up this girl a couple of times. \"I don't think it was her, I think you saw it wrong. Probably can't be her\" blah blah. \n\nHe got angry and sad when I asked him if he cheated and he denied all and called me paranoid.\n\nSo, fellow Redditors. What do you think? Am I the asshole for accusing him of cheating?",

      "description": "This new family moved into a house across the road from me and everyday their dog is found roaming the street barking at everyone and everything. I have two dogs a medium sized border collie and a chiweenie this is important to note because their dog is easily 2 times the size of my border collie. \n\nLast Saturday they went out and left their dog roaming the street for over 9 hours and tonight I went to get my mail and it was standing on the walk way leading up to my door. I just dont trust the animal and I think as a responsible dog owner you should keep your dog in your yard/house not give it free reign of the neighbourhood.  My brother tried to put it in their backyard but couldn’t get close enough to the dog due to the barking and aggressive behaviour. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I contacted the council about the dog being left home alone and on the street?

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to go to Chinese New Year with my girlfriend? Hey",
      "description": "Gh\nMy Chinese girlfriend is upset that I only want to spend 2 days with her family during Chinese New Year (CNY). I don’t want to go because her family does not speak English well and I do not speak Mandarin. I have spent two CNYs with her family before and both times I spent the vast majority of the week feeling incredibly bored. \n\nI feel guilty but at the same time I really, really do not want to spend an entire agonisingly tedious week with her family. I can deal with it for a few days. But after a couple of days have exhausted all my foreigner repertoire (yes I am not very tall but neither are you hahaha...) I am stuck with a fixed smile and resisting the urge to use my phone. It gets to the point where I am doing unworthy childish stuff like sneaking off during lunches or extended family hangouts.\n\nI have tried to get involved but I just can’t seem to get past the language barrier. I leap on any opportunity to play cards or things like that. Anything where I can have fun and try to connect with her family. But that still leaves like 10 meals with an hour or two either side of them for me to endure. Last time I tried drinking well beyond my usual 2 beer limit to see if that helped, but I just got fucked up on rice wine and felt paranoid about embarrassing her by throwing up or stumbling around. Maybe this time I’ll try a few puffs of weed before going. \n\nBasically I don’t want to go because I can’t communicate with anyone. It’s like going to a party where you don’t know anyone and also they all speak Mandarin, and then that party lasts a week. Things would be different if I knew Mandarin and I feel bad for not being even remotely fluent, especially since my girlfriend speaks perfect English.\n\nHer view is that I’m part of her family so I should be there the whole time. She told me, after I suggested that I only stay for a few days, that she feels like she lives in two different worlds, one with her family and the other with me. It bothers her especially since she only sees her extended family a few times a year. \n\nShe cried a lot when we were discussing this but didn’t really address my boredom. I told her that I get bored purely because of the communication barrier. I think she thinks it’s cultural instead which I don’t really get. I honestly enjoy the atmosphere around CNY and don’t find the get-togethers particularly different to Christmas time in my home country. I don’t think I’m making huge cultural faux pas or anything as she’s never brought that up before either.\n\nRegardless, after she started crying I really felt terrible and I was so close to giving in right then and there. I feel like I honestly don’t have much of an argument and that I’m just being a selfish boyfriend. The only thing that has been stopping me is the thought of the last CNY.\n\n\nThis is my first time posting her so I’m sorry if it’s not quite balanced enough for our two viewpoints.\n\nThank you for your judgement.",

      "title": "AITA for getting on my girlfriend's case about paying me back?",
      "description": "My girlfriend and I (both university students) have lived together for around a year and a half. She and I split most costs pretty much evenly, except for groceries where I pay for 60% because I eat more than she does. Because I drive and she doesn't, I'm almost always the person who fronts the money for groceries, house supplies, etc. by putting it on my credit card and then she pays me back through Interac e-Transfers (a thing in Canada where you can email money instantly to/from Canadian bank accounts). I'm actually quite fine with fronting the money like that because I get pretty good points on my credit card.  \n\n\nHere's the problem; she takes FOREVER to pay me back. I usually send her a request for the money she owes me from a transaction immediately after or within an hour of charging it to my card, and then it just sits in her inbox for weeks. At the time of writing this, I have 10 requests for money from her still pending with the oldest being from a week and a half ago. She says it's due to her ADHD and the fact that she has to enter her banking password every time she accepts a request. I've suggested switching to a bank that lets her use her fingerprint (the only thing she'd have to move over is her student loans which just entails sending one letter to the office), but she pretty flatly refuses that as well. Every time I bring any of this up she goes on a rant about how little time she has due to her schoolwork. For reference, it takes about 10 seconds to accept an e-transfer and I've offered to do most of the work in opening a new chequing account for her.   \n\n\nAbout 6 months ago I started quite diligently tracking my expenses so that I know where my money is going. The problem is that her taking so long to accept these requests means the outgoing transaction gets tracked, but no incoming transaction offsets it for weeks, making it look like I've spent nearly double the money I actually have, which completely negates the usefulness of being able to see how much money I have left in different categories at a glance.   \n\n\nI've tried reminding her to accept the e-transfers, but it usually results in a fight where she accuses me of nagging her and stressing her out when she has school to deal with.",

      "title": "AITA for asking my brother to take me to the store, but getting frustrated when he stalled?",
      "description": "A couple of days ago, I asked my brother to take me to the grocery store because I was out of all of the kitchen essentials. I don’t have a car and the store I needed to go to is about 2 miles away. Normally, two miles isn’t much for me and I usually just choose to walk it, but there were so many things that I needed to buy, there would be no way for me to carry it all back. \n\nMy mom arranged for my brother to come pick me up, and he honked at me to come down when he arrived and waved at me to come down quickly, so I did. At this point, I should probably mention that my brother has ZERO sense of time and it’s one of the things that frustrates the people around him to no end. No matter who is in the car, no matter what their schedule is, he will spend at the very least 15 minutes on Facebook on his phone, and it can sometimes be up to two hours. He can’t put his phone down for more than a few minutes at a time and it’s a terrible habit of his. Even after spending time on FB with the car parked, he can’t help but check it while he’s driving, too. I’ve prevented multiple accidents by being his eyes when he wasn’t paying attention.\n\nSo, I gave him some time. But after about 15 minutes, I realize that this might take longer than expected, and I really did need to get the shopping done and out of the way. I know, and everyone who knows him \\*knows\\* that there’s a possibility that he can keep you with him in the car for hours, so I finally said, “Dude, I really gotta \\*go\\*.”\n\nI’ll admit, I could have been more polite, but he interpreted me saying this as being aggressive and he got pissed. Retorted back with, “I’m the one doing YOU a favor, I’ll take as long as I want, you’re not a goddamn queen!” I replied back with the fact that if I agreed to take someone somewhere at a specified time, I would finish up whatever I had to do at home (in this case, perusing Facebook) and then leave, because keeping them that long is just as rude and inconsiderate of their time. And that if it isn’t a pressing matter, then the most efficient option time-wise would be to drop me off, stay in the car, and do whatever he wants while I’m shopping. That way, both parties are satisfied. But no, I had to be considerate of his time and get in the car promptly while he just. . . sits there. For who knows how long. \n\nSo, Reddit, in your opinion, who was the asshole in this situation? I don’t feel great about the way I phrased things, and I know he was trying to do me a favor, but I was also on a schedule.",

      "description": "We're mid-30s, been married 6 years, have a 3 yr old and 1 yr old. I'm not receiving a paycheck due to the shutdown (though I'll receive back pay eventually), and I went way over the budget we set for Christmas (a night/activities out of town while family watched our kid). Our son's birthday is a few days before hers, and she wanted to do a big themed birthday with homemade decorations and activities at her mom's place, 4.5 hours away. We did the party the Saturday after his birthday, and drove home Sunday.\n\nWe packed up us, the kids, (who are both sick), and the decorations after I got back from the doctor on Friday morning, and I drove down. After the kids went down, I helped prep/decorate, and then we went to bed. Got up, went and ran errands, prepped, partied, cleaned, helped with the kids, fed/ate dinner, then wife went to bed. I went out and picked up a card and some flowers, prepped them, and went to bed. She told me she wanted a massage from everyone, so I figured she or I could make the appointment for it this week.\nShe slept in, her mom made her breakfast, and I watched the kids until they napped. Then we packed (which took forever, since we spread out around the house with decorations and food). We had planned on going to the zoo, but since we couldn't afford to take the dog to boarding and the zoo was 2 hours away, that was out. We ran out of time to go to the local state park, and had to leave. We drove to my mom's on the way back, where wife got another gift (on top of her mom/grandmother's gift, and a gift from my stepmom the previous day). Mom cooked us a nice dinner, and put on some music and lit some candles, then dragged the kids away while the two of us ate, which was very sweet.\nDuring dinner, it came out that she was bummed that the day didn't go the way she expected, and was upset that I didn't put enough effort into making her birthday special. Apparently just saying she could make the appointment for her massage according to her schedule wasn't enough, and I should've done more to make it feel like a gift, and less like permission to spend money.\n\nHonestly, I know I'm a little bit of an asshole, I suck at birthdays and special days in general. But on top of parties and travelling, we've got the shutdown, and we're trying to move (there was a drove by shooting a few houses down during the week before Christmas), the owners of our house won't let us out of the lease until they sell it, so we have to clean constantly to be prepped for showings, both kids are sick, work has been stressful (yeah, working for free), the holidays were nuts...like I said, I know I'm an asshole, but don't I deserve a little bit of slack? And it was her call to have a big party out of town the day before her birthday?",

      "description": "As bad as it may sound, I am and have never been mad at the young man himself.  He was probably around late 20-ish, always with his dad or extended family, and I think his condition may have been a lower functioning Autism.  I worked at a fast food place for about two years, and me and my friend usually both worked together whenever we worked.  His father would usually bring him to get food, and the first time (I will call him Gary here) Gary came and introduced himself and me and my friend were more than happy to talk to him. After they ate, Gary walked to the employee door and knock loudly.  We didn’t mind talking to him, so we both went to the hallway to talk to him.   Thats when he first asked for hugs, which we agreed to.  During these hugs he would roughly grope our breasts and butt and kind of rub on both, while his father watched and laughed.  I expected his dad to try to stop the actions, in which he never did.  We didn’t really want to upset Gary so we just got over it.  Then he ended up coming very often, mainly when us two worked.  the next time with his whole family and he told them we were his girlfriends and they thought it was cute.  They still thought it was cute when we would be cleaning and he would come hug and grope on us, and even kissed my coworker on the mouth when she was only trying to hug him hoping it would make him happy and maybe calm down.  Which she nicely was like “Gary, you’re my good friend but please don’t do that.” And his whole family would just be like “come on!! you guys are his girlfriends!”  It even got to the point his father would drop him off and wait in the car while Gary would come inside and sit and try to get us to hang out with him in the lobby while we were working.  At this point we would tell him we couldn’t leave the employee area to hang out and that we were sorry.  We offered to pay for food for him, and he would just say “Im not leaving until i get my hugs.” His father wouldn’t try to get him to come out or anything, and after 40 minutes the hugs were the usual.  After a couple of times, whenever other coworkers saw them come in, we would just stay in the backroom trying to avoid being seen by them.  One time the father himself saw me doing something in the back while I was staying back there and even told Gary how he saw me, to which he ended up screaming for me and I still wouldn’t go out and my coworker would just say it was someone else.  During all this, I felt awful.  I felt awful I was avoiding this man who can not help how he is, but I was furious at his dad.  His dad thought it was fine and cute no matter how uncomfortable we visibly looked.  AITA for my constant attempts of not being seen when Gary and his family came in?",

      "description": "So this is the second time something like this has happened, but I’ll be brief.\n\nMy[26F] brother [29M] , mother and, I live in a house together to conserve money. My mom decides to go to on a business trip with my aunt for some quality sister time. After my mom makes these plans, my brother decides to invite his ex to stay one night while she is “passing through” our town for training. He tells mom and me that she’ll stay Saturday night and then be gone on Sunday. Cool no big deal, I would have loved to know sooner but at least I know (as opposed to the last time when he invited her over to stay for the weekend without telling me... that was a fun Friday after work, finding that out..). \n\nSo mom leaves for the sister trip on Saturday, brother’s ex arrives late Saturday night. Great. Sunday afternoon rolls around and I ask the ex what time she is leaving so we can grab a meal before she goes. Well, she tells me, “oh I’m not leaving until Tuesday.”  To which I reply, “Really, why?”. Brother shrugs and they go back to watching a show. \n\nI pulled brother aside and asked him to talk to the ex about leaving early since we both have work on Monday and I don’t want the random ex snooping around my house. He said he would speak to her but he didn’t. I texted him Monday morning while at work to see when she is leaving. “She is leaving on Tuesday because she wants to cook me dinner”. I told him this is illogical and that he should have spoken to her and told her to leave. Now he is mad at me because I am angry about her presence in this house. \n\nHe doesn’t understand that he is being inconsiderate. But because I am mad at him, I can’t stand to look at her, much less make conversation. I got angry at him for locking the backyard gate on me and ex was there when I did. I am confined to my room because every time I go out into the living room, they are making out. It’s uncomfortable that I feel uncomfortable in my own home. \n\nSo, AITA for being angry at my brother for his surprise guest staying too long in the house and thus, taking it out on the ex as a result?",

She reported it to Bnb and that was that. Flash forward a week and the woman is being hospitalized for something and she was touch and go at multiple occasions. She comes back to the Bnb after a little under 2 weeks with one of those bags that relieves excrement. \n\nAfter only 1 day of not relieving the bag. She got feces all over the bathroom and the mattress ,(destroying it,) in her room. My mom was fed up and asked her to leave because X would not be able to focus on his work with her around. She came back after a couple minutes to tell my mom she would be staying until Monday because X said it was fine. Okay First of all, It’s not X’s house. And Second of all, Fuck you for going behind my mom’s back. \n\nMy mom went to X and asked him about they’re conversation and apparently she just walked up to him, told him she was saying and then went to talk to my mom.

And sometimes she has pictures in her social Media like showing a woman in White underwear thats really bloody and the Text \"normalize menstruation\" or something like that. And in those occasions i often act a bit of disgusted or sometimes I'm making jokes. Nothing too Bad, but maybe slightly offensive, Just to Cover up that im disgusted.\nShe knows that im not completly comfortable with that topic, especially if its very detailed. But she goes on and says Things like \"sweetheart, dont make a fuss)\". Maybe that I'm so uncomfortable with that topic in situations with too much detail is because i dont like seeing or thinking about blood at all, independent thereof where the blood comes from. And Yeah, the fact where the blood comes from and everything makes the thing a little bit more disgusting for me in that case (I'm Not gay though xD)\n\nAnd dont get me wrong, ist have always comforted my ex girlfriends in These \"times\".. I Just think its Not something that should be talked so in a disgusting way..\n\nSo, AITA for Bitching around and being a bit \"cold shoulderd\" whenever its to much for me?\n\nYeah, and at the end i want to apologize for my Bad English skillz, if someone managed to read until here..

      "description": "On St Paddy’s weekend, my pop and two brothers flew in to visit. We (and my friends) go hard- I put my drunk father and a brother in an uber at 3:30pm. My 2nd bro and I stay til 5:30, he gets a bad case of the hiccups so we head home.  \n \n\nMy friend E at some point leaves. She does this thing where she’ll leave and then texts us “should I come back? Is it still cool? Who’s still there?” To decide if it’s worth it.  \n \n\n4pm she starts doing this to our group chat. And we’re like yes! 2 hours of this. Every 10 minutes, we respond each time, so I’m fed up.   \n \n\nGet back to my house 5:50 and she texts me where are you? I’m like E stop just go home. She says “can you come pick me up?” I’m mad, too drunk to drive, I say “no, just go home” She sends me a pic of my location at my house and says “I’m coming.” My struggling pop and bro are sleeping, and my hiccups bro had just fallen asleep on the couch so I say, “no don’t come over” She says “I’m coming” I repeat do not come over 5+ times.  \n \n\nOn arrival I don’t let her in. She calls one of my 4 roommates and texts me “I win”. So as he comes out of his room I’m like dude don’t let her in- and he’s like “oh okay” and goes back. So I text her “E what are you doing I told you not to come, please go home.” Silence. 10 minutes later she’s still on our porch, and I text again, “go home, why are you here?” No response. I was so mad I text, “if you don’t leave in 45 seconds I’m gonna call the cops”. As soon as I hit send I regretted it so I text (20 seconds later), “actually, I’m just gonna come talk to you.” Go outside and say “E what are you doing here?” She says that she’s here to let out another our other roommate’s dog (she never once mentioned that before). I say “I’ll let out the dog, please go home.”  \n \n\nCouple hours later, I text to apologize and she says “I thought you were joking, S \\[dog roommate\\] told me to come let out the dog”. I asked S about it later and she told me that E had told her “I’m going over to your house” and S was like “oh ok, while you’re there, can you let the dog out.” S didn’t actually ask her to come over.  \n \n\nI left the country for a week after that and E told everyone that I had threatened to call the cops on her because she tried to let out our dog. Of course when I told them my side they changed their mind a little bit but not all of them.  \n \n\nI feel if the roles had been reversed, and I (a male) had gone over to E’s house and was drunkenly ignoring her repeated texts to not come over, and refusing to leave, I would be the bad guy. How was I supposed to know she was there for the dog? Also later she said was “stranded” which again, how could I have known since she never responded (and got there somehow).  \n \n\nOne of E’s friends was furious with me and said I should have just let her in regardless, and that S has the right to invite over people too (even though S wasn’t home) and that if I had thought she was drunk I should have taken care of her.   \n \n\nAITA?",

My post was me basically making fun of the fact that antivaxxers think that vaccines cause autism and at the bottom it read \"And if you believe this crap, you should go to jail for child abuse and neglect\" which is what they are doing. Now, when I posted this, my mom was shopping. When she got home she yelled at me that I shouldn't post stuff like that. I said back \"If I can't, why does dad?\" And she said that he was allowed to have his opinions. This happened at about lunchtime (12pm) and I haven't really talked to her since. I feel kinda guilty, which is why I came here. So, o great redditiors, was I in the wrong here? ",

It makes me want to just pay in cash so I can avoid having to outright deny the request for tip all together.\n\nNow if I go into a restaurant, sit down, have a meal, I always tip, but for takeout I almost never tip unless if I’ve been going there for awhile and know the guy in which case I’ll tip every third time or something.

Tonight I spent an hour cooking a meal for the both of us and when I walked into the room I had the goal in mind of paying attention to what she says to see if she said ‘thank you’. I have a pretty bad mental illness and my memory is atrocious so I needed to keep focused or I’d forget what she said. I waited there while she went on to say ‘this is good’ and ‘very tasty’ but she didn’t say thank you. I waited and tried to give her cues, trying to be non-confrontational and make a joke out of it before finally feeling defeated and saying ‘you’re welcome’. She immediately claimed she said thank you multiple times and gave a few examples that weren’t there. I know they weren’t there, because I was looking for them.  \n \n\nSometimes she’ll be outright rude/bitter to me and I’ll call her on it “I did not appreciate what you did just then.” and instead of apologising she’ll change the subject or make a joke out of it. I can’t exactly ask her to apologize and when I later call her on it saying my feelings are hurt she’ll exclaim “I apologized plenty of times!” when I know she didn’t and she will get irritated and upset and I’m still left with hurt feelings.   \n \n\nI feel like she’s taking advantage of my bad memory… and I feel like she doesn’t really care about how I feel. My issue with her behavior is not that she isn’t saying thank you or I’m sorry but that she’s either ignorant she’s neglecting to do so or manipulating me…",

It's interesting, challenging work most of the time, and it helps to be able to see what type of environment my students practice in. However, it is also full of entitled people and those who otherwise can't be arsed to take their kids to a proper music studio. A recent exchange has left me wondering, though.\n\nA parent of two of my students (henceforth \"Florence\") recently signed them up for basketball practice this month. The only problem is that the basketball practice is in conflict with their piano lesson time (one we established months ago, I might add). Less than 24 hours before I am supposed to go over there, she asks if I could possibly move their lesson time half an hour later to let them have time to take a shower in between. A couple things, for context:\n\n-Their lessons are on Saturdays, when I teach for 12 hours straight with a 45 minute lunch break (if I'm lucky and don't have to teach a make-up class to anybody). \n\n-Their lessons are my final lessons on Saturdays.\n\n-Florence and I have discussed moving them to another day in the past, but so far no slots have worked for both of us. \n\n-Florence knows I work long hours on Saturdays.\n\n-Florence has also, repeatedly, attempted to talk me down to charging a quarter of my usual hourly rate (because her kids are so great, don't you know).\n\nSo I refused, and fairly forcefully so. I told her that it seemed that she did not respect my time at all, and suggested a break. I'm actually kind of hoping that she just won't call me back, ever...",

      "description": "TL;DR: I want to go discover myself whilst studying abroad, Mum wants to tag along for a bit. Do I crush her dream by telling her I don’t want her to?\n\nLater this year, I’m [18M] planning to go on study abroad to the UK for about 4 months. My mother [46F] is very excited about this and has suggested we holiday around continental Europe for 2 weeks before I get to the UK. \n\nNow don’t get me wrong; I love my mum more than anything and our personalities are really compatible and we get along well. However I’m not keen to go on holiday with her. \n\nFirstly, we just got back from a holiday overseas together (with other family) that was enjoyable but in no way relaxing due to us all liking different ways to travel. \n\nThis trip of studying abroad will be my first time living out of home and I was kind of hoping for it to be a discover-myself kind of trip and I feel spending two weeks straight in close company to my mum will not be a great start to that. \n\nAlso I can only be overseas for a certain amount of time due to medical reasons and the more time I spend with Mum the less I get to myself. \n\nHere’s a summary of the reasons that I feel bad about not wanting to go:\n- Mum is super excited about it and I don’t want to crush this dream\n- We are not rich and mum’s more than willing to spend lots of money on the trip\n- My Mum had breast cancer last year and I feel like this is a pick-me-up she really wants. \n\nMum’s brought it up around my grandma who thankfully said I wouldn’t want to do that, which my mum unfortunately ignored. I’ve tried to hint I’m not super enthusiastic about it but have not explicitly stated I don’t want it do it. \n\nShould I suck it up and go with her or tell her I don’t want to do it? Before you roast me I know this is the most first-world problem ever but it’s still a dilemma. \n\nAlso if it makes a difference I’m paying for the study abroad with money I’ve worked for myself. ",

Am I the asshole for telling her to fuck off?\n\nBackstory: Me and this “Friend” who I will not name for her privacy, have been friends for about a year and a half now and its the same with me and my girlfriend, I didn’t expect my friend to act so rash about me dating her, I mean, I knew they didn’t really like each other, but I didn’t know it was gonna be like that. And now that me and my girlfriend are dating, she’s acting like a total asshole, calling her a slut, and a bitch, and pretty much insulting her every chance she gets.\n\nEdit 1: I did not expect this post to gain any attention whatsoever, but consider that it’s got some traction, I feel I should give some more context. Me and the “Friend” that was being so rude to her haven’t been talking lately, especially since I live more towards the northwest right now and it’s been extremely cold so we haven’t been able to see each other as often, but she’s started being a little nicer to her now, so that’s good. I’ve decided that maybe I should stop communicating with her for a while, as things are a bit off right now, and I feel it would be best to only talk to each other when necessary, but next week it’s supposed to be warmer, so we’ll see each other again, I just wanted to give a bit more information about what’s going on since a lot of you are asking.",

Sometime after that, my mom moved out and we started subletting from her.\n\nMy mother has a long history of being emotionally abusive and my relationship with her is extremely strained, but it's a really sweet apartment in a good area and has been rent controlled for fifteen years.\n\nI seriously doubt my mom is going to evict us for practically any reason because that would involve giving up her last source of control over my life and allow me to finally go full No Contact. Which I happily would, and she knows it. \n\nSo I'm not interested in practical advice on that front.\n\nAnyway, my mom's lease says no smoking and no pets, but the real landlords have always been extremely laid back.\n\nWhen my mom and I first moved here, the official superintendents were obvious full-on tweakers who left used needles lying around their porch. The people who replaced them smoked a big hookah indoors.\n\nAs for pets, there has usually been more than one tenant with at least one cat. The last time the actual landlord was here, she was worrying that there weren't enough cats on the property to control the rat problem.\n\nSince then, the true landlord has come down with dementia. I think she technically still owns the place, but some corporate entity is overseeing it. I'm not sure exactly what the deal is. \n\nMy mom says she once went to the proxy-landlord and started tentatively asking probing, \"hypothetical\" questions about subletting, and they were like, \"Stop right there. We don't want to know. We just want rent.\"\n\nMy wife and I both smoke a lot of marijuana, myself for my panic attacks and my wife for her chronic pain. My wife has a fused spine. She is extremely stiff in the morning, and has a lot of trouble getting outside to smoke before she's had her morning smoke. \n\nNonetheless, we avoided smoking in the apartment for the first couple of years we were subletting.\n\nThen, one winter, my wife was sick, and I couldn't get her to drag herself outside, so I put a fan in the window and we smoked in the bedroom, and it was downhill from there. \n\nBut for a whole year, we were able to keep the smell from collecting in the walls by putting the fan in the window whenever we smoked. In fact, we were able to control the smoke to the point where when my mom dropped by, she couldn't tell. There were times when we had ten minutes to air the place out before her arrival, and she still couldn't smell it. \n\nAnd in fifteen years, none of the real landlords or proxies thereof have come barging in on short notice the way my mom does. \n\nMy wife didn't like the fan, especially during the winter, but I would fight with her to use it. \n\nThen, one day, I got sloppy, and I got caught. \n\nMy mom was furious. I explained to her that we had been able to control the smoke for a whole year, and she hadn't noticed. I explained to her that if she'd given me just ten minutes warning, she wouldn't have noticed that day.\n\nI also explained my wife's chronic pain issues, as I had before. \n\nMy mom sneered at me and said \"World's smallest violin.\" \n\nNow for some background. My mom has seldom hesitated to ask for concessions on account of her health problems. When I was an adolescent, she denied me access to public education, completely failed to homeschool me, and screamed at me nonstop for an hour every time I woke her up from a nap. She justifies this in terms of her chronic fatigue syndrome and my supposed autism, the latter of which has been diagnosed only by her. \n\nAnd what she had to say to the 19 titanium screws in my wife's spine is \"World's smallest violin.\"\n\nAt that point I wasn't going to thanklessly fight with my wife on her account. We completely stopped using the fan. \n\nSo now apparently the whole apartment smells like weed to those who aren't scent blind to it. Whenever my mom comes around, she starts going ballistic about it and demanding that we give her a deposit and saying the deposit won't be enough and the landlord is going to sue her when we move out. \n\nMind, we never signed anything when we moved in here, least of all anything relating to a deposit. This is an illegal, under-the-table sublet, as with all three units in this building.\n\nI also have my doubts about my mom's lawsuit fears. No one has ever had a problem finding smoker tenants for this place, so I doubt they'd bother suing anyone over having to do that. When we leave, I reckon they'll still get more money because the rent control will reset, but if they wanted to bother evicting us, they'd have cause regardless because of the sublet.\n\nAnd because of the cat, but we won the fight over the cat with my mom years ago. \n\nAITA? \n\n",

      "description": "So my fiance and I are getting married in December. I absolutely *hate* Facebook, but I brought it back to look for wedding vendors, etc. Everything major has already been booked (DJ, wedding and reception venue, photographer, hair and makeup, etc). My mom is paying for everything minus the rehearsal dinner, which is fine. My mom asked me to look into videographers, so I did. (My fiance and I don't really care about having one, but I decided to look into it anyway, for my mom's sake.)\n\nA family friend of my fiance's suggested her nephew, but he is waaaayyyy too expensive. She posted his page on my personal FB. So I politely told her that he is out of our budget...NBD. SO her some random lady (complete stranger) chimes in on the post and says \"Quality is the most important. Flowers die, cake is eaten, your photos live forever to tell your story and family.\" Okay....and? I don't know you, why are you pushing this on me? Come to find out, it's the videographer's mom. \n\nI commented back, \"He is still out of our budget. The most important thing is that it is OUR day. We will be together, as one. I don't need a random stranger telling me how to run OUR wedding. But thanks.\"\n\nI took it as \"So if you choose someone else, your wedding will be shit. Who gives a fuck about flowers, cake, etc.\"\n\nI am BEYOND tired of people I don't know (strangers, not family or close friends) putting their two cents in for our wedding. AITA for what I said? ",

      "description": "Background: this is someone who I have known for a couple of years. Stopped hanging out with him(30M now) 5 years ago when he made incredibly forward actions, comments and physical contact towards me(25M) after I had explained to him I was for starters not gay, secondly in a relationship with one of his friends for a couple of months.\n\nSo flash forward a couple years and we start drinking in the same pub and chatting a bit, we didn't leave it on too sour a note and always said hi when we saw each other so it wasn't the end of the friendship. \n\nWe start hanging out, catching up and seeing each other on a regular basis. During a chat we were having over coffee one day he asked about my sexuality as I'm recently single after a long relationship. He asks me if I would ever experiment. To which I responded; no. I then gently reminded him that we are friends and I'm afraid I'm not interested.\n\nFlash forward a couple weeks, out of nowhere he asks if I'd like to go on holiday on short notice as someone dropped out(group of 6 down to 5).\n\nI accepted, we went on holiday, it was fantastic fun. Untill he purchased a gift I expressly told him would make me feel uncomfortable.\nHe tried lying saying he didn't purchase the candy-thong after I went outside for a smoke. I could see it in his jacket.\n\nLater that night he hands me the gift I asked him not to buy and I sat down and asked if we could have a chat. I outlined again that I am not interested. I love you as a friend, that is all. \n\nFriendship continues, I'm planning another holiday with some other friends and offered him to come along with my friends he hangs out with too.\n\nAll good, on a night out and he made the same in appropriate comments and shouted at me to \"come out already\". I didn't know how to repsond. I took a day, he texted me asking to hangout for a coffee. I responded by saying I didn't want to hangout today, could we postpone untill I am ready to talk about your comments the other night.\n\nHe asked what comments, I explained, he had the same response as previously which was \"it was only a bit of fun\".\n\nI then reminded him of me bringing up how this made me feel previously and that I asked him not to behave that way toward me.\n\nHis response was we shouldn't be friends and all of the presents were just him showing me he loved me like a little brother.\n\nAITA to ask him not to come on holidays after we booked our flights? We each paid separately, but I do not want to go on holiday(to my family's holiday home) with someone who makes me feel that uncomfortable? ",

I'll identify as a refugee.\n\nMe: You also have to apply to gender studies or something like that, cause who the fuck applies to a major in gender studies?\n\nMax: Lol, gender studies kids are the type of kids that can't find a job after graduating and become socialists \n\nEverybody was laughing, except for one kid, who said we were being transphobic, anti-minority, and mocking liberal arts major. I pointed out we weren't mocking trans people or minorities, we were mocking colleges for- in a lot of cases- choosing students just because they're a minority/trans/had a bad life etc. And as for liberal arts, 1) economics, which I want to study, is a liberal arts major and 2) it's not untrue that gender studies majors don't have that many job offers compared to other majors.\n\nSo, aita?

She was gone one year on my birthday to Aruba because it was the only time we could go, and it was the last vacation my grandfather would ever be able to go on due to dementia, she told me we could go somewhere within a car drive someday, but instead never did. Her justification was that I would have fun. \n\nSo, next year I am turning 18. Me and my friends are planning on going during April, as we cannot go in February as I’ll still be 17. I have told her I am not willing to take the time, and will really have to think about the money to go to Las Vegas at 18. She expects me to not go on a vacation with friends I’ve been planning longer, to go to Vegas. At 18. She expects each of my siblings to pay a portion along with me(which is fine at face value) but they’ll all be 21. Here’s the kicker, I don’t have any say where we are going.

      "description": "I had a fairly good friend who I kept in touch with long distance, as I am working in the United States and she is in East Asia. Last time we got together was before I started my job. I flew over from the US and I brought some souvenirs and a card. We hung out normally and just talked about normal topics friends talk about, like future plans and work life etc etc.\n\nAfter I came back to the United States, work kept me extremely busy. During this time I also got a girlfriend which she knows about, so this results in even less communication between us, as most of my time is spent with my SO.\n\nNow I still do my best to keep in touch with this friend. Up until today, I tried my best to send a quick message every 2 weeks or so asking how the friend was doing. But I noticed that conversations became harder to maintain, and that a lot of the time my messages were one word replies or just none at all. Furthermore, the times that she actually messaged me were mostly soliciting my help with translation or just buying stuff from the United States. I decided that this was something that was just going to make me more tired, and I stopped messaging her but did not delete her from my friend's list. \n\nThen yesterday she messages me out of the blue, saying that she is kind of upset that we don't talk anymore, and that she is not that happy that we are drifting apart. I wasn't really sure how to respond to this, and since I was at work I just left it at that and forgot to reply. Upon arriving home, I clicked into her profile and discovered that I couldn't see any of her posts anymore. I assumed that she deleted/blacklisted me, so I did the same and removed her from my friend's list and I thought that was that. \n\nThis morning she sends me an angry message saying how I was a shitty friend, and how she was an idiot for deciding to become friends with me. She thought she was used, and how I don't care for others and that I should reflect on my definition of being a friend. I didn't reply, but would like to know if I'm in the wrong for doing what I did. ",

      "description": "Ok, so forgive me I'm typing this in class on my phone, so there will probably be a few errors. So this pretty much started a few months back when I use to vape religiously. I had gotten into it from people at my work and I had recently turned 18 as well. So one day I had gone to the shop to buy another vape, because my other one was acting up. When I got home I remembered that one of my friends wanted to try it as well. Without hesitation (forgive me I should have known better), I gave my old one to him. \n\nFast forward a while, and now all he talks about is vaping. It seems to be the main thing. Like\n \"Hey man, have you tried this flavor?\"\n \"Hey man, can you buy me more stuff?\"\n \"Oh, I really wish I could chief(smoke) right now.\"\nSo, after a few failed attempts to quit I finally had manage to stop vaping. I need to this time, because I was going to start running track and those two things just don't mix. Meanwhile, my friend is getting worse. Eventually, his vape breaks and he begs me to buy him another one. He would only talk about how he needed it so badly and about how he was going crazy without it. I refuse, because I wanted him to stop, but be told me that he will just get one of his friends from work to buy him one. Later, he tells me that they bought him one and he tells me about how much he loves it. I will also admit I stole a hit off of it, because of the really bad urges. My friend and I (mostly my friend) do make jokes about him to his face, but am I the asshole? Like now he primarily gets the stuff from his other friends at work, but I got him started. ",

      "description": "TL;DR: Listed below husband’s health, eating habits, comments from friends, family history, sex life, etc. Husband is always degrading himself. He knows he’s obese, he’s sensitive, but won’t step up. I want to get him a surprise gym membership for his birthday. I don’t know how he’ll react.\n\nI love my husband. We’ve been together 10 years, HS-sweethearts. I’m sexually attracted to him, although my sex drive naturally is extremely low. Alas, story time:\n\nMy husband has never been the skinniest guy. He was pretty broad in high school. But not fat either. Maybe a small bit of chub. I’d say he was built athletically for the most part. His arms and legs were muscular. His legs still are and when he flexes they are rock solid. His father was a big man. Tall, huge hands, big neck, and overweight. I believe the largest shirt my father-in-law owned was a 5X. His weight has fluctuated the past two years. And he even donated some clothes when he lost over 100 lbs. before gaining a lot of it back. My husband’s mother, who is shorter, has also went from small to big and back to small in the past 6-7 years.\nI could be wrong, but I don’t always believe weight is a genetics thing (educate me if I’m wrong).\n\nIt’s 2019, and over the last 3 years my husband does not like me knowing his weight. He is between a 3XL and a 4XL in shirts. Most of his weight is in his gut. I don’t pry into his weight and I’ll even leave the bathroom when he tries out the scale.. but he didn’t shoo me away when we went to the doctors together a few months ago and he had to step on a scale for a check up. He was around 330 lbs.\n\nNow, I’ve been very sensitive around my husband when his weight is mentioned. Whether he’s putting himself down, family points it out, my Dad says I’m going to be a widow before we grow old, my friends ask me how do I even have sex (I’m 5’3” weight also fluctuates between 120-155 lbs over the years but many still call me petite for being a little soft meatball at 155), his friends encourage the weight gain while finishing a package of mega-stuffed Oreos together, or again; my husband calls himself a fat POS. I’m sensitive. But I don’t lie to him. Subtle.\n\nMy husband has injured his back 2-3x from falling on ice and had to go to chiropractors, get MRI’s done, stay bed rested on a new firm mattress, pain killers, etc. He’s had to get a new computer chair for work, owns two canes, and a walker (when I bought it, someone saw me carrying it up an elevator to our apartment and thought I was an at-home caregiver to a senior citizen). He’s tried running years ago and his shins would cause him pain so he gave that up. He’s been having stomach problems and throwing up lately. Sleep apnea and snoring so much it’s kept a whole house of 5 people up all night. Kidney stones.. and only Lord knows whatever happens in the bathroom. —basically, the only form of exercise I’ve witnessed him loving doing lately is disc golf, but I don’t even think that’s enough. We last hiked together nearly a year ago up a popular hill side that he couldn’t even finish and started complaining it was too steep, as all our other once-a-year hikes are too.\n\nMy husband grew up a picky eater. Loves fatty foods, junk food, energy drinks and soda, and mostly dining out (especially at taco shops) thanks to his parents not cooking much in his childhood nor eating wholesome meals together at the family table. I grew up with high protein, low fat, low calorie meals all homemade. I didn’t even know what Panda Express was for 18 years. If we ate out, it was once a year and a bean burrito from Taco Bell. At home, I try to cook and eat leftovers 5-6 days out of the week but sometimes I even fail at that or have to limit certain ingredients and vegetables that my husband doesn’t like. It’s been better lately and I’ve finally got him to eat onions which is good for the heart. But still..\n\nLastly, my husband knows he’s obese. His doctor has told him to lose weight a few times. He knows his body will feel better once he drops the weight. My husband is never a person to complain if you have a solution to fix your problems. And he’ll call anyone out on it too. A no BS guy. But unfortunately this is his one downfall for and he does not try to make the change despite knowing how bad it is. I can’t baby him about it. When he last hurt his back and couldn’t move for 4 days, I looked him dead in the eyes and said enough is enough. He sulked and said I’m calling him fat. I sharply responded I said no such thing, all I’m saying, this lifestyle is unhealthy and “you’re sick” and we need to do better. I haven’t had this talk with him again, it’s been months, and nothing has changed.\n\nSo Reddit. I need to know. AITA if I get my husband a gym membership to the YMCA for his birthday? For starters. He’s said it out loud before that even doing some cardio in the pool might do him good.",

      "description": "This one isn't too deep but I keep thinking about whether or not I was in the wrong here. \n\nFor some background, I'm a 23 year old male. I was riding the train back from work when a middle aged woman and her teenaged son sat next to me. \n\nI noticed that the woman had a family pass, which is good for up to 4 people (2 adults and 2 children). \n\nI asked her in a somewhat joking manner (kind of with a cheeky smile as I spoke) if I could say I was with them so I could ride the train without having to use one of my tickets. \n\nShe said \"absolutely not\" with a bit of aggression and gave me a nasty look. I was a bit surprised by her reaction so I kinda laughed and said \"oh well, it was worth a shot\" and just listened to music for the rest of the train ride. We did not interact for the rest of the ride. \n\nSo I've been wondering, AITA? If the situation was reversed I would have let someone hop onto my family ticket without question; the conductors just go by quickly and check so it's not like anyone would have got in trouble. ",

      "description": "I shortened this story to keep it in the 3000 character limit.\n\nFor some backstory, I had known her for about 4 years. We knew each other in High School and had the same clubs and friend pool but weren't that close.\n\n\nI ended up telling her during a \"how are you?\" text chat she initiated that she was hot and she was impressed with my confidence and over the next month or two we progressively got more involved as horny teenagers. Sexting, nudes, the whole shebang. I found out that she was into some kinky things, at least to me at the time. She liked blindfolds, headphones, whips, chokers, being thrown around and smacked on the ass. All of that was new to me and I didn't like the idea of hitting her, but that was her thing and I loved to please. I explained that to her and she liked it. \n\n\nWe ended up agreeing that we would meet up at a hotel when she was in my area and fuck to put it bluntly. The day came around and we actually made somewhat of a date around it. We went to a sex shop and I bought a bunch of toys that she was into and grabbed some food. I bought cuffs, blindfolds, nipple clamps, all that stuff. She asked me when we were walking into the hotel if I had any STDs and I told her no, I happened to have recently been checked for several as part of a routine health check and everything was negative. I actually assumed that she didn't have any before she asked and she verified that she didn't have any. I had sex with a few girls before her, most of which were virgins and none of them were the type that you would even remotely expect to have an STD. We got to the room and stripped, we were both impressed with what we saw and ended up kissing, touching etc. We took a shower together and she got on the bed with her cuffs, blindfold, etc. I had a number of condoms on the bed next to us and started doing all kinds of foreplay until she was ready so I stuck my dick in for a few pumps (maybe 10 seconds) to lube it up right and then opened a condom to put on. She heard me tear it open and said the safe word, took off her mask and by the time she looked down the condom was already on. She asked if I had just put it on and I told her yes, and she was pissed that I would do anything before putting on the condom. \n\n\nI asked her if she was okay and I was kind of shocked because I didn't expect that I was doing anything wrong. She told me that she was pissed about the condom and was no longer in the mood. I offered if she wanted to stay and watch tv and eat pizza without sex and she wasn't interested so said she was leaving. She offered to pay me for the hotel and I told her no and that she had the right to leave whenever she wanted. I spent the night feeling horrible because I didn't intend to emotionally hurt her like that yet I can't blame anyone but myself. She never told me that she didn't want me doing anything without a condom and I assumed it wouldn't be a problem since it was only a few seconds and she was also on birth control anyway.\n\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Sorry if i come off as a choosing beggar, but there is a bit of a story behind it. Also sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.\n\nThis is kind of an extra long one so buckle up. (I'm sorry for wasting your time in advance).\n\nAt the beginning of the year I (m20)  didn't have a drivers license or a car. My Gf (19) wanted me to get both, as she didn't want to come over (20 Minute drive) everytime we met. (Public transport wasn't really an option for short visits as I come home late after work and it wouldn't be worth the hustle for just an hour or two). So i bought a car and made my drivers license. So far so good.\n\nI've spent pretty much all my savings on my license and a car (family couldn't help because my parents aren't really financially stable). Later that year, my car had a serious malfunction and i had to pay 3.000€ to fix it (I didn't have the money for another used car either and at least i knew what was wrong with that one was my approach to the situation.aybe it was stupid, but that's not the point of this whole story).\n\n I didn't have the money, so my GF generously lent it to me. Since then I've been doing everything i could to pay her back as much as i could. E.g. I'm eating only the cheapest stuff i can find for dinner if I can't avoid eating dinner all together so I can buy groceries on the weekends we spend together. Btw. I am totally fine with this and still seriously grateful, that she helped me out. Problem is, that she hates spending money, even on small things. So whenever she wanted something but didn't want to spend money i would buy it for her. (Usually small things like ice cream, but 3€ for ice cream is pretty expensive if you have only 20€ left for the last two weeks of the month).\nBut again i was fine with it as i seriously love her and spending my last money on seeing her happy made me happy.\n\nToday she came to me with great news. She has won a 100.000€ raffle and i was so happy for her. When i asked her if she could relieve me of my debt or at least a part of it she instantly snapped into something i have never seen before from her.\nShe first started laughing at me and said that i must be joking. Then said, that she loves me and all but money is where she draws the line and that 3.000€ is a lot of money. She also added that she is sure that i would do this for her anytime, but she just isn't somebody like me.\n\nThis kind of broke my heart, i mean sure 3.000€ is a lot of money and i would've understood it if she politely said no, but her response just felt so disrespectful. Especially the \"I'm just not somebody like you\" part.\nI didn't reply anything at first as I was kind of shocked of the way she replied.\n\nI didn't know why but i started to do some math and realised what she just really said to me. Maybe my approach to this situation is too logical, idk. Even if she would let me off the hook entirely, that would be about 3% of what she just won, but on a monthly basis i would commit more percent of my entire savings just to make her happy without even thinking about it. \n\nI didn't really want to put a number on love but i thought that she maybe just wasn't seeing my struggle, so i tried to defend myself for asking her what seemed to her as a ridiculous request. I never talked to her about the things I do to be able to afford paying her back and living a normal life when she's around. I didn't mean to offend her or make her feel guilty I just tried to rationalize why I asked.\n\nAs i told her what i was doing for her and that i felt deeply disrespected by the way she answered she just started calling me an a***ole and told me to f*** off\nhaven't heard from her since.\n\nWas me even asking too much?\nWas trying to rationalize my request too much?\nI seriously don't know, \nI see why somebody could feel like I was trying to make it seem that I do everything for our relationship and she did nothing, i never said that and I didn't want to imply it in any way. But the way she responded to me both times just felt like i suddenly became worthless to her.\n\nHow do you think I should handle the situation? \nShe seems to be upset with me and i really didn't want to upset her. I don't really want to do a big apology as I still feel that she treated me terribly, but I can't live with her being angry, I still love her after all.",

      "description": "My husband's family has a standing yearly tradition of a family camping trip. It's held on the same weekend every year, and MIL expects all of her kids to come (it's basically 2nd Christmas at this point). It has only changed weekends a couple of times in the last 2 decades, causing chaos, sooo they don't change it idly. Also of important note, MIL organises and purchases everything, then divides the cost by person and each family reimburses her for their portion. No one has a problem doing this, including us. \n\nI love this trip. I look forward to it every year, because it's often the only vacation hubby and I get. This year however, the camping trip weekend falls 6wks after my due date. \n\nI made an idle comment to MIL a couple weeks before Christmas about us planning on coming, and massively looking forward to it, while simultaneously hoping that I'll feel up to us coming...basically a hope and plan for the best but mentally prepare for the worst type conversation.\n\nShe became visibly irate, and asked WHY I thought we might not come.\n\n....b-because I will have very recently pushed a squashed watermelon out of my baby purse (or if I'm unlucky had my abdomen carved open, rifled through, then slapped back together like a Thanksgiving turkey) and I physically might be in extreme discomfort or pain, rendering the idea of being in an unpredictable, \"rustic\" environment with shared (and probably less-than-sanitary) facilities entirely unappealing?\n\nShe made a face and didn't say anything else about it, but a couple weeks later at Christmas, hubby and I's Christmas gift was a homemade gift certificate explaining that our family's camping expenses were prepaid in full. \n\nI mentioned to hubby that I was SUPER APPRECIATIVE of this gesture, but that I simultaneously feel that she's manipulating me into a position of not being able to say \"no\" to coming on the camping trip, which I dislike. He was irritated with me for seeing ulterior motives in his mom's generosity.\n\nTL;DR - I tell MIL we *might* not be coming on a traditional yearly camping trip due to my having given birth just weeks prior, she responds by paying for our portion of expenses...I feel she's manipulating me/us into coming, hubby feels I'm being ungrateful and petty. AITA?",

      "description": "This might be a little long.. sorry guys! \n\nYesterday i took my boyfriend to class with me and we were going to go to a Museum after for an assignment i had to do. \n\nI commute a little over an hour to school- its a train, a bus, and a walk away. Everything was fine until we got off the train and onto the bus. \n\nWe were making small talk and i mentioned in passing that i might transfer into bioinformatics (im a bio major), and he kinda lost it. \n This is kinda how he conversation went; \n\nMe: “yeah i was thinking about doing bioinformatics! [my school was making it a seperate major next year]” \n\nHim: “Thats not a great idea. Youre terrible at math.”\n\nMe: ???? Terrible at math? Do you mean that because i ALMOST got a B in precalc junior year of highschool?\n\nHim: Yes, i mean come on. You were never EVEN in the middle of the pack [in relevance to people taking math classes] \n\nMe: ..do you know how incredibly insulting that is? I got an A at the end of the semester; the final just messed me up but i still got it? \n\nHim: it would be an UNNECESSARY stress on you \n\nMe: literally every stem major is under unnecessary stress. If i didnt want to be under stress then i wouldnt GO TO COLLEGE. \n\nPeople were staring because he insulted my intelligence so LOUDLY on this PACKED bus. I was so insulted but he just shook it off as if that wasnt the most degrading thing ever. I just walked to class and sat down. I didnt say a word to him after i told him he was being insensitive, i just told him we were no longer going to the museum. \n\nThen after class he wanted to go eat something and i brought it up again \n\nMe “If you think im not smart enough to be in engineering then we’re done here. I dont want to be with someone who blatantly thinks hes smarter than me because he CAN “handle” engineering” \n\nWe just sat in silence. \n\nHe walked off for a bit, but i waited for him because he doesnt know his way around school nor how to get on the right bus or the right train. \n\nAnd then he kept talking. \n\nWe were at the bus stop and he opened his mouth AGAIN \n\nHim: you were just never exceptionally good at math. You havent even taken calc yet! \n\nMe: you shouldnt me talking because youre NOT even in college yet \n\nHim: i dont think you could handle a college level math class. What? Do you want me to lie? Midterms are hard \n\nMe: (im tearing up at this point because when i get super mad i cry and he was being extremely rude)\nAnd what MIDTERMS have YOU taken? Youve literally never stepped inside your own college MATH class. Who are you to tell me what i CAN and CANT do?! You would never say anything like this to [ insert girl friends we have that are in engineering] \n\nHim: yeah well thats because they were in my calc bc class and theyre actually smart too \n\nMe: (i couldnt stop tearing up anymore) \nSo just because you took calc bc in highschool means that youre smarter than me and that I WONT be able to handle a bioinformatics major. Youre so RIGHT! (/s) Seriously, stop talking. \n\nWe get on the bus and the idiot KEEPS TALKING. \n\nI ignore it \n\nWe get to the train station and i walk off to go charge my phone and he follows me \n\nHim: Listen, you dont even LIKE math. And you were never that great in Ap stats or physics \n\nMe: you mean MY FAVORITE CLASSES? the classes i got As in consistently? The easiest AP classes ive ever been in? Who are you to tell me what i LIKE and DONT LIKE?? If i didnt like physics why would i take BOTH ap physics 1 and 2 ? Stop talking \n\nHe kept trying to hammer in his point and kept trying to tell me why i wouldnt be capable in engineering and that is super offensive because im not BAD AT MATH. Sure, hes good at math. But that doesnt mean i couldnt handle it. \n\nI was literally crying all day and he just kept talking. He says that im twisting what he said, that he didnt mean to say it the way he did, that he was just being honest, and that i heard him wrong. \n\nThose are all of his excuses and they ALL contradict each other. He didnt stop when he saw me crying at the bus stop. On the bus. At the train station. Nor on the train. He apologized Twice. Once at the very end and once when j dropped him off. They were not sincere because later he kept texting me that he was just “trying to explain” when i literally NEVER ASKED FOR HIS OPINION IN THE FIRST PLACE. \n\nIm still mad. \n\nReddit, what do you think?

      "description": "Obligatory throwaway. \n\nSo I (22f) have been with SO (m22) for 4 years, we've been living together for almost 7 months. \n\nSo we'd just been lazing about and he asks if I want to go to the grocery with him before he has to head to a meeting. I didnt need anything from the store, but I was bored, so I agreed. \n\nBacktracking a bit, a few hours earlier one of our dogs vomited on a blanket while on the couch with SO. I cleaned up and put the blanket in the wash. Fast forwarding to when he asks me to go to the grocery, I say yes, but remind him that he agreed to check on the laundry. \n\nHe gets dressed and asks again if I'm going with him. I ask him \"arent you going to check on the wash?\" And his response was \"Are you going with me or not, I'd appreciate it if youd turn down the attitude FFS\". \n\nTaken aback, I didnt respond. He comes into the room and starts saying how I didnt need to curse at him, but I didnt. He was in the other room so i raised my voice so he could hear me, but i didnt curse. When I tell him I didnt he proceeds to do the whole \"uh huh sure you didnt, you're just saying that\" routine, and how it's \"my reality\" that I didnt curse at him but in his reality I did. Which means he gets to be upset. \n\nNow, at this point i was over the whole back and forth, who said what, deal, and told him I wasnt going to the store. I didnt think either of our attitudes would improve if I forced myself to go with him, so he should go alone. He gets even more upset that I wont go with him and says there's a double standard when I'm allowed to curse and be upset with him but he cant be rude to me. I do have a tendency to be emotional and get angry easily, so I figured he may be right and didnt push the issue. If he wants to be upset, I guess that's fine. \n\nHe put one of our dogs (technically his) in a kennel and then left to get the laundry. When I asked why he did that, he said it was to stimulate my going to the store with him...weird but it's your dog so ok. He then asked for an explanation for how I thought I'd answered him earlier (if id cursed) and I explained it to him, but he went back to the \"my reality vs yours\" idea, which led to him saying that he feels like he cant be \"his own person\" half the time. So I told him I'll let him be upset if that's what he wanted (at this point I'm just confused). \n\nAnd I dont think he went to the store, bc I just heard a loud sigh from the living room. \n\nTL;DR So am I the asshole for not going to the store because I overreacted at a miscommunication?

I was there with my boyfriend, and Michelle was there with her husband. The house has 2 double bedrooms.\n\nBefore the first day, Michelle keeps telling me how someone will have to stay in the living room at some point, since their friends would be coming. It seems the friends invited themselves when they heard michelle would be going to the house.\n\nDuring the stay, Michelle keeps telling me someone will have to stay in the living room. I eventually get the hint, and tell her I don't mind staying, in a tentative manner. I then asked my boyfriend at the time (who was ill) if he would stay in the living room. He said hell to the no. He said he needed a private room (because of a chest infection) and he wanted me with him, since he's sick. I told Michelle, and she said:\n\n\"I don't know what to do then....\" over and over.\n\nWith me in the room, her husband asked her why she couldn't have her other friends stay in the living room. Michelle said \"It's not my hospitality to have guests over and then have them stay in the living room.\" Her husband also said he wouldn't stay in the living room.\n\nI took it on the chin, and went back to my boyfriend, and urged him to give the living room a shot, since Michelle was clearly not going to entertain the idea of having her other friends stay in the living room. I probably should have put my foot down here and said no to Michelle, but I honestly just didn't want a confrontation, and I didn't want Michelle to be sad...even though I was. \n\nThe living room was awful. I couldn't sleep because of the echo from the pipes. My BF became worse, and he was bed bound for days. \n\nDays later, we went home. Michelle has since apologized, not for specifically being inconsiderate or prioritizing her friend's comfort over ours, but more generally, saying \"I'm sorry it wasn't great.\"\n\nIt has been 6 months, and just last week, she made a joke about our holiday together, saying \"Well at least you won't have to sleep on the sofa again, right? Hahahaha.\"\n\nThe thing is, my BF is still super pissed about the situation, and wanted to cut all contact with Michelle. I said to give her a chance.\n\nMy BF was upset about the joke. \n\nWIBTA to bring up the holiday in a talk with Michelle, and tell her all the things she did wrong, and tell her not to joke about it again?

      "description": "Earlier this morning I was leaving to go to work. It is important to note that I live in a busy area of the city where parking is scarce and the apartments around here supply no lots, it is all street parking. I leave my apartment and go into my car to turn it on and let it warm up for a few minutes before heading to work as it’s extremely cold out. I notice a car behind me stopped and blocking the one way traffic waiting for me to leave so she can pull in. I wave and gesture for her that I am not leaving. She remains still and is now holding up ~10 car as it is an extremely busy one way in front of a major intersection and many people are honking. She then pulls up right next to me and parks and asks if she can have my spot, I let her know that I can not as I need to let my car warm up before I head to work and it will be a few minutes. She then asks if I will wait for her and save it for her until she circles back around. I let her know that I can’t do that as I have to get to work as I leave myself no extra time to make it on time. She then says I can leave the spot now then, to which I again tell her I will not as my car is still warming up. She keeps persisting and is holding up nearly two blocks of traffic. I then give in and tell her I will try because I just want her to leave at this point and for everyone else to be able to move and not be held up in jam. I wait for a little while but then had to leave to get to work on time. As expected, as soon as I leave I see the person behind me immediately park into my old spot. I then see her behind that car.

      "description": "I came home from work and my dogs were running around the yard. He was at my house, he let himself in because we don't lock the door (we live in the middle of nowhere), he went into my bedroom and let my dogs out of their crates and into the yard. I live on a road and the dogs have to be watched closely if they aren't on leash. I do not trust this person to do this.\n\nWe went on vacation and he was given a key to check on the house in case of extreme weather or flooding. When we got back all the weed was gone and there was evidence that he and his family had stayed there while we were gone. They don't have the greatest living situation so I can see why they would want to say a while. However their living situation is not my fault. I lost my shit and while my boyfriend was upset, he thought I was overreacting.\n\nI keep a pencil from my Mom's exchange student trip in the 60s in my art supplies. They are currently in open boxes in the living room. My Mom died when I was a kid and I just keep it there to remind me of her. Boyfriend and his friend were working on a construction project and I'm talking to them then I notice that the pencil is being used. He went into my boxes and got this pencil. It's not about the pencil. It's about my space being invaded. \n\nI've always lived alone and not had to worry about this.  Boyfriend thinks it's no big deal but I feel like nothing is sacred in my house and I wonder what else has been taken/done. \nI don't do well with expressing anger and just left the house without talking to anyone. My boyfriend has asked me to talk to the friend about it but I'm afraid I'm going to come off as a total asshole.\n\nDo I deserve to be SO ANGRY? Or should I lighten up?",

      "description": "Im 26, shes 25. \n\nWednesday night I got upset with one of my friends for being increasingly distant towards me the past few weeks. I feel really close to this person and probably the only person i feel comfortable opening up to. Lately I noticed im the one starting 90% of our conversations, and that they are very short lived. Every time another friend was available she would be talking to them instead, leaving me mid conversation, or just straight up not responding at all. \n\nWendsday I was in a bad state emotionally and wanted to confide and talk about it, but she was more preoccupied talking to other people, whilst I was having a very hard time, verge of crying over a personal problem.\n\nAfter telling her all this and getting little response, I told her how I felt like she was being distant, and dismissive. \n\nShe got defensive and offended saying things like \"You're basically saying im a shitty friend\" and that she doesn't owe it to me. Not that I expect to get things in return but I just feel like somebody who cares and calls me their best friend would give me a little more than pretty much dismissing me. She ended the conversation by going to bed mid conversation, and we haven't talked since.\n\nI dont know if i should reach our or let her. I feel like I may have lost a friend but I dont know if thats also for the best. I dont know how to feel about this. \n",

This dude instantly swings at me and i try to dodge but i catches me in the wrist, so naturally i swing back and connect with his jaw and he's stunned and at that point i had done a take down and we were on the ground wrestling and I finally got him in a triangle choke and I choked until he passed out and i got up and instantly headed for the front office and They sent me home and would give me a punishment as they saw fit.

      "description": "So there is an older woman (60+) in our building with a mental disability. If she knows your name, every time, she will stop you and engage you in conversation. Problem is, I have seen her conversing with people but she doesn't really register how to detect when people are busy/in a hurry or want privacy. \n\nI have also seen her come to the pool and notice someone she knows. This is followed by her sitting down next to them and talking to them the whole time they are there. She will literally stay there with them until the point the person gets up to leave. I have seen this happen to multiple people at the pool too, whether they are by themselves quietly reading or, like I saw one time, writing thank you cards for their wedding gifts. \n\nAnytime I am around her or end up in the elevator, I am cordial and say good morning if she says something but I do my best to come across as silent and occupied. \n\nThe reason for this post was recently I went to the grocery store where she works as a bagger. I forgot she worked there so, without checking, I entered the line a put a couple items on the belt. When I realized she was the bagger I pretended I forgot something, looked at the person behind me awkwardly and said, \"Ah, I forgot something on my list, you can go ahead of me.\" I promtply then threw all my shit back in my basket and walked to bakery and bought a muffin before finding a register that ensured I would not have to encounter her during my purchase or enroute to the exit. \n\nI feel kind of terrible about it all but I know if I go past \"polite building cohabitation acknowledgement\" then she will incessantly be stopping me and disturbing the little peace I get at the pool. \n\nAlso, she hangs out in the lobby *a lot.* I see her no less than 5 times a week. \n\nTL;DR An old lady with a mental disability is always in our lobby (or at the pool) and stops people to talk if she knows their name. I do everything I can to avoid her knowing my name so I don't have to frequently interact or talk with her so I can keep my peace when I leave/enter my building or when I am reading/relaxing poolside. \n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "So I want to preface this first by saying that around 2.5 weeks ago, I was in a no-fault accident where a truck rear ended me at 55+ mph and sandwiched me into another car in front of me. My car was a total loss, and I’ve been extremely stressed out about getting a new one, to the point of crying, because I was halfway done paying off my car, and I loved it. \n\nI’ve been searching for a car since then, and my dad and I found this car that was exactly like mine, but nicer and newer (it was two ‘trim levels’ above mine). Same color on the outside and same model, but the color scheme on the inside was different. I’m going to use made up numbers for the cost, but let’s say this car with a trim level at a 3 would cost 12,500, but the trim level at a 1 would be 10,925. \n\nThey advertised it as a three, everywhere, on their website, the car market website, and on the paper attached to the car. \n\nThey of course hadn’t added tags titles taxes and their fees, but I wanted that car, and we agreed to drive it off the lot AT 12,500, everything included. I thought I got an awesome deal, and planned to finance it at my bank, because I would just be paying what the car was valued at.\n\nWe get to our bank, I’m excited. The bank uses a website to pull up the value of the car, and the bank teller says sorry, we can’t finance this car because we only finance up to the car’s value. I figured it MIGHT be the difference of like 100$ which I’m fine with; but she prints out the paper and it’s a differential of 1500$. \n\nShe used the VIN number on their car market website (not KBB, which is what I used, and doesn’t allow you to put the VIN in), and it shows the car I was buying was a Trim level 1. \n\nSo of course I’m extremely upset. I look at all the paperwork we signed, it doesn’t have Trim Level anywhere, but I do have screenshots of the web page, showing it’s a trim level four. We call the dealership and they said sorry, they would never do that on purpose, blah blah blah, BUT, they did bring the price of the car down to 11,500, which is ‘all they can do’ because they ‘don’t have much room left to move on the car’. \n\nI really want this car, so I’m going to buy it and pay the difference, but I feel like this was done on purpose and I feel like people should know what happened so they aren’t caught in the same sort of scam. WIBTA to go on Social Media and blast them after I’ve bought the car? Part of me feels like I would be vindicated I’m doing so, the other part of me feels like it would be shady of me. ",

      "title": "AITA for being mad at my friends for adding a guy that makes me feel uncomfortable to our group chat?",
      "description": "A bit of backstory, about two years ago a guy I barely knew developed a crush on me. He is a shy person, so instead of trying to start casual conversations, he took pictures of me and stared from afar. After a while of doing this, he tried to approach me, but was incredibly akward about it and I started to feel uncomfortable around him. He wrote a poem to me and I told him I was not interested. He spent the next year asking for advice on how to make me fall for him and made many of the relationships I had with the people whom he asked pretty akward as well. Last semester, he started acting passive-agressively and treating me pretty badly, saying he didn't believe in love anymore because his heart had been broken (obviously alluding to me rejecting him). Around that time, one of my friends befriended him and after her, all of them became friends with him. These friends all knew about my story with him and how uncomfortable I felt around him. Despite this, a few days ago the admin of our group chat added him. When I saw a number I didn't recognize, I asked who it was and they avoided telling me until I was persistent about it. \nThis group chat was something really important to me, as it is one of the only places where I feel I can express myself without fear. I am not trying to forbid them from being his friends or anything, but I feel very betrayed as they knew how I feel about him. \nI have been debating on whether I should tell them or not, but tbh I feel like we have been becoming more and more distant recently. I don't feel nearly as much confidence in them anymore. Maybe I should just let it go and find myself some better friends lol.\nAnyway, do I have no reason at all to be mad?",

      "description": "My fiancé and I have been engaged for over a year.   It’s been over a year because we’re not making enough to really be able to save up that much for a wedding.  Right now we have enough saved for just basic, barebones ceremonies.    I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  \n\nThere’s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That’s wedding of our dreams kind of money. \n\nI brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn’t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It’s ridiculous to me.  It’s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!\n\nI’m his fiancé, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he’s not hearing me out at all.  He just gets mad every time I bring it up.  It’s so frustrating.  I feel like the answer to our prayers is just sitting in garage collecting dust.  ",

      "description": "6 months ago my girlfriend (19F) and I (21M) moved out of our parent's houses and into an apartment together. My dog Max is very chill. He doesn't like children or other dogs, but tolerates them unless they get in his face. Max had never bit a person before her though. She and my dog have never gotten along for whatever reason. She has taken snapchat videos of him sitting in his crate growling at her, and has taken multiple pictures of the bite marks he has left on her.\n\n\nWe tried many behavioral changes, and some days were better than others. Two weeks ago after an incident we decided to take Max to the vet where he was checked out, given blood work, and ultimately put on a low dosage of Prozac. Things were going very well. For example Thursday my girlfriend stayed home while I was at work and give Max a bath and they had a great time cuddling and watching Netflix. However on Friday I get a call 2 hours into my shift that Max had bit her and was acting very aggressively. My girlfriend called my parents and had them pick him up and keep him.\n\n\nMy parents love Max so I know he's well taken care of and I can visit whenever I want. But Max has been my dog for 9 years. He has been with me through so much, I have a hard time not getting a lump in my throat thinking about him missing me.\n\n\nI know my girlfriend tried to deal with Max, but he proved to be too difficult for her to manage. That scares me about the future, what other situations are going to be too difficult to manage? Am I blowing this out of proportion and being an asshole? Should I break things off with a girl who would do anything for me to be with my dog?\n",

I'll just use MF for my friend, and OF for my other friends.\n\nA bit of background. MF was having problems with my OF because of something school related. MF was irritated at OF because she thinks that they were not taking their work seriously (all of them are student government). MF doesn't really like anyone in her class and comes to our class to hang out with us, mostly with me.\n\nNow for the AITA. While buying lunch with MF, OF came and I joined them. We go to our classroom (we eat lunch in our classrooms) and I go to sit with OF, completely forgetting about MF. I didn't realize what I did until I saw MF crying.\n\nI came to MF and started to apologize, profusely. Maybe MF thought it was insincere because MF just up and left (I don't blame MF since I don't really know how to handle emotions). I tried talking to MF, and MF said: \"I'm fine now\". MF even came back to our classroom and we apologized to each other again.\n\nI thought that would be the end, but now MF is completely ignoring me. Doesn't even come to our class anymore, and doesn't seem to notice when I try to say hi. I'm completely stumped. Am I the asshole because I'm the one that started it all? Or do I just need to let MF cool down a bit? We've been friends since elementary and I don't really plan on severing a friendship that has lasted that long.",

She just quit working her job on the east coast and has one lined up  on the West coast next month.\n\nShe also got married recently, with in the last 2 months, I can't totally remember. Her relationship has been a bit bumpy from what she has told me. Nothing too crazy, but she says she isn't happy where she is in life and this job is really going to help her since she will be living in the city of her dreams doing a job she loves. \nThis means that her husband also needs to move across the country too. It appears that he is able to and still keep his job working remotely. \n\nRecently she has made it clear that she and her husband were having problems and that she doesn't feel like he values her and she is treated like anyone else. Ling story short, she talked to him about it and she called me crying and saying that he was leaving her. \n\nThe options came down to her staying in a city she hated, jobless, and her possibly working through her relationship to fix their problems, but still no promises, so let's add alone to the list. Or she could move across the country to a city where she has some family (although her relationship with them is a bit rough), a stable job.\n\nI'm her best friend, she doesn't really have a lot of people beside her husband, me, and a couple others. I'm feeling useless and I dont know what to tell her. I want her to be happy, but I don't want her to be alone across the country. She is only 20 and has her whole life ahead of her. I told her to take a couple days and see how she felt then about everything as her judgment could be clouded right now. I personally want her to be happy and am learning towards her going to her new job, but I still would like some others opinions.",

      "description": "Mobile, formating, spelling--ya know the drill\n\nSome info before we dive in: my sister is 22y/o, i am 20, almost 21 y/o. My sister (sis), has admittedly been having a rough few months. Her best friend of 12 years randomly told her to fuck off (more eloquently), she had a big arguement with our parents that involved her being kicked out for about 2 1/2 weeks (it was definitely her fault she got kicked out). Shes got a damn pharmacy in her room for one mental illness and another (not a ding on needing medication, but our family dr has a habit of just tossing drugs at us and not having proper tests done. My sister likes our dr because she validates every last thing she can 'relate' to online regarding mental disorders and our dr just believes her. My sister is VERY good with words--its whats going to make her a great lawyer one day--but she definitely pulls the wool over our drs eyes). She only recently started seeing a therapist again, but hes a psychotherapist so he cant prescribe or recommend different drugs. Only listen. And hes great, hes the one therapist shes seen where his opinion actually made difference in her behaviour, but its unfortunate he cant recommend different medications.\n\nFor the opinion needed: shes been having difficulty with jobs for awhile now. She quit due to a disagreement that got handled miscorrectly (from management's side) from one job, fired and paid to sign an NDA with another, fired from another where you volunteered yourself for shifts on a weekly basis, and has quit small waitressing jobs in between all that. Shes been unemployed for about 3 or 4 months now and that doesnt fly in my family since she has to pay her own way through a bit. Car insurance, gas, phone bill--ya know, the things that are hers. She also has to pay for her own university and that shit AINT CHEAP. Even with government funding, grants, everything, she still has to cough up a few grand a semester.\n\nAnd now--NOW she had a job offer, she was told 'this is our orientation, come and join us' and she TURNED THEM DOWN. Shes already had to borrow money from me and our mom. Her car, which is a total lemon, broke down AGAIN and is sitting dead in our drive way with a flat tire. She turned them down because she got a 'weird vibe' from the manager--which, fine, ive gotten that before too but the reason for her weird vibe was because the poor man was doing his job and promoting the fact that their store loves inner promotions and if she wanted a career with them, then thats a viable option. Its a spiel ive gotten from job interviews as well. Its nothing new.\n\nON TOP OF THAT, she had another interview lined up at a higher-end restaurant (a steak house) and she just DIDNT SHOW UP. I cant even remember the excuse she gave because thats how lame it was. \n\nShe cant even do what she usually does, which is sleep all day, because she has class 4/7 days a week. That doesnt stop her from sleeping from 2pm-11pm and then staying up until 2pm again. Its just so unhealthy its worrying everyone. Shes so tired that a small cold that everyone in my house fought off, no problem, knocked her on her ass for nearly 3 weeks (and by 'on her ass' i mean she was bedridden from the damn thing--and, no, she never had a fever or anything).\n\nAs i was typing this she came into my room to talk and i told her i wasnt happy she turned down the job. She said she and her therapist said she shouldnt have a job right now but, like i said before, that sort of stuff doesnt fly in the type of house we live in. A job for 10hrs a week (our min. wage is $14) would be more than enough and not be a distraction for her with school (something she used to balance alongside multiple jobs). If she doesnt get a job my parents may force her to by saying she needs to pay rent (I already do, its a small amount, but it ensures Im managing my money and keeping an income). Now i can hear her downstairs getting pissy with my parents and im regretting telling her my opinion--a common occurance, she always makes me feel like shit for opening my mouth. \n\nTldr: AITA for telling my sister i wasnt happy with her turning down a job offer?",

      "title": "AITA for asking my boyfriend to ditch one of his friends",
      "description": "My boyfriend Henry and I have known each other for 2 years, and have been in a serious relationship for the past year-ish.  He's known his friend Billy Bob for a long time.  I really didn't mind Billy Bob at first; I hadn't met him until recently, and he sounded like a pretty good guy.  However, before I met him I realized that my bf and Billy Bob spent lots of time together.  They were taking an EMT course together and studied together a lot.  I study a lot too for my own school, so I was happy that they were studying.\nI've never wanted to be the crazy, controlling girlfriend who tells her man what to do.  It sounds old-school, but I prefer to take on a more submissive role in the relationship since he's the man.  I try to be really supportive of his work and social life.\n\nThen there's Billy Bob.  I don't really like him.  I liked him just fine at first, and then I started to get to know him better.  I'm not really a fan of drugs or alcohol, and neither is Henry.  Billy Bob smokes/drinks/chews underage, which I don't like.  He lives with his parents rent-free and doesn't have a real paying job.  He's really lazy and doesn't like working or studying (he barely passed the EMT course and had to retest twice).  \nWhen I talked to Henry, he admitted that Billy Bob is lazy and should get a job.  He also said that he doesn't like that Billy Bob drinks or chews.  Henry's whole family doesn't approve of Billy Bob either, but Henry says he's hanging out with him so that he can \"be a good influence\".\n\nOne day we were eating dinner and Billy Bob texted asking if Henry wanted to go play Xbox.  We had already decided that we were going to have a date night together, so Henry told him that we weren't going to go.  Billy Bob texted back: \"Get your girl and get down here\" (quote).  Henry asked what I thought and I said it was up to him.  Henry said: \"I don't think Jenny wants to\".  Billy Bob said: \"Be a man and tell her what to do\" (quote).  That really bothered me.  I try to be supportive and kind, but I don't like being disrespected like that.\nShortly after, Henry and I talked about Billy Bob.  I said I didn't really like him and I didn't want them to hang out anymore.  He's lazy, doesn't have a job, drinks/smokes/chews underage, won't move out from living with his parents, and is really disrespectful towards me and other women (like his ex-girlfriend).  I love my boyfriend and want to support him, but I don't want him to hang out with people like that.  He still hangs out with him (every day for multiple hours).  Every time I text or call, he says he's hanging out with Billy Bob.  I really want him to stop being around him.  I don't want him dragged into the wrong crowd.  He says he's just \"trying to be a good influence\", but I don't think it'll ever work.  I want them to stop hanging out.\n\nAm I the asshole?  Thanks for your answers!  It's really appreciated.\n\ntl;dr - my bf's friend is lazy, doesn't have a job, drinks/smokes/chews underage, won't move out from living with his parents, and is disrespectful towards me and other women.  I want them to stop hanging out.  AITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want them to hang out?",

      "description": "I had just gotten off of work and I'm on the way to Burger King to get some food before I head back to my apartment for the night. Considering it's late at night, the BK at that point had closed the dining room but still had the drive through available. I go through the drive through and as I'm waiting for my food, this woman walks up and knocks on my window and when I roll it down she says in a sobbing voice, \"Hey, I didn't realize that they closed the dining room so early, I ran out of gas and am really hungry. Do you mind buying me a 10 piece or 2 of the nuggets so I can eat?\" I was kind of hesitant at first and she saw this and says, \"I just need some food because I'm stuck here and I ran out of gas and I don't live too far away from here.\" This is when I say, \"If you would like, I can give you a couple bucks in gas instead, that might be able to help you more. But I would like to pay for it in person rather than just give you the money.\" She then proceeds to say, \"Forget it. All I needed was some food until I got some gas,\" and just walks off all pissed off.\n\nNow I know, I don't know her circumstances and I don't know much about her. She also implied that I would buy the nuggets because just giving her the money won't help because she can't get in and you can't walk through the drive through. She also was not very big nor was she very skinny either, so going a few hours longer without food wouldn't have killed her. But here's my reasoning behind why I did it, if you only live \"not too far\" away, then surely the money I would pay for the nuggets would give you enough gas to get home to get food &amp; money. Granted it only would've been 3-4 dollars, but here that's over a gallon of gas and most cars get above 17-20 miles per gallon which would've been plenty given the area we are in.\n\nSo AITA and if so, what can I do better next time?\n\n",

      "description": "Quick disclaimer, my son is 17, the girlfriend just turned 16. There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. \nIt's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. \n\nMy son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. \n\nWe have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. \n\nHe is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. \n\nHe is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) \nThey both have their lives ahead of them. \n\nThey are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...\n(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. \nThis is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.\n\nSo, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? \n\nEdit to add T to wibta\n",

I am a really good worker and liked by most of my peers. I also fallow nearly every rule. I have came in multiple times to work when I was not supposed to in order to cover peoples shift, worked longer shifts, have a open schedual, and have done some very niche annoying things for the company. I have only been here for 2 months and she is a new(ish) manager. We are also understaffed. The official rules say we need to have a 2 week notice but this came short notice so I only gave a 5 day. Here are the exact texts as they went down today. \n\n\"Hey (manager). I wont be able to make it to my shift this Saturday. Sorry in advance for the short notice.\"\n\n\"How come? Also did you find coverage?\"\n\n\"Its personal reasons and your the first person i told. I can ask around but if I cannot find coverage I still would not be able to come. And if I could pick up the hours on another day I am down.\"\n\n\"Ok this is a one time pass. I will not allow this ever again. It’s a rule that you need to find coverage or you are written up. I’m letting this go this time and don’t worry about finding coverage I will adjust the schedule on Monday\"\n\n\"Thank you. Again sorry for the short notice. Do you need me to ask around?\"\n\n\"Also just a heads up never message your manager saying FYI I’m not coming in on a certain day if I find coverage or not. It’s not polite nor professional. Asking for help is the way to go bud. It goes a long way. No I will change it accordingly on Monday\"\n\n\"It was an emergency and I asked my mom. She told me to just say it upfront because she won't let me go (and that what she does). Sorry if it seemed rude. ^its not my jive but my moms the boss\"\n\n\"That’s fine, but I would not talk to me like that again. Your mother doesn’t speak for you bud. If things happen that’s fine but again asking for help and explaining that it’s an emergency goes a long way.\"\n\nNote: Please dont ask what is filling up my day on Saturday! It is quite personal.\n\nTL;DR - I told my manager I cant come in for a day I worked a week ahead. She took it personally. ",

Two times he was late for his time slot so we started filling another truck and he had to wait. A few other times, we were finishing up his order so he had to wait as well. He has also had times where he shows up and his truck is loaded and he's out the door in 20 minutes. It's really a crap shoot. He gets compensated for wait times and it's not unusual in the industry to wait for your load.\n\nA few days ago, I was checking my company's Google reviews and noticed a 1 star review from the week before. It was a truck driver saying that he always has to wait for his truck to be loaded and that people shouldn't do business with my company because we are unprofessional.\n\nI immediately called my contact at the trucking company and asked them to take down the review. We are their customer and we give them a lot of business, and I didn't think it was appropriate for one of their employees to give us a bad review because they are unhappy with something that is standard in our industry.\n\nMy contact called me today to say they have removed the review and fired the truck driver. I didn't ask for the driver to be fired, but I think I would have done the same thing if one of my employees left a bad review on one of our customers sites.\n\nI do feel bad that he was fired, though. I think maybe I should have talked to him directly instead of going to his boss? \n\nAITA for getting this employee fired because he left my company a bad review?",

However we both went to separate colleges and they were 8 hours apart. So after going to college and never seeing her I started to lose feelings, she wasn’t good at holding conversations through text and we didn’t really have the time to FaceTime. About 2 months in she was gonna come up and visit me but last second she decided she didn’t want to drive by herself the 8 hours to see me, which is understandable. But since I wasn’t really into her that much anymore I took her cancelling as an opportunity to tell her how I felt. So I ended things with her and she got mad at me, called me an immature asshole and how rude it was for me to talk to her all that time and just end it. I really didn’t think I did anything that wrong since I lost feelings for her but I wanted to get some other peoples opinions as well. Was I the asshole? ",

It had no creative value, and it was very distasteful and offensive. Me and one other woman both thought the same thing.

      "description": "I don't really know how to explain this in the title.\n\nSo I agreed to meet up with a friend and meet someone else. He told me and I thought we were just gonna hang out. To be honest it ended up becoming really uncomfortable. I don't exactly know how it all happened but it was almost like he was trying to control my life in a way. He kept saying how much I should change my major to something else and how I'm not cut out for my chosen one. The friend he introduced me too wasn't a bad person and she was actually fairly pleasant to talk too but I didn't come long so I could be interviewed. I did my best to play along and overall it wasn't horrible but it got worse.\n\nEventually the other friend left and he started saying about how I should write up a resumé for my life? I found this weird as I had no reason to write one and even if I did need to at one point it's not like I needed his guidance in doing so. The point being I never asked for his help on any of this. But he kept insisting that I should do this and he has to force me or else I won't take charge of my life. At this point I became fairly angry, almost betrayed. A long time ago I told him about how I felt about my depression and this is what he does? It was almost like he was treating me like I was disabled or stupid because of it. And above all, why the fuck would any of this help me? At this point I got fed up and confused and I asked to leave. On the ride back he was telling me about how he was doing this because \"he saw me as human\" and his explanation sounded like bullshit.\n\nI seriously feel like he was trying to manipulate me or play on my vulnerabilities but I'm not stupid enough to go along with it. But the question still stands if I'm the one at fault here. Maybe he was genuinly trying to help and I got mad for no reason. Maybe I'm being oversensitive. Or maybe there is something with the resume that I'm missing. Or maybe he has a point in general.\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I live in an in-law apartment in my mother’s basement during my pregnancy. There’s a staircase leading into her house that locks from her side. There have been a few times when either my mom or grandmother (who lives in the main house) have knocked and then opened the door without waiting for an answer when they need something. At first, this wasn’t a big deal but lately it’s been happening “after business hours”.\n\nLast week, my boyfriend and I were getting out of the shower when my grandmother called my name. It was around 8 PM. After this, I asked my mom if she could tell her mom that I asked for them to wait for an answer before opening the door. I also have a key, so I make sure the door is locked so they have to physically unlock the door before they open it. I had hoped this would defer the behavior further.\n\nLast night, my moms boyfriend opened the door without knocking and called my boyfriends name. It was 9:30 PM, he was sleeping and I was in the bathroom. I called my mom from the bathroom to ask if they needed anything and she didn’t tell me why her boyfriend called for mine, she just apologized and hung up.\n\nAn hour later she texted me saying she had been having a conversation with her mom so her boyfriend was looking to see if my boyfriend wanted to hang out for a bit. I texted back saying that he was sleeping but I’d appreciate a text or a call moving forward before people open up my door. She said she didn’t think I had a reason to be angry and that her boyfriend was just trying to be nice. So I sent a long text explaining that I wasn’t angry but that I thought I made it clear last week that the current system of communication wasn’t working for me, and also that I couldn’t have people shouting down the stairs for me when I had a newborn here so from now on please just text me if I’m needed. \n\nMy mom replied bitterly about how it’s not fair that there are strict rules for her to come into my space but not for me to come into her space and that she should be able to knock without there being an issue. And “boyfriend was just being nice”. So I just reiterated that I’m not mad at anyone, especially her boyfriend, that she can set rules for her space whenever she wants, but I’m not budging on this. I told her I loved her and went to bed.\n\nThis morning she called me and told me she’d like to “discuss our argument”. I’m dumbfounded. I feel as if I’m not asking for a lot and I wouldn’t consider the conversation an argument. Am I missing something?",

      "title": "AITA for making my mom cry?",
      "description": " \n\nTo give some context: The relationship between my mom and the family (specifically father) in the house next to us has gotten progressively worse over time. For ease of reading, I'll just refer to the father as A.\n\nThe point at which I took notice is when my mom, in attempting to prevent leaves from being pushed by the wind onto their driveway, placed a thin wall around the flower patch dividing our two properties. On coming home from school one day, A promptly opens the door of house, proclaims loudly that we built the wall by cementing on top of his 'wall' and therefore has decided that he is going to contact his lawyer. He then shuts the door of his house, leaving me and my mom gobsmacked. This was about a month ago.\n\nMy father works a couple hours away, so he only manages to come back every two weekends or so. My dad comes home, and on opening the door, I see that my dad and A are talking. I go to the door to try and eavesdrop, but I was surprised when I hear my dad, completely calm, hearing A out.\n\nA argues his case, giving one example that, should he want to renovate/replace his wall, he can't due to the front porch wall. My dad  notes the incidents between A and my mom, and asks that, as having a good relationship is important, he no longer talk to my mother, and come to him instead. A apologises, explaining that he's had a heart attack, and has been under a lot of stress.\n\nThe conversation ends pretty amicably, as A says he needs to cook dinner, and my dad needs to unpack. My dad then walks into the media room, where my mom asks him, coldly, why he's talking to her. She begins to shout, saying that he'd rather 'hang out with his new best friend than see his wife', angry that he didn't defend her 'like a man'. Over the next half hour, he tries to argue that the best way forward is to end the conflict, rather than getting angry at him. For the rest of the day, my mom doesn't talk to him.\n\nAfter he's left for work later that night, my mom brings my sister (15) and me into her bedroom and asks us our opinion. Being a quite religious person, I recounted a story in which a women laid traps for the prophet every day to hurt him, and when the traps were missing one day, the prophet went to her house, where she was ill, with no-one to nurse her back to health. He therefore decides to do it himself, and following this, she converts. I tried to argue that my dad's course of action was correct, as ending a conflict through communication and diplomacy is always the best course of action. My mother begins to cry and state that my father didn't defend her. She then complains that she thought I would be on her side, and that only her youngest daughter (6) is comforting her, telling me to leave. My other sister then gets angry at me, saying I should have agreed with her, and that I made her cry, which, referring back to religion, is a sin. I try and argue to her that my mom is in the wrong, but she gets angry at me and storms off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Posting from a throwaway for reasons. \n\nBackground: I am engaged to be married in August. My fiancé's parent's owned a motorcycle dealership and on their honey moon they took brand new motorcycles on a road trip across several states. \n\nApparently it has always been my future mother in law's dream that her son and his wife recreate the trip. My fiancé apparently bought off on this without consulting me. They just had us over for Sunday dinner and I was presented with a brand new motorcycle. Funny thing is, I've never ridden a motorcycle, I have no interest in motorcycles and frankly they scare they shit out of me. Along with a motorcycle came an itinerary, a set of ridiculous looking leather gear and some cash to make the trip happen. My fiancé was like \"aren't you so happy?\"\n\nI told them in a way I consider polite but direct that I appreciated the thought but that I was not interested in recreating the trip. All of the sudden it was 3 against one and apparently all of the sudden I'm a complete piece of shit for ruining his parent's dreams. His mom actually screamed at me that they spent some ungodly amount on the motorcycle (I didn't hear exactly but 20k?  30k? more? I'm not sure) and I was being very unappreciative. I excused myself and drove home. I'm shaking from being talked to that way. \n\n\nPlease talk me off the ledge of crazy town, Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "To give some background, I currently work a job where I only get 10 days of vacation a year. \n\nI am also dating someone who lives in the next city over, and we both work jobs with long hours, so we can only see each other on weekends and vacation days.\n\nSo this week is a vacation week, and I have three days off. I was pretty excited, and made plans to go visit a lot of places I had wanted to visit for a while. \n\nAbout a week ago, my brother messages me to say he's going out of town for the holiday and can I go to his place to look after his cat. I'm kind of annoyed that he assumes I won't have any plans, but he says I can stay at his place with my boyfriend for the holiday so I think ok, that could work out. I agree, and think it's all settled. \n\nSkip forward to this morning, the day before I'm meant to go to look after the cat, and he messages me to say that, actually, my boyfriend can't stay. Turns out, he'd never bothered to ask his wife if it was ok for us to stay at his apartment, and had just assumed it would be alright. \n\nSo now every day of my three days of holiday I have to make a 3 - 4 hour long round trip to the next city to go check on his cat. This puts a big dampener on me being able to do anything else.  \n\nI'm not annoyed at his wife, I understand not wanting people to stay at your apartment when you're not there. I'm just annoyed that I wasnt informed of this before, and that it was assumed I would have no plans for the holiday. My brother is absolutely adamant that he did nothing wrong, and that me and his wife are both completely overreacting for being annoyed at him. \n\nAITA for being infuriated by this situation?",

      "description": "So this weekend I was hanging out with some of my friends and one of them left their Bluetooth speaker and so we were playing some shitty music through it as a joke to annoy one of our friends. Sometime later I got the brilliant idea to put it in the microwave (we never turned on the microwave either), after doing that and closing the door the music would suddenly stop and we were all intrigued by it so we did for a bit. After a bit of that it wouldn’t play any music and connect and I realized that I’m kinda screwed here if it’s broke. The next day I get to school he’s pissed about it and is demanding about $40 for the speaker even though it’s about $30 on Amazon. I offered him to buy a new one in replace of his old one and he would just get angrier with me. At the end of the day we’re at our usual spot where we wait for everyone before we go out to the bus and everyone else is pissed at me after offering to buy him a new one instead of overpaying him. I get home about half an hour later and I see that he blocked me and nobody is responding to my messages so I got on and figured this would be the best sub to share to.\n\nTL;DR \nPut my friends speaker in a microwave and broke it so I offered to buy him a new one but he won’t accept it",

      "description": "I'm going to separate this into two parts that are both equally important. Backstory oh, and the current situation.\n\nBackstory: My uncle is the last person alive on his side of the family. My grandmother was murdered by her second husband in 2008, and my father passed away six years ago 2012 from a heart attack. All of his cousins and family are gone, me, my mother, and my brother are it. He is going through a nasty divorce, and he has become an alcoholic. \n\nHis wife filed a PPO against him and he came to stay with us, he never exactly asked for permission. And that's probably because we are the only place he has to go. He has also been jobless prior to staying with us for a year and a half.\n\nBefore he came to stay with us his wife was only giving him rice and eggs to eat because he had no money to go buy food. I would sometimes go down and give him food. I also helped him get his current job after he arrived, and I'm currently trying to help him get his truck up and running.\n\n\nCurrent situation: Over the past 6 months it has been hell, we have very basic rules in my house. Clean up after yourself, no smoking in the house, no drinking in the house, be respectful and kind to everyone. Every single one of these rules he has broken, we caught him smoking in our house at least a dozen times, drinks himself into a stupor almost every night. When he is drunk he is absolutely not himself, he often goes on rants about us, and start verbal fights over things as minor as walking to heavily in the house. \n\nThe outside of our house is littered with hundreds of cigarette butts, and he stashes all of his empty whiskey bottles behind the couch, which has effectively ruined the carpet. We have a pretty beasty video game &amp; movie collection, which we have had to physically remove from the house because he would never take care of them. I will be surprised if our Lord of the Rings extended edition ever runs again, he also broke our Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.\n\nBut he is my uncle, and we are all he has. When he is sober he is mostly fine and doesn't do even half the shit he does when he's drunk.\n\nSo yesterday we told him that at the end of the month he has to leave, his reaction was not good, he started getting emotional and was talking about how he has nowhere to go an why his only family is abandoning him\n\nI want him gone, but I feel awful.

      "description": "My dad and I (28M) have had our ups and downs throughout my life but the last two years have been good. My dad got fired from his longtime time about 3 years ago and my parents divorced last year. He hasn’t gotten a job since and is only making a little side money doing photography. He has never really been good with finances and that became apparent as I got older. He made pretty good money and he should have had built a really nice savings up but instead he has tens of thousands in credit card debt and has filed for bankruptcy 3 times in the past. I remember him always spending his money on random expensive things but still he should have plenty of money. He never bought clothes, drove an old car and he bought their house for 100K about 15 years ago. I honestly have no idea where his money has gone.\n\nI found out from my mom last week that he was really struggling and that he is putting his house on the market. He burrowed 2K from my mom and my uncle took out a personal loan to help him out over the past 3-4 months. I was shocked by this because 2 months ago he bought a BRAND-NEW living room set even though his old couch was perfectly fine. How can he burrow money and turn around and buy a living room set? \n\nAnyways, I knew that he would eventually ask me for money and today it finally happened. He came over and asked for $1,500 and that he would pay me back this week. He said he doesn’t have enough for his mortgage. I told him that I am not as well off as he thinks I am, which may or may not be true depending on your outlook. I own a business and things have been going really great this year and I have finally been able to save a good amount of money but this is my wife’s and I house fund that we’ve been working hard towards. I also told him I was hit with some unexpected bills (TRUE) and I couldn’t help him right now. He didn’t press me about it which was great.\n\nTechnically yes, I can loan him money and not be hurting but seeing his spending problem worries me. Two other people have already loaned him money and he took that for granted. He's refused to get a job, any job in the past 3 years and spent money he didn't have. He made his own bed and he must lie in it.  The question is though, AITA?",

      "description": "This has bothered me for awhile now. So my friend and I decided to go watch the movie Finding Dory and sitting in front of us was a mother, a father and a daughter. The mom was texting so that bright screen was already pretty annoying. Once the movie starts the kid went nuts! She started running up and down the theater pretending to be one of the characters. She was so loud. I even saw her throwing her candy at some of the other movie goers and laughing at them when they asked her to stop. So my friend nicely tells the kids father “ Hey, your daughters being kind of loud...” He immediately cut my friend off and said. “Well I guess you didn’t have a decent childhood. Your parents never let you be a kid?” We were left speechless. Then the daughter proceeds to stand up on her chair. She then slips and falls backwards. Thank god I was behind her and she landed on me. She could have cracked her head wide open on one of the seats but I said something that I feel kind of bad about. I looked her in the eyes and said  “You’re lucky that I was here or else you probably would’ve cracked your head open. You better sit down quietly right now or else I am getting the manager to kick y’all out and you will never find dory if I do that!” The daughter sat quietly in her seat for the rest of the movie, the dad stormed out angrily never returned and the mom never looked up from her phone. After the movie the daughter apologized it was really sweet. Unfortunately though the Mom finally looked up from her phone and said “Don’t apologize to that jerk!” Then her and her daughter left the theater. \n\nSo I ask AITAH for saying such harsh things to a kid? I’m starting to feel like I should have just gotten a manager to begin with. Not to mention the daughter was so sweet in the end. I feel bad. ",

      "description": "All right this happened a few days ago, so my uncle and my dad were talking about something and my mom threw herself into the conversation and started complaining saying he was doing something wrongly (p.s he was doing everything right) after he tried many time that what he was doing wasn’t permanent to no avail this got him mad and he yelled at her and walked out of the house. Now we just got a puppy she’s the cutest thing you’ll ever seen. It took me 11 years to convince my mom to by a dog (I’m 14) and she knows she means the world to me, and I know that she’s not the biggest fan of my dog and complains about it constantly. The rest goes as follows, I pick my dog up as I didn’t know how she would react to the arguing after my dad stormed out with my uncle. I bring here in my arms to the kitchen where my mom is and kinda give a ok kind of sigh. She then proceedes to say this dog was a mistake, it’s causing me so much problems. I then proceed to freak the fuck out and get mad at here she says some things back and runs out of the room crying(p.s I would also like to point out that this is not the first time she has called getting my dog a mistake and every time I’ve gotten mad I was a little more mad because she was acting like she was the victim when we have all been doing everything and having trouble) so am I the asshole ",

It works every time.\n\nProblem is, I really hate this. It makes me uncomfortable at best and furious at worst. Every time I’ve told someone to stop, they’ve gotten noticeably more distant towards me, with the exception of one person who I’m still very chummy with. I don’t wanna alienate these people, cause I genuinely enjoy hanging out with them aside from the takeouts, but they really aren’t enjoyable. Is telling them to stop an asshole move?

She drives for Uber just enough to pay for gas and food and that's about it.\n\nThe other day she texted me a picture of a cute yellow lab puppy and said she was getting it on Friday.  I know she's super excited that get it and I know having a dog is good for so many reasons, but it's also a huge responsibility.\n\nWhen I mentioned that she lives in a camper, I should stress that it's extremely small.  It has room for a small bed, has a toilet and makeshift shower and then a small folding table.  Its the size of a large closet.\n\nAnyways, I told her that the dog was going to get to be pretty big and asked If she thought she had enough space.  She didn't understand why I was asking that and so I said that getting a dog right now, regardless of size is a bad idea, as she's barely taking care of herself.\n\nShe got off the phone pretty quickly and I haven't heard back from her since.

      "description": "This happened in Europe, I am from Canada. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was interning abroad and my luggage was taken on my charter (Flixbus) bus ride to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Unfortunately, even though I immediately figured out who had taken my luggage (due to the fact that his luggage was left on the bus), I had to catch my plane back to Canada. He had taken it off the stop before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got in contact with the man who swapped luggage with me. He lives in Italy. I contacted the charter bus to see if they would help us resolve this, but they were and still are absolutely useless and are not jumping to help in anyway. I have given up on that route. They wouldn't even offer to help bring my luggage to another part of Europe... even though they have routes all over Europe. Even if they did, it would take me another year to see my luggage again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis man who took my luggage is essentially ghosting me. I've been messaging him on WhatsApp trying to get my luggage back for over 4 months now. He makes excuses such as he's busy with work, he's waiting for the bus company to get him back his luggage, or he tried but can't figure out how to ship it. I get it, shipping to Canada would cost over 400$, and he says money is tight for him right now. This isn't money I would even be willing to pay to get my luggage back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to give him an easy way out and tell him to ship to Berlin, where I have a family friend. And there would be a chance that someone I know could come get it from there in the near future (around Christmas). I let him know this about a month and a half ago, he sounded actually interested in this, but continued to reply slowly.  I told him to do it ASAP, as my friends will only be in Berlin until the end of December. Again, I got the sense that he wasn't very interested in shipping my luggage for me, and was just trying to get me to give up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a last ditch effort, I told him that if he does manage to get my stuff to my family friends, I would cover the costs of the shipping (this would be around 80 euros). AGAIN, I told him he has to do it ASAP because shipping takes around 20 days from Italy to Berlin using Standard. He wanted me to pay first before he shipped, I obviously refused, and he stalled a bit more. I told him I would contact \"transport authorities in Italy\" (I was BSing, but I was frustrated that there wasn't anything I could do) and he actually seemed to make a move on shipping it and got some quotes for prices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe still hasn't shipped it. He tells me he definitely will at the end of this week (so... tomorrow). However, because he waited so long, he has to pay express shipping (120 euros), which is about 80$ CAD more. He still expects me to pay this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday I told this story to my roommate and she was like, \"Why not just NOT pay him, MaplelikeNine? It's your stuff and completely his fault. Get your luggage and ghost him like he did to you.\" It was his fault... our luggage looks NOTHING alike and mine is significantly larger. If he was paying even a slight amount of attention, this swap wouldn't have happened. He also wasted so much of my time and money now by not trying to fix this earlier. But I did tell him I would cover whatever the cost of shipping was as long as I got my suitcase first. I definitely feel like this is morally unethical... but uh, am I in the right to do it? I don't know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, yeah. If I didn't pay him or at least paid him much less than I promised him for MY STUFF that he originally took, would I be the asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr guy took my luggage accidentally. I want it back. He doesn't want to pay for shipping. I offered to pay after I got the suitcase back. Debating whether or not I'm a horrible terrible person if I just ignore him after I get my suitcase back. ",

      "description": "This may be long and confusing, apologies in advance. Also: dirty, dirty mobile user. \n\nI am maid of honor in my best friend’s wedding (to an amazing guy and they both deserve the world). I live in Seattle and the bachelorette party is in South Florida. For reference, everyone else is only a couple of hours drive from the location. I had every intention of going, bought the plane ticket, booked the rooms, etc. Something came up and I am unable to make it (car needs $2k of work and fiancée is leaving for a couple of months so I wanted to spend this last weekend with him). \n\nI paid for my share of the rooms, gifts and decorations. It was roughly $500 per person. I told the rest of the girls to let me know if there were any other incidentals so that I could contribute towards.   \n\nThey are now telling me that I also need to pay for my 1/8 of the food that was ordered in restaurants as well as gas money to drive (the food is almost $600 per person and the gas was only about $60 per person). I told them I would pay my share of the gas because they were going to drive me around when I flew in, so I do think that’s fair, but I am absolutely not paying for the food they ordered in restaurants. \n\nThey are up in arms. I am suddenly the villain. They told me that they are to tell the bride to cut me in the wedding altogether and I shouldn’t even bother showing up. I feel like this is kind of ridiculous, but my bride (god bless her soul) is so impressionable that I feel like she may feed into it. She is arguably one of the most important people in my life, and the thought of this happening is destroying me. \n\nShould I bite the bullet and just pay them? Am I the asshole for refusing this and standing my ground? Will I be cut from the wedding (just venting on this question)?",

      "description": " So I'm getting married in October and everyone tells me, \"It's your wedding do what you want!\" but it doesn't feel that way...My fiance and I got engaged in July and shortly after she started doing all the planning. One random day in August my mom texts me if my niece can be a junior bride's maid (didn't even know this was thing). Now, me and my niece, who is 11, don't really have a relationship. I've been around her since she was born but that didn't help us establish a connection. Now being the first grandchild of both sides of the family, she was very spoiled from the beginning and got way with everything. My mom, has probably been her biggest enabler. Let's her get away with anything without any consequences. I thought this would phase out but here we are today. When I see my niece at family functions I say Hi and how are you?..nothing...won't even go out of her way to greet me or my fiance. When I was child, this behavior was completely unacceptable and would have been scolded for not greeting my uncles. Now back to the question of Junior brides maid. I tell my mom I don't know I'll ask my fiance. At this moment I had a bad feeling due to her behavior and should have said no, I didn't. My fiance and settled on her being a flower girl. In my head great everyone is happy, my niece is in the wedding like my mom wanted and my fiance keeps getting to plan the wedding of her dreams. This is where it all goes down hill. At the end of October, we invite the bridal party over to announce, well, that they are in the bridal party. My fiance puts together a little box of party favors and a balloon to pop that asks her friends if they want to be a brides maid. My sister, nieces mom, is a brides maid. When she shows up to my house, she brings my niece and nephew. I thought it was just going to be her but they are her kids, wasn't upset. Upon my sister popping her balloon, my niece immediately got upset because she didn't get a balloon to pop. My dad escorted my niece and nephew out of the room before she started crying. Now, I was in the other room with my groomsmen so I did't see any of this go down. A couple minutes after the balloon popping, my mom corners my fiance and wants to know why my niece didn't get a balloon to pop for being a flower girl. My fiance, stunned, said I don't have a balloon for her to pop and my mom was disappointed.  She was planning on doing something else for the ring bearers and flower girls when letting them know they're in the wedding. Since my mom or sister already told my niece, no point in that anymore. Later that night, my fiance told me what happened and I wanted to confront my mom but she told me no and not to make a bid deal out of it. I should have. As the weeks and months go on my mom's attitude towards my fiance changed. Whether she admits it or not, the tension was growing. Recently, my fiance started to pick out flower girl dresses and was sending links to my sister for her to buy them and have my niece try on. My sister becomes difficult. Not ordering the dresses and/or not responding. My mom even makes a comment to my fiance one day that she made my sister's flower girl dress for her aunt's wedding and everyone loved it. Why? So we finally get pictures of my niece in the flower girl dress to she how she looks and she looks absolutely miserable. In one picture you can even tell she's fighting with my sister. My fiance, is immediately stressed out. She is worried that my niece will not cooperate on the day of wedding and cause a scene. She still doesn't want me to say anything but I call my dad to vent. He blows up the whole situation. My mom immediately called my fiance and assures her that she'll drag my niece down the aisle if the she has to. WTF. My mom completely missed the point and now my fiance is furious at me for saying something. I decide at that moment my niece can't be in the wedding. It was going to be a no kid wedding but I would still like her to be a guest. I go tell my parents that she can't be in my wedding for all the reasons above. My dad 100% agrees and gives me \"It's your wedding, do what you want!\" My mom seems disappointed but agrees. My dad even made the point I don't even think she wants to be in the wedding. I tell my sister afterwards, she's disappointed and says no hard feelings. Over right? No. Today, I get these long texts from my dad (to be honest I think it was my mom) to reconsider and almost bullying me into having her in the wedding. I still say no and now silence from my mom, dad, and sister.... Now I ask you reddit, Am I the asshole for removing my niece from the wedding?\n\nTLDR: Getting married. Asked by my mom to include my niece in the wedding who I don't have relationship with. Things go sour due to my nieces difficult behavior and my enabling mom. I decide she can't be in the wedding. My family is clearly upset with me because of the this decision. AITA?",

      "description": "So my BF is really upset at me and it's causing a lot of arguments. I was so set but now I need outside advice.\n\nI'm the oldest and things were ok with my parents until my dad's company took off and he became a giant abusive asshole. He never hit the kids but would throw stuff and call us names. He walked out when I was in college with a mistress less than 10 years older than me and ignored our existence by selling his company, leveraging a ton of debt and moving out of the US. I was fucked, didn't qualify for financial aid, we lost everything to creditors, had to drop out and struggled for a few years.  It was a wake up call to how much we had in terms of money but how abusive he was. I ended up going back to school, ended up with an advanced degree and am very comfortable right now. That's when I met my current BF. He is amazing, kind and has a wonderful family. He sees the well off side of me, generous and giving a ton of my income and time to various organizations. He never saw how bitter and broken I was trying to get back on my feet.  \n\nMy cousin reached out on Facebook which is weird because they called us the worst things during the divorce and cut off contact. I had changed accounts but they found me. Long story short he's really sick and needs money for medical care. \n\nI have been wise with my spending and I could easily pay for his care. In fact it's less than what I donate. My boyfriend is horrified that I'm saying no to helping him. He says that my dad paid for my living expenses growing up and I had a very comfortable life up until he left. I'm torn. I spent my childhood trying to protect my mom and little sister. She's still emotionally recovering from our dad ignoring us even though she reached out when she was a minor and all the emotional abuse. I spent years trying not to think my existence was a mistake. \n\nIt's also been over 10 years since I've seen or heard from him. It's not like he's asking for a kidney but now I'm afraid everyone in my BFs family is going to think I'm heartless. I want to marry this man and I can see his face change when we have these arguments.  He doesn't get why I won't budge even though it's not really much for me. He doesn't understand how I can be so kind and generous to friends and strangers while letting my dad suffer. He doesn't like this side of me. \n\nTldr, I said no to helping my dad who left and my long terms BF thinks I'm an asshole. AITA? ",

      "description": "\nThis situation is complicated. My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n",

      "description": "Okay, so some background: I am a very avid “gamer girl”, not your typical gamer girl, I’m top 1000th in the world at Black Ops 3 Zombies and top 100th in the world at Black Ops 2 zombies. I’ve been playing since I was young and I love it. Honestly my only hobby besides painting is gaming. I bought my PlayStation 4 a few years ago before I was with my current boyfriend. He doesn’t game much, but on occasion. I don’t mind sharing it, I’ve even deleted my games off the console to free up hardware storage space for some of the games he likes to play! Anyway I bought Black Ops 4 last night and it takes FOREVER for games to download onto the console, my WiFi probably sucks, oh well. Anyway, I left my PS4 on rest mode so it could download all night and while I’m at work today, so when I get home at 4 pm today I will finally be able to play Zombies on this new game! I am excited, I can hardly wait. Well.. my boyfriend is trying to tell me I can’t play my game when I get home because he’s off today and wants to play his game.. he’s owned this game for 5 days and has played it a few days already, I’ve let him play and haven’t had any protest to him playing. I told him he can play today until I get home and then I’m playing my game for a few hours. He can have it back after, but I have been waiting and I’m excited. He said no... I flipped and told him it’s my system and if he wants to be like that he can buy his own and cannot play mine anymore. Now he’s calling me a spoiled brat and saying I’m being an ass and this is escalating into an argument and it’s so dumb. I know it’s a trivial argument for some, but I love my video games. I know I can be a spoiled brat, but I don’t think I am being one this time. I don’t want to let him play all day while I’m anxiously waiting to play a game I’m excited for. Basically waiting to use my own system while someone else uses it and I sit there all day anticipating playing this game. \n\nTLDR: Boyfriend is trying to tell me I can’t play my new game on MY PlayStation 4 when I get home from work today because he wants to play his own game. He’s off today and can play from 10:30 am to 4 pm while I’m working, but wants to sleep all day and play all afternoon basically. ",

      "description": "So last night I made a joke that clearly did not go over well. One of my friends (more of a friend of my closest friends who i therefore see on occasion) broke up with his gf. And i know this because he liked 3 of my old photos. I laughed and told her \"Bob is single again, man his gf must have really hated me\".\n\nThis joke seemed to just start a fight. She asked why I was still following a guy I had slept with once (mutual friends, he is my friend, no feelings there). And then went on to \"why do you follow all the girls you slept with too. We've been together for 13 months. They should be unfollowed. Keeping your options open eh?\" Side note here, i am not keeping options open, i'm just too lazy and can't be bothered to unfollow people. I still follow people i went to high school with and friends of my ex. Also, my current gf has told me over and over again that there is no future with us, no marriage, nothing - because she's Muslim and you know, being a lesbo gets you a one way ticket to hell. \n\nI didn't want to bother fighting over this, I explained that I was just lazy and then when she kept going on, i got my phone out and just started unfollowing because not worth it. I really don't care about them. Well this was apparently the wrong thing to do. She wanted me to unfollow them because i wanted to, not because she asked me to. And to not do it in front of her. More whining about it, teary eyes, and asking why i want to keep them around. I said clearly i don't, i'm getting rid of them right now. \n\nQue her saying \"i don't want you to do it right now. Just tell me when you do\". I've had it at this point because i'm trying to cook us dinner and stop a fight about nothing. I said \"why is it not ok for me to follow these people, who i slept with once and mean nothing to me, when you still follow your ex (muslim man - potential for future i guess) who you were in love with.\" \n\nThe tears started. Just crying and saying that i was so mean for saying that, that i'm gaslighting her, and she was just joking before but then i had to be mean. I am just done with the conversation at this point and walk away for 20 so minutes to cool off. Come back and she is pissed, says i just ignored her when she was sad, that what i said was uncalled for. That's there's a difference between people i slept with once and someone she was in love with at one point. I'm done with the fight and just don't give enough of a shit about it so I say sorry. \n\nWas i an asshole for bringing that up?",

      "description": "My (23/F) boyfriend (26/m) has been extremely busy with work this week. A few times during the year, his job is really high stress and he usually reacts by being distant in our relationship. I understand why, it’s happened before and we’ve talked about it. However, I always worry about him when this happens and he reassures me everything is fine. I think I get on his nerves by always checking in to make sure everything is OK. (Ugh, I know. I’m a worrier, I can’t help it sometimes.) \n\nHe has plans with his friends this weekend to blow off some steam and chill out with them. So, I was planning on getting some of his favorite booze delivered to his house as a little gift to maybe cheer him up. (We live in a major city, so booze delivery is super easy and I wouldn’t be physically going over there - I’m trying to give him space and let him do his thing.) \n\nBut, I can’t help but think this would be kind of an asshole move. Like I said, he gets distant when he’s in these stressful periods, so I don’t want to encroach on his space and seem like an overbearing girlfriend. \n\nSo, am I overthinking this or WIBTA if I got my boyfriend a surprise booze delivery?

It was hell and as a result I don’t drink at all and don’t like being around drunk people.  \n\nWhen I started dating my girlfriend I knew that she drank and discussed my issues with it.  I just asked her that she doesn’t drink around me.  It worked out fine, she was great about not even drunk dialing me, a problem I had with my ex girlfriend.  \n\nWhen we started discussing moving in I was very apprehensive about it.  I asked her if she could really handle not drinking at all in our home and she was adamant that it was no big deal.  That if she wanted to drink she could just spend that night at a friends and that she really didn’t drink that often anyways so it wouldn’t be a problem.  \n\nThe first few months that’s exactly what happened.  Since then though there have been times that she’s come home obviously drunk and just lying about it to me.  I’ve talked her about it to mixed reactions.  Sometimes she will apologize profusely and promise not to let it happen again.   Other times it becomes an argument about how I’m projecting my mother’s problem on our situation.  That she’s not an alcoholic or abusive.  Which is true, but it’s not really about her being abusive, it’s that being around drunk people drudges up a lot of painful memories for me.  She just brushed that off though.  \n\nAfter this last time it happened she’s outright fighting me on the issue.   She says this is her home too and we’re both adults.   That I need to get therapy instead of trying to control her.  We had a clear agreement before we moved in though.  ",

      "description": "I [23M] have been seeing my boyfriend [22M] for a little over a year now and honestly, he makes me happier than anyone else has ever made me. When I tell you I'm in love with this guy, I don't have the words to describe how much I mean that. He's everything I've ever wanted and more. \n\nHowever, he was raised in a very staunchly conservative Christian household. This included his parents, from whom he is now estranged, being incredibly homophobic. There was also quite a lot of abuse. To give you a taste of the extent of this behaviour, his brother once posted a picture to Facebook where he was jokingly kissing a male friend on the cheek and his father beat the shit out of him every night for a week. \n\nNaturally, this meant that my boyfriend spent much of his teenage years very deep in the closet. He basically went the route of deliberately acting like a hypermasculine fuck boy because how could such a manly man who hit it and quit it with every girl in school be gay? Part of this behaviour was posting homophobic memes etc to social media and commenting mean shit on posts about gay people because, again, how could someone who so clearly hates the gays be gay? \n\nObviously that isn't who he is any more. When he was 19 he was finally able to move out of his parents' house and come out of the closet. He apologised to people who he'd hurt with his comments and went through his social media accounts and deleted all of the homophobic posts he could find. However, some things managed to slip through the cracks. This included an old Twitter account that he used in school and forgot he had, which had his full name and pictures attached to it. \n\nRecently, a friend of mine stumbled upon this Twitter account and found some of the homophobic content posted there. She texted screenshots to our group chat and a few people there immediately started chatting shit on my bf and talking about how I should dump him etc. I tried to explain why be did what he did and how he's sorry, he didn't mean it, that's not who he is any more, so on and so forth. Some of my friends understood but others just weren't having it. \n\nThis has caused something of a rift in my friend group. On the one side, there's the friends who think I need to dump him who are accusing me of internalised homophobia, of not actually caring about gay rights and of valuing \"getting some dick\" over actually doing the right thing. On the other side (the minority) there are the friends who agree with me that this behaviour was clearly just a manifestation of the abuse my boyfriend was facing at home and came out of fear and self loathing rather than from a place of genuine hatred and malice, and that he deserves to be forgiven. He's kinda stuck in the middle of it all and he feels terrible all over again for the things he said. \n\nSo my question is, did I do the wrong thing by defending him and in turn tearing up my friend group?

      "description": "AITA for ending this friendship?\n\nI've known this person since the first grade (I'm currently in my junior year of high school). Ever since we were little shes had little respect for all types of boundaries. This includes telling random people all of your deepest and most personal secrets, no respect for personal space, and an array of other social norms. In middle school she used to literally beat the shit out of me, and say she was just being 'playful' (Don't get me wrong she wasn't this big beefy 13 year old girl that could just destroy anyone in her path, but I was malnourished and really small during this period. I think I was around 90 pounds back then and she was like 150 or something so of course she was gonna be able to shove me around). It got so severe that several teachers confronted me about her after classes. You get the point, shes doesn't have boundaries. Since elementary school I've known that shes a bit toxic, but I have a hard time with confrontation and saying 'no' to people so despite my best judgement I've remained friends with her for the majority of my life. Over that period we got *really* close despite my opinions of her. \n\nNow here's the straw that broke the camels back: (Trigger warning  about mental health stuff, sexual abuse, and self harm) I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember. Obviously I regret it now, but I used to confide in her about it. My dad is an alcoholic, and she was the only person I ever told. I was molested when I was 11 and she was literally the only person that knew about it. She was the first to see my self harm wounds (By the way, I've been off self harm for about two years now, we all good), and the only person I ever confided about that to. Despite knowing this stuff and how it affected me, she always poked fun about all of it (Usually not in front of people until a certain point), she make 'daddy issues' and emo jokes about me all the time. I tried to laugh it off, but since she was the only person I had ever told about any of it, it really made me feel like it was unimportant and something to be ashamed of. One of the worst things shes done was jokingly make sexual advances towards people, almost all of our other common friends have experiences of her creeping on them. I was always around her a lot because we've had the same honors classes throughout middle school, which guaranteed that we would have almost identical schedules. So I tended to experience the creeping on a regular bases, and since I had experiences with sexual abuse previously it made me seriously uncomfortable. \n\nSo one night my phone just starts blowing up with people asking me if I was okay and shit. There were a couple of numbers I didn't even recognize. She had told some people about almost all of my trauma. From there it just spread like wildfire. So now my entire friend group and people that I dont even know, are experts about my life story, which I myself had told only one person about. Despite the fact that I had been doing well, not depressed, not cutting myself or anything for several years, I'm now known as some kind of psycho-bitch, self destroying, maniac. I never told my parents about any of it either and I was afraid to, so I just went to school like normal so they we're suspicious of me or think I'm depressed or anything (not that it did any good). So I get on the bus and once I showed to school the majority of my friends are swarmed around my locker wearing crisis mode expressions on their faces. They tell me that person heard it from what's-her-face, who heard it from my now ex-friend*.* Who I assumed painted me as currently suicidal. I blocked ex-friend on almost everything and I called my parents to pick me up a few periods into the day before I had to see her. I don't show up the next day.\n\nSomeone tells the guidance counselor that I'm apparently suicidal and the guidance counselor calls my parents. \n\nThey want to put me in therapy now.\n\nI haven't been to school in a while now, ex friend has caught onto the fact that our friendship is over due to my vague and indirect snapchats. My friends tell me she shows up to school crying the next day, say I was being unreasonable, and that it wasn't a big deal because she only told one person that I was friends with and who wouldn't judge me. They say she wants to talk to me, but honestly I don't know if I ever want to see her again. At the same time I don't like knowing that I made her cry, and I don't know if I could say no to her if she apologized to me. I feel kind of guilty because I think in her own way she was trying to help me or get people to support me, I guess. I just hate that she did it in that way. It's my own decision if I want to tell people, right? Like, I'm not sure why she thought telling people all my personal shit was just gonna go over smoothly. I just don't wanna make anyone feel bad. Was I being unreasonable by just ending the friendship rather than talking to her? AITA?",

      "description": "(Throwaway) I’m 19f, my sister is 24. Long story short, my sister’s boyfriend (23?) tricked my parents into letting him move in with us (he chose to run away from home but said he was homeless). He never introduced himself to me so we just ignored eachother for 7 months. My sister was so focused on him and work that we only had time to talk during dinner/online. Eventually I tried to be friends with her boyfriend, but he’d be passive aggressive towards me and basically told me to fuck off. His exact words: “Are you never going to be out of our (he and my sister’s) lives?” I just kept a very far distance from both of them afterwards. My sister asked why, I told her what he said, and her response was “he just says stuff like that sometimes.” He continued saying “stuff like that” on family trips or just whenever we were in the same room so I ended up in arguments with him, and by proxy, my sister, since she always came to his defense. It got so hostile and tense that I straight up told them I didn’t want to keep in contact with either of them when they moved out. They “apologized” after moving out. Didn’t really say sorry or anything, just that “there was a miscommunication”. After they moved out I was civil with them (for my parents’ sake) when they visited and things were going smooth as long as we made plans when her boyfriend was working. Recently though, I think I fucked up. I found my record player damaged in the room they shared, and I didn’t even know they’d been borrowing it. To rub salt in the wound my sister bought her boyfriend a record player in front of me on Black Friday. She also got three big packages sent to our house and turns out she’d ordered a pricy sewing machine for her boyfriend as well as a bunch of other stuff for him. It honestly pissed me off not only because they broke my shit, but because she’s never been a gift-giver, like not even with my parents who are super supportive and accommodating to her. I know this sounds extremely immature, but I impulsively un-added/softblocked her on every social media. I know you’re probably thinking “okay, so you’re mad because she bought her boyfriend some stuff?”, but it’s not about the actual gifts. I just feel like I’m putting in a lot of effort to maintain my relationship with my sister and she just is not. I don’t know if I’m overreacting by basically blocking her on everything and avoiding her?",

Unfortunately he lives with me and my lease is not up for a few months, so I am basically stuck with him until then.  It's been a rocky few months, to say the least.  Anyway, I currently pay his cell phone bill because it's on my account.  I have put in a request to have it transferred to him (so he can pay his own damn cell phone bill) but so far nothing.  So fast forward to today.  I get home from work, and he tells me he put a lock screen on his phone, forgot the code, and now can't get into his phone.  He demands I \"fix it.\"  Like, dude, I can't?  Why would you think I could?  So now he's pissed off because he can't use his phone.  After stomping around and slamming doors, he asked to use my laptop.  No, dude, just, no.  He demands to know why he can't use it.  I tell him I don't have to give him a reason, it's my computer.  Well that really sets him off and he continues stomping and slamming doors and now calling my every name in the book.  Then threatens that maybe it will just get destroyed or disappear while I am at work.  Like yeah, now that you've threatened to trash my personal property, I'm definitely not letting you use it.

      "description": "Okay so as we’re getting ready to go to bed. Brushing our teeth and the preparing for bed routine, we were having some conversation. She was telling me about her day and I realized she was being pretty loud. Mind you, it’s about 2:30AM, we live in an apartment and the walls are paper thin. When I’m taking a leak, I sometimes hear my neighbors talking or something. I’m always pretty conscious about being noisy neighbors because it’s a pretty big dick move to have no awareness of the people around you. \n\nSo while telling her story she paused for a second, I politely asked her if she wouldn’t mind lowering her voice a little bit. I mean I’m right next to her and there was no need for yelling anyways. I feel like I was pretty polite about it. Apparently not. She freaked out and now wants to argue with me that I’m trying to shush her and she “wants to be her own person.” \n\nSo after a little arguement I figured we both needed to take 5 and cool down. I browsed reddit for 10 minutes and went back in to try and talk to her. She told me it’s a big pet peeve of hers when people tell her to shush. \n\nWe’ve been together for almost 3 years now and she does get excited occasionally and can raise her voice out of excitement. 9x out of 10, I let it ride because it doesn’t matter anyways. But out of respect for my neighbors and the fact that there really is no need to be loud, I felt that it wasn’t that big of a deal. \n\nIdk maybe IATA? I’m trying to see it from her perspective but I just can’t rationalize that my request wasn’t a fair one. ",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm almost 50, been married for almost 20 years. My wife is 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think we came together all those years ago as two lonely people, afraid we'd never find anyone else. I married her, completely unsure about it, because I was afraid I'd be alone forever, and determined to \"make it work\". In hindsight, my heart wasn't in it, and I felt trapped. She says I'm the best thing to ever happen to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't say it was all bad times, but fast forward 15 years and two kids later, I fell into a terrible depression, with suicidal thoughts. My wife knew nothing about this until I got help. I started therapy with a psychologist, who helped me learn to cooperate with my emotions instead of fighting them, to slowly learn to be aware of what I like and don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich leads me to today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like being with my wife. When she touches me, I feel hollow inside, trapped. It's been like that for a long time, but I've also had an overwhelming tsunami of abject pitch black terror at the thought of the marriage ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe past week or so, though, something has changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is new is this: amongst my group of friends is an attractive, smart woman of about 40. We've been growing as friends for a while, but about two weeks or so, I saw a spark in her eyes that maybe, just maybe, she might feel something more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've met a few times since then (once just the two of us), and chat a lot online. The vibe is still there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was like a wall came crashing down inside me. If such a thing was even possible - if someone as attractive and smart as her could even allow a hint of that kind of feeling - then maybe a post-marriage existence could be a happy one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly the tsunami of terror is gone. Ending the marriage is still a fearful thing, but not completely unthinkable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now, for the past week or so, when my wife wants to touch me, or wants me to hold her, I no longer do what I did before - I don't just hold her and silently bear the emptiness inside. Instead, I flinch, or pull away, or say no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is devastated. She asks why I changed so suddenly, and how long it will be before I can go back to what I was like before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't want to go back. I hated it. I also don't want to kill a 20 year marriage over a passing crush, or a temporary angry phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept I can't see it being temporary. The change seems sudden to her, but all that's happening is that I'm not hiding how I feel any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Everything inside me is a jumbled mess of conflicting feelings now.",

      "description": "We all know porn can mislead men (And women I suppose) into thinking women are so into everything. Anyone with eyeballs can see that the woman is definitely NOT into all of it. Yes they are acting but it is extremely hard to ignore the expressions of pain, unless you choose to ignore it. Anyways there seems to be a style of porn where men are overly aggressive and choose to grab women's hair and use it as leverage.\nWe had been going at it for a good ten minutes already and upon switching it up he grabbed my hair, which he has never done before. \n In my instance my neck cocked in an extremely awkward way and it was hard to make a sound. I have very long hair and he grabbed all the way up by my head twisting my head back. The sounds \nI was making were me trying to say stop but it just sounded like gags.\nThis went on for like 2 minutes. Eventually he loosened his grip and I immediately snapped around and pushed him way the f off me. I was disgusted. I felt violated in the sense that to me, in my opinion, there is ZERO chance he thought I was enjoying it. But he says he thought I was. He didn't get why I would react like that. And it turned into me \"not communicating properly\" and therefore \"rejecting\" him. It hurt his feelings that I didn't want to continue. So ladies, AITA? Men, AITA? ",

      "description": "On mobile, etc.\n\nI (29/F, work in the veterinary field) moved back in with my family, on my mother's insistence, a year ago when I was getting divorced, to finish school. I have since graduated, become licensed in my field, and gotten a good job. I'm working on moving out.\n\nAt the end of the summer my mom, who couldn't find a job after she broke a contract job, finally got a part time job. She also adopted an 8 month old dog without discussing it with anyone in the house, my dad, brother, me. It had 0 manners. She insisted she would train it. Guess what hasn't happened, no training, no socialization. So then she finally gets her shit together like 1.5 months ago to take it to doggy manners school. But it's never been around dogs, so it can't focus, and so she pulls it out of school. They offered her private classes. I encouraged socialization and private lessons. Shocker, it still has no manners. She hasn't been working with it at home, in fact she gets my dad and brother to take care of it more than she does. I've basically refused to interact with it since she got it, because it's annoying to me, and I just avoid it as much as possible. Anytime I am upstairs it licks my legs and toes, even if I tell it to stop (but if I kennel it I'm an asshole), begs for food, has tried to get my food, and overall is constantly underfoot.\n\nI was calling it a mooch today while I was making a sandwich and it was begging and messing with me. She yelled at me because \"no animals are perfect\" and I just needed to lay off the criticism of the dog. I stated back calmly that it still needed to be taught manners, and that it was annoying to be around because of the lack of them. Now she's just mad at me, which is whatever, but honestly I get in trouble for never leaving my room as it is, but then stuff like this happens where I don't want to be upstairs anyway.\n\nTl;dr My mom's untrained dog annoys the shit out of me, and I don't want to be around it, and she gets mad when I get annoyed at it.

      "description": "Boyfriend and his ex remained friends after breaking up, even though they haven't  really talked ever since we started dating, which is about a year. For  some reason, in the past week or two, their friendship seemed to have  resurfaced. They've been going out for coffee several times a week and  seem to suddenly talk about everything - including her and my  boyfriend's (which obviously includes mine) sex life. They also text  sometimes, about random stuff.\n\nAnyways, I  should include that one of my male friends, who my boyfriend doesn't  like, made some inappropriate comments about me. I didn't really care,  since to me, they were pretty obviously jokes. My boyfriend was really  bothered by that, so me and my male friend now hang out way less than we  used to. We also don't text anymore, nothing beyond an occasional meme  or video.\n\nThe ex of his is the only  girlfriend he said to actually have nice memories of. He also lost his  virginity to her and he considers her the most serious relationship he's  had (before me, supposedly). Also, every time I ask him about pretty  much any good experiences he's had in the past, nearly always, she comes  up. I don't think he realizes it, but he also compares me to her -  example - I refuse to not use condoms and then he tells me they used the  pull-out method and she didn't mind and everything turned out fine. He  says he no longer has any feelings for her and that their relationship  is completely platonic. Worth mentioning, he did lie to me once before  about a pretty big deal. He wouldn't have ever told me the truth if I  didn't find out from someone else. He also cheated on one an ex of his,  not the one this post is about, though.\n\nI  met her today, since I asked him to and he thought it's a good idea. It was pretty awkward. I was quiet most of the time,  while they managed to get in an inside joke or two that I didn't get. I  was uncomfortable pretty much the entire time. When I asked him why he  suddenly got the need to \"befriend\" her again, he kept telling me about  what a cool person she is, about how much they have to talk about etc.  etc.\n\nI'm really bothered by their new  friendship, especially because it seems to have appeared out of nowhere.  After he was uncomfortable because of my male friend, I nearly  immediately set new boundaries, which he flat-out refuses to do. Also, even after telling him how bothered I am by him letting her know about our issues (mostly sexual/relationship stuff), he keeps texting her about it. When I confronted him about it, he said she has similar issues and that he was looking for advice. As I am typing this, he's letting her know what's happening.\n\nAm I the asshole here for wanting him to just not be friends with his ex / not wanting her to know about my personal issues, which he shares with her even after I ask him not to?",

      "description": "Okay, so for context I (18F) live with my parents and our 1 year old dog. Mom is usually the one who takes the dog out before sleep since I am afraid of the dark and dad is not that invested in the dog. \n\nThis, combined with the fact that she gets up early in the mornings, makes mom tired. So often she takes a nap before she takes the dog out. She likes sleeping on the couch (she says the TV is relaxing), instead of in her bedroom (who also has a TV). The problem is I likely have misophonia - a condition when specific sounds trigger negative emotions and thoughts. My trigger is snoring and guess what - mom snores, really loudly. It triggers emotions like sadness, frustration and anger, sometimes I just want to hit something when I hear the sound. So to keep her from snoring I keep her awake by pushing her with the foot so that she never really falls asleep, we can keep going like that for an hour - me pushing her til she stops snoring, while she still is half asleep.\n\nShe knows about my sensitivity against snoring but she doesn’t take it seriously. She also knows that I will  keep her awake unless she sleeps in her bedroom, but she still insists on sleeping on the couch. It is driving me crazy and I really try to block out the sound but it doesn’t always work. I feel guilty for waking her up, but I also feel like she should respect my intense feelings toward snoring, and sleep in her bedroom so I can more easily block out the sound. AITA?  ",

      "description": "So basically, my brother is 5 years older than me but a year below me in uni. My brother has been dealing with mental illness for most of his life, he has pretty bad anxiety, depression, and ADD and barely scraped out of HS with decent marks. He was in uni for a half a year before he tried to commit suicide, and after that he pulled himself out of school to focus on his mental health. This went on for years, and in this time he was really dedicated to battling depression and trying to become the best person he could be. I was fucking proud of him. \n\nFast forward to September, he's a 24 year-old freshman going into a Com Sci program at our local university, and I was going into my second year of Software Engineering. He said he felt really nervous being back in school and relied on me for support, and I gave it to him to the best of my ability. He found a girl in his program who he liked, some cute, fresh faced 17 year old Korean girl. They dated after talking for a while and he seemed happy, but I was grossed out that my 24 year old grownass brother was dating a teenager. I held my tongue though because this was the happiest I had seen him in years, but I wasn't happy about it.\n\nSo now, on Sunday she decided to break up with him because she said felt more comfortable with guys her own age and that he should move on. The motherfucker hasn't left his room in 3 days and has reverted to the same self sorry sack of shit he was before his therapy. His fucking wailing has been preventing me from studying for my midterms, and I went to his room to tell him to get over it. He continued to wail saying shit like \"I'm fucking worthless!\" and \"I'm gonna kill myself!\". I was so frustrated at him that I yelled this to him word for word \"SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU WORTHLESS SHIT AND DO IT FAGGOT, NO ONE FEELS BAD FOR YOU!!!\". I had enough of his self pity and I was angry at the fact that this guy basically wasted thousands of dollars of therapy money over some girl he knew for a couple months. \n\nThis was the first time I actually yelled at him and he took it to heart. He looked shocked and I quickly made sure to make myself scarce. It's been several hours now and he hasn't made a single noise from his room. He's locked the door and won't respond to my numerous apologies that I've said. AITA reddit?",

      "description": "So I was brought up in a pretty conservative Pakistani household and had Islam burnt into my mind throughout my childhood and teenage years (praying five times a day, reading the quran, going to the mosque every week, fasting during ramadan). I was utterly devoted to the religion to the point where I voluntarily memorized about half the quran (it’s a pretty huge book). \n\nAfter starting college 3 years ago and learning more about evolution and scientific theory in general, I stopped being able to reconcile science with religion. I chose to believe in science because it actually offered evidence for the ideas it promoted. I haven’t prayed or read the quran for almost 3 years but I’ve been pretending to still be Muslim in front of my parents and relatives. Most of my friends know I’m an atheist and they’re pretty chill about it. \n\nI recently went on a trip with my dad for a few days and he asked me if I still prayed. Because he’s always been the more open-minded of my parents, I decided to take a chance and tell him part of the truth (that I had doubts about religion and that I didn’t really pray anymore). He promised not to tell my mother and seemed to be have taken it well during the trip. \n\nWell, imagine my surprise when I found both my parents crying after I got back from work the next week. He’d not only told my mom what I confided in him, but was now demanding that I go talk with a mufti to “clear my doubts”. My mom kept saying “you’re gonna lose your entire family if you don’t come back to Islam”. I told them I have nothing against other Muslims but I personally just can’t believe in religion anymore. When they realized I was being serious about this, they told me if they died, it would be my fault. My dad said “if Islam didn’t prohibit it, I might’ve already killed myself because of this”. \n\nMy parents have always supported me, financially and emotionally. They brought me up with love and made sure I never wanted for anything. I’ve always loved and respected them and tried to be a good son. Now they say that I’ve destroyed my life and theirs by not believing in God anymore and made their lives meaningless. They think that I should follow the religion if only to repay their kindness and love. \n\nI feel very guilty about my part in all this. Obviously, I should never have told them about my beliefs and just kept pretending. But now the cat’s out of the bag and I’ve messed everything up. If I’m the asshole in this scenario, I’ll try to go back to praying daily and reading the quran, but is it really that bad of me to wish my parents loved me unconditionally?",

I brought most of the living room furniture, except for one chair, into the home.

I have an aversion to dog hair and their smell, and I absolutely do not want them on my furniture.  She’s lived with us before—and at the time my furniture was in storage so it wasn’t an issue then—but I do remember her not keeping up with their shedding and fur was everywhere, including on dishes and counters and it grossed me out.  He did tell her they were not welcome on my furniture and her response was that she would cover with blankets.  I have a dual recliner, so I have a “spot” where I sit, and blanket or not, I don’t want dogs there.  There will still be fur in me and I will still smell dog.  Also, that’s just not good enough.

She’s from China so I’m not 100% sure she understood me but she said okay. And I leave class after I turn it in. I go to the top University in Florida, and I know the consequences will be severe. I feel like shit because he’s a kid just like me just trying to do well but at the same time so am I. ",

      "description": "This is a Throwaway account\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating since we were teenagers, and we recently turned 21.\n\nThe subject I’m majoring in as a senior in college has a national convention in Las Vegas, and going to it would be an amazing opportunity to meet and mingle with people in my field and maybe find career opportunities. If I can afford to go, it seems crazy for me not to!\n\nThe focus of the trip would be business and the convention, but obviously we would have a bit of downtime and it’s possible that we would go to a club or gamble in the casino, that sort of thing. Obviously I’d like to try that because we’re in Vegas after all! It’s also possible that in an effort to save money, I might share a room with some of my friends from school, and a couple of them are guys.\n\nI mentioned the trip to my boyfriend recently and while he didn’t protest, he seemed a little hurt. We’ve been together for a while, and when we were teens we obviously had some spurts of jealousy, but over the years we really got good at communicating with each other and trusting each other. Sometimes we get a little jealous or moody here and there when one of us goes out or does something, but it’s really not that big a deal.\n\nThe thing is, I don’t really want to go with my boyfriend on this trip. I feel like if he was around, I wouldn’t take some steps to meet people or do things because my mind will be sort of preoccupied with how he’s doing. He wouldn’t come to the actual convention, but still. \n\nI know he wouldn’t mind wandering around and doing his own thing in the hotels or casinos while I’m doing the stuff I came there to do, but I’d rather not have to be preoccupied thinking of how he’s doing while I’m trying to mingle and get in touch with my professional self. I think it would just change the whole dynamic.\n\nHe’s been to Vegas before with his family, but he was a teenager at the time, and since we turned 21 recently this trip is filled with a lot more possible things to do, and a lot of first experiences for both of us.\n\nAm I the asshole for not inviting him to come with me/get our own room?",

They have this habit of making complex webs of lies to maneuver around divulging their sexual orientation, which I completely understand given their family situation and (as I have told them multiple times) I will do my best to support them when they does choose to come out. I've told them that trying to manipulate others through lying is probably not good in the long term, but they have a right to live their life how they see fit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for a few months now, and are currently doing the long distance thing because she lives in another city. She's coming over to visit this weekend for valentine's, and I wanted her to meet my friends (including the aforementioned friend). When I told my friend I wanted them to meet my GF though, they instantly said he wanted to tell her that they and a mutual close opposite sex (relative to the closeted friend) friend of ours (which my GF would meet at the same time) are dating, and pretend they are a conventional hetero couple. I (as well as the mutual friend) was pretty taken aback, and told them I didn't want to do that because why would we discuss their sexuality and if we did, who would my GF tell? They're paranoid their mom would somehow find out and they want to eliminate the risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my friend I wouldn't lie to my GF (I love this woman), and we wouldn't talk about anything they aren't comfortable with. They later sent me a text apologizing for asking me to lie, and I accepted the apology. However, I'm still a bit pissed because they are not sorry about the lies, but about asking me to lie. I'm finding it harder to trust my friend in general to be honest, seeing how quickly they jump to lying. Am I overreacting here?",

      "description": "Let me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?",

The ex pretended to be impregnated by her ex. BF broke up with her and on the same day kissed TF and they started dating. I don't like BF because he previously outed me when I was going through some stuff, TF knows this.\n\nWhen BF and TF started dating I expressed concerns that they were dating so soon after BF broke up and TF just told me that she's been single for a year and isn't giving up this chance. That worried me.\n\nLast year my other friend got into a toxic relationship and I'm worried that the same might be happening with TF. I tried to support her but then I heard her say that she loved BF even though they've only been dating for a week. I kept trying to talk to her about it but she said that no one really cares and that saying love isn't a big deal.\n\nI expressed my concerns to another friend and she agreed with me when we were alone but took TF's side when around TF. I want to be supportive of my friend but I'm worried that BF is going to make TF do something she doesn't want to and that she'll go along with it because she doesn't want to be single.

      "description": "This scenario isn't as nearly as dramatic as a lot of others I've read, but I can't stop thinking about it and feeling guilty.\n\nBack info:\n\nFirst of all, I'm 23 and still live at home- don't judge please, it's not unusual here in Germany since our education system is a little different and a lot of us including me still go to job training at that age, which, in my case, doesn't pay you any money, so I can't afford my own place yet and my parents often times said they love having me around and don't even really want me to move out yet. For real, I would actually LOVE to have my own place and I'm saving up for it. Not sure if that's too important to the story, I just want you to know that I didn't act like this because I'm \"going through puberty and my hormones are going crazy and mothers and daughters always argue at that age\". Sadly I can't use the hormones excuse anymore lol.\n\nThis is where the story begins:\n\nTwo days ago, my mom and I went grocery shopping together; no big deal for others, but for us, it's kind of a mother-daughter-bonding thing, where we talk about anything and everything and I just love it. After we had everything we needed, she asked me if we should go to my favourite shopping center.\n\nShe had actually had other plans on this day, so it was really sweet of her to offer it and I sincerely appreciated it. When we were there, I saw some watches in the store we were in. I don't own a phone anymore and thought it would be a good idea to buy one of them. I picked one, my mom saw it and looked at me like I was crazy. In case anyone is wondering, I was gonna pay for it and my mom knew that too, I wasn't asking or expecting her to buy it for me, but she just started ranting about how ugly that watch was and asked if I was actually serious and told me to put it back. My mom is a great person and she's always there for me, but when I wear or buy something she doesn't like, she and my dad both get extremely obnoxious and judgmental and scornful about it, sometimes I feel like they're laughing at me, and it has always made me feel terrible about myself.\n\nSo even though my mom took some time out of her day to take her adult daughter to the shopping center, and even though she clearly did this to spend time with me, I snapped at her with an equally condescending tone while starting to walk away from her: \"You really could have said this in a different way.\" She walked after me and apologized, but I was still angry because this has been building up inside of me for a while, so I yet again snapped: \"You ALWAYS do this. ALWAYS. You and dad make fun of me for everything that I like and it makes me feel like shit.\"\n\nShe said \"You know we don't mean it like that, we didn't want to hurt you\", and I responded \"No, I really don't. I don't care how you mean it, all I know is that it feels god awful to me and it hurts like hell every single time. You ruin everything that I like, there are so many things that I used to love that I can't wear anymore because I know you'll ridicule me for it.\" I walked away from her without looking back.\n\nWhat I said may have been an exaggeration because it doesn't really happen that often; it's just that it leaves an impact every time it happens. My parents' opinion of me really, REALLY matters to me even as an adult, so seeing them judge me the way my bullies used to really hurts. I don't know, I have pretty thin skin in general, something that I should probably work on.\n\nShe got really quiet after I said this and stopped walking after me and I could tell she felt terrible. Needless to say, our shopping trip was cut short; we wordlessly left the store and got back into the car. After a long silence, she started to talk and tried to justify her talking to me like this as \"I understand you're upset, but I just want to give you feedback, how else am I supposed to do that?\"\n\nI yet again snapped: \"Just tell me that you don't like it, but that I'm free to wear it, that's literally all you have to say.\" After that, we were silent again. At home, she tried to make light of the situation and said \"Tomorrow you'll be thankful about me preventing you from buying that watch\", but I wasn't having it and said \"I may not be angry anymore by tomorrow, but I sure as hell won't be thankful for it\", then I disappeared into my room.\n\nAbout half an hour later my mom came into my room and gave me a speech about how she's sorry and that she's only like this because she sometimes forgets that I'm a young woman now and not her little girl anymore and that I can make my own decisions, and she also said she feels awful for making me feel this way and that hurting someone you love is a terrible feeling. Usually my mom never apologizes like this, so I could tell this truly must have been a big thing to her. It made me cry and we hugged and made up, so this should have been the end of it, but I just can't stop thinking about the fact that I made my wonderful mom feel so bad about herself, and that I made this whole thing that is so special to me so awkward. I legit want to cry when I think about all of this, but since she already apologized and the whole thing is resolved, I don't know what I can do to fix it, or if there's even a need for me to fix anything, because I don't know if I was the asshole in this situation or if my reaction was understandable...\n",

I work in a somewhat big company, started as an intern and later got a job as a costs analyst. Overall, I’ve been working there for a year and a half (9 months as intern, 9 as employee). I love to work in this company, being a family business, I was able to develop a bunch of indicators and fill almost every department with information, mainly by extracting and working with data from our system and some paper reports. This was due to an expertise in Microsoft Excel developed over the course of my internship and work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem, however, lies in the company owner. Turns out, he doesn’t give a shit about information, and values much more an operational employee. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe’ve been in a crisis for a few months now (the whole country is, by the way), and we had a lot of layoffs the past month. My boss and I have been accumulating new tasks almost every day due to that, so I am staying late almost every day. Turn out I’m now working for three people right now, and it is starting to really (I mean really) discourage me. To make things worse, the owner pointed at me during a meeting a few days ago and said “you were almost fired a few days ago”. It really pissed me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cannot stress enough how I am proud of my realizations at the job, and how dependent the company is of the database and information I am developing (the board recognizes it, but the president doesn’t). I also learned a lot from my boss and coworkers, and love to spend the day with them, but I’m feeling more tired every day, to the point of having some mild insomnia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust to wrap things up, a former boss, who left the company due to disagreements with the board, contacted me with a job offer. It is not certain that I would get it, but the odds favor me.

      "description": "LTL;FTP\n\nI (21F) have been dating my partner (21M) for 3 years now and though we've had some rocky times, things have mostly been good. When we first met, he was in a relationship with a FWB-turned-girlfriend Kate (not her real name). Their relationship ended because she cheated but he doesn't hold it against her, and they still seem to be rather close. He has described Kate to me as his friend and \"like a sister\", and sometimes mentions he's talking to her, or calling her, and brings things they're talking about up in our conversations. He has shown me screenshots of their little conversations that he finds funny, shared things with me he then tells me he has to show Kate too because it makes him think of her, and has compared things I've said to what she's said (e.g. Kate asks for/does X too). He has never mentioned me or our relationship to her as they apparently have an agreement to not \"rub new partners in each others faces\", which ultimately I'm okay with, but he has also told me that she's expressed interest in things \"returning to how they used to be\", which he told me he rejected. \n\nI have expressed discomfort in their ongoing friendship, particularly after he told me she was interested in rekindling their relationship but he insists it's completely platonic and he doesn't think of her in a sexual way. However, he has also called her beautiful on multiple occasions and talked in passing detail about their sex life - including breast size, and  bedroom complications brought about by her height though he also brought up other exes in this conversation (they don't bother me as they're no longer in the picture). In an argument in which I brought up my insecurities regarding Kate, he told me he \"fucked her like a whore\" and so I shouldn't compare our relationship with theirs. Despite this, I do believe he is no longer interested in a relationship with her due to how theirs ended, and he is thoroughly invested in our relationship but Kate still rubs me the wrong way.\n\nAs I am not very experienced it terms of relationships, I chalked my dislike of Kate up to me being insecure and jealous and dropped the topic. When he'd infrequently bring Kate up, I'd attempt to steer the conversation away or withdraw from the conversation which usually worked and things would carry on as usual. He seems to have picked up on my dislike of Kate because he mentions her less frequently nowadays, though I know they are still in contact which I can live with. However, the issue was brought to the front of my mind again recently. He deleted his account on a messaging app a while ago we used to use before we started using a different app, but recently reopened a new account and added Kate and two or three other people, telling me it was because he'd have no contact with Kate if he lost his phone and she needed him. He didn't even think about adding me until I pointed out that I didn't even realise he had made a new account, though we do have contact through another app as I said. In hindsight it seems juvenile because \"OMG he didn't send me a friend request\", but I was undeniably hurt that I wasn't even a thought in his mind when he made that account almost exclusively to talk to her.   \n\n\nSorry for the rambling but AITA for being uncomfortable with this other girl?   \n\n\n**TLDR:** My partner has an ex-girlfriend/FWB he's still in contact with and very close to but he insist it's platonic and she's like his sister. She has expressed an interest in repairing their relationship before and that, among other things, have made me uncomfortable with their friendship. ",

      "description": "Long story, TL;DR at bottom. \n\nBackground:\nMy parents split-up when I was 7, my mom remarried when I was 12 and my childhood was been spent on an every other weekend visitation schedule with my father until I was a teenager and could decide when I wanted to go. \n\nMy father has no job, no car, and struggles with mental-illness and drug abuse. When it was time for college, I moved to a city about an hour away and would only come home a few days for school breaks, summer, and holidays. During this time the only contact I would have with my father is text messages, as he has no internet connection either. This continued on to my current life. I’m 24, work full time and am expecting my first child. Throughout my pregnancy so far my father has contact me through text message once or twice. \n\nIn an effort to try to have a better relationship with my father before my son is born, my husband and I have been driving to visit him when we have the same days off, which happens only once a month. Each time we’ve gone to visit, my father makes a big deal about my husband being there and how it gives him anxiety to have us in his apartment. To better accommodate his anxiety we’ve asked him to meet us for coffee or lunch and paid for everything since he has no job. This seemed to be going well until the last few times he ordered his food to go and asked us to take him home. I started worrying his strange behaviour was because of him not taking his medication (this has happened numerous times), or him being on drugs again. When we dropped him off I asked about it and he told me he was fine, so I dropped it. \n\nThis brings us to Christmas. On Christmas Day, my husband, sister and I all brought gifts to my dads apartment. The moment we walked into the house my dad said he needed to talk to me privately and angrily asked me why I confronted him the last time I was there. I told him that I didn’t want to talk about this, it’s Christmas and this is supposed to be a happy time. This understandably made me upset but we went back out to the living room and he opened his gifts and then said “This is awkward, can we do this another time?” \n\nI got extremely upset, started crying and left, but as I was leaving I did raise my voice at him and tell him he was an asshole for asking us to leave as he was the one who made things awkward, and I rarely get to see him. I also told him I wouldn’t be coming back. \n\nWhen we all got back to my parents house my sister was upset with me and told me I was being an asshole for ruining my fathers Christmas. I began to feel bad, so I texted him an apology but told him that what he said was extremely hurtful to me. I got no reply. \n\nI’ve discussed this at length with my husband, and have come to the decision that I will no longer be reaching out to my father, or trying to force a relationship with him because I don’t want my son to be hurt by him the way I have. My sister is extremely angry at me for doing this because I’m no longer accommodating my fathers mental health. AITA? \n\nTL;DR \nFather struggles with mental health and addiction. Has no way to contact me other than text messages. Makes minimal effort to maintain relationship with me (potentially because of mental illness), we get into a fight on Christmas, I decide to not let him have a relationship with my son. ",

I thought dates were really supposed to be only between you and your partner) and we went to see a movie. I went to a lot of her volleyball games, and only got so far as to kiss her cheek every now and then. Because I wanted to feel like I went on a \"real\" date with her, I asked her every weekend if she had any plans. She always said she did, and when I looked on Snapchat I saw pictures on her story of her hanging out with friends almost every weekend. Also when we would be on the bus together she would sit and talk with her friends and I would sit in a seat alone for the whole bus ride. This happened so many times and I even told her about this but she avoided answering me back. So really.

      "description": "Long story ahead. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI hail from a country and culture that is supremely family-centric, to the point where extended family often comprises most of your entire network. My own family (my parents, me, and sibling) moved to the United States when I was very young, so I've grown up in an environment largely at odds with that traditional culture. (As a result I think I know where Reddit will stand here, but it'd help to hear opinions either way). My entire extended family is still overseas.\n\nImportant detail: in the country I'm from, arranged marriage is the norm, and marriages are practical rather than love-based. Often your parents and extended family will search for a potential suitor, they'll vet them financially and whether they satisfy the criteria (for men it's whether he's got a good career and is educated and can support a family, for women it's whether she is pretty and can raise children in a morally/religiously \"right\" way. Archaic I know)\n\nI have a couple relatives (my father's brother, as well as his wife and son) that got entangled in some type of fraud case in the original country. I can't give too many details, but it boils down to an arranged-marriage version of catfishing: creating fake profiles and stories to attract people looking for an arranged marriage, and somehow scamming them out of quite a bit of money and ghosting them. \n\nWell, the uncle and cousin got busted for it, and they're in jail awaiting a trial. While they were in jail, the wife was hospitalized (for unrelated reasons) and, unfortunately, passed away. They did not get to spend time with her in person before her death. It's very sad.\n\nMy family lives in the US, and I moved out of my parents' house after graduating college and moved across the country to start my career. This stuff all went down shortly after I moved out. I talk to my parents on the phone every so often, and because I'm making money now, they often encourage me to donate to the needy (which I do, although I should do a lot more). \n\nWell, this time my parents told me to donate to the cousin and uncle instead. They aren't confident that they will obtain a fair trial in that country, and they cannot afford an attorney that isn't state-appointed (from what I'm told, unfamiliar with local laws, state-appointed attorneys suck there). \n\nI said I was not going to. Although no trial has occurred, from what I'm told about the event, they were indeed committing the crimes. My parents resorted to tell me that I should donate when people are needy, and how my cousin wasn't even let out of jail as his mother died. I responded saying that to me, needy people are poor people who are struggling due to various circumstances outside their control, not people who deliberately scammed others, knowing the consequences, and now likely face punishment in accordance with their actions. My parents kept pushing me until I made the mistake of saying, straight up, \"I'm not funding the defense of criminals\" - this rubbed my father (whose family I'm talking about) the wrong way, and understandably so. \n\nNow my parents are villifying me for not caring about my family in need when I have the resources to help. Maybe I said some things that were insensitive, but am I the asshole here? \n\nI know it's a very unfortunate course of events that they weren't able to see their family member before she passed away, and I wish the system in that country would have allowed them to at least meet with her, but they understood the consequences of their actions and did it anyway. I have no particular connection with these people other than blood, so to me, I can't be expected to help them with legal trouble they knowingly caused, and I certainly shouldn't be vilified for it.\n\nTLDR: cousin, aunt, and uncle in another country scammed people in a very formalized version of catfishing. Cousin and uncle got arrested, aunt died in the hospital while the others awaited trial. My parents want me to help contribute to pay for their legal defense, saying they are in need of charity. I said no.\n\nEdit: super late update for anybody that's still paying attention. My mom in general is very against her in-laws because of how badly they mistreat her and how much they take advantage of my dad, who is the only one in his extended family that makes a reasonable income yet is also totally spineless when his family is clearly taking advantage of him. My dad was sending money to help out, but his own family members began hijacking it and keeping some of it to themselves while it was in transit, so I was even more unwilling to contribute. Well me and my mom had a discussion later, once things settled down a little, and she agreed that I don't owe those people anything and that if they want to improve their situation, that should get a job and pay for it themselves.",

      "description": "I’ve been kind of in an odd place with my best friend of 6 years. I’ve been experiencing a serious downfall in mental health, and have been very lonely. My best friend hasn’t spoken to me in two years unless she’s upset or needs something from me. But she still likes to call us “best friends” and thinks it’s all the same between us. She hangs out a lot with people who she tells me she “doesn’t like” and tells me she doesn’t have time to meet me, call me, text me etc because she’s too busy with studies. Which I mean, I’m not jealous, I’m just trying to understand why she would lie to me. \n\n\nMade a post about it yesterday on AITA, and I realised that the details I gave were very improper and a lot of people misconstrued the situation and my relationship with her. Also, I phrased the post in a way that made it feel like my mental health was the reason I wanted her around, which is honestly what I thought it was about too. But on some more introspection, I’m realising that it’s about my relationship with her and how it’s failing. \n\nI’ve confronted her a couple of times, told her that I’m struggling with a bunch of things anyway, and I can’t handle being disappointed over and over. Told her that if she doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore, or if she just thinks I’m too much, I understand, but she needs to be honest with me about it. She denies it everytime, makes huge promises about how she set this alarm for 10PM everyday so she can call me daily, or that she will text me everyday. Even if I ask her not to make such huge promises that she knows she won’t follow through with, she does it anyway. And never follows through. \n\nI’m a little tired of it now. I had a huge breakdown recently and I was calling people around me desperately, because I was scared of being a danger to myself. I wouldn’t have told anyone that, but I just needed to talk to someone. I knew she wouldn’t pick up, and she didn’t. Later on, I told her what happened so I could ask if she could be a little more present  (20 minutes a month-ish, on her own schedule). She overpromsied again, and it’s been a week and I haven’t heard from her, at all. I understand that she has her exams, I do too. Which is why I don’t hold it against her. But I’m personally just exhausted of this routine. \n\nAITA for wanting to just cut her off slowly, instead of making it work or talking it through?",

      "description": "This happened a few months ago, and I am not sure about my actions here. I believe I was right in standing my ground, but friends have spoken against me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a big concert of a local group in a theater in my hometown, tickets were sold out weeks before the event and me and my girlfriend had to buy from re-sellers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, the tickets weren't numbered, so the seats would be grabbed on a first come, first served basis. We arrived \\~ 3 hours before doors opened and we queued up. There were already \\~50 persons ahead of us. More and more people started arriving, and the queue in front of us was \"fattening up\" with people who either arrived to \"greet\" friends and just stayed there, or straight up people who had a spot being saved for them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe finally got inside, behind possibly 100 people now, and headed for the front rows. The frontmost rows were already taken, but I saw 2 comfy spots next to a middle age couple in the \\~8th row. I go over to them and proceed to START sitting on them with my girlfriend when the couple informs me that both of those seats are being saved. Bummer. No issue however, in the middle of same row there are still around 7 free seats we could take. We apologize and move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out that there was one girl in her 20s next to those 7 free seats, and as soon as we are going to sit she says \"Sorry, those are taken\" To which I reply \"...all of them?\" \"Yup...\". I get more annoyed and start looking towards the rest of the rows of the theater and see a massive flow of people just sitting everywhere else. If we were to exit the row we pretty much would have to go all the way to the back by now, making all our time queuing outside a waste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt not only annoyed, but I also felt saving spots like this was a severe disrespect. There are people like me and my girlfriend who stood for hours outside, and a single person who may or may have not queued properly was not saving 7 spots for someone who had not arrived yet. So I stood my ground and sit down on the saved spots. The girl complained, and I explained my reasoning, with a very defensive and slightly upset tone. My girlfriend tensed up, and you could see she didn't like the ongoing conflict. Eventually an older lady (40s) arrived, possibly her mother, and upon hearing from the situation she confronted me, but I stood my ground again and when the lady raised her tone, so did I. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I am not sure if people from many rows away heard our little dispute, but I'm pretty sure it got loud enough for someone to focus and hear. The lady gave up and just sat down next to me, in possibly a passive aggressive attempt to get me to move. Didn't happen. Show started. The rest of the family arrived looking for their saved seats, almost half an hour after the show had started.  I even overheard one of them saying \"I hate when people save spots, but now I had to do it.\" Two of them had to go elsewhere, and that was the end of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend later told me she felt really uncomfortable, and was on the verge of simply getting up and leaving when I stood my ground. Another friend told me I need to control myself, and she WOULD have left there as soon as it all started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe I was right to stand my ground, it was pretty much an abuse to save 7 whole spaces, and we had been outside for hours... but AITA here?",

We're expected to work on these in our own free time aswell.\n\nThis has happened before and, when he set us to create a hip-hop track, I ended up just doing the work on my own because my partner didn't bother to come and work on it. I felt like a bit of an asshole for leaving them out but our time frame was strict and we didn't need to learn anything we hadn't covered so they didn't miss out on much other than experience.\n\nHowever, our new project differed significantly as we had to create a multitrack which we hadn't really done before. We also had a much larger time frame this time around (a week). \n\nMy partner just doesn't want to work with me though and so I ended up just recording it by myself today out of frustration. This meant they missed out on how to do the recording themselves which is essential to completing this A level and my teacher will not cover it. She's now very pissed off with me even though she doesn't really take this subject seriously anyway.\n\nSo here's to the main point, am I the asshole for potentially fucking up this girl's A level? \n\nShe did have the time to do the recording and she does spend her free time just smoking but I can't help but feel bad for doing it without her.\n\n",

He has a very deep voice and can be heard in every room of the house, even over the sound of a tv or music. He's usually shouting something pretty profane, too. He's really bad at communicating with people, trying to talk to him about it or asking him to keep it down will just result in him arguing or blatantly ignoring you. He'll only stop if his dad tells him to. It drives my mum and me up the wall.\n\nI'm the only one in the house with the admin log in for the internet, so one night when he was shouting while I was trying to sleep I set up a firewall just for his xbox and shut him off the internet for the night. Since then I've been doing it whenever his shouting is disturbing or annoying me or my mum. He has no idea that I'm doing this and has been complaining a lot recently about our unreliable internet. His dad doesn't know either but my mum does and will sometimes ask me to cut him off when he's annoying her.\n\nI feel bad for lying to him and stopping him from doing what he enjoys but it was getting to the point where we were starting to really hate him and no one was able to relax. His dad refused to deal with it beyond yelling at him at the time to shut up. This is the only solution I could come up with. \n\nAm I the asshole for doing this? ",

I gained A LOT of weight in the past few years after an assault my freshman year of college and subsequent deep depression that I haven't completely gotten over yet. I was raised by a single mom who worked long hours to support me and my siblings and who always loved and supported me. She still does, but the last time I was home for an extended period of time after a fifty pound weight gain following hospital stay and a bunch of med changes, my confidence and sense of self-worth was completely destroyed by her fixation on my body. She told me I no one would ever hire me looking the way I do, any guy would be embarrassed to be seen with me, and that I'm destroying my life. She would print out info about new diets and hand them out to me while I was eating dinner to make me feel bad. One day I just snapped and told her I had enough. We got into a huge fight and I have barely spoken since. Lately I've been getting a lot of pressure from other family members to reconcile. The thing is I still don't want to see her. After losing 15 lbs, I'm back at my highest weight ever and I don't feel like I can face her because of what she'll say. When I tried to get her to back off, she would for a few days but then come back with a vengeance because \"it's her job as a mother,\" and \"she's only saying what everyone else is thinking.\" People keep reminding me of all the sacrifices she has made for me and that she is a good mother besides this issue, but I just can't separate that from the bullying.

      "description": "My parents have been married for almost 27 years and I’m their only child together. Before they got married, my dad had another daughter from a previous marriage. My half sister has always been rude to my mom even though my mom has been nothing but kind to her since they met. \n\nWe would visit her twice a year and each time she would say how my parents marriage was stupid and how awful my mom was. When she was getting married, she refused any help from my mom and wouldn’t let my dad walk her down the aisle—just being overall rude and disrespectful to my parents during what is supposed to be an exciting time. \n\nOverall she is the type of person I’m not much a fan of because she’s dependent on others, needy, a tad mental unstable, and clingy. I think this is because her mom raised her as a helicopter parent in a very anti-my-mom environment. She also constantly talks trash about my ultra-kind mother who has been nothing but nice. When she saw the “ABC College Dad” sticker on my dad’s car, she cried because he didn’t have one for the school she went to (she’s been in school for 9 years and still had 3ish years to go to finish her bachelors).\n\nWhen we would visit her, I would always dread the trip because I couldn’t stand her. I don’t like people who are rude and don’t show kindness to the people nearest to me.  \n\nIn the last two months, she has been trying to reach out to me to “rebuild our relationship” even though we’ve never been close. I have told her I don’t want to be around her until she can treat my parents marriage and my mother with respect, which isn’t asking very much. She leaves a constant stream of Facebook messages but since I put 0 weight in Facebook, I don’t care. I care about people’s actions. \n\nTo the AITA part, am I awful for not wanting to be close with her? She’s done nothing but trash talk my mom and her marriage for the past 22 years, maybe longer but that’s how long I’ve been around for it. I’m all for people changing but who she is as a person is someone I fundamentally dislike. I don’t like people who are clingy, catty, needy, and rude. We grew up in extremely different environments, mine being one that focused on being independent, having an education, and being nice to others and hers where it seems there was a focus on being catty, a gossip, rude, and dependent on others for everything.

      "title": "AITA For cutting out my mentally ill friend?",
      "description": "So I'm in college and I have this friend named \"Tyler\" (fake name, obviously). Well Tyler and I are both freshman and we've been friends since the first week of school, and I cut him out of my life last night. I feel bad for Tyler because he does suffer from bipolar disorder, comes from an impoverished family, grew up with an abusive single mom, etc. The reasons I cut him out were because he can't keep promises and his problems take their toll on my mental health. \n\nSo he recently got caught with weed on campus and got in trouble, and he promised me that he was going to quit and that he was going to get his act together this semester. Cut to a few days later, he is texting me while high. And not to mention he was smoking in his room, after he had a DIFFERENT infraction from smoking. And I know that isn't my problem, but I am one of those friends that try to be the \"mom\", but if he got kicked out of school that would affect me, and having a friend in need of help takes its toll on me emotionally because I care about him as a friend. \n\nHe kept flaking on plans with me. If I was going to be late to a plan we had or had to cancel, I always texted him and apologized or gave some reasoning, but I was rarely bailing on him. But we will make plans and he will put it in his calendar or be like \"DEAL\" and it would be safe to assume he would show up, but then he would forget, or he would brush me off to hang out with other people. \n\nHe wouldn't show up to classes we had together. I enjoyed having classes and studying with him, but then he would skip class or not sleep through, even though he had promised me this semester he wasn't going to sleep through or skip his classes anymore. \n\nI tried getting him help too, since we have therapy and counselling services on campus, but he would forget his appointments or complain that he had anxiety calling them, and was scared because he would make appointments and miss them that they would hate him, etc. \n\nAll of this drama and stress of being friends with him was taking its toll on my personal mental health, and adding to my already stressful college workload, and I just felt like I wasn't being respected in the friendship, and that I had done all I could in trying to help him, and that he needed to do it on his own if he won't take my help. \n\nSo I confronted him about this last night and he basically told me that I'm being selfish and that I couldn't understand everything he has been through, and that I'm basically not helping. Also that he didn't have time for friends who don't know how they feel about him. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for cutting my friend out who needs me to help them? Because I'm just not really sure whether I should feel guilty or if this was the right decision to make. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Basically somebody I knew on social media was asking for money to buy medicine (she has done sort of disease. I forgot what it was but it's pretty serious and requires constant treatment. I also know she's not lying). I'm not really friends with her, she was just a classmate back in high school, but I figured if you're asking for help on FB you must be in a REALLY tough spot.\n\nSo I sent her a DM and sent her about $40. Cool I'm glad I could help.  A week later she comes back and asks if I could help her again because she REALLY needs diapers for her kids. I think we've all been in a tough spot, and if I was in her position obviously I would want help so I said sure. Sent her some more money and let her know I don't want this to be a \"thing\".\n\nThis repeated itself for about 2 months in which I sent get almost $500. Every time it was really serious and a big deal so I had trouble saying no, but I did sometimes. She kept telling me each time was the last and I kept telling her that I don't want to do this regularly. Eventually she tells me she doesn't have any money for food and I've just about had it. I didn't know how to communicate with her after repeatedly telling her I didn't want this to be a habit, so I just blocked her. \n\nI felt kinda shitty about it though. I haven't told anybody about this so I don't have a second opinion. AITA?",

      "description": "Am I the Asshole for being disappointed that my boyfriend planned a birthday getaway for me that has centered entirely around hanging out with his friends with a few limited choice items that must also include his friends?\nMy boyfriend has a knack for planning things for me that really end up being what he wants to do.\nFor instance, one year he wanted to take me on a getaway for the two of us. It ended up being a trip to spend time with his best friend that left no alone time for the two of us. No nice dinners, no nothing. In fact, he left me on this getaway to hang with his friend. I was super hurt and disappointed by this and let him know that he created an expectation for it to be a getaway for ‘us’ not a trip to see his friend.\nHe surprised me with a birthday getaway this weekend. I love the beach, him not so, much so the getaway was to a place with a beach. I knew that one of his friends lived here. Originally he said we’d stay with friends one night and then in a hotel on an island the next. Which of course ended up us staying with his friends 2 nights. He asked me about the things I wanted to do and I did provide him a short list, which consisted of things like, dinner, walks on the beach. Of course, this entire time he has chanted that this is my birthday and I can have ‘whatever I want’. Which has seemed to always include his friend and sometimes his friend’s wife. They are perfectly lovely people and I enjoy them. This is just not the intimate birthday celebration I pictured and really requested when he asked.\nWhen I found out that we were coming to the city where his friend lived, I made it clear that I was looking forward to the alone time between the two of us.\nInstead, we’ve hung out with his friend the entire time so far. I am an introvert and am exhausted by this much social time. We are about to go for a late sushi dinner (bfs favorite) with the friends so I stepped away to rest for a bit by myself at the house. Bf is mad that I am being rude and antisocial. I’m not trying to be rude, I’m just tired and am now needing to gear up to get ready to go out with these people again. His friend even suggested a place that bf could take me for a date for my birthday but no...we are going out with them.\nI’m more disappointed than pissed. And I don’t feel that I need to be with these people every second of the day. Am I the asshole?",

I work full time as a machinist in a big factory and hate waking up Sunday morning to go listen to stuff that makes me roll my eyeballs.  I go through this crap every Sunday morning. Get woken up and then yelled at for 30 mins until I get dressed and get in the car to go with a rotten mood. \nOne similar day my little sister flips out and says I have to go with my mom to a different church that lasts even longer. This was because I was ruining her mood. Usually I go with my sis to a different and quicker church service. She and my mom threaten to take my room door away and go through my shit all the time unless I go. \nSo I go to church. Little do I know, my sister stayed home after I left and went through my room regardless. She said she would do this if I didn’t go, so I went to avoid the trouble and got searched anyway. She found my beautiful triple perc bong, ash catcher, and 45$ in weed. She then proceeded to destroy all of these things instead of go to church, like she was getting ready to do. \nWhen I came home it was gone. I was very very upset. I threw her keys in the lawn, but she walked out later and got them back whole. \nI got some crappy weed a day later and smoke out of an apple now. \nWhy do I have to go to stupid church and why would my little sister (1yr younger than me) take it upon herself to do such petty evil stuff? My mom supported her actions when she found out. I live with my parents  but contribute to the fam. Much more than my sister does. I can’t even hang out with my friends anymore because we smoke weed together. I have not seen my friends in weeks. My packages gets searched and taken away if it’s something drug related. My bank account has to be shared. Im not or never have been addicted to anything but weed, which I love. Ask questions to clarify if you want to. \n",

It pays pretty well, I work on my own, very good benefits, I work four 12-hour shifts every week with the option for more overtime essentially every week.\n\nMy direct boss is the operations manager (OM) for the entire department. He is the only person I have to answer to. Eight months ago he decided to give me a raise that would be “on my next check”. Every two weeks (pay period) he would continually tell me it’s supposed to be on my next check and it never was. For awhile there I thought maybe he was screwing me around about it being “stuck somewhere in corporate”... until...\n\nLast week when my pay stub was posted my raise still wasn’t there, and I got pretty upset about it. I calculated that over the last eight months the company owes me about $1800 from when I was told my raise would be there until now. I told my boss that if he really can’t get this through (with backpay), I’m going to start writing down extra hours on my time sheet until they are back to even with me. He told me to go ahead and do it (commit fraud) and he would still sign off on my time sheets like nothing happened. He just told me to keep a documented running tally so that he knows when I can stop doing this. \n\nI have all of our texts/emails saved, which is basically us conspiring to defraud a company... but I can’t help but feel like this money is owed to me, because they have been lying to me for 8 months... so what’s the difference if I lie to them?

      "description": "I have a really good friend of mine who wants to obtain a career as an artist. This friend (let’s call him Joe) has been really into art as long as I have known him and is very passionate about what he does. He is in his mid 20’s and is wanting to become an artist full time. He has gone to community college and obtained his associate’s degree last semester but has stopped going to school to pursue his career in art. \n\nAs a good friend to Joe, I know that I should be supporting him in what his aspirations are, and I have been this entire time. I think now that he has a degree and has stopped going to school, my feelings toward his artwork need to be heard but I don’t want to break his heart. \n\nTo be honest, I am not a fan of his artwork. I think that art is very much open to interpretation and that one person’s artwork may seem great to some and may seem terrible to others. This is a huge reason as to why I haven’t told him my true feelings. Just because I don’t like it does not mean someone else doesn’t like it either. But it has gotten to a point where I feel like he should know. \n\nHe is spending almost every cent that he earns at his part time job buying art supplies. He spends most of his time working on his art and has even made separate social media accounts and online shops for his artwork. He has become so into his work that I feel if I do not tell him soon, he will exhaust all of his resources into his art and not get anything out of it. \n\nTo summarize, as a good friend of Joe, I am concerned that his artwork won’t be able to support him. I would hate to see him get ridiculed for his art or financially struggle in the future. I definitely think, however, that he should continue making art as a hobby. As a career, I do not think think it will work out well for him. \n\n[Here is a link to one of his more detailed artworks he has created.](https://m.imgur.com/ikQ0qCV)",

She says \n\n\"look at this fucking homophobe, people like this dont deserve to live\"\n\nI mention that words like that shouldnt be used, but that i dont think that its reasonable to make that judgement like that based on the fact that he said it once a 5 second clip.\n\n(I understand now that she was seeking validation, but this is all realized in hindsight. )\n\nShe tells me that im not allowed to have an opinion on this opinion (even though she just asked me lol) due to the fact that i am a straight male. \n\nThis honestly pissed me off, so from tbis point on im pretty unsure with the tone in which i spoke in.\n\nI started off by saying that thats ridiculous and that people should be allowed to voice their mind on things, regardless of their characteristicks. I say that saying this would be like saying that she has no right to an opinion on anti-semitism because she isnt jewish.\n\nShe ended up getting up and leaving, but not before calling me an asshole and an idiot.\n\nI dont particulary care about my relationship with them, but i was thinking that maybe i had done something wrong\n",

      "description": "I recently moved in with my boyfriend and his three roommates. I pay less than them in utilities and rent, but I do a bulk of the grocery shopping and cooking (they throw in a little money for the shopping, and I make dinner for everyone 3-4 times a week). I also end up cleaning quite a bit. What irritates me most is the dishes. Every single day the dishes are piled up in the sink when I get home from work. It’s like they use a new glass for every refill. After a few weeks of this I’m annoyed and not taking care of it everyday anymore. I almost want to stop all together just to see how long it will take for someone else to pick up a sponge.  I’ve mentioned it to my boyfriend, and he sat down with everyone and said that all four of them need to do more, and they agreed, but nothing has changed since then. I’m at the point where I don’t even want to make dinner or shop for the household if this continues. AITA for considering telling everyone to fend for themselves if they can’t be bothered to help out even though I pay the least in bills?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to talk to my coworkers?",
      "description": "I work in a small rubber manufacturing shop. There are only 5 of us in the shop; my boss (let's call him Ryan), his parents (let's say George &amp; Ruth), another worker we'll call Frank, and myself. George &amp; Ruth are a couple years away from retirement, and Ryan, Frank and myself are 28-36. \n\nI am extremely introverted. I find most extended conversation mentally exhausting, outside of my small circle of friends and family. Everybody else in the shop are extroverts and thrive on conversation. I don't like being rude to people, so even if I don't care for a conversation, I'll still let a person know I'm listening (\"mmhmm\", \"oh cool\", \"ya thats neat\"), but most of the time I'm checked out mentally and waiting for the other person to finish talking. I once had a \"conversation\" with Ryan in which I did not contribute a single thing but those small little platitudes so I didn't come off as rude (keep in mind this was also at the end of the day; I was clocked out and walking out the door). This one-sided conversation lasted for an hour and 13 minutes. I had my keys in my hand, I was not making eye contact, and I was leaning back on the heels of my feet; I don't know what other physical signs I could have given that I didn't want to talk. I've tried explaining the fact that I don't want to talk to anyone because it makes my day feel twice as long as it actually is, and it's just fallen on deaf ears. I'm still dragged into conversations that just ruin my day. I feel like the asshole because I start being shitty to everyone; they keep talking to me and it just puts me in a fouler and fouler mood. This is compounded since Ruth is an older woman; I'm essentially wishing for an elderly lady to shut her mouth and leave me alone. \n\nIt's gotten to a point where I try to structure my days around avoiding everyone else. Not to a silly extent, but if I see someone in an area of the shop and there's work I can do somewhere else, I go somewhere else. I try to take my breaks away from everyone else, but that doesn't stop them from bugging me when I try to hide in a side office. Sometimes all 4 of them will be talking and it gives me anxiety and sets me on edge just listening to it; all 4 of them will just talk at the same time over each other, louder and louder until the end of the conversation. This is another aspect I've noticed; I don't know if this is common among people who love the sound of their own voice, but one of the reasons I don't like talking to my coworkers is; we'll be talking, Ruth will finish a sentence (or so I think). There's a pause in the conversation, so I start to talk. Turns out Ruth wasn't finished her thought, cuts me off, and keeps talking for another 45-75 seconds. This has happened so much, and with everyone else, I've just said fuck it, they want to talk so much they can talk. I've stopped responding. Even simple questions/conversation starters (How was your weekend/Did you have fun at your friends wedding) will only elicit one word responses or grunts of acknowledgement. \n\nThis wouldn't be as much of an issue if not for the fact that I'm trapped for 8-9 hours a day in the same space as these people. They seem to understand that I don't like small talk, but it doesn't stop them from talking to me. I tried headphones/ear buds, but in my situation they are not ideal and not very professional for the odd time we have customers in the shop. And it didn't make a difference in deterring them from talking to me anyway; they'd tap me on the shoulder, wait for me to pause the music/podcast, and then proceed to talk while I pretended to listen. \n\nI'd also like to add that I'm talking about general conversation. I'm not trying to deter them from talking about work-related things; even though I don't want to talk to them, shit still needs to get done. The work done in our shop is very monotonous and repetitive, so they like to fill the time with conversation; I just don't need to be part of those conversations, but they seem adamant on dragging me into them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, am I an asshole?",

      "description": "So earlier today, I went to get gas while waiting for clothes to dry. It was around five so the gas station was already packed. I had a bit of trouble getting in so I decided to sit behind a guy that just started. It took a good while, and so when the person ahead of me pulls away I start pulling in when a lady in an suv comes out of nowhere from the opposite direction (that I'm facing) basically blocking my lane at a perpendicular angle. She makes a few hand gestures most likely telling me to back out. I throw my hands into a shrug and she drives away after a second.\n\n It should be said that I'm well into my lane I could easily park and start pumping I just prefer to have the tank right next to the pump.\n\nWell a spot opens on the opposite side of my pump and she pulls in after circling the place once. As she gets to the pump she says loudly that some people are just *sooo* rude these days.\n\nI decided not to respond and not escalate anything.\n\nWell not taking the silence well she follows up with... \"you know I've been sitting there forever waiting for him to move\"\n\nThis time I responded with a lazy \"well I was sitting behind him since he started\"\n\nWe have a quick back and forth talking over the pump(she never actually talked to my face) basically it seemed to me like she was just talking to make me feel more guilty. We finished our business and left it with me ending it with another lazy ok at her jaded remark.\n\nI actually laughed at the idea when she blocked me in the beginning if she wanted a spot she should have sat in line behind someone that was going the same direction as her. Also she was nowhere to be seen when I entered(and if she was she would have been blocking traffic to stubbornly go into this particular pump). \n\nWell I'm home now and I figured I'd actually ask since I'm a new driver if this is a common problem? I've driven for over a year and even across my state and have never encountered any problems with proper pump protocol like this but I don't know. What do you think? ",

      "description": "BG- My partner is korean, I'm american, we married only on paper and did at the time we did because of my visa situation. \nBefore we got married we almost broke up from fighting because he wasn't willing to spend time with me even when i asked. He always made plans with friends and never made time for me when i made all my spare time for him and if he was with me he'd look at his phone. I asked him to be nicer and spend time with me like a fiance does and he would get angry at me and wouldn't change. So i changed after we got married and stopped asking for his time and waited for him to give it to me. He doesnt give affection and I'm an affectionate person, he gets angry easily and we fight about something every time we are together. He swears at me and when he gets annoyed sometimes grabs my arm hard. He went to the army for 1 month and i waited and wrote 100 letters. When he came out he gave me a half assed hug and wouldnt talk to me bc his friends and family were there too. He only made plans with his friends when he came out and didnt try to spend time with me. For almost 2 years i begged for his attention, time and love and didnt realise how hurt i was. I am so unhappy now and cant recover which i told him but he doesnt want to break up and he says that if we break up I've fucked up his life forever bc in korea it's bad to get a divorce and he cant meet another girl in the future. He also told me if i leave he will think that I'm leaving for someone else..not because he didnt make effort in the past when i asked him to. Am i right to want to leave or should i stay and try to work on the marriage even though i know my heart isnt in it? He wants me to keep trying.\n\nTLDR husband thinks relationship is fine when i told him from the start how unhappy i am - doesnt change or make effort, now that i want to leave he says dont go and says if i divorce i fuck his life up forever because of his culture so now i feel stuck ",

He stopped helping around the house, he stopped showering, he boarded garbage and dishes in his room, he produced a stink that could bring you to your knees, he ate food he wasn’t paying for, and he stopped leaving his room for anything that wasn’t work. We talked to him about it, expressed our concerns and for a while he got a little better. We kind of figured it was a depressive thing and we have him his space while still being firm, saying that you need to make sure we can’t smell you from a floor away. He started to take better care of himself and he doesn’t smell (as bad at least) and he’s stopped hoarding the dishes as far as I can tell. But he’s kinda back into this funk now, except that he’s now also out of the blue quit his job and doesn’t have any new prospects. I haven’t seen his bedroom lately but I would assume it’s full of garbage, he’s started smoking again, and he’s back to never leaving his bedroom or his office. His mom has been paying his rent, but I’m not sure how long that’ll last. \n\nSo with all of that information, would I be the asshole for asking him to move out. I want him to move out because of all of his other issues (hygiene, smell, garbage and him literally never leaving the house) but I would say it’s because he doesn’t have a job and this he doesn’t have a solid way of paying rent. He’s my friend but I can’t live with somebody like him. Plus because he never leaves the house he’s affecting my relationship with my fiancé and it’s basically confined us to our bedroom and the top floor of our house because his office and bedroom are connected to the den where we would normally watch TV or play video games. \n\n",

      "description": "A bit of a back story.\n\nMy friend and I met during a master's degree where he was always kind of lazy, doing half the work and always saying \"how super easy\" everything is. To be fair, the coursework was not particularly challenging but personally, coming from a difficult undergraduate program, I valued doing good work i.e. giving myself 100% for everything I do. He was also bitching all the time about how everything we are being taught is professors being professors and having no experience with the real world. The program was far from being perfect but most of us were hard working so we made the best out of it. He ended up passing without merit and dead last in terms of grade.\n\nIn addition, he always appears extremely lucky. While everyone was struggling to find a good internship, he got a good one very early on in the process. I struggled and found something that was fitting as a research assistant, which helped me build a strong network in my field. I kind of resent him for having it so easy (I know bad bad)\n\nHe also got admitted to another master program in a prestigious university in another country where coincidentally I found a job as a research assistant working on some kickass research. I therefore meet him on a daily basis where he keeps telling me how the country's university system is easier than the one we are coming from and that people from the country are not really good. Also he told me that he does not feel the need to work hard when the stakes are low. On the side, his goal is to pursue a PhD, for which he was a good contender for but did not end up getting the funding. So now he is on the look for one.\n\nMy job is going really well; my supervisors are happy with my work and they approached me with a PhD opportunity. For different reasons, I may not accept it. \n\nMy friend and I are in a similar field so I know this PhD could interest him. I could forward it to him and put the good word about him to my supervisors, which could greatly help him get the PhD (but he may still not get it)\n\nHe is not a bad person, quite the opposite. He is loyal and a tremendous friend. Some of his speech just seem problematic. I just don't think he \"deserves\" my help and kind of \"deserves\" to fail for once. \n\nAITA for thinking this way?",

I kind of wanted to visit, not just to see him but it's also a city in a country I've never visited, after a lot of back and forth I decided on this weekend (Fri-Mon). I started arranging it about 3 weeks ago. I couldn't stay with him because of his housemate so I had accommodation anyway. He also told me he would take the weekend off work to see me. A couple of days ago he drops that he won't be able to see me on Saturday, and I felt a little annoyed but let it go. He now says this morning that he won't be back until 8pm on Sunday, I ask him why and he says he went back to his dad's hometown (the kicker is it's my hometown too!) because he was sick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm actually really annoyed.

Occasionally, an employee doesn’t produce results, so I call them in to help figure out why. They make more money when they produce results. Otherwise it’s just an hourly wage.

      "description": "I live with my mom and two sisters. My older sister's boyfriend invited our family to his house for a New Year's Eve party from 6 p.m. to midnight to meet his family who live only 15 minutes away. That same night my mom and younger sister had a wedding to attend at 6 p.m. \n\nMy mom is terrible with directions and will not drive anywhere unless someone takes her to the destination as practice beforehand, which we did. She’s not handicapped in any way, just bad with directions. However, the location changed between her practicing and the day of the party, which I didn’t know about until last minute. \n\nBefore my mom leaves for the wedding I told her I would meet her at the party because she said she was going there straight from the wedding. As she is walking out the door she passively aggressively says “I guess I’m not going to the party” because she knew of the location change and I didn’t. My older sister and I cleared the confusion with her and said that I would wait for them to come home from the wedding and then we would go to the party together. Problem solved. \n\nTen minutes later mom texts us saying “Y’all go! I am fine. I was not trying to be rude. I can’t drive there without practice. Just go!” \n\nWe know she’s just saying that and doesn’t mean it so I text back “Just come home when you’re done. We can go after.”\n\nI wait at home until they get back from the wedding around 7:30. Once they’re home I hear them changing and eating so I wait in my room for them to get ready for the party. They can see me waiting in my room; I’m not hiding from them or avoiding them.\n\nI hear nothing from them and have the following conversation with my mom verbally around 8:30:\n\nME: “Are you still planning on going to the party?”\n\nMOM: “I don’t know how to get there.”\n\nME: “That’s why I waited here, to take y’all.”\n\nShe then says nothing and just ends the conversation and goes back to watching TV on the couch. I wait for a response but she continues to ignore me. I then get dressed and leave for the party. On my way out she asks where I’m going and I say to the party and she says nothing. My older sister also texts her to come to the party but mom blames me in the text for leaving them without warning.\n\nFrom January 1st-5th she ignores me at home and gives me one word conversations when I talk to her. I confront her about it on the 5th and she says she’s angry that I didn’t take her to the party. I told her that I made it clear four separate times that I was going to the party and I would gladly drive them, 1) before she left for the wedding, 2 )in the text, 3) when I openly asked her about it and she ignored me and 4) on my way out as I’m leaving for the party.\n\nIn the coming argument she denies that we ever had a conversation at home when I specifically ask her about the party and she ignored me. That she should never have to talk to me about our shared plans because the person driving has 100% control of the situation. She said that she watched me sit in my room after they got ready for nearly 30 minutes and that she has absolutely no responsibility to come to me with questions. That she did everything in her power to make it to the party but I just left her at home without giving her a single chance to go with me. Now my mom is continuing to ignore me to this day. Was my communication unclear or misleading in any way from another perspective or AITA?",

      "description": "This happened like a year ago but I’m thinking about it because tonight I went on a date with a guy who looked so much like the guy I used to date. \n\nSo over a year ago I (22-23 at the time) was seeing this guy (30). I was head over heels for him by our second date and stopped seeing anyone else I was casually dating. Our chemistry was amazing, he came to visit me at work every weekend, and I spent around 4 nights a week at his apartment. My friend told me they thought he and I were soul mates. When we first began seeing each other, I asked what he was looking for (I would end up asking this about 5 times in the 3-4 months we were seeing each other). He said he wasn’t sure because his last girlfriend had broken his trust somehow after he introduced her to his friends and family (he never went into detail). He also says he doesn’t like the term “dating.” I was looking for a relationship and didn’t want to be used for sex so I asked him to spend some time thinking about it because I didn’t want to be be a fwb. Every time I  brought it up he said he said he hadn’t thought about it or that he liked our relationship being vague, despite me telling him I don’t like keeping things vague. \n\nAbout 3 months later he’s giving me very mixed messages. He says he loves me, and talks about possibly meeting his family, but then says things like “if we were really dating” and reveals that he doesn’t refer to me by name but as his “bartender friend” to his friends. He also was frequently condescending to me for being a college dropout while he had a PhD, and he also said to me I could never understand depression despite him knowing I have depressive episodes. \n\nIn the end I felt frustrated constantly asking him where we were going and his condescending attitude. While at work I texted him that I’d rather we pursue friendship because he didn’t seem to know what he wanted. I know breakups over text are generally not okay, but since he didn’t see us as dating and didn’t ever seem to take the time to decide what he wanted, I thought he wouldn’t care. I apparently was wrong. \n\nWe spent days arguing, in which he criticized me for doing it over text, that even though we weren’t dating, we were dating (what does that even mean??), and he proceeded to blame me for him cutting himself afterwards. After refusing to take responsibility for him hurting himself, he got angry that I wouldn’t “take responsibility for anything.” \n\nI honestly felt like he didn’t care about our relationship. I also felt like he acted very coldly when I got emotional, and I knew I would cry if I ended it in person. I genuinely was under the impression he wouldn’t mind that I needed it over text because I felt like he didn’t care about me that much, which is the only reason I didn’t that way. I felt more emotionally invested and thought my emotions would make him feel bad. Am i Still the asshole?\n\nAlso I’m drunk, sorry for any typos",

My parents never have.\n\nA year ago my step dad had a stroke and the age of 44.\nHe couldn't work for a while and still isn't.\nAbout a month ago mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer... It's been a hard year.\n\nI paid 2 thousand dollars in fuel and hotels for us to get to a hospital 8 hours from home for a week for her appointments. Luckily they can do most of the treatment at home.\n\nWhen we got back I was told that they were 3 grand behind in rent again.\nI told them they have to move because their house that is the same size as mine is more expensive to rent than mine is. (I live 30minutes away in a different town)\nThey refused to move towns and told me \"is rather be homeless than live there again\".\n\nI got angry Very angry.\n\nToday I get a message that they need 2 thousand to move into a different place. The rent is still 50$ a week more expensive than my place. (I live with my gf of 3 years)\nAfter hours and hours of friends and filter telling me, I finally told them I couldn't help.\nI was sick. Physically sick. I could hardly stand. All this was happening while I was at work.\nThey can't work for another 6 odd months. They have gone to every help centre they can.\n\nI feel like they hate me. Every time I've said no they don't talk to me for a few days. My gf says it's to guilt trip me.\nI kind of already know but they are my parents and it kills me.\n\nI told them that they can store their stuff or even live with me until they get back on their feet but all I got in response was \"ok\" when I said I don't have the money.\n\nThis is probably partly therapy for me and there is more to the past than what I have said but obviously that's a bit of a book.\n\nAm I an asshole? Am I an asshole for saying no?",

      "description": "My in laws are in their late 50's and very well off. Not rich, but they have money. For instance, they built their home in 1984, paid it off in 1991. Every single thing they own is paid for. They have no credit card debt, loans, mortgage, etc. Just monthly bills. They're really frugal as well and they have no cable tv/internet, rarely eat out and drive older vehicles. My FIL makes over $100k a year and has been for the past 15 years. My MIL makes over $40k a year and has been for 15 years. My FIL has mentioned to me that they have been saving my MIL's complete salary for the past 15 years, which I estimated as around $30k per year. They have three rental properties which they paid off ten years ago. \n\nI'm mentioning all this to show that they're not in need of any money. They have plenty. So, my FIL rents these homes out for $800-$1,000 per month. The tenant he had in the $800 home was constantly late on payments but was paid up. The last month of the one year lease, his tenant gave him $400 and said he would pay the rest in two weeks(not uncommon by him). Well, the guy bounced and my FIL never got the rest of his money.\n\nThis happened two years ago. My FIL has been researching high and low for this guy to get his $400. I've seen the guy. He came into my place of employment looking to get a permit. I know where he works and where he lives. ",

My boyfriend has a history of drinking.  He claims he’s getting better and he is but slowly. He has three DUIs under his belt, many drunk stories of him pissing in our stairwell, passing out and sleeping on the toilet, even as far as falling off the toilet and shitting on the floor.  He hasn’t had any of these mentioned incidents in the past year. But every time he drinks still something happens. More recently, he’s passed out and our puppy chewed up shoes, pillows, and hats all around him when he was “watching him” and last weekend he sliced his finger pretty bad on a mandolin. \n\nTonight, he opened a couple of bottles of beer already. He doesn’t work tomorrow and had a long day today but my day tomorrow is going to be long. I have an interview for a big opportunity job and then I go into work.  I need to be on my A game in the morning. He is listening to his headphones and not being too loud (he’s singing) but I hear him opening more beers which makes me anxious due to his history. I asked him to not drink tonight because my day is important tomorrow. He basically said no and said he’s not bothering me. He started imitating me in an obnoxious voice and saying that I was nagging and acting like a princess. That just irritates me more so I walked away. I just don’t want drama before my big day. He can drink all he wants tomorrow.  I don’t care. \n\n\nTldr. Big day for me tomorrow. Boyfriend wants to drink probably all night. \n\nAITA for asking him to not drink on his night off?  \n",

      "description": "My family's always been pretty progressive and bookish.  My mother's a tenured professor of sociology at the local college and my father's a permaculture consultant.  So me and my siblings grew up in a pretty nerdy lefty/liberal/whatever environment.  We were always encouraged to find things out for ourselves, and look at things from an academic perspective rather than letting our personal feelings cloud how we saw stuff.  I remember my mother teaching us about the Aztecs and human sacrifice when I was like nine or ten, and telling us how we shouldn't judge the Aztecs by our standards and stuff.  So that's that.\n\nMy older brother married into a pretty heavily Christian family, and they have a daughter who's turning five this year.  I love her very much!  Her name is Katerina.  And because my sister-in-law is extremely Christian and very conservative and controlling, she's pretty strict about what her daughter's allowed to watch and read and stuff.  Nothing with magic or witchcraft, nothing with talking animals (because it implies animals have souls), nothing with witches or wizards, nothing with ghosts or spirits.  And church every Sunday, and eating fish on Fridays, and the \\*Holy\\* Ghost and all that - she's QUITE the Christian.\n\nAnyways I was babysitting my niece and we watched some of the old Disney DVDs I still have lying around from when I was growing up.  And when my sister-in-law showed up to pick her up, we were watching Disney's Hercules.  Which has ancient Greek gods in it, and ghosts, and magic.  Needless to say, she pitched an almighty fit about it, basically calling me disrespectful and hateful, accusing me of always opposing her since she joined our family and wanting to hurt her because of her Christianity.  After she calmed down, we managed to have a bit of a productive conversation where she apologised for what she said and I said I didn't realise it would upset her so much; after all.\n\nAnd then I said something like, \"I don't see why you're so upset, it's not like Kat's gonna run off and start worshipping Zeus.  Ancient Greek religion was around before Christianity, so feeling threatened by it is a bit like how ISIS is blowing up those temples in Syria.\"\n\nAnd she just ABSOLUTELY LOST IT.  Like, I mean screaming, crying, calling her parents and my brother and asking them to come get her, threatening to never let me see my niece again, claiming I was cursing her and I don't know what all else.  I didn't even mean it in a shitty way, I literally just meant that there's a commonality between Christians who are afraid of anything that even suggests or depicts non-Christian belief and ISIS blowing up anything that isn't strictly Muslim!",

      "description": "So my family has two dogs, and one of them is mine in every sense of the word while the other is a family dog. Both of them sleep indoors, my dog with me and the family dog with my brother.\n\nMany times I’ve had to have both in my room (enough that I’d estimate around 30-ish times, not that often, but enough that it’s noticeable it’s never happens the other way around). Normally it’s because my brother was at a party late or felt “sick” or simply didn’t want to have the dog that night. I don’t mind having them so I always agreed to taking both of the dogs. \n\nLast night my family and I had a party with a large number of my friends and families workmates coming around too, and my brother ended up crashing pretty early-ish for a party night (around 11). I was still out enjoying the party and hanging out with everyone I knew. \nAt around 12 we decided to let the dogs inside for the night, and because I wasn’t finished partying I decided that since my brother was already asleep and in his room he could take them both. \n\nMy mum went off on a rant about me and my dog, saying stuff like “this is your child and you’re just ditching her to party” and “he’s sleeping why should he have to have them both tonight”. I quickly pointed out that I’d done it for him several times before and that I’d rather this then having my dog locked into my room by herself (she has abandonment issues and likes to be with someone else at all times, especially the family dog who is older than her and acts like a big sister of sorts) \n\nShe then refused to talk to me saying she couldn’t believe what i was doing and that I needed to be responsible for my pet. Every time she saw me again that night she gave me dismissive remarks about my dog and harsh looks. It kinda ruined the fun for me so I ended up retreating to my room anyway and bringing my dog back with me when I did.\n\nThe way my mother acted all night and her comments made me think I was acting like an asshole when I’d originally thought it was a sound decision and now I’m second guessing myself.\n\nTLDR; AITA for deciding that my dog could sleep in my brother’s room with the family dog so that I could stay out and party longer, since I’ve done it for him multiple times?

I thought I was polite throughout, though I also stated that them fixing it would be the difference between negative (no contact/fix) and neutral (contact/rectified) feedback, and that I would withhold feedback in the mean time.\n\nWhen I got the response, they completely denied the possibility that the deck had been tampered with, and that it was likely a factory error, which I would have been willing to believe if it hadn't been sealed so tightly (because even the coin could potentially be explained away as a factory error, but there was no way that much glue could). They then went on to... express their annoyance... over being blackmailed with negative/neutral feedback even if they'd do everything they could to fix it.\n\nI did respond saying I didn't agree that the box wasn't tampered with, but did acknowledge that it wasn't necessarily their doing, that I may have potentially been a little harsh, and that I appreciated their response and their willingness to fix it.\n\nWaiting for a response from the seller after my latest message, which will hopefully include a valid code card, but in the mean time...

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible. \n\nMini background: Boyfriend and I have been together for some time. We’re very happy. We have talked about marriage before in what I had always felt were very vague terms. I would like to marry him one day but at present, we are neither engaged nor do we even live together. We are in our 30s. \n\nRecently we were talking about a friend’s upcoming wedding and I said something to the effect of, “if I get married this is something I’d like to have at my wedding.”\n\nHe got mildly upset and asked, “don’t you mean WHEN WE get married?” \n\nI apologized for upsetting him and explained that because we’re not engaged, it didn’t feel right speaking in definitive terms like that, and also that I didn’t want to give the impression I was putting any pressure on him (I’m not - propose, don’t propose, I’m not going anywhere anyway.) He said it still bothered him, I apologized again and privately decided to avoid this topic until such a time that it DOES become a definitive in our lives, should it ever. \n\nAITA here?\n",

      "description": "I swear I've tried to cut this story down as much as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGist of it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom left me with my abusive father when I was about 8, and didn't really resurface again until I was 18.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time I was extremely sick and needed dialysis. She let me move in with her, bought me a car, and supported me for a few years. She eventually donated her kidney as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPretty much as soon as that happened I moved to the other side of the the country. It's a long story but my family is extremely dysfunctional and there was a lot of pain that I wanted to distance myself from. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was there for about a year before I fell pregnant. She convinced me to keep the baby even though her father walked out on us, and again supported me financially for about a year after her birth before cutting me loose. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year after that she convinced me to move back to her side of the country, saying that she would co-sign on a lease, help watch my daughter and help get me through school. So I did that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt immediately became clear that her new husband is extremely petty and abusive. In the short time I was there he had multiple violent tantrums, screamed at my child, kicked my dog, treated my mom and me like garbage, and quickly convinced her to revoke her support. She claims this was justified because I stopped talking to him. I know someone will say I'm not telling the whole story but that's literally it. He had a violent outburst, and from that point I tried to never be around when he was. She decided that this was an insult to her personally, and started saying that she had never offered to help me in the first place. I moved in with roommates almost immediately after she said she wasn't going to help any more, and I moved 6 times in the 9 months after that before finally getting a secure living arrangement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe also completely dismissed me when I told her something was wrong with my brother and that I didn't want to see him any more. Turns out he is on drugs, lies about literally everything, and was probably grooming my son, but she chose to ignore me until it was revealed that he had stolen about $10k from her and her husband.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot more to this story (really I could write a book) but things came to a head when she said I was \"entitled and ungrateful\" when I asked for help paying for daycare- help she had offered 3 months earlier, but I never took her up on because she likes to hold things over my head. At this point I had been self sufficient for over a year, and decided it would be better to cut her off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cut off my entire family while I was at it, for one reason or another. I can't deny that the financial and physical support I received was crucial, and that they have done a lot for me. I wouldn't be where I am without them. I also can't deny the years of abuse and abandonment, or the patterns in my family that are clear to me now. I never want to see them again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still feel like a small part of me was definitely ungrateful and entitled for expecting her help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo based on my limited info, AITA?",

He's also made some weird offhanded comments like \"You can handle my stuff any way you like\" when I asked if I could help him with some bags. Idk if it's really that weird of a comment but the way he said it kinda made me quiet. He always tries to tell my siblings what to do and I can tell it annoys them immensely, and he tried to have conversations with them way beyond what they can understand (like politics and my siblings are elementary grade level). He plays his music super loudly in our tiny house and I feel like he wants us to ask about it for attention or something. Anyway I'm thinking of just talking to my dad for him to let me know when he comes over so I can make myself scarce lol.

      "description": "I’m 21 and I still live with my mom. I fully understand that I am old enough to be living on my own, but to make a long story short, my mom struggles with mental health issues and I worry that if I leave her on her own, she’ll start living life in a very unhinged way. (she’s struggled with addiction in the past) \n\nI’m not going to make myself out to be a saint or anything like that, but I do help her out a lot around the house. For the past 5 years, I’ve been giving her daily assistance with learning the internet &amp; web browsing, a lot of which includes helping her with online shopping. She had a slight addiction for a minute and was ordering 5+ items from a multitude of shops and having me complete all the return/support tickets when she doesn’t like her items...which is almost always. \n\nI digress. I’m just trying to paint an accurate portrait of our give and take relationship. She’s on social assistance which pays for our rent. I’m grateful that she allows me to live here, but I do pay for most of my own food and things, and lately I’ve been going out of my way to pay for her meals and groceries as well. \n\nThis is where I get frustrated. I work about a 40 minute walk away from my house. It’s a 5 minute car ride. It’s freezing out right now, and taking the bus takes almost as long as walking since the schedules are wonky. \n\nI asked her if she’d mind dropping me off (since her days are always 100% free) and she says no. I asked her why not, and her reasoning was that her boyfriend is awake and might want to use the car in the 10 minutes she’d be gone. I told her I would really appreciate just a drop off and had full intentions of taking the bus home. Still no. \n\nShe very rarely gave me rides as kid—I relied on the bus for school &amp; hanging out, even in the winter. When I missed my school bus, I’d take a cab. \n\nI can drive, and I drive rather well... but I never have access to a car to practice, which is why I haven’t gotten my license yet. There’s always an excuse as to why I can’t use the car when I ask to practice/book a road test. \n\nSorry for the brick of text. I wanted to paint a proper picture before I ask:\n\nAm I an asshole for being annoyed that she won’t drive me 5 minutes up the road to work, but expects me to be on call for her tech support and questions 24/7 and bring her takeout/run various errands for her while I’m on foot &amp; she drives? \n\nI know the realistic response is to move out and get my own car... but my dad just passed away recently and I have a lot of psychological hangups/panic about losing my mom now. She takes very poor care of herself without my help, and I fear that if I leave her, she’ll let go altogether. \n\nI’m just bitter lately because I feel like she has no remorse asking me for a million things because she “puts a roof over my head” (technically the government does but whatever) but when I ask her to drop me off, it’s the end of the bloody world.

      "description": "Backstory:  \n\n\nMy father was laid off from his job so my parents made plans to relocate to SC where my mother has family, and also because of the much lower cost of living since my father is looking to retire.  They were originally intending to move into a townhome but my aunt and her husband, who own two houses, suggested that my parents purchase one of their houses.  They initially declined, but my aunt lowered the price and there was a written offer and acceptance via email.  Rather than using a real estate agent, the plan was to have a lawyer draft the documents, but my parents wanted to sell their house before the documents were drafted.\n\nGood news - my father gets rehired to his old job.  Since he works remotely in IT he can live anywhere, but they still decide to move to SC due to cost of living.  In the meantime, they are working toward selling their house, selling off one of their cars, and even selling furniture such as one of their couches, a dining room table, an outdoor swingset, children's toys (for my children/their grandchildren), etc.\n\nThey get an offer for the house, but things fall apart during the negotiation process.  My wife and I state that we would like to purchase the house, but would need to wait a few months in order to prepare.  They would even save money by not paying the real estate agent.  My parents initially agreed, but out of the blue my aunt states that they are only giving my parents one month now, so my wife and I are forced to recant our offer, and my parents eventually work things out with the initial offerer and sell the house.\n\nTwo weeks before my parents were supposed to move out, my aunt and her husband state that they are no longer selling their house due to the hurricane that was headed toward SC.  This is disingenuous, since we later find out from other family members that my aunt's husband had stressed out about selling their house before the hurricane, but the hurricane was their excuse.  The result is that my parents had two weeks to find a place to live, and pretty much gave up their house, a car, and several pieces of furniture for nothing.  In a panic, they decided to move into my townhome complex.  They managed to find movers, but the movers cancelled the day of the move.  They had to pay roofers (they were their to repair hail/weather damage as part of the sales agreement) $600 dollars to help load the U-Haul truck that my father rented last minute.  I even left work to go help them load, and especially unload.  It as a total clusterfuck.\n\nI later texted my aunt and stated that I was \"disappointed\" in the way she and her husband dealt with my parents in bad faith.  She ended up flipping out, and stating that I was trying to shame her, and that there was a hurricane hitting SC and that we didn't care.  I was told that it wasn't my place to comment, but she had given my parents the fucking of a lifetime, not to mention the stress between my wife and I over our earlier intent to to purchase my parents' house, so we were affected to some degree.  Even now, after my mother went to visit (since her father is dying), my aunt kept going on about the hurricane and how their was some flooding in their yard.  They refused to accept that they bent my parents over the barrel hardcore.",

      "description": "I was doing laundry today and it was time to put my clothes in the dryer. There are 8 dryers, and 3 of them were broken - the rest were all in use. I saw that a couple dryers were going to be done in like 8 min, so I put my wet clothes in my laundry basket and went upstairs to my place. I came back down in like 15 min and two dryers were done, but nobody was there. I decided to browse my phone and wait a bit.\n\nSoon after, a couple came in with a few loads of laundry and started setting up near the washers. I was just standing their waiting, and as I looked at one of the dryers that was completed, I got the impulse to check it because it looked like it was maybe just a fleece or something. I thought to myself, \"Maybe if it's just a single item, they wouldn't mind if I gently folded it and proceeded to use the dryer.\" \n\nI'm not sure if I would have actually would have taken it out, but I opened the door to give it a quick check, and it was not just a single item - it was a medium sized load. One item (maybe boxer shorts) fell out as I opened it, and I picked it up and put it back in and closed the door. \n\nI turned to the couple and said, \"I'm waiting for a dryer...\" and was about to mention that three dryers were out of order, and the guy goes to the dryer that I was just at and starts ranting about how disrespectful it is to \"mess with people's stuff.\" It was his load of laundry in the dryer. \n\nHe starts taking his clothes from the dryer and is ranting to me about common courtesy and how touching other people's laundry is just something you don't do. It made me really uncomfortable to be accused of being disrespectful because I'm a respectful person.\n\nI said something like, \"Sorry, but it's also courteous to take your clothes from the dryer, and I didn't take your clothes out anyway,\" and then he says that something about me dropping his stuff all over the floor. He tries to keep going and I say, \"I get it\" to stop his lecture and then he says, \"OK, then drop it,\" as if I'm the one ranting. \n\nAnyway, AITA for committing the great sin of opening a laundry door?

It was very sudden because I was not open about the dysfunction in our relationship. My parents especially took it hard.\n\nI only found out about this because I had to get something that was mailed to him and he briefly mentioned it in passing. They invited him over around Thanksgiving and didn’t tell me. I’m furious and I feel betrayed. I get he was a big part of the family, but I’m too pissed about them going behind my back to even begin to empathize with them. AITA?",

      "description": "Opposites attract, right? Well I'm as free going as it gets, my wonderful girlfriend isn't as much. When I have an off day, I'm slightly reclusive and try not to interact. Not an douche, as she says \"there is just something off\". When I finally shake it off after 1-2 days everything is okay for a few and then comes another couple days of her wondering if everything is okay in the relationship, if there is anything that she did to cause this, what could have gone differently on her end...... the whole time she questions motives and actions. I've tried multiple responses. Ive answered her questions immediately, Ive tried to let her know her actions are not a healthy *reaction* to what is going in my life. I've blatantly asked her if I have to respond a certain way when things like that are happening, maybe a scenario where in her head she is out of control and she needs me to be there for support. Everytime either I'm distant or im over reacting. I literally am the one trying to lighten the spirits in conversation, in daily life. My favorite saying is \"you cant take life to seriously, you'll never make it out alive!\" I'd rather not bring up things to possibly erode somebody's happy mood for the day. She wants to talk about what was bothering us for days, when it was something stupid like I couldn't land my bottle flip last night or something. When is enough enough?",

      "description": "New to this sub. Having problems with marriage arguments. I’m 20(f) he’s 22(m). Got married at 18. Every time we talk about this he gets extremely frustrated with me. Back story is we got married super young and my parents didn’t pay for a cent of the wedding. He bought my ring, $900 (no diamond for the center stone). Other than that it was pretty much my money or gift money that paid for the $4k wedding and honeymoon. He didn’t have very much to contribute because he had just bought a car with cash, $12k. Only thing I had bought is my cellphone, $500. After getting married and combining accounts, we had $4k. Two months into the marriage I found a car with the remaining money I had saved up from being single, $2k cash.  Fast forward to the summer and he drops $4k on a dirt bike he really wanted. We had to take out a $1k loan to do so. Fast forward again to the next years tax return and he spent almost the whole refund on buying himself a new phone, a little over $1k. Then we get to today, where he is deciding to take out a student loan to do a computer build, $2200. I have already brought it up before but I mention that I want to get a nicer car. He always gets extremely frustrated and shuts me down and calls me selfish. Says my car is perfectly fine and that he sees no need for me to get a newer one. Says that everything we own is both of ours. But all these things we’ve bought that are “ours” don’t really benefit me anyway. Can’t possibly ride his Yz 450 dirt bike, don’t use his phone, and am not a gamer so I won’t really use this $2200 computer. So I ask for something that would benefit me and he won’t even consider it because we don’t need it. I’m not asking for a brand new car, just maybe a little nicer than $2k gets you. He also says that when we do need a car in the future, I will get his old car and he will get the new one. I say that’s not fair to me because I never get to have a nice car. Then he gets mad and says in the future I won’t even need a new car because I will be a stay at home mom and won’t be driving anywhere. I have never bought anything that has cost more than $200. Which was a pair of dirt bike boots, and I don’t even have a dirt bike. I’m leaving out Christmas and birthdays because they are irrelevant. I’m also leaving out everyday small purchases like clothes and shoes etc because I think I’m pretty even with him with his video games and clothes and shoes etc. I will admit I do spend money more frequently, but it is always small amounts around $30 or less. I also know that I am not the domestic completely selfless conservative wife he expects me to be so that causes some anger towards me. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting some equality in big purchases?\n\n",

She seems to have this chronic sinus/upper respiratory issue. I’m not a doctor, but if being a carrier for a respiratory virus is possible... that’s what she is. The common cold version of Typhoid Mary.\n\nEvery time her “sinus issue” flares up, the entire office gets sick. It’s the nastiest cold imaginable and it just drags on. The last two times I caught it, I was sick for over a month. This is the *third* time that I’ve had the same infection, that hits exactly 2 days after her “sinuses flair up”, since I started. \n\nEveryone gets at least 2.5 weeks of PTO, she probably gets more since she’s been here for a long time. She also has the capability to work from home. I have less PTO and my job doesn’t permit me to work from home. So, when she comes in sick, I’m essentially screwed. \n\nThe cherry on top is that when she’s having these “sinus issues”, she walks around the office coughing and telling everyone how sick she is. At least quarantine yourself in your office! Jesus.\n\nWIBTA if I called her out? This is just getting ridiculous. ",

      "description": "My gfs all-time favorite dessert is tiramisu. This was our first Valentine’s Day together, so obviously I wanted to do something sweet. I cook most our meals and am a pretty decent chef, so I already had a meal planned that she knew about, but I wanted the tiramisu to be a surprise. \n\nThat Wednesday night, I get up after midnight while she’s still sleeping and run to the grocery store to get what I need. A pound of mascarpone, vanilla extract, eggs, cream, etc. all-in-all cost me about $20, which isn’t much in the grand scheme of things, but I’m a college student. \n\nHowever, there was one ingredient that I couldn’t get. Rum. I’m only 20 and liquor shops close at 9 where I live, so I had no options. We did have lemon vodka though, so I decided that I’d give it a try and if it sucked then I’d just use coffee without liquor. \n\nI come back and make everything as quiet as I can. After dipping some of the ladyfingers in the vodka-coffee mix, I tried one and thought it worked great. The vodka didn’t overpower the coffee and the lemon added some lighter flavors. I assemble everything and hide it in the fridge. \n\nNext day, everything goes great and I bring out the tiramisu. Her eyes light up and she gets super happy. Then she digs in and gets the most disgusted frown on her face. I asked if she liked it and she shook her head. I told her I made it with the lemon vodka and she said that was what made it so bad. \n\nI had a bite and it tasted exactly like it had the night before. \n\nI’m not above criticism, but this was different. I said that it tasted fine to me and her response was “Well, that’s all that matters.” Normally I’d agree, but I didn’t make this for myself. I made it specifically for her as a gift. It was if you bought something that you knew someone would love, but when you give it to them they say “I don’t like it, but you can have it.” \n\nAfter that, I cleaned up the dishes and offered to go get some pre-made tiramisu from the store. She asked why and I told her it’s because I clearly ruined her gift and wanted to make it up to her, which made her feel really guilty about everything. She apologized but I antagonized her a bit more about it and have been using it as my silver bullet for arguments recently. \n\nI intentionally made her feel guilty, but am I an asshole for it?\n\n",

      "description": "This issue has been plaguing my mind since last December and I am happy that this r/ exists because I need to know whether i am in the wrong or not. (If sharing please don't show username.)\n\nMy friend since childhood (We'll call her Sarah) has been giving me rides to and from school everyday for a long time because she lived right down the street from me. One day in Dec. after school, I was going to host a Secret Santa party. I have two groups of friends because Sarah doesn't get along with my larger group of friends. I didn't invite her to my secret Santa party because I know it would end in a fight if she did attend. In the past Sarah had been extremely jealous whenever I spent time with other friends. Anytime I would post a picture  with someone else she would message me and be angry even though I spent time with Sarah other times. This was getting old and I was growing apart from Sarah. I did plan on having another party, but it never happened. My group of friends took my bus home, we all got off at my bus stop where Sarah's mom would also pick her up so she didn't have to walk to her house.  I was planning to just walk a couple blocks with my friends to my house. Then, Sarah's mom asked us if we would like a ride home. I politely refused at  because I didn't want Sarah to be around other friends. Sarah's mom then says, \"No,its OK, I'll get y'all a ride home, its cold.\" Without thinking, I agreed. Everyone got in her car and she dropped us off. I thanked her profusely and quickly got everyone to my house. During the ride to my house, Sarah said nothing. I look at Sarah as she leaves the driveway. As I look I see that she is crying. I was expecting the upset text from Sarah, per usual for being with others. I couldn't focus at the party. After opening presents, my phone rings. There it is. The upset text from Sarah. Crying and blaming everyone. I had discussed that I didn't think Sarah and the other group should spend a lot of time together, and she AGREED, but now she decided that she did want to be at the party with them? I received at least 15 other messaged with a a range of emotions. This typically happened when I spent time with my other friends, but this time I was confused on how to respond, because I was wrong for accepting the ride. I didn't respond until later in the night, now seeing 20+ messages. At this point I was SO tired of this jealousy every time I wanted to be around people other than her.  I finally snapped and told her we should not be friends anymore. To which she politely responded with, \"Fuck you.\" I can't help to feel guilty for accepting the ride and not inviting her.\n\nAITA for cutting off all contact with my best friend since childhood over this?\n\n(I'm not a great storyteller so I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.)",

      "description": "A little background. My wife and I are of different nationalities, and whereas she is still religious--in the sense she'll go on the holidays--I do not believe in God although I was raised and confirmed Catholic. (This isn't a religious debate so please keep that in mind). I was forced to go to weekly mass (at a Catholic school) and complete all the religious sacraments even though I told my parents, from a young age, that I don't believe in God. This belief was solidified over the years following so many things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen my wife and I got married, she kept her last names and I was fine with that, but there was the question of whose last name would the kids takeI love my wife dearly but I just couldn't see myself going through life with my children having two last names (I really don't know how to explain this one. I used to think that I'd be cool with pretty much whatever as long as my kids are healthy, but when the moment arrived there was something unexplainable to it). Probably very American of me, but it just didn't sit right. I was/am fine with her not taking my last name but it felt too much to ask of me to that we do things her culture's way in regards to our kids--at least for this theme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter months and months of long discussions, we finally came to a compromise. Our kids would take my last name, but they would be baptized in her religion. This was fine with me because I don't believe in God and she's still semi-religious. Unlike most compromises, where both sides feel like they got a bit screwed, we both came away feeling like we each got a win. Fast-forward to the present. We have one child and another on the way. Recently she asked me about their baptism and I reminded her of our arrangement, and mentioned that the baptism is her responsibility. She knows of my beliefs and stance towards God and religion. So, she looked into it. It didn't take her long to come back with some info, but I again reminded her that if she wants our kids baptized it's her choice and responsibility and that I'm not in the picture for that one because of my beliefs, or lack thereof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, it turns out that not only do both parents have to be present for the baptism, but I would have to take religious classes because I'm not her religion. There are two parts, come to find out, about this baptismal process that I refuse to do because of what I believe. Taking classes. 2.) I genuinely cannot bring myself to stand up at an altar and answer a priest in the affirmative that Yes, I do give this child to the kingdom of God. To me, that would be like saying, Yes, I give my child to nothing. (She got this info from talking with her priest).\n\nNeither of us was aware of this process and we figured it was something she could do on her own. I won't do the classes, again, and I don't see myself up at the altar telling the priest that I give my child to God. So, WIBTA if I renege on a compromise made with my wife?",

      "description": "So let's start with that - my aunt lives in another country. She has a really strong personality but that's what I like about her. She has visited a lot of countries, had many interesting jobs and experienced a lot. I love listening to her life stories. Sadly, I see her only once a year. I really used to enjoy her visits, and waited for them more than I even waited for Christmas, until she got a baby (a girl, is 6 years old now). \n\nNow we don't talk about interesting stuff like we used to, we barely even talk at all and if we do, it's now always about what her daughter did, what she wore, how \"different she is from other kids because she likes dinosaurs and dragons\". And I'm slowly getting sick of it. It makes us distant from each other and on top of that every time she visits us she wants me to play with her daughter all the time.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love my cousin. She is a sweetheart, she always cries when they have to leave and she knows that she won't see me for another year. She is a smart child and I love hearing some funny stories about her from time to time and don't mind drawing with her or building fun stuff with legos etc. but she is extremely lazy and gets bored of everything very quickly expect play pretending. Which would be ok if it wasn't like: I talk to her, try to be entertaining, play a hundred characters at once while she is just sitting and looking at me, sometimes saying a word or two. It is really frustrating and exhausting and doing that for a few hours really isn't fun for me. And when I try to do something different with her or tell her that I want to rest she goes downstairs to my parents, my aunt and my uncle chatting, and tells everybody that I don't want to play with her, making me feel like the biggest a-hole in the entire world.\nBecause of that I found myself for example eating extremely slow at family dinners when they are visiting us because then I don't have to play with my cousin (but she keeps on asking me over and over again to do that while I eat anyways).\n\n\nThere's also one more thing that concerns me.\n\nThis year I'm going on a trip to Asia with them (aunt, uncle, their daughter and me). It's my birthday present because I've never had birthday parties or celebrated my birthday in any way and felt like I want to at least make one of my dreams come true when I'm 18. My parents don't like traveling and I don't feel comfortable traveling on my own so I'm going with them. Plus they also wanted to visit Asia and I won't lie, they helped financially a lot.\n\nHowever, besides money they don't organise or help with anything connected to that trip at all. When they visited us recently we had decided earlier to discuss everything but we just didn't. I didn't even had the opportunity to talk to them because I was always taking care of the cousin.\nThere's still a couple of months left to the trip, but still it's better to talk about these kind of stuff face to face and not via email.\n\nThere's only one thing about the trip they mentioned while already leaving and that was a comment directed to their daughter saying \"Don't worry! You can play with [my name] in [the month we are going to Asia] for two weeks (we will be traveling for two weeks)!\" and that really hit me you know.\nI also heard from my parents that my aunt wants me to take care of my cousin on the plane and during car rides knowing very well that this flight will be long and I have motion sickness so I might feel awful and have even less energy than normal then.\nI wanted that trip to be my present, my vacation, my break from everything and my opportunity to explore an interesting culture without having to take care of my cousin every damn second. \nBut now I am not happy about the trip at all and I feel like a piece of shid for that because I feel like I'm over-exaggerating the whole situation. I'm just tired of all of this and don't know how to feel or what to do. I tried talking to them or my parents about it but they all make me feel like I'm exaggerating.\n\n[[Also English is not my first or second language and this is my first post on Reddit so it's probably full of mistakes and it was a horrible decision to post that but hey.. I want to know if I'm really the a-hole here because it bugs me so much.]]",

      "description": "Hello guys! First time poster here so I hope this all goes well. (On mobile by the way) \n\nTL;DR at the bottom\n\nA little background info. I’m currently a junior in college (relevant for timing) and in high school, I used to be really good friends with this one girl (we’ll call Sally). Basically, we were best friends and would hangout all the time. Then, I started dating a girl during my sophomore year (who I would end up dating for 2 years). Now Sally and many others warned me about this girl being kind of controlling and demanding towards her boyfriends, but me being the ignorant high schooler just ignored her and the rest of the people. Because of this, I lost my friendship with Sally and we didn’t speak for the rest of the time I was dating this girl (2 years).\n\nFast forward to the break up. I ended things with that girlfriend because I finally saw all the signs that pointed to a toxic relationship and what everyone had previously warned me about. After we broke up, I contacted Sally and told her how sorry and terrible I was to her for ignoring her  and wanted to rebuild our friendship. We started hanging out again and becoming friends. Until one day we hooked up and it just turned our whole friendship to shit. After we hooked up that one time, she became distant and eventually cut off communication with me. I was devastated because Sally was my best friend and I had lost her again because of a dumb mistake. We both eventually graduated high school and went to different universities in different states.\n\nFast forward to today (3 years later). I am now in a relationship with a girl I met in my dorm. We have been together for 2 years (ironic) and we are still going strong with no signs of slowing down. So today, Sally contacts me by randomly sending me a picture, through Snapchat, of us in high school. Now keep in mind I haven’t talked to her since high school when she cut off communication with me, so I was very shocked she contacted me. We started talking about our lives, how we’ve been doing, school, etc. While messaging each other back and forth, she confesses that she misses me and wished things could have been different and that she wished we could have dated. I’m blown back by this because she’s the one who stopped talking to me. Anyways, she goes on to say that she has feelings for me. First of all, I don’t know how she could have feelings for me if we hadn’t even talked in 3 years. Secondly, I have my current girlfriend who I adore. So I go on to tell her that I’m flattered that she’s saying all of this to me and for confessing her feelings for me, but that I have a girlfriend.\n\nAt this point, once I told Sally I had a girlfriend, her whole mood changes. She tries to convince me to break up with her. Sally says, word for word, “The relationship we had is incomparable. You’ll never find anybody else like me.” Well she’s right, I found someone much better. I respectfully decline her offer saying that I’m happy in the relationship I have now. She goes on to tell me how much of dick I’m being and that she’ll never talk to me again (shocker). In hindsight, I feel like I could have handled it differently by getting coffee with her the next time I was in town, or anything to just talk to her in person. Because from experience, everything can be interpreted differently if it’s over text, so I’m hoping I didn’t say anything that could’ve have rubbed her the wrong way to go off on me like that. It is the middle of the night, so maybe she’s drunk and spewing whatever comes to mind that she might not even mean to say. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling Sally that I have a girlfriend? Maybe she interpreted what I was saying in a demeaning way towards her? Should I have gone to see her face to face before I said anything about my current relationship status? I’m just confused on this whole situation. \n\nTL;DR ex bestie contacts me after years of no communication to confess her feelings towards me. I tell her that I have a girlfriend (maybe it came off as douchey) and that I’m happy in my current relationship. She tries to convince me to break up with my girlfriend for her. After I don’t budge, she continues to call me a dick and that she’ll never speak to me again.\n",

They started it at 2pm so they had time to do it. Fast forward to just now, at 11pm. My friend calls me to say he was trying to do it, but the file got corrupted(I think this might be bullshit). He wants them both to take partial credit for the stuff I did on google drive. I said no, he shouldn't have postponed finishing it to today. I've got great grades, they don't, but they're not at risk of failing and it's not an important class, and I want to salvage what's left of my grade from this shitshow.

We were winding down as we didn't see much more than sign that day so my dad, an old friend and I were playing with a little .410 shotgun when a hunting dog ran up.\n\nWe all stopped and I called the little guy to me and he came right over sweet as could be. He had a tracker collar on as well as a name plate but he was thin, too thin. His pads were bleeding and he was soaked to the bone in that thick bud only a river delta gets.\n\nIn true redneck engineering I used a rifle sling as a leash and we called up the owner and brought the dog back to him. He had four dogs total. Three chasers and a pinner. The pinning dog was a pit bull and it was the only dog with a protective vest. The chasers were hound mixes and had no protection not even a spike collar.\n\nHe drove off and I had a bad taste in my mouth. Hogs are dangerous. And while I have a hunting dog of my own he doesn't go out without a good meal a vest and a spike collar. It was quite clear that this dog had none of those.\n\nAITA for returning this dog? I know I couldn't have helped the others but maybe I could've left his radio collar in the river and taken him to a shelter.",

      "description": "A little over a year ago, I finally cut ties with a friend of 3.5 years who had spent the better part of our friendship gaslighting and manipulating me, as well as dumping all of her emotional baggage on me very frequently almost as if I were a therapist, since she couldn't afford one at the time. She had also betrayed my trust on multiple occasions, but I'd always just chalked that up to her being a huge gossip. Examples of things she's said to me/tried to convince me of include that I was never going to get into college because I'm not as smart as her, that my own boyfriend liked her more than he liked me (and that I was just his side piece), that I was never going to find a friend who appreciated me as much as she did, that my personal health issues were not as important as her, and more. For anyone who hasn't been gaslighted before: this might sound absolutely nuts the first time you hear it, but when it's been told to you over and over again almost every day for years, you slowly start to believe that everything they say is true. Just as some extra information, this friend of mine wasn't the most secure person, and was dealing with some mental health issues during our friendship, which I had offered to help with if I could (listening to her rants, offering advice/comfort, etc.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had noticed signs that this friendship was getting quite toxic around 3 years in, but never had the courage to confront her about it because I'mnot the type to do so and I really didn't want to suffer the consequences of her freaking out if I had essentially \"dumped\" her. Since I'd moved an hour away in the last year of our friendship we were almost exclusively talking online and over FaceTime, etc. After one particularily bad conversation, being the coward that I am, I didn't reply to her rant and instead just blocked her on all forms of social media.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to the next day, and she has sent me more than 20 messages on various forms of social media using alternative accounts, asking why I suddenly left the night before. I proceeed to ignore her and block all of her alt accounts that had messaged me, plus all the other ones I knew of as well. A few days later, I received messages from some of her other friends as well as a few of our mutual friends, all of which said something along the lines of \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is going to kill herself tonight because of what you did, you're such a shitty friend.\" I didn't respond to any of these either, because the fact that \\*so many\\* of these had showed up in my inbox on the same night led me to believe they were just a call for attention, and my experience with this girl in the 3.5 years we were friends is that she would often say things like this which were just empty threats. After that, I only received 2 messages from her friends, both of which begged me to take her back, and both of which I ignored. Everything was well for about 6 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few months, I received another message from her boyfriend, telling me that she really missed me that night and begging me to please give her a second chance. Feeling like an absolute asshole, I agreed to talk to her again that night. I unblocked her main account and sent her a \"hi\" message, only to be left on read. I blocked her again the next day, and moved on with my life as usual. A couple weeks later, the boyfriend sends me YET ANOTHER message that says something similar, and seeing how I still felt terrible about it, I agreed once again. SAME THING HAPPENED. I blocked her and vowed to never agree to speak to her again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was a little over a year ago. Last night, I received the same messages from her boyfriend, but merely left him on read. This morning I woke up to multiple paragraphs from the boyfriend, some of which begged me to talk to her again while most of them guilt-tripped me for not connecting with her again afterwards. He says that I should've at least told her \\*why\\* I ghosted her and left, and give her another chance at being friends. I blocked him as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit, AITA for suddenly ghosting a close friend without explaining it, and then rejecting multiple advances from people \\*other than the person I ghosted\\* to reconnect?",

      "description": "First of all the title could condemn me already (shout out to my pun lovers) but to give context back in December I was on vacation, visiting my wife for exodus after being away for a few months at NAS Pensacola. \n\nWe had pre bought tickets and reserved seats that morning for a 4pm showing of the new aquaman movie. We had no hiccups getting there, getting our tickets, snacks, and our reserved seats. The real issue should up with the people who reserved the seats next to ours, specifically a father and son. \n\nThe movie starts playing and about 10 minutes in the son, who is sitting adjacent to my right starts opening a extra large bar of Hershey cookies and creme. Which wasnt too loud and obviously no problem. The issue was the kid starts smacking his lips like no other, I mean nauseatingly obnoxiously loud. After about 5 minutes of self deliberation on how much I actually cared to focus on the movie I decided I paid for my ticket and it would be fair I get to enjoy it so I turned to the kid(looks between the age of like 16-17) and me being 22 didn't personally find it that strange to make a statement to him; and I said \"Hey brother would you mind not chewing with your mouth open I'm having a hard time focusing on the movie.\" The kid says sure and sorry, I didnt want him to think I was trying to be rude and said \"ya not trying to be rude, I really appreciate it.\"\n\nI turn to continue the movie, kinda glad that went so smoothly until about 30 seconds after that little conversation the kids father stretches over his son and says to me, \"dont tell my son what to do, he has braces and it's not his fault\". I comment back something of the sort like I wasnt trying to be rude but hes really making it hard to enjoy the movie and the guy insists on saying it's not his sons fault and I shouldnt have said anything to his kid and if I had I problem to take it up with him. I think that's so dumb though. His kid was apparently 14 and cant handle a simple keep it down request at the movies? The kid seems visibly uneasy and asked his dad to let it go and at this point i give up on this arguement anyway because the boy stopped chewing loud, problem solved and I wanna watch the movie. Although it did irritate me that I had to have an arguement with this guy over what I thought was his sons lack of manners.\n\nFast forward to the end of the movie, I had been stewing on this guys reaction but being nonconfrontational as I am I didnt care to carry on his BS so I waited until his whole family got up and started to walk from their chairs, at that moment I figured I would start getting the leg rest down and my stuff together. As I'm doing this, mind you still sitting, the father comes up to me and restates close to word for word what he had earlier, \"dont talk to my kid, he has braces and he cant help that.\" I said back, \"I think it's pretty fair I ask him not to chew so loudly, how was i suppose to know he had braces and i dont understand how that stops someone from chewing quietly. I asked your son very kindly if he would stop and he said sure and it was done, I wasnt rude and the fact you wanna come up to me after the movie after you've ushered your family away to make a scene of this is ridiculous.\" He again restates what he has said and then suggests that we take this outside and this really astonished me that this man decides he wants to fight me in the parking lot over this. I decline, I say I'm in the air force and was raised and taught not to be about that kind of crap. \n\nI did however say something of the sorts(cant remember cus I was kinda frustrated at this) that he can fuck right off and get out of my face, pointed to the door and said to get the fuck away from me. At this point my voice was raised and my wife was really just begging me to stop. He insisted on arguing but I just kept saying leave me the f alone, I dont care fuck off old man as he would try to keep arguing but with my wife being uneasy I really just wanted him to go away. So each time head try to speak with me I'd just loudly say to get the hell out of my face and leave.\n\nHe eventually left but not without saying the same damn thing he had said like 10 times as he walked out the door and into the lobby presumably out til the lot idk I didnt see him after that, I left the theater pretty quick myself.\n\nSo am AITA? My wife believes we both were being assholes but does thinking the father started it and there wasnt anything wrong with me asking the kid to not chew loud. But I thinking if this guy wouldn't leave me alone when I tried to drop it, yelling at him to leave was the best and least assholish thing I could do, rather than fight him.\n\n\nSo tl;dr: I made a 40 something man mad at the movies cus I politely asked his son to not chew so loud. AITA for going off/blowing up on said father after he decides to egg me on, get in my face, threaten me and repeating himself?",

      "description": "I hope this I see the right type of post for this sub— I think it’s maybe potentially rude than truly assholeish and I definitely don’t think the other person is an ass, I’m just looking for your thoughts.\n\n\nFor context, I look like a Nazi Germany poster—Hitler probably would have creamed his pants if he saw my family, we’re all the stereotypical tall pale blue eyed blondes, mostly due to our Nordic ancestry. I recently got to visit a Scandinavian country and once we got out into the countryside, it was kinda hilarious and cool seeing most people around that looked so similarly to me we could be related. We’d walk into a cafe and see a sea of towheads, I felt like I could just walk behind any random family and blend in as their own. And I wasn’t tall any more, I was more or less normal sized and tables/countertops seemed built for me! When I got home I was mentioning to a friend of mine (South Asian ancestry) that it was kinda cool going somewhere where everyone looked like they were related to me and I thought it was really funny. I noticed her starting to look uncomfortable and realized I sounded like Hitler. I know that my intent wasn’t “we need to build an ethnostate!”, in fact after the initial coolness it got kinda weird, but I understand how people could interpret it that way. She’s a dear friend to me and one of my favorite people in the world, I’m worried she saw the whole conversation as a white girl talking happily about a place with no brown people and thought I would be happier without her or her family. Should I stop telling that vacation anecdote or do you think that most people would understand what I was getting at?",

She grew up with always having dogs, so is experienced in raising and caring for dogs. She moved in with me a year ago and then we got both of our cats after that.  Both cats dumped on us. We have raised from the brink of death back to health. They absolutely adore us, but favor me over her when it comes to bedtime and couch vegging.\n\nShe recently expressed interest in adopting a dog. So she could have companionship when off work as she works 3 12 hour shifts a week. \nI of course said yes, so we started looking to adopt at the local shelter, we found a dog after a week of searching and the shelter said that she was great with other dogs and cats alike. \n\nWe placed the application for adoption and were approved immediately, so we brought the dog home (chow chow mix) \n\nThe first day we spent with a professional dog trainer helping us do introductions, the dog at first didn't care about the cats, but after 3 days she has started growling whenever she sees them, lunging snarling, etc. Basically If we didn't have the dog leashed she wouldve attacked and tried to kill the cats. \n\nWe tried separating them into rooms but nothing has worked. I told her I dont want to see our cats torn to shreds if our super visions lapsed. We never leave the dog with the cats obviously, as she is crate trained. \n\nJust today the dog has lunged at one of our cats snarling and growling. \n\nI told her we cant keep the dog and need to bring it back to the shelter as it's only a matter of time before a cat ends up dead or seriously injured. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like I'm ruining what could be a great friendship with her new dog, but at the same time I dont want our cats to end up dead.",

      "description": "(on mobile so sorry for any typos and disorganization)\n\nso basically we started dating freshman year, and stayed together for a while. We didn’t get to see each other in person often, so a lot of our relationship was over rabbit, Snapchat, and text. I was always a little closed off emotionally, and even though I tried, it was hard to open up to her. About a year and a half after we’d been dating, she started asking me why and I finally admitted to her that I’d been through some past sexual abuse that made relationships hard for me.\n\nAfter this whole interaction, she basically dropped off the face of the earth for 4 months. I reached out once or twice, but I didn’t want to push it and make her uncomfortable. After a while I finally snapchatted her asking why she wouldn’t talk to me, and she told me that she was trying to give me space. I then apologized for dumping my baggage on her, but she completely ignored that and started going on about this romanticized relationship she’d built up in her head over time. She talked about how she wanted to sit on roofs and hold hands and general cliche romance things like that, but it was off topic and seemed like she kept trying to change the subject. Every time I tried to have a conversation with her about it she would just brush past. That same night I ended up breaking up with her over Snapchat, and we haven’t talked since. I feel terrible about it, because we were close friends before. So AITA here?\n\n",

      "description": "I know that the title is vague considering the circumstances, but something doesn't feel right about how I handled the situation. Please read the following and judge for yourself.\n\nSome background: I have an 8 year old son. His mother and I are not together. We haven't been together for 4 years. Things have been civil where I pay her $400 a month (With no court agreement or anything) and get him a little over 1/3rd of each month. We can be around each other for a couple of hours at a time MAX and things go smooth for the most part. \n\nThe other night she phoned me obviously very drunk and I could tell she was looking for a booty call. She never stated that or anything, but sometomes you can just tell. She invited me over. I have not touched her in years. She is recently single and is one of those people who absolutely needs to have someone with her 24/7. I am in no way interested in sexual or intimate relations with her. I was more interested in spending time with my Son for an hour or two before he went to bed. So I journeyed on over to their house as it's a few miles away.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of me being there, she let it slip that my Son was with her when she was at Applebees slamming dollar margaritas and that she drove all the way home wasted after, and that she hadn't been caught for years and she was the best drunk driver. Before I blew up in front of my son, I calmly got up said my goodbyes to him and told his mother that we needed to have a talk after the kiddo went to sleep. \n\nWhen I got her on the phone the next day, she immediately started denying any part of the conversation and didn't want to take responsibility for her actions. I was furious. It also happend to be the day that I pay her half of the monthly $400 to see him this coming weekend. The conversation then got turned over to her demanding the biweekly payment. I told her that before I send the $200 via venmo, she needed to admit ahe was wrong driving drunk with him and to promise that it will NEVER happen again. This of course pissed her off even more and she threatened to block me and never let me see him again unless I paid right away. I was pissed and threatened to call DHS because I am concerned for his safety. I have since been blocked by her and am wondering how I should proceed? \n\nI feel like she doesn't understand that she is in the wrong and the fact that she is using him against me. She makes me feel like the asshole for not sending the payment, but all I asked for was for her to own up and take responsibility and to promise to never put my Son in danger like that again. Am I the asshole????\n\nI am aware we need to set something up through the courts and state so she can't pull this type of shit, but it has been easier so far to go our own way. \n\n",

      "description": "I'm (17F) the valedictorian at my high school and, generally, the valedictorians give a speech at graduation. I hate public speaking. I've taken a public speaking class before and I think that I'm capable of actually giving the speech, but ,to me, it will never be worth the amount of anxiety and stress that I'll have to go through in the coming months. I've been feeling depressed lately and having to work on this speech is making it a lot worse. At this point, I would rather my parents take my phone, Xbox, and laptop for months than actually give this speech.\n\nThe principal has told me that it's totally fine if I don't want to give the speech. The problem is that my parents really want me to do it. I honestly don't know why.\n\nI have siblings that were valedictorians and they gave a speech, so it's not like I'm the first/only one to be valedictorian. Basically, my reasoning is that my senior year/graduation should be something that I enjoy (or at least not be miserable during) because I've worked hard and this speech is making that very difficult. I don't think I'm just being lazy because I've had to do a lot of work to be valedictorian and I know how to do things I don't want to do.\n\nMy parents are amazing. They're really good to me and I don't want to disappoint them. I've already asked them if I have to do the speech and they said yes, but they can't force me to do it. They've given me so much and I really don't want to hurt them, but I think I need to advocate for myself.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole if I decide to not do the speech?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

December is a costly month and difficult to set savings aside for us.\n\nFB's birthday is approaching, and where we live it's the norm that someone else takes responsibility for planning the party--well, at our age it's now a dinner and night out. FB's sister-in-law, who we work with (SO and I), is planning our friends' party (also noteworthy, we work with FB; it's a very small community despite being a sizable city).\n\nSO and I don't associate with people from work outside of business hours other than FB. Since FB's SiL is planning the party, SO pointed out that it's going to be mostly people from work. Because SO is pregnant, we're hoping to avoid a dinner and night out, which we know will be expensive due to particular circumstances--plus the fast-approaching holidays. So, in addition to not wanting to see people from work, and thinking of our family's long-term goals, we offered a more intimate setting with FB and FB's SO. We discretely asked FB if this would be alright and FB agreed.\n\nBirthday dinner one night, hanging together at our place or FB's place the next. Perfect. We offer to cook dinner and host, or are willing to travel if they'd rather host and let us cook at their place. FB's birthday, FB's decision. Totally cool with us, don't have to hang with people from work and can hopefully set savings aside in a costly month.\n\nThe day after casually mentioning that we don't really do things with people from work other than FB, FB invited us to dinner and a night out with a mutual friend. We also work with mutual friend and there are certain circumstances that brought us all together that I can't get into (sorry I can't go into this, it would be a dead giveaway if FB sees this).\n\nAITA for declining an invite out to celebrate FB's birthday on a separate night out?",

      "description": "Some context: My dad started his own business about a decade ago and it took off. By consequence, he makes a lot of money but is often working 60+ hours a week.  \nMy mom has taken this as an opportunity to stay home. She hasn't worked in years, doing about 2-3 hours of volunteer work a week.  \nI'm a student in my junior year of high school taking advanced classes. Between school and homework, it's about 50 hours a week, plus about 10 hours of extracurriculars. As a result, I value my vacation time enormously, as it is the rare opportunity to relax.  \nWe are comfortably upper-middle-class to rich. We could afford a house cleaner easily. However, my mom says that's elitist and every family should be able to clean their own house.  \nI think that, because she is home the vast majority of the time, I am nearly independent, and she made the choice not to hire a house cleaner, she should do all the housework. She argues that since I live in the house, I should do my equal share. When I help, she acts like it was my responsibility. I believe she should see this as a favor from me.  \nI am on vacation this week, and so she expects me to do a significant amount of chores (about 5 hours' worth over the next two days) while she rests. I understand she does the housework normally and deserves a vacation also, but I think that's her job and if she doesn't like it, she should get my dad to pay me or a house cleaning service. If nothing else, I think she should be far more grateful than she's been. However, I've been told that housework is far more exhausting than a kid could understand. So, AITA for thinking this way?  \nTLDR: SAHM is the only one who's home often and she says house cleaning services are elitist. She expects me to do part of the housework. I don't think this is my responsibility—if I do it, it's a favor. AITA?",

      "description": "Yea, well this is kinda straightforward ish, and there are definitely parts where I am 100% an asshole. We have been dating almost 3 years at this point.\n\nAnyways, Yesterday my gf woke up feeling dizzy, with weakness in her right arm and leg. She went straight to emerge, and got checked in. The doctors ran a bunch of tests (CT scans, MRI's, Bloodwork). I was at work and headed over right after when I was done, reliving her dad who had been with her 10+ hours. I get her some dinner, we settle in for the night.\n\nDuring the night they checked her vitals repeatedly, and we both dozed on and off. Her in the hospital bed, and me with a pillow on the linoleum floor when I wasn't sitting worrying my ass off.\n\nWe wake up, I buy her and I some breakfast, and we hang for a bit, before they take us down for her MRI. As we go down she hands me her phone to hold while shes in (you can probably see where this is going). I sit in the hallway while she gets scanned (takes about an hour). I feel her phone go off once or twice, so I open it (she willingly gave me her passcode, multiple times because I have shit memory most of the time), answer her dad, and then go to close. Except I see that she has Whatsapp installed, when we don't use it to converse at all. \n\nTo make a long story short, I opened it, discovered that within the past 3 month she had reconnected with a guy she blocked for being 'too flirty', and proceeded to send him nudes on multiple occasions, looking like she was seeking validation and to be called beautiful (which I fucking did every day! Every time she sent me even just selfies I would compliment her...). And judging by the dates she did this on weekends we were even together!\n\nI message her dad on my phone, telling him what I found and asking him to come relive me (he was going to come with overnight stuff for her later in the day). I keep my cool until shes out, and get her safely back to her room and settled before confronting her about what I found. I don't yell or anything, mostly just cry like a baby while asking her why :/.\n\nI waited until her dad was there so she wasn't alone, and then booked it out, sobbing. I grabbed an uber home. I asked her dad about her results (clear so far, they still aren't sure whats wrong), and we discussed what she did a bit more (with her just repeating the same stuff, that she doesn't know WHY she did it.). I haven't talked to he anymore, I did apologize for making her dad rush out though.\n\nSo yea, am I the asshole? For dumping her and giving her more stress while shes in? I would have faked it if I could, but I just couldn't. Is this even something valid to dump her over? ",

      "description": "Let me preface this by saying I absolutely love dogs. I’ve owned them most of my life, and even though I don’t have one right now, I will probably  be getting one within the next six months or so.  With that, I’ve always had a strong emphasis on training my dogs to get them to be well mannered. \n\nThat said, my roommate’s dog is driving me up the wall. She’s a Aussie/pit mix (mostly pit), and she’s super sweet. However, my roommate has made zero attempts to train or otherwise contain his dog aside from teaching her to go in her crate at night. This has resulted in a number of really bad behavioral issues. \n\nShe constantly pees and poops in the house, even though he takes her outside regularly. She destroys anything that is left out in the common areas, including our couch and a TV that I had. She jumps up on everyone and loves to bite our heels, which makes getting out of the house with clean business clothes (or any clothes for that matter) impossible. And to top it off, she loves to run around the house LITERALLY bouncing off the walls at all times (including 2-3am), which means that me and my other roommate can never leave our doors open without risking her running and jumping on my bed/desk/etc. \n\nI finally told him that he has GOT to take his dog to obedience training, or keep her in his room or on a leash at all times. He didn’t take that very well and told me that if she’s bothering me, I should deal with her myself. \n\nAm I being an asshole for thinking that he should address his out of control dog given that my other roommate and I can’t use the majority of the space we’re supposed to be sharing?",

During that time he has spent long periods simply bedridden and skipping school, often in moods, not eating, not socialising and generally just unproductive and not \"present\".\n\nI stuck with him during this period, trying to encourage him and offer support where I could. Whether that be talking to him or dragging him out of the house to have a meal or go to an event occasionally.\n\nLast year, having left school with minimal grades, he managed to secure a fairly decent opportunity at a well-respected firm. Things seemed on the up and it appeared that the position had given him some purpose. He was lively and social and most importantly, getting out of bed and leaving the house. \n\nHowever, recently I have seen aspects of his previous depressive phase creeping back in. He has begun to oversleep and miss work days, likely reporting himself as ill when in reality he's just laying in bed till 4pm. I had a go at him about it, essentially calling him lazy and unsympathetic to the family's feelings and he came to me later and said his depression was getting him down.\n\nAt this point I honestly just felt a bit helpless and frustrated. I wanted to shout that \"there is nothing wrong with your life\". \n\nAITA?",

Sometimes it's less stressful to just sleep or get errands done that I've put off then constantly worrying about replying to everyone.\n\n In high school I had a good group of friends but never was one of those people who cared about social status and things, so keeping friends happy wasn't usually hard for me. \n\nAs I've gotten older, and it's getting harder to see everyone, over the years people's patience with me seems to be growing thin and I always feel the need to say sorry for not replying in a timely manner and not seeing people for a while. I understand their p.o.v... , like my one couple friends had a baby before Christmas and I still haven't met the baby or talked with them (or anyone else)  too much for the past few months and I'm pretty sure my friends are upset with me about it.. I am planning meet up with them tomorrow because of it, but still.\n\nI don't know how to feel. I feel like an asshole because yeah I'm getting bothered with everyone's expectations of me when all I am trying to do is focus on making my life for myself (and trying to do what I want for a change) and everyone is more concerned with seeing/hearing from me, but at the same time I am glad they care and I do want to see and hear from them, I just want them to be understanding of my time and how I use it too.. and if that means not talking for a few months, then so be it.. right..? \n\nSo guys, am I the asshole for not putting more time into my friends and family?\n\nTo sum it up: I am a super busy college student working to get her life together and I don't have a lot of time for others or myself. My friends and family are getting upset for not seeing me as much as they want. And I don't know if I should feel bad or not. ",

      "description": "AITA for not allowing my ex-husbands girlfriend babysit my 5 year old daughter when he works weekend shifts during his parenting weekend?\n\nFor additional context, in our parenting plan he asked for every other weekend and alternate holidays (and to not have to pay child support, that's it). The girlfriend is the woman he left me for (moved out of my house and into hers). We've been divorced for a year. But in that time all is not smooth sailing with his girlfriend. He's been kicked out of her house several times, one time left him homeless for about 6 weeks. In the last 6 months I've been informed that all is well and he's never been more in love. \n\nHe works in a warehouse as a temp (it's his 5th job since we've divorced), and often \"has\" to work weekends. To hear him tell it, he goes 21 days or more without a day off and no choice in the matter. He wants me to leave my daughter with his girlfriend while he is working (5am-whenever he gets off). I refuse to do so, instead I keep my daughter and then drop her off at his house once he's home. Then at bedtime, I pick her up (since he's working Sundays too).  I then deliver her back to his house Sunday once he's off work and pick her up from him at bedtime.  Every now and again (maybe once every 6 weeks) he'll have Sunday off and keep our daughter overnight (in which case she sleeps on the couch, because the other bedroom belongs to his girlfriends sons). I typically don't know until the day of, when he'll be off work and if I need to pack her a bag for the night.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked him for 48 hours notice of his work schedule if it impacts his parenting time so that I can plan our weekends and be prepared. He told me that he can't do that, and since I'm unreasonable about not letting his girlfriend babysit, that my plans are my problem. So AITA?",

      "description": "Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLittle bit background, My wife and I are grad students in US and we hang out and travel in a group of 8. In the trips, one of us (referring him as X) takes the lead, does all the hotel, car, air bookings. He has been here 4 years more than us and is more knowledgeable about rentals and places. He generally puts the amount spent, and we split it 8 ways. We have never asked questions about the amount before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis spring break we planned for a Florida trip. X booked a 12 seat van by himself. My wife and I were a bit surprised because of 1) not sharing with group, 2) for booking 12 seat van for 8 people, 3) finding cheaper options even with 2 separate SUVs ($400). We shared in the group the alternatives. We suggested canceling the car reservation and book later together. X then mentioned that he fully paid and booked it, so all is done. Now at this point, my wife got a bit stubborn. Even with $50 cancellation fee, we could have got fair deals here. She also said the website should have a cancel button online. She asked for the car rental company's name and reference. X did not give that, he was changing topics. At this point, he said he is sorry and is paying extra $50 from his pocket. He mentioned this should be the end of discussion here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were struck, since no one asked money, and he does get to say end of discussion. So, after 1-2 nights, all 7 of us except X (he lives a little bit far from us) was having a hangout, and my wife asked X to join. When X came, she politely started the topic again and asked for reference number/ receipt for car rental. X again started to change the topic, walk around, take smoke breaks. But she was persistent after about 1 hour X finally sent the email to her. There was a Cancel button in the email. She clicked on it, and canceled in a minute. X said that it did not let him do it before. We didn't say anything and decided to get 2 separate SUVs. We left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediately after leaving my wife says she is not going on the trip and showed in the receipt that nothing was paid. Only a $50 was paid for insurance. Also, it was booked for 5 days for 4-day trip. We could not make any reasons out of this, so my wife decided it was better to stay clear or it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe mentioned in the group thread, that due to personal reasons, we won't be going. We will cover the lost expenses (Airbnb cancellation fee, air tickets). After we said that, 2 of others in the group also canceled. It got awkward and all 8 of us sat together again. We initially said some personal reasons. After others pushed, we asked for everyone's consent (including X). We then discussed the issue. Everyone saw the receipts. It got weird and X left in the middle without saying anything. He has not given any reasons for the whole thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for ruining a whole group of friends and canceling a trip? Also, what might be the possible motivation behind X's activities?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to break up with my bf for a girl, cause he's \"a stereotypical straight dude?\"",
      "description": "My bf is an alright dude. He's my best friend who is a guy, and I appreciate him lots, but recently I've been thinking that I made too many rash decisions along the way in pursuing him. \n\nFirst off, I'm bi. This relationship was my first, and I was the one to ask him out. I got rejected (for good reason) at first, but somehow we ended up becoming gf/bf anyways. He says he loves me, and I used to love him but I think I may have fallen out of love.\n\n\nThe reason is because, well, I guess it was mostly unfortunate circumstance. I just wasn't prepared for guys to be so, base, I guess. No offense. We were pretty good for the first couple months, though he would joke a lot about my small boobs, like small depreciating jokes, but enough to make it known that he didn't think they were a plus, at least. That was a pretty unfortunate shock, because I actually really like how small and non-womanly they are, cause I *love* androgynous looks, unique looks, bodies that are like fine art. I didn't mind at first, it's just different preferences, but then later he kept revealing stuff that made me realize just how *different* he was. Like, he was into girls with &gt;C cups (once he actually told me, post-sex, that if there was a me with bigger boobs, he would date her...and the sad thing was that later I asked him about it, and I think basically this was his way of trying to show that his attraction was \"more genuine, not only in the physical sense.\" While internally, I'm like, \"I'm gonna take it how he intended, but boy, you cannot get more stereotypical guy mindset than this...\", again, I *prefer* the look of no boobs to boobs, fucking A) He's, I dunno, just another straight guy with hormones, and looking back, I'm not sure why I expected something other than what he is at face value. It's not his fault or anything, it's just, so goddamn disappointing, I guess. I thought he would be more like me, more open to not standard guy-view types of beauty. Again, I don't know why I expected this. Like to me, he is the most beautiful dude on this planet. I love his unique features, I find him sexy because his face is memorable, even though maybe others wouldn't. But my view of beauty is: fat girls, skinny girls, fat guys, skinny girls so long as they've got something different about their face. Guys have a really limited definition in comparison, and again, I'm not that, and I guess I dunno, it hurts a little. I thought I would be considered beautiful, at least by the one I loved, cause I don't really understand how you can love someone without thinking they're beautiful. But I guess I'm wrong. He tells me he looks at other girls, and that he can't help it, it's just that if a girl walks by with nice big titties or if a girl that's physically his type walks by, he's gonna look. Like, yeah, I get that, I get that it's out of his control. But he didn't really ever look at me...I didn't catch his eye, I won over his heart. He finds me attractive, 'cause I've got an attractive personality. He thinks that's OK, and that's normal, and I ought to be satisfied by that. But in my way of loving, that's called settling. There's supposed to always be something about your partner that you find beautiful (their eye color, the fine shape of their eyebrows or their eyes, the cute way one cheek is a little plumper than the other) that doesn't fade with age. How else will you still find the other attractive as you age and change? Anyways, I explained this to him, and he understands that I'm different but can't relate. I guess after learning that I'm starting to fall out of love with him.\n\nAnyways, that brings me to my main point. I've seen lesbian/bi girls (and one bi/regular dude, idk) look at me in the way you know they mean business. I read online that lesbians think more like I do, although I realize this may not be true for all lesbians. Am I an asshole if I break up with my boyfriend (also best friend) now just because I don't want to have to deal with someone who has a different taste in beauty? Don't hold back, I feel like an asshole.",

And it was always great fun. But lately he's been getting cranky every time we play. Then he leaves and goes to join other people (who he say play way worse than me) and goes to laugh and behave fun. It's come to the point where he'll go play with others and not even ask me to play. I feel like I'm second choice, like he doesn't want to play with me and I don't get why he's cranky with me but fun with others. To add to this, he's a bad texter, he'll send me one word replies and I don't expect him to constantly message me. But when he's playing he'll pretty much stops texting at all. Which again, I get. It just feels like I'm being a burden. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI try to talk to him about this, explain that he's making me feel like I'm the second choice. But when we're together in real life, he'll be all over me. He keeps saying he wants us and he's showing that he does when it comes to love. It's just online that's awful.   \n\n\nI already said we should probably stop playing together or talking to eachother online but this is just causing me so much anxiety. But he's saying we should be able to do things together and he doesn't think it'll work between us if we don't game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're young as hell and I know this is such a stupid situation, but I'm trying to get some thoughts from other people and see what I can change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My girlfriend (22) and I (26) have been together for about 2 years. We make it a habit of talking on the phone every night ever since we started getting to know each other. To be honest I don’t really like doing it at all. I am just doing it just because she loves talking on the phone. There are some nights where I just want to be alone and have some me time and I would never get it. There have been days where we would spend the entire day out together but she still expects me to call her at night. There have been nights where I will be out with my friends and she would be waiting at home just for me to call and talk, even after telling her not to because I will be late. This would make me just leave early cause I will start feeling bad that she is waiting for me. I mean I get that she really wants to talk and all but I have tried telling her this and she would just get pissed and say things like I don’t care about her. It has gone to a point where I rarely meet my friends at night nowadays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings started getting worse recently. Over the past few months every single week we would fight on the phone over small issues. She would fall asleep on the phone and I would wake her up. She would wake up and be all cranky and shit and start yelling at me. Telling me why did I wake her up knowing that it irritates her so much. Some other shit like when she would fall asleep, wake up and ask me why am I keeping quiet. Wtf am I supposed to do? Talk to myself when she is sleeping? And she would blame it on me saying that she fell asleep because I kept quiet. And if something like this sparks her off she would go ape shit over me, no matter how I try to calm her down and talk to her properly. I know the examples are all pretty immature and childish but there are many other stupid dumb issues that she would get mad or irritated at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really love her and all but things like this that happen is just making me avoid talking to her on the phone at night. I just feel that a lot of our fights could have been avoided if we just don’t talk on the phone.  So, am I the asshole here? ",

Dad smokes in the basement despite me repeatedly asking him not to.  I can smell it upstairs.  A couple weeks ago, I came home and Dad had clearly been smoking in the house.  I confronted him, he claimed he had been listening at the back door and stuck his head in (bullshit) the back of the house was saturated with smoke, but he lied anyway).\n\nTonight we had supper started, he was smoking in the basement.  I have a few beers in me, so I confronted him.  He said something about how he needs to find a house where he can smoke bc it's cold outside (no sympathy from me), which is his normal way of threatening me.  I told him please do if it keeps our son from getting asthma.\n\nSo when supper is done and kid and I are eating, kid keeps asking where Dad is (Dad was outside smoking in his truck to prove a point to Mom).  I went and hollered to Dad that his boy would like to eat with him, Dad made a bunch of BS excuses which included that I must not want him here (eye roll).  Son and I ate our supper together.\n\nNow Dad is trying to act like it was a small misunderstanding, looking for scrubbers for the basement.  Mom is not impressed.",

      "description": "Been dating her about 8 months now. She has some issues with her dad from her past that have caused some affection issues as well as issues with expressing emotion that have both caused problems in our relationship. For example, hugging family members or anyone other than myself makes her extremely uncomfortable and come time around thanksgiving and Christmas she gets a bit bitter and depressed. I am a very understanding person and genuinely want to help her and help our relationship. \n\nAbout 5 weeks ago I suggested she go see a therapist. I did so in a very respectful way and she was extremely open to the idea and agreed she needed to. She even asked her mom to send her some names of people she could see (her mom knows people in the field). \n\nFast forward to today I have mentioned it to her a couple times since then in passing just to check on where she’s at with it. Both times she said has names but hasn’t made an appointment. Today I made it a little more clear how serious I was about this and how important it was for not only her but for our relationship as well. She got a bit irritated and said to not bother her about it and that she didn’t want to. I got a bit frustrated and told her that she needed to make it a priority because those issues were bleeding into our relationship. She reluctantly said she would go. She has a habit of avoiding uncomfortable things like this so I feel like that may have been what she was doing.\n\nI kind of feel like an asshole but I’m not sure. What do you all think?",

      "description": "using a throwaway just incase any parties recgonize themselves.\n\nI [17F] just recently got a SO [18M] and I'm planning on not telling my parents about him until they confront me, if ever. There are two reasons ultimately: I have privacy issues, and teasing issues. Let me explain:\n\nAs a kid, my parents are super protective of me. To the point where my father threatened to completely turn my phone off with when I was on youtube watching a staring contest video. There have been multiple incidents like that. Luckily, my dad has cooled off since, but with it I have privacy issues and anxiety. I have trouble telling anyone anything. I'm getting better I think, but they're still there. Infact, the stress of keeping my first SO hidden from my parents (I wasn't allowed to date yet) kept gnawing at me to the point that we eventually broke up. It's been three years.\n\nNow onto the teasing.\n\nMy mom is a very big teaser. She likes to pick fun at nearly everything she can. Infact, my mom still refers to me by a name she used for me when I was a baby. In fifth grade when I had my first crush, my mom teased me relentlessly. Infact, she still does tease me over it.\n\nWhen I was a baby, my grandfather and great uncle started referring to me with a rhyme, a two worded name. It was my first name, and another name that sounds similar to it (just change the first letter and you have the second word), similar to \"Moose Goose\". They still call me by this name. I'll explain more about the rhyme later.\n\nNow here's where the teasing all ties together. I've known my SO for years, most of my life infact, so my mom already knows him. I know my mom would definitively tease me about him if she knew. Now here's where everything get's better. His last name is very very similar to the second word of the rhyme my grandfather and great uncle refer to me as. Since I've known my SO for most of my life, my grandfather and great uncle and mother all know his name. Infact, my mother is the only one of the three to refer to him by his first name instead of last name when talking about him. I don't blame my grandfather and great uncle for really only remembering his existence because of his name, but I wish they'd still think of his first name first.\n\nI know that if my parents knew I was dating my SO, they'd treat the both of us, but mostly him, differently. I'm afraid of my mom teasing the both of us, both seperately and together. I'm afraid of my dad looking at him as a potential danger to his daughter, not someone who would make her happy.\n\nOh, and my SO knows two things I've listed this post. 1) My parents don't know, and I don't want them to know. 2) My mom teases me. Everything else I haven't told him, infact I haven't told him WHY or HOW my mom teases me. I want to, but I'm yet again afraid as to what he'll say about it.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom..\n\n**Backstory**: s/o drank heavily for all of their 20s (10+ years), and from my perspective the drinking took a steep nose dive after the loss of 3 grandparents and their best friend in a short amount of time. In talking with my therapist, the drinking may have been the solution for their problems (not having other/better/healthy coping mechanisms) S/O, tangential to these coping problems, doesn't like to discuss difficult things* and has a history of lying to avoid hard topics (*this might be a \"learned\" trait from family? I'll touch on this later). An example of this is lying about having something \"bad\" happen to cover bad behavior (historically, s/o would lie about a health condition or the health of a family member to avoid conflict with me). Please note these lies have ceased since The Event. In hindsight, I was not fully aware of the extent of the drinking or lying, and I admit that some of the things I was aware of I chose not to argue about (noticed hard liquor was disappearing quicker than it should have been, etc.)\n\n**The Event**: long story short; s/o suffered from a major seizure due to alcohol withdrawals. Seizure lead to 2 dislocated shoulders, 2 broken humerus bones, 3 shoulder surgeries, 13 days admitted to the hospital (4 days on respirator, ~8 days in ICU), a slurry of medications to help them literally survive the withdrawal, acute pancreatitis, acute liver damage... Thankfully, s/o has amazing insurance, is fully recovered from the physical impacts of The Event, and has been sober for 13+ months. *Over the course of The Event, s/o's family struggled to talk openly about the issues at hand (did not want to tell extended family/friends the truth), and did not have a great sense of the magnitude of the situation (respirators, ICU, and talks of removing part of pancreas are BAD imo). I was left to follow up with hospital staff on imaging, labs, asking hard questions, etc. I've been diagnosed with acute PTSD from The Event and have been meeting with a therapist to work through the nightmares and anxiety hospitals still cause me (not great, considering I work in the healthcare industry). \n\n**The Ultimatum**: after The Event s/o moved in with their parents for ~5 weeks to heal/help with post-op recovery, before moving back to the city we live together (I travel for work and would not have been able to to provide the care/assistance s/o needed post-op). Before s/o moved home, we discussed the 2 items I needed to agree to renew our lease together this past summer... No more drinking, and that s/o would seek therapy; either through our health insurance or through AA.\n\n**The interim**: s/o has been sober, but hasn't taken action to seek therapy. S/O went to AA a few times, but it wasn't their cup of tea (fine with me). S/O saw one therapist via health insurance and didn't \"like the therapist\" (also fine with me). I have, on 4-5 occasions, brought up that I wish s/o would seek counseling so s/o can (most importantly) find peace with The Event, (second most importantly) discuss/develop coping skills to help in the future so s/o doesn't self medicate again, and (third most importantly) take some of the burden off of me, as their friends/family don't broach the subject as often as I do to \"check in\". From my perspective, I worry that my s/o hasn't really \"gone through\" the grief, etc. that lead to self medication, and I worry that my s/o would land themself in the same/worse spot if s/o doesn't learn new skills. S/O thinks I am being unfair, because \"just because [I] have liked therapy, doesn't mean it's the right thing for [s/o]\". \n\n**Worth noting (I think)**: I am so SO proud of how far my s/o has come. I make a point to celebrate/discuss progress each month on the anniversary of The Event and have encouraged s/o to be proud of the path they've taken... I make efforts to check in on s/o \"how are you doing?\" And s/o is admittedly resistant to discussing The Event and their progress because they are ashamed of the whole situation. It makes me sad for my s/o, because as I tell them, you can't change what Happened but you can be proud of how you reacted.. also worth noting, my family and friends are fully aware of the entire situation, and agree that my s/o and I have a healthy, strong, relationship/support the relationship. \n\n**The asshole?**: Am I micromanaging my s/o too hard? We've been discussing marriage/buying a house/moving/etc. quite often recently and I keep mentally coming back to The Ultimatum that has been avoided. Because I want my s/o to find peace? Because I need it to find peace? Because I want to see s/o set up for success no matter what? *Yes* *yes* and *yes*.\n\n**TL;DR; s/o is a recovering alcoholic, and doing a great job (13+ months, yay!) But s/o continually pushes back my requests to seek formal therapy/outlet. Am I the asshole for continuing to push s/o to therapy, even though s/o is rocking sobriety?**",

      "description": "Bit of a back story. So I have this cousin, who I shall call \"E\" who is 21, loving guy,  big heart, is very supportive of his family, but very unreliable because of his girlfriend. His girlfriend who I'll call Emma, is an emotionally and physically abusive bitch, basically steals his money, as she refuses to work, will constantly fight with him and doesn't have the decency to do that in private. My whole problem with him is, he constantly will break up and get back the next day, or he'll ghost his entire family including me, one of the only friends he has for months, sometimes up to a year. \n\nDue to recent events in the family including losing my father to a heart attack, I've decided to just cut him off as I view him nothing more than a lost cause/unneeded stress at this point. I talked with my aunt about this and she was very much against it saying he's young and that eventually he'll learn from this, but in my eyes he's old enough at this point, and should've gotten his situation figured out, she's really nothing more than a parasite.  Don't get me wrong I love my cousin to death, he means the world to me, he's basically the only true friend i have in this world or so I think, but I feel like he just has his head too far up this girls ass to realize what he's doing to his family. \n\nTLDR: Cousin is blind with love, for a girl who abuses him and drains him of money, I want to cut him off because its caused me stress and problems for years, family thinks I'm the asshole for thinking this way.",

      "description": "TLDR; I need to be alone sometimes and my mom says that I am being rude, selfish, and thinks that something is wrong when I just need time to decompress. AITA?\n\nI just finished nursing school about a week ago. Something I learned about myself over the past year is that I need a day or two in between finishing classes and going on break. Without time to myself, I bring my stress and other baggage home and I am an asshole to the people around me. I give myself a day or two to journal and allow myself to decompress basically. \n\nNow, my mother specifically does not seem to understand this concept. I have explained to her multiple times that I just need to be by myself to detach from school. I clarify that I’m not mad at her or anyone else. I’m completely fine. \n\nShe has continually been saying things like, “You’re not being yourself”, and, “Why don’t you want to talk to the ones that love you the most?”\n\nSimilarly to separating school from home, I have to separate myself from my family and just be alone for a day or even a couple hours. I live with 9 people (7 siblings and 2 parents...yes, all my siblings are from the same parents) and sometimes I need to be by myself, which is hard in such a large family. I think that is pretty reasonable to want to be deprecate, especially at my age. (22M)\n\nYesterday, I told my mom that I needed to be left alone because I am socially exhausted and she started back asking all these questions again. I keep having to clarify that I’m ok and I’m not mad at her, which is fine. I understand that she is my mom and that she’s wants the best for me. However, after explaining myself she insists something is wrong and that I’m being rude and selfish.\n\nThis has happened multiple times over the past year and I don’t know how to feel about it all.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Obligatory \"this happened yesterday\", and extra-obligatory throwaway for my own sanity. This isn't a debate on whether my family should be Muslim, lets start there. This is also a little long. Tldr at the end.\n\nOkay, some background. My family is Muslim and multiracial. My mom, along with a couple of my siblings and I, are white. My stepfather is brown, and my other siblings are mixed. My mom and sisters wear a headscarf, which is a personal decision they decided on in their own time. We converted to Islam back in the early 2000s. \n\nI was standing in line with my sisters and a woman and her children, about 7 and 12, were staring at us. She looked at us for a long time, before coming up to my sisters (13, 16) and demanding to know if they were Muslim. They said yes, and she immediately started asking them questions. \n\n\"Are you girls married?\"\n\n\\-No, they said, we're 13 and 16. \n\n\"Does your dad hit you? Does he beat your mom? Because I believe hitting women is like hitting children, it's completely unforgivable.\"\n\n\\-No? Obviously not? We're fine.\n\nMy sisters were uncomfortable, and she was pretending I (I'm a teenage male) wasn't there. When my sisters started to ignore her, she switched gears. \"Who's that?\" She asked, gesturing to our younger sibling, who is biracial.  \n\n\\-They're our little sibling.\n\nShe shook her head a little and said something like, \"so you're that kind of family.\" I felt like she was just trying to antagonize us or something, and I admit that I took the bait.\n\nIt didn't at all sound like she was legitimately checking on my sisters so much as trying to intimidate them.\n\nHer kids were listening to the whole thing. It was getting on my nerves, but it wasn't anything we hadn't dealt with before, but that last comment really rubbed me the wrong way. A lot of people stare at us when we're all together, and ask me especially weird prying questions, so it's not like I haven't heard it before, but for some reason it really pissed me off. I don't know if she meant it the way I interpreted it or not, but I immediately snapped.\n\n\"Wow, fuck you.\" I said, and she stared at me. I said something like, \"Really, you're being a huge bitch. You need to back off.\"\n\nShe told me that I was the problem with people today. That I'm rude, disrespectful, all that, but she relented and backed off to talk to her husband (I'm assuming), and her kids looked like they wanted to cry. My sisters (and later, my mother) were appalled by what I said. They said my behavior probably ruined her perception of Muslims forever, and I should have kept my cool. I felt good about defending my siblings in the moment, but now I'm kind of embarrassed. \n\nTLDR; Woman harassed my headscarf-wearing sisters and suggested my family was somehow immoral for being multiracial, and I told her she was a bitch in front of her kids. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "It's pretty lengthy and in-depth but I will try my best to summarize events. Hopefully there's a tl;dr at the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2016\\] GF was supposed to graduate at a tech uni but still needed to finish a few classes. She was able to get them written off as 'incomplete' and even allowed to walk for graduation when others who hadn't completed courses weren't. She did not finish those classes by the time the fall semester rolled around and one of those classes was a senior project. The only time senior project is available is during spring. I recommended to her to just work on certifications, preemptively do the senior project, and trying to keep up to date on her information for when school comes back around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2017\\] She pays for the classes but does not complete them. Again, she takes the senior project course but does do not any work for the class. She browses facebook/reddit/instagram/plays video games for 18+ hours a day and does not have a job. She understandably so fails the classes. For the rest of the year, she does not attempt to do any work or try to figure out what she needs to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cannot remember if it was at the end of 2017 or the beginning where we went to a friend's birthday party where his employer was there and was amazed that she was going to graduate with a degree that they need at their Department of Defense contracted company. He told her right there and then that if she had a security clearance they would higher her on the stop and double her salary. He said to her, \"You'll probably make 70k with your first job -- We'll pay you 140k. We will train you and everything so you know what to do and how to do it.\" My friend said that offer is 100% genuine and it is what got him working for that company as well. \\[She has not followed up or communicated with them since. She has not worked on any progress getting a security clearance or any type of certifications. Her friends have told me that she has frequently talked about how she needs a security clearance since this chance encounter -- even to this day. But not how she will get one or that she's working towards one.\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[2018\\] Senior project rolls around again and she does almost misses the deadline for submitting her project and cannot get her project working. With a very simple google search, I fix the problem in about 30 seconds that she was stuck on for hours. During this time as well, the curriculum committee tells her that she also needs to take a 1 credit course and recommends the website, 'StrLin'. 'StrLin' offers these 1-credit courses at a rate of $100/mo. She takes the speech course and does not complete it. \\[From the start of 2018 to now, she has not finished the course and this 1 credit online course will cost about $1100+.\\] I have gently reminded her to finish the course maybe once a month, to once every other week, to once a week, to now daily. \\[She tells me the more often I remind her, the less she wants to do the work. She says that she is an adult -- that I'm not her parent or her employer, so she doesn't needed to me reminded or hassled to do the work. She says she's not a child and doesn't need to be reminded and that she can do the work. She told me this eight months into the course when I started asking her more often.\\] She still hasn't finished the course. She does not work a job and has no other obligations. For over 5 months now, she'd had the equivalent of a one page paper, two page paper, and a final exam to complete the course. Little to no progress has been made. She ended enrollment in the course a few days ago because she said she wanted to re-enroll when she had the papers done and had studied for the final. Mind you, this is a course that gives you 30 days after you pay before the next billing cycle begins again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Overall\\] She says that she suffers from extreme anxiety and has issues even doing basic social tasks and functions. She has never sat down to find a doctor for herself, I have always been the one to find a therapist/psychiatrist for her. She fights and argues and screams and sobs uncontrollably when trying to find a doctor and is extremely picky. Even when we find a physician right for her, she complains about the cost of the doctor or visits when she doesn't work or attempt to contribute financial \\[towards her parents, school, or our relationship\\]. When she goes to therapist or psychiatrists and gets medication or help, she stops visiting them / taking medication after a month -- even if it's helpful because 'it's too expensive.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've gone on vacation trips to Florida, Las Vegas, and along the East Coast -- I've paid for it all. All my/our hobbies, I have paid for all the equipment myself. I basically live with a foster family because they picked me up after my mom kicked me out and I was homeless for 8 months. I mostly did chores and other things around the house until I got into pharma univ and my ability to contribute slowed down. I didn't really pay rent here until she started coming over more often and she said to me that I \\*needed\\* to pay rent. I've paid over $6000 and she's contributed $0 to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've talked to her about these kinds of things and she gets really upset at me and acts like I'm a jerk. She'll bring up that she has severe anxiety but no matter how hard I try to help, she just doesn't want to get help or even if I pay for it she'll end up refusing to go. If I try to help her with the work, she refuses. I ask her if I can see the course for myself, she refuses. I ask her for updates on the course, she refuses. It's a one credit class and it's literally holding her back from working and she will not complete it. In the same amount of time I've completed nearly 75\\~ credits at my Univ of Pharmacy and worked my ass off. She will yell at me for working myself too hard or cramming for exams but if I try and say ANYTHING about her and her school work -- she won't talk to me for a day or even days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am nearing the end of my education and am on my way to become a working professional in this field that I struggled so hard to get into in the first place. I came back from an international business/educational trip that was insanely difficult and not very fruitful. It took a lot out of me mentally and put me in the position where I had two options - Sit in my bed and not participate because I was an unwanted presence there OR strive to make myself a household name and watch them be impressed when I return. This kind of spirit really did invigorate me and really changed my mentality on how I need to do things. 20+ hours to fly back to the states, landed and completed labo-work, studied &amp; took an exam the next day, and finally laying to rest promptly due to jetlag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(tl;dr searchers can probably read this too)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* When I came to, I told her that she needed to really work hard on her end of the relationship. I am juggling a lot on my plate and still being attentive to her and involving her in a lot of my activities. She's not really working on herself professionally -- looking for a job, working on certificates, or even trying to finish her one-credit class.\n\n\\* I told her that it wasn't fair to me to be paying for everything. She hasn't worked in over 3 years and doesn't do anything while at home. She only plays video games, browses the internet, does arts and crafts -- but that's it.\n\n\\* I told her it wasn't fair to her parents or myself to help out with the cost of class (and living) when she doesn't do any work and we're paying for it. It was unfair to complain that things were expensive or doing x,y, or z cost money when people do spend time, energy, and money on her -- and she just wastes it.\n\n\\* It's not fair to me to be paying rent when it was her suggestion and she's not helping out. If I suggested to her that she needed to pay rent at her parents place because I was staying there, it wouldn't be fair for me not to contribute either.\n\n\\* I told her that I wasn't going to be paying for things for her anymore and that she needed to finish her class. If she didn't want to finish her class, then to not be a financial burden on her parents while she stays there - she needs to start working. I don't think it's fair for me or family to be putting in so much effort and energy when she's not really doing anything in return with all the time she has at home.\n\n\\* I ask her how much more money needs to spend on her before she starts caring / if she cares about not contributing / what will it take for you to get your things together / what will it take for you to do something / when are you going to take life seriously? No one is guiding me or helping me for my or career aspirations that I'm working towards -- I'm doing it all by myself. Everyone is willing to help you and has been helping you -- what more will it take for you to take any steps?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her all of this and as per usual, she hasn't spoken to me in three days. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr GF hasn't worked in three years. Hasn't finished her BS that she walked for. Refuses to finish a one-credit online class to get her degree. Claims financial issues for everything or lack of doing anything but doesn't work or want to work.  I've been in pharmacy school full-time and have paid for everything. Claims anxiety and/or other psychiatric issues. Refuses to get help and if someone else gets her help, refuses to keep up or continue going. Told her that she needs to start caring about life, start taking life more seriously, and what will it take for you to put in any effort -- everyone else is working hard for you, so what will it take for you to work hard for yourself? She hasn't spoken to me in three days. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically",

      "description": "So some backstory. My boyfriends sister has been fucked up on drugs lately (I don’t know her personally but this is what my boyfriend has been telling me). Anywho she’s fucked up on drugs, and gets kicked out of where she was living because she attacked someone. Anyways, she’s been missing for 2 days, doesn’t have a cell phone, is fucked up on Meth or heroine, and my boyfriend is worried sick. He doesn’t know how to find her so he can help her. I suggested going to the police and filing a missing persons case. He thinks this is a waste of time because “the police won’t do shit for a drug addict” am I the asshole for trying to continue to push for him to contact the police?",

      "description": "So I’m in a production of High School Musical, you might remember me from getting cast with my sister in a couple, which has since been resolved, thank god. Anyway, so we’re blocking this scene and I’m on one side of a desk, and  it’s a crowded desk, but it’s not crowded enough to the point where everyone has their own space. So, we’re blocking the scene and this 6th grade kid basically drapes himself on me, so I try to shrug him off. He makes no move to leave, so I try again.\n\nThis kid is not moving.\n\nThere’s no amount of movement I can make to get this kid (quite literally) off my back. I tried to be polite as possible, nudging him, shrugging him, trying to give him that look that is like “yo you’re making me uncomfortable”, nothing’s working. So I finally get sick of it, and turn to him and say, slightly forcefully “Yo can you get off me?”. \n\nHe gets off and he doesn’t seem to be offended, I talk to the kid a lot and he’s pretty resilient and generally an alright kid. But my director is treating it like I crossed a line and wasn’t being mature about the situation. So AITA? I thought it was fine, but my director seems to disagree.",

Erin got it as a gift for the both of us really, but John was the one who opened it. \n\nWhen he opened it, Erin happened to mention that we (John and I) would be able to go to the steakhouse. John happened to make a few comments such as “do you want to go with us? I know you want to go too.” When I(21f) was sitting there also, thinking to myself, well... so much for a date. \n\nI love his sister to pieces... but this happens all the time. Sure, we’ll go on food dates every so often, but I feel like it’s usually John, Erin and I when we go get food. \n\nI’ve never piped up about it, because I don’t want to step on toes. Like I said, I love his sister and her company... but AITA if I speak up about dates or do I not have say because it’s his sister?\n\nThanks!",

      "description": "First some context: Me and my friend are in middle school and were pretty close. We sit together on the bus and hang out in a back room with some other friends during lunch. Seeing as March Madness was starting soon everyone in my group decided to put $5 into a jackpot and whoever got the most accurate bracket would get to keep all of the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day starts out normal until third period. I have English class that period, but the teacher was pretty laid back so she put on the first game of the tournament which I believe was Louisville vs Minnesota. I had been messing around with my bracket and chose Louisville to win the whole thing. After they lost, I sent out a text to our group chat in mock seriousness saying that I was dropping out and not putting in my $5. Well my friend took this very serious and started complaining to me, but I ignored him for the time doing my classwork instead. After the class ended we went to lunch and were all hanging out watching a new game of the tournament. That's when I felt something touching my backpack(which I still had on). When I turned around I saw my friend in the pocket where I keep my lunch money.(Take into account I only get $20 a month for when I forget my lunch). I was angry, stealing is one of the few things that I do not tolerate, and I tolerate a lot. I was angry so I stood up from my chair and reached for him. I accidentally grabbed one of his earbuds and due to my anger I pulled. Well, the earbud ripped out and was now on the ground. He seemed shocked and dropped my money which I hurried to grab. After that he demanded that I pay for his earbuds. I refused at first because I was still angry and we went our separate ways. I later payed the $5 for the bet, and our friend group was staying neutral. A few hours later on the drive home from school I sent a text apologizing for breaking the earbuds and that it was an accident. Within seconds he said \"F you. I'm blocking you.\" After that I told my friends that I would not pay for new earbuds unless he apologized, and made my friends promise not to tell him this .That is the story so far, my friends are trying to get him to cool off, but I don't know how it is going. I like him as a friend and we play brawl stars together quite often. So am I the asshole for breaking my friends earbuds and refusing to pay for them after he tried to steal money from me and insulted my apology?",

      "description": "     Aight so pretty much from like grade 4 I’ve always been really good at KINDA fitting into every group of friends I could find but never all the way being the same as them so I’ve always had a lot of problems making actual friends. But I found a group I fit in better than most other ones, but they’re all white. ( I’m black and was  one of the very few coloured people at my elementary school) so every sleepover/ time we’d hang out they’d try out all their racist jokes and just say things I didn’t agree with at all but by this point I had been with them for almost a year and was completely outnumbered by white people who think racism / racist jokes or comments are the funniest thing in the world, so I kinda just went with it. \n\nThese are still most of the people I talk with in high school, with the addition of several others similar to them and one Friend who I genuinely considered to be my best and closest friend who I’ll refer to as V. I used to be very very ugly and fat in grade 9, as well as desperate for approval/ friends. So all these people I’ve known for a long time used that to get me to go do stupid and really embarrassing things and they recorded all of them. The next two years (currently grade 11) they’ve been holding those videos against me and threatening to send them out to people if I didn’t do shit for them, just basically being huge dicks and acting like they’re just playing around and everything is hilarious and we’re such great friends. But anyways I’ve been asking V non stop the last year to delete the videos or to keep them to himself ( he was the one with the majority of the videos a couple others did the same thing with ones they have ) and he said that he won’t delete them, but he also won’t send them to people.\n\nBut in the last week I’ve been sent the videos and made fun of by 6 different people, and in my English class (this is a class I have a different friend group in, as well as 2-3 from the group of dicks ) one of the kids from the group of dicks (I’ll call him D) came over to the group and asked “do you guys want to see some videos of *****” and I knew what he was about to do so I tried to take his phone, resulting in D running to the other side of the class and sending it to everyone he could, including those in the class, and i watched every single person in my English room open the videos and laugh at / make fun of me before airdropping the videos to every phone they could reach. At the end of the class D told me that V had sent the videos to multiple groupchats with 25+ people where they all made fun of me more. I was pissed and I was going to beat his ass but D like literally sprinted to his next class and kept acting like everything bout this was a big joke while I’m still getting made fun of by people in the halls for it.\n\nThen I finish the day and go home, already in a terrible mood, feeling way more depressed than usual, feeling completely powerless and suicidal, and about two hours later I got a message from a school friend I don’t even talk to laughing at me and making fun of me on Instagram DMs with an attached Instagram story. V posted all the videos on his story with 900 followers and every single guy friend I have has seen it, plus I’m already shit at talking to girls and not doing great in that department so this doesn’t help that at all. I sent V a text and a message on Instagram telling him to take me off his story rn, both of which he leaves on read and keeps the video up. But he still wants to act like we’re friends in person Nd everyone’s making me feel like IM the asshole here for being mad and not thinking it’s funny and saying I’m overreacting Nd being a bitch when I’m just sick of their shit\n\nSooo I just really need to know AITA right now for not wanting to talk to any of these people anymore? Because I really do not feel like I’m overreacting \n\nEdit: tomorrow is a big trip to Quebec pretty much to party and do bare drugs and have sex n shit, Today V broke his wrist in gym class (bone sticking out and shit ) and will not be able to go on the trip. ALSO he doesn’t get the $700 fee for the trip back, karma is real I guess lmao",

My father is against her going because he sees no big reason to go that far away for a school trip. My mother simply doesn’t feel safe about her going to another country since my mother cannot chaperone. My sister’s argument(she is 13) says that she wants to go because she probably won’t  have another chance to go. I really did not want to get involved but they essentially had me as a tiebreaker on wether she goes or not.\n\nI chose for her to stay. My reasoning is that she is still 13 and will still have lots of chances to go places and visit other countries, but she doesn’t know that I’m against her decision yet.\n(I was asked by my parents after she went to sleep) Now I have the task of giving the news to her that essentially from her point of view will make her seem like her family is against her. I told my parents that I will explain to her that she cannot go without really thinking how.\n\nSo how should I tell her the news in the nicest way?",

      "description": "I just broke up with my partner after five years. Our biggest issue has always been their drinking habits. Unfortunately, they cannot handle their alcohol very well. It only takes a couple of drinks and they become reckless and can’t form straight sentences, and become a person who is very unattractive to me. They’ve lied about their drinking and it’s been detrimental to our relationship.\n\nWe’ve had many discussions about how their drinking affects our relationship, and every time they promised to get better. It’s been five years and nothing has changed. \n\nSince we started dating, I started to drink way less. I stay sober when we go out, because I need to be responsible for when they start drinking. I also drink less in hopes that they will also choose to drink less.\n\nNow we are broken up, and I’d like to go out with friends and coworkers for drinks. I am afraid my ex will find out and think I’m a hypocrite, or they won’t seek the help they need to get better. Would I be the asshole, if I go out for drinks?",

When I was on the phone, I told the receptionist I needed it removed and replaced and she said she'd double check with the doctor and call me back.\n\nShe didn't call back, but that same day I got a confirmation email that clearly said \"IUD removal and replacement\" so I figured we were fine. \n\nToday (the day before the appointment) I get a very dodgy looking email from them that's encrypted. It doesn't have any of the normal stuff, no letterhead, nothing in the actual body, and the subject just says ENCRYPTED-IUD. I work as a network engineer and I've seen spam like this before, so I call the office and leave a voicemail asking for a call back. \n\nI get a call back from a very distracted receptionist who tells me that they sent me an encrypted email that contains a form I have to fill out for the insurance company and they haven't ordered my IUD. I ask why, and she says because I have to fill the form out. \n\nI'm pretty pissed off, and after looking through my email, I can't find the form. I finally find it buried in my trash folder, and call them back. When another receptionist answers, I lost my temper.\n\nWhy the hell didn't they tell me about this form on the phone when I MADE the appointment? Why isn't the office fillng this form out? I've never heard of this before, and my sister is a nurse, I've never seen this done before. I'm seriously upset, my IUD is causing me to bleed, I have to work tonight, and the receptionist is saying stupid stuff like \"We don't keep them in stock, we sent you a form--\" \"I MADE THIS APPOINTMENT TWO WEEKS AGO WHY AM I ONLY NOW BEING TOLD ABOUT THE FORM?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was definitely yelling. She transferred me to the nurse manager, who explained they'd really dropped the ball. I vent to him a little and he's pretty understanding (or he's used to upset patients). I also ask him about a CPAP that's supposedly been ordered but that there's no update on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, I hung up feeling better, but was an I asshole to yell at the receptionist? I know its not her fault but this is the second time they've dropped the ball for me, and I'm getting tired of having to submit my own insurance forms, which is not standard practice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, tomorrow, when I go to drop off the form, I'm probably going to apologize, but let me have it Reddit: am I an asshole?",

      "description": "First time posting sorry for long post, TLDR at bottom\n\nSo here's some context: In the beginning of the semester, my girlfriend signed us up for the anime convention in her uni. This anime convention was going to happen on the end of my spring break, which is next friday and the weekend. She signed us for to volunteer for it because then we would be able to get free access to the anime convention on all 3 days. However, we abandoned the idea of volunteering because we were required to participate for a training session and it was a little difficult for the both of us to attend, since the training dates were during my break and during her class. We decided to pay for the tickets, but didn't actually buy them because we forgot and by the time we realized, they were already sold out. My girlfriend got really sad because her school requires her to take her spring semester off after her sophmore year, so she wouldn't have the chance to go to this convention until she graduated. At this point, we were both devastated and since she was stressed out and down from other factors recently, I decided I would do something to make it up to her.\n\nAround a month ago, I started gathering people to ride with me from our uni to our home city, which was a seven hour drive. I told them that I would start this morning, and leave to go back to uni on sunday the 24th. When I arrived, I dropped everybody off and then I got an email from her uni, reminding me that we could still sign up for the volunteering training dates, which meant that although tickets were sold out, we could still get the free pass in order to attend the event. This is where things get tricky: the training dates were for next tuesday, wednesday, and friday. I had already told my friends that I would be driving them up on sunday, but I really wanted to make up to my girlfriend, something to give her a little boost. \n\nI chose friday for the training date, but I knew I was basically intentionally screwing over my four other friends and I felt really bad. I was basically going to drive up on friday, and leave them there or force them to come with me, so I told them that if they felt like staying until sunday instead of coming up with me on friday, I would pay for their ticket back to uni, and also carry their luggage in my car for them when I drive up. I also won't  be charging them for the ride down since I feel really bad. \n\nIs there anything else I could have done for them? AITA?\n\nTLDR: forgot to buy tickets for anime convention, they got sold out. Volunteering gives free access, and it falls on a day that makes me ditch my four friends and leave them stranded in order to get said free access.",

      "description": "So I (22 F) have been best friends w/ Adam since I was a freshman in college. \n\nAdam is like a brother to me. We studied abroad &amp; traveled the world together. Our families consider each other family as well. \n\nAdam’s fatal flaw is that he is not a faithful person. He loves the attention he gets from the person he’s dating at the time, but since he’s a 6’4, chiseled, charismatic athlete, he gets a LOT of female attention when we go out. In reality he’s just this really goofy kinda nerdy guy who doesn’t know what to do with the looks he suddenly got when he hit puberty. \n\nBasically, if a girl approaches him, he will pretty much always hook up with them even if it would hurt the person he is dating. \n\nHis reputation proceeds him at school, but the catch is: he avoids defining his relationship like the plague, so in the end what he does is distasteful but not cheating press. \n\nThat is until he started seeing Ash kind of. I knew of her, but we were never close. Ash pursued Adam HARD, but this time he seemed to really like her back. They started dating and it was obvious that she was determined to defy the odds &amp; lock him down. \n\nSuddenly, Ash  had an invested interest in being my friend. I’m a very social, easy going person. I’ve always been super friendly with Adams “girls” as they’re usually very suspicious about our relationship at first.\n\nThe issue this time was the budding friendship  Ash was forging w/me. Part of me feels used by Ashley as a way to get the inside scoop on Adam. In the beginning I was always honest and say things like “love him but good luck tying him down!” I stopped when I saw Adam was actually developing real feelings for her. He’s my friend after all and I didn’t want to undermine him even though I wasn’t confident in his abilities to remain faithful if the opportunity came up. \n\nI never saw Adam cheat, but he did tell me that one of Ash’s sorority sisters pursued him behind Ash’s back and he hooked up with her a few times. I admonished him but he swore they never defined the relationship, which I told him was a BS excuse now cause he let Ash post pictures of him all over social media. I do feel like she was a little hasty to do that, knowing he would dodge the DTR conversation, but as a female I thought I could at least call him out on his BS. \n\nOne of Ash’s friends finally told her, and she blasted him on social media. \n\nI felt absolutely horrible. Adam felt bad but he still maintains they never DTRed. \n\n I have been cheated on and I know how horrible it feels, but I never expected any of my exes friends who I became close with to drop him. \n\nAsh did end up calling me and asshole and accused me of sleeping with Adam and all this other stuff when she saw me out one night.  Idk how to feel. I almost feel bad for not feeling bad at the same time. But then again I feel like an asshole. \n\nAdam vows to stop leading girls on, but AITA for still being his friend since he’s been like a brother to me?",

We decided to adopt another cat because they seem to really love hanging out and playing with each other, and are very passive/non-territorial.\n\nWe went to the shelter, and picked out a cat that the employees said was very easygoing, chill and great with other cats. Let’s call him Diablo. When we got him home, we did all the proper introductions with the other two cats. Multiple litter boxes on different floors, got him his own room, let them sniff under the door first, etc.\n\nIt quickly became evident that Diablo is NOT good with other cats. He constantly hisses and growls at Fluffy and Snuggles, and has commandeered all of their usual hangout spots/toys/etc. Like, we have three couches, and Fluffy and Snuggles used to really like chilling on one of them. Diablo immediately took it over and began biting at the others and hissing when they tried to play on that couch. When they tried a different couch, DIABLO WOULD FUCKING GET OFF THE COUCH HE WAS SITTING ON TO CHASE THEM OFF OF THE SECOND COUCH HE WASN’T EVEN USING.\n\nHe also constantly tries to mark his territory by pissing everywhere. He does this constantly, even if there are no other cats around. He just sprays everywhere. We have taken him to multiple vets, and there’s not a medical issue or anything. He’s just aggressive and territorial. He also screams all night, to the point where I can’t sleep.\n\nAt this point, I fucking despise Diablo. I would never abuse him or anything, but I have spent hours of my life scrubbing his piss out of our carpets, dealing with him biting me for looking at him wrong, and comforting Fluffy and Snuggles, who are now absolutely miserable and basically hide all the time. My wife feels bad for Diablo and keeps defending him, but at this point, I just want this cat gone. I know it’s not his fault because he’s just an animal, but I feel like he’s obviously NOT the right cat for our household.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I insisted that we rehomed him? ",

      "description": "Going to cut a long story as short as possible. \nTL/DR at bottom\n\nMy girlfriend of 6 years (lived together for 3) mother broke her ankle/foot about a year and a half ago, obviously she went to the hospital and had a cast fitted and was told to rest (no work etc) for a few weeks.\nObviously at this time I was extremely sympathetic and supportive to me girlfriend (as she works with her mother in the family business) and her mother.\n\nAfter 2 days she'd cut the cast off, returned to work and has complained every day since how her foot has been hurting her, bearing in mind this is a year and half ago. This annoyed me but I kept it quiet.\n\nSo my girlfriend comes home almost every day with stories of how her mother is struggling and how she feels so sorry for her, up to today as I said before I'd go along with it and offer my sympathies etc. But as of late I've been struggling to show any interest or sympathy, just zoning out whenever she starts talking about it.\n\nFaat forward to today, i come home from a long ass day in work and she immediately starts talking about her mother again, how she's bought a walking stick and how she's missing the gym blah blah blah.... I zoned out.\nShe shouts at me calling my ignorant and rude so I reply with \"It's her own fucking fault! If she'd listened to the doctor she'd be back doing everything she wanted and everyone could happily get on with their lives!\"\n\nImmediate regret, like full on face flushed, mouth open repeating sorry over and over again. She storms out and we haven't spoken since yesterday. Tried calling but to no avail. But I kinda feel relaxed knowing I've said what I wanted to say, but wish I'd said it better. \n\nAITA? \n\nTL/DR:\nGirlfriend mother breaks foot, takes cast off early, complains for year and a half about pain, girlfriend sympathetic... me not so much.\n\n",

R said about one girl \"she was nice but also bullied the crap out of me\" so we were kinda laughing about how our town is too small to have nice kids and bullies so everyone's just both. We were openly talking about how if you look back, at least when you're a little kid, you were probably mean to at least one person. Yknow, everyone's kind of an asshole when they're growing up. \n\n\nBFB chimes in with something like \"well I've never been a bully, I'm just too nice.\" Which, I'll hand to him he's grown a lot, but he's not stellar. I brought up that him and a few other boys were so mean to me in the sixth grade that I didn't come to school for 2 weeks and he said \"well I don't remember\" and I was like \"well, BFB, that's pretty common actually. A lot of bullies don't even remember the person let alone the things they did that might've made them feel shit for years.\" And he said \"I genuinely don't remember which means you shouldn't either.\" \n\n\n\n\nApparently I'm mean for making him think he might've been a bad person. Idk. I feel like you need to take inventory and really ask if you are the asshole sometimes. I feel like he isnt doing that, but maybe I'm not looking in enough. AITA?? ",

We have been dating for almost a month now, and I decided that it was time to have a discussion about sexuality in our relationship. I said that I wanted to have sex, but she quickly mentioned that she didn’t feel ready. Now, I completely understand that mentality (as we are both 16 years old), and I told her that I respect that, and I wouldn’t force her to do anything she is not comfortable with. However, I mentioned that I wasn’t looking for a relationship without sex, as it would basically just be us being really good friends that cuddle sometimes. I said that I didn’t want to force her to do anything, but I wouldn’t want to continue to be in a relationship without sex, but I would like to still be friends. She immediately became angry, and quite standoffish, as she would not talk to me other than to accuse me of just using her for sex. Now she is telling all of her friends that I am just a “man-whore.” Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "Sorry for the length in advance.\n\nJust got back in touch with my mom [50] after about a year of not talking. Relationship with her has always been stressful and I [22F] think I've had enough.\n\nMy mom has always been very opinionated. Either she's super in my face about what she thinks about my life, or she's complaining about how everyone is always out to get her. She had a stroke in 2015 and it has left her at about 90% of what she was. It feels like her highs are higher, her lows are lower, and like she has completely forgotten how to have a two sided relationship. She lives with her boyfriend who always takes her side and always tells her she's right, no matter what.\n\nI moved across state for all of 2018 with minimal contact with my mom. She didn't agree with my lifestyle (going out without telling her where I was going and who I was with etc.) and I'm an adult and was tired of her constant judgement when I was home. It felt like I couldn't get a breath, so I moved in with my boyfriend of 6 months. He was living with his parents so I basically took with me what I needed, and I left a lot behind.\n\nThe only contact we had in that time was her messaging my then deactivated Facebook (she had my cell #) with her telling me she was going to sell all of my stuff if I didn't pick it up in 2 weeks. I didn't see that message until months later and just wished her luck. She responds with \"thanks! Gonna change the locks!\"\n\nOn New year's I broke up with my boyfriend. I started staying with my sister, who is on the same side of the state as my mom and is very close with her. Sister convinces me to talk to my mom and although I don't really have anything to say to her, I went and had dinner. Mom is exactly as I remember, asking me surface level questions so she can give her opinion on it, and then ultimately turning all conversation back towards *herself* and all of the things she's dealing with. The night is 10% me talking, 90% her complaining. Her problems mainly consist of not being able to make friends with people she works with because of the way she acts to them.\n\nMy mom invited me to this work party over the last weekend where I didn't know a single person. I initially declined but she insisted. I tried to make any friends with this crowd but my mom kept *stalking* me from room to room, asking me to follow her to this or that room for no reason at all. She finally corners me and asks me when I'm going to come by for the stuff I left. ~~I thought she sold that but whatever~~. \n\nShe's wearing my old sweater, using one of my old purses. I hadn't said anything about it. She then asks me where I would have left my hair straightener, because she really wanted to keep it. I had no idea. I told her that it seemed like she already went through all my stuff and took anything worth taking but that I would clean the rest of the junk up. She told me I was being shitty. I was just being honest.\n\nI then left the party because I didn't feel like being talked at like a kid in front of strangers.\n\nShe texted me this morning:\n\n&gt;Mrnd I'd like to work things out with you.  I can tell that you're really angry with me.   Some things I know what I did, others I don't.  I cant figure out why you're so angry.  I'm worried.  Did I fail you as you were growing up?\n&gt;Are you frustrated with my life choices?  Are you angry about my behavior from the stroke? Are you angry that I judged you and your life choices?  Do you think I have taken your absence lightly? \n&gt;When you're ready I would really like to sit down listen to you.  I'd love to work things out. \n\nI know it sounds shitty only having been gone a year but I'm really not ready for her to be in my life so much right now.\n\nI know that when I sit down with her it's just gonna be more of the same. I'm just apathetic at this point and I feel like I'm tolerating her when we hang out. I don't want a relationship where the only point in me being there is so she can vent. I appreciate that she's trying to be better but she's coming on way too strong and saying all the wrong things. I don't want to sit down and talk to her.\n\nMy sister and her are going out to dinner tonight and I'm definitely not invited. My sister is hardly talking to me. I know she doesn't want to get involved but they're going to talk about me for sure.\n\nTl;Dr: Mom is trying to reconnect after I stopped contact for a year. A month in already wants to sit down and have an emotional talk about something very minor. She says she was gonna sell my stuff, didn't, takes what she wants from it, wants me to get rid of the rest. Historically one sided relationship.\n\nWIBTA if I don't go to dinner? If I am, how do I get out of this mindset that I'm in centering around my mom. If I'm not, what should I tell her to make her back off. I don't care about cleaning out the room and I'll do so as soon as I have a place to live (this Friday).",

      "title": "AITAH for not wanting my in-laws on our cell phone plan?",
      "description": "So I feel a little backstory is necessary here. I (27M) been married to my wife (28F) for 4 years now. I've always had a good relationship with her parents, even if our personalities and views don't always align. My wife and I both work full time and we've always striven to be financially independent.\n\nRecently my MIL got fired from her job, and has picked up 2 lower paying jobs to keep the light on etc. This was just the beginning. Things just got worse and eventually they had to file for bankruptcy. I really felt for them and my wife, but I just couldn't seem to wrap my head around how this happened.\n\nSo MIL starts hitting us up to borrow money. I had no problem with this. I came from a poor hard working family of farmers so helping each other out was a part of life. It started out small, $20 for gas here $40 for groceries.  Not soon after though the dollar amount began to increase, 100 bucks until payday for \"insert reason here\". I never felt any resentful for helping, but hearing her telling us she'll pay us back and never did started to get to me.\n\nI knew something was up, I never suspected drugs (No real changes in appearance or attitude for what it's worth) but something had to of changed. I ask my wife if she would be willing to sit down with her mother and try to figure out what the problem is. So she leaves one night to go over and chat, hours pass and when she returns, her mother admitted to having a gambling problem. (Not as casino's, rather \"hot spots\" which are basically just a room with video slots and poker.) This honestly kind of shocked me, I don't want to see her and our family suffer.\n\nSince this opportunity showed itself, my wife and I set up our cell phone plan under my name. Enter the in-laws, my wife told them about us getting on the plan and they immediately want on. I am VERY reluctant to say the least. The plan is in my name and since we haven't seen any of the money we've loaned out back, I feel like this will just increase our payments when they inevitably don't pay for their share. I feel this is my credit score we're talking about so I will have NO choice but to pay it no matter what happens.\n\nI've tried to offer alternatives like setting them up on a pre-paid since I've never really had an issues, even offering to give them some old phones I have (nothing great but solid mid range devices). They don't like this idea and shunned the idea of having to downgrade even a little. This really rubbed me the wrong way so right there I said \"Well I don't feel comfortable at this time but I'm still more than happy to get you set up on prepaid. They were instantly pissed, but i don't care. My credit score is important to me and something I've worked hard on.\n\nMy wife is now stuck in the middle. I feel bad for her because she has a hard time saying no. I don't want her parents on my plan where I have a strong feeling I'll be paying their whole bill for 2 years. Am I the asshole??",

      "description": "First time posting here plus i'm on mobile so sorry if i break any rules. TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nAnyway, in January my ling distance gf came over to live with my family and I. I was living in the garage which went from manly man-cave to a cozy room fit for a mature couple. Things were great. Now, I am not a clean freak but i do hate seeing things on the floor and clutter on counters and tables. (I know that's what they are for but i like to keep flat space clear for when i wanna place temporary bigger items on them like amazon packages and what not) I started to notice a lot more mess after a while which i thought was normal since there was now mess coming from two sources instead of one so i was okay with it. Eventually the landlord tells us she wants to remodel the garage so that it is even more livable (only had one window which didn't open, and wants to add an ac) so we moved back into the main house. One thing led to another and now we have an RV for free. An RV is in no way as spacious as a garage so now her clutter which has overwhelmed my small amount of clutter is very intense. Makeup everywhere, fast food trash, and dishes like cups and plates. We both work a lot so there's never a lot of time to tackle the mess. Now the asshole part is that the other day i lashed out at her. It started as a joke that spiraled into a, \"most of the trash in here is because of you\" type of comment and that really upset her. I feel bad but at the same time, i care about the state of our temp home. So am i the asshole for being mad about it and lashing out that way? \n\nTL:DR\nGf and i live in a messy home due to how much trash and clutter she can produce. Lashed out at her about it.",

      "description": "So this guy privately messaged me on a social media site, asking me if I was open to roleplay. I was, of course, more than happy and open to do so. So we took some time, getting everything settled before jumping right into it. \n\nAfter a short while, we had everything decided. Mind you, and this is important, I sent four messages after his last one. My first message was the actual roleplay starter, and right after was me basically saying: “Here’s the rp starter!”. I didn’t get any response from the dude, so I sent a small message an hour later, and then another five hours. Just another thing, he didn’t say anything about being busy or leaving. \n\nThe chat stayed completely silent for five days, before I sent another message to check up on him. And finally, a whole day later I sent another message. Some time after that, he left the chat without saying anything. As you can probably have imagined, I got pretty annoyed that he left like that, especially after ignoring me for a whole week. \n\nI later sent a message on his profile, since I was under the assumption that he would’ve just ignored me again if I sent him a private message. To summarize my comment, it was a sarcastic remark about how great our communication was together, followed by a picture of our chat when he left me hanging. It took him a whole day for him to respond to my message. \n\nHe replied with: “Sorry, I just don’t like persistent people.” Now another thing, I would’ve been more than content if he told me this right off the bat. If he felt that I was annoying or bothering him, then that would’ve been valid. But, he decides to tell me this after he ignored me, and only when I went up to him. My thoughts here was pretty much what I responded with, and I felt his reason was a poor excuse for what he did. \n\nAfter that, he then proceeded to label my comments as “hate”, adding in some sarcastic remark about how riveting I was. At this point, I was only getting annoyed with his responses, as we continued on going back and forth with each other. He kept resorting to sarcastic remarks against me, while my own patience was whittled away. Eventually, there reached a point where I couldn’t hold back from calling him out. I called him inconsiderate, self-centered, and selfish. In which, he ended up getting annoyed to, and called me immature for taking this situation to his wall, where everyone can see. \n\nAt this point, I was just sick and tired of arguing, especially since he didn’t at all acknowledge what he himself did. So what I did was, suck up my pride, and apologized. I apologized for messaging him the way I did, and took back some of the things I said. All I got back was a thumbs up emoji, before I deleted the message chain to avoid any other trouble. \n\nAdmittedly, I wasn’t very happy with how I reacted, but I still wasn’t happy with him either. So was I wrong? Was he wrong? Did we both just plainly sucked?",

      "title": "AITA for not telling my cousin Happy birthday?",
      "description": "First of all, im on mobile and this is my first post on this sub, so sorry for any formatting mistakes. Also, probably gonna be a long post.\n\nBackground info: my cousin was born in the U.S. so he's a citizen by birthright, but he was raised in Mexico and lived there for pretty much his whole life up until a couple of years ago. He came for vacation in the summer one year, went back and came for vacation again the next. The second time, he stayed so he could go through high school, so he's lived with us for 2 and a half years.\n\nSo my cousin (M18) just turned 18 2 days ago. I'm 16M and share a small room with him and my youngest brother (8M) (too small a house for 7 people). He's done a lot of things that bother me, and im sure I've done things that probably bother him too, and he might even be able to tell i get annoyed at him. One thing is that he always likes to call his \"girlfriend\" late at night as im about to start sleeping (around 10:30). He knows damn well i have  a 0 hour class everyday, making me get up at like 5 every morning. (Girlfriend in quotes because i think he might be playing her).\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was when i went on vacation to mexico a year ago, he was there along with my other younger brother (12M). So when my cousin first went to my High School, me and my Girlfriend (17F) were the first people he sat with at lunch while he met people and made his own friends. Anyway, i see him as a player/fuckboy. In Mexico, he and another cousin said they knew a girl my age who's single and According to them, super pretty. They wanted to set us up together im pretty sure, which i didn't like at all. The cousin i live with kept trying to pressure me into it, basically saying \"you need one for mexico and one for the U.S.\" and it annoyed me and i pretty much said \"no im not a fuckboy like you\" but in Spanish. He finally stopped after that. There are other things he does that really bother me (leaving used, wet towels on the floor of the room, spending sometimes up to 20-25 minutes in the bathroom, etc.)\n\nSo the day of his birthday, my mom reminded me to tell him happy birthday a few times, but i never really did. I felt kind of bad about it but i feel im not obligated to tell him happy birthday if i don't want to, so AITA? \n\ntl;dr: My cousin who irritates me and i think he's a little bit disrespectful to me recently became 18 years old but i didn't say happy birthday to him.\n\n(Also, idk what tl;dr stands for so someone pls tell me lol)",

      "title": "AITA for not paying for 50% of my boyfriend's mortgage?",
      "description": "Until last November my boyfriend and I were not living together, I was renting an apartment and he owns his own. We decided that I would move out of my apartment and move in to his place, so we can save some money to buy a house together in a year or so (and try the 'living together' thing before actually buying something together).\nWhen we discussed the splitting of expenses, I explained I did not want to pay for exactly half of what he's paying towards his mortgage every month. He understood and he made some calculations so that I pay half of the *interest* he pays each month (which is most of the amount), but not the actual mortgage he puts towards his apartment.\nWhen we buy a house next year, I will put all my long-term savings as upfront cash for the house, and he will put in whatever he makes from selling his apartment.\nMy reasoning is that he's the sole owner of the apartment, and if he sells it tomorrow all the money is his (obviously). If something went wrong in our relationship and we were to break up (no reason it would be the case, but these things happen), I would prefer to have money saved to find my own place instead of having contributed to his mortgage.\nObviously it would be different if we were married but we're not there yet. \nAll other expenses are split 50/50 (groceries, gas, electricity, local taxes on the apartment etc). I earn more than him at the moment, will earn less later in the year when I change jobs.\nAITA?",

      "description": "Alternate account to prevent any reprisal.\n\nFirst of all, it happened twice but I considered there must be a debate.\n\nSome background, in case of being necessary: I work everyday, I can hardly have a day off because I need the money. I considered myself as a person of few words. I was working at the family's restaurant, to be exact at my brother's food truck. My parents work also on the business, for about almost 40 years. We had other locations years ago, but because of economic reasons, we had to shut them down, leaving the first restaurant they opened still functioning today. This only restaurant is the only income my parents are having, my brother has a food truck who opened it a couple of years and his income comes from that mobile-food-maker. Everyone is living in the house. Both my mother and father has their mood, she can hardly hear anything, she uses hearing aids on both sides.\n\n Anyway are the cases:\n\nCase 1: My mother has been treating my dad like shit, blaming him that he isn't doing anything to revive the family business and telling him that he's a pipsqueak and that he's spending the money are earning on uneccesary stuff, and even naming him a kept. Also when she's doing something wrong such as making the order or something, she considered like a humiliation from my dad, when customers are around or not. One day I discoverd my dad bursted in tears, after many years tolerating her.\n\nOne day, my brother and I arrived and both of them made a salad on the restaurant, she made a commentary of my dad as usual until my brother wants to tell her about those commentaries, she didn't want to discuss that, the insistation and arguing become more louder until she wanted to remove her hearing aids and my brother grab both of her hands to prevent doing that. She gets furious, considering that as an agression from her own son. My brother and mom yelled each other, telling her many truths about her and she left the place. I was just hearing, processing what the hell happened.\n\nLater at night, she entered my room to apologize about what happened, telling her that she won't let anyone \"stomp\" her and being humiliated, I stopped her. Now for once in my life, I could tell her many things like \"my dad is not a 'macho' neither a kept\", \"he works everyday and you on Facebook only, so thank you very much\", \"how he can be a kept if both work in the same place and is the only income both of you have\". She wanted a defense about my brother and I doesn't appreciate the stuff she made when we were kids, I stopped her saying that don't come with past stuff, it doesn't make sense right now. She enraged and considered that comment as a disrespect and wanted to slap me, I just say \"do it, just do it\". Never did it. I finished the discussion that why she's like that, she never wanted to listen. And she left upset. I would like to tell her many things but she left and I thought that after the arguing.\n\nCase 2: After that, she had been partially reformed, she stopped telling my dad offences and there's no \"humiliation\" and stuff. Some defects still there. I left my brother to work on something else and work with my parents at weekends. Both my parents didn't support my decision of working on another place because of the wage ar first, but they tolerate at the time.\n\n One day, my boss told me that is necessary to be in a wedding convention to be with clients the weekend. I told my mom that I must be at the con in the weekend so probably I come late or even not going with them at the restaurant. Told me it was ok. Didn't go with my parents on Saturday and Sunday. Problems come on Sunday, after I return to the house at 10 pm, I called at the restaurant to tell them I'm at home, my father answered and I overheard at the phone that he told my mother, and she got upset that why I'm there and both of them with too much customers.\n\n After hanging up, I got pretty upset and send her a long message at her phone, because she still doesn't want to discuss many things. I wrote her that she perfectly now that probably I couldn't be with them and that I'm not a seer, how could I know there will be many people. I tell her some defects that she's still having and I got enough. She doesn't saw the message until the next day. At first I wanted to delete the message, but I kept it so she can see how upset I am. After she saw the message, she replies that I was right, she apologized about the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, my mother has changed her personality a little bit more after those confrontations. However, sometimes I ask myself if I did the right thing despite knowing her personality at the time.\n\nSo, after all that events, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway account.\n\nI got married three weeks ago and one of my bridesmaids is about 7 months pregnant (let's call her Kate). Kate's belly was easily accommodated into the dress style because it had quite a flowy skirt with a fitted bust. \n\nBetween the ceremony and reception, we had a few hours worth of professional photos taken with just the wedding party. In one of the first photos I noticed Kate was deliberately holding her belly so it was really obvious in the fabric of her dress (think basically every maternity shoot photo ever taken). I asked her to stop holding her hands to show off her belly and to just pose like everyone else. I had to remind her a few more times before we'd finished taking the wedding party photos.\n\nI was away for a week on our honeymoon and when I got back I hadn't heard from Kate, despite texting her, and we usually talk every couple of days. I felt she was avoiding me. Today another of my bridesmaids confirmed that Kate is pissed at me because I was 'trying to make her look fat, not pregnant' during the photos. Now I'm annoyed because I paid a lot of money for a wedding photo shoot, not maternity pics. But I don't know, am I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "Long story short, my little brother by two years is getting married to this girl he’s known for maybe three years. She has a kid, he’s a good kid whatever.\n\nAbout five months ago, my best friend messages me and asks if his post about getting engaged is serious or not. I don’t do social media at all, so I can text my mom and ask her the same thing. She says yeah.\n\nGreat.\n\nFor context, my little brother has been absolutely horrible to me growing up due to the encouragement from our parents always telling him and me that “it’s his job as your brother to annoy you.”\n\nAnnoyance turned into abuse. Now, at 22 I don’t want anything to do with him. Blood may make us related, but it doesn’t make us family. I’m feeling physically sick at the thought of having to go to this wedding when we barely even talk in the first place. We say happy birthday and holiday greetings because our parents “remind” us to tell each other.\n\nI just take it as the fact that if this person was a family friend or a friend or a stranger and they treated me this horribly, no one would mind if I didn’t go. But because we are related, somehow I have to go because of family obligation. They have a date set for someone in the Fall this year but have made no plans because my brother is facing felony charges for shooting a dog unprovoked (another story entirely). He is badgering me for money for lawyers and court fees because I am quite well off financially. I said no.\n\nAITA here? I don’t feel like it but I know that family ties can be strong. I’m just so done with the whole thing and don’t want anything at all to do with him. Advice? Thoughts?",

      "description": "I'm a programmer. At my work we had a hackday recently (for those that don't know a hackday is usually an IT thing where you're placed in a team and challenged to solve an issue or implement an idea in a short amount of time) where I was placed as leader of one of 5 teams in our office.\n\nWithout going into details, my team kicked ass. Not only because we met our goal, but also because we were kind of underdogs, having less experienced and more junior programmers on our team. We also bothered to have several meetings prior to the event where we planned our strategy, and we worked incredibly hard well passed when the other teams had gone home for the day (both of these things - preplanning and staying late - were allowed in the hackday rules, if that matters to anyone).\n\nHowever, today the winner was announced. The team that won did no code. They had no meetings prior to the event (so they did no planning which meant they didn't choose which code libraries to use) and only presented a powerpoint presentation. They also left early for the day.\n\nI kind of think that to qualify to win a programmer's hackday you need to at least show you 'hacked' some code. This really bugs me. Not so much because we didn't win but because the team who won put in such little effort.\n\nIATA for wanting to raise this an issue with my supervisor? Will they think I'm an asshole? Will I be creating unnecessary drama?",

      "description": "My fiance (F32) and I (M29) have a pretty good relationship overall. We've been together for 5 years and engaged for 3. We don't have any kids and bought our first house together in 2017. We make a decent wage together that surpasses $100k/year combined. So we aren't exactly Bill and Melinda Gates, but we're doing fine.\n\nI have a few hobbies that I like to enjoy when I'm not working, but the hobby in question is collecting Hot Wheels. I loved Hot Wheels as a kid and became involved in collecting them as an adult two years ago. I've really come to enjoy it as I've made dozens of trades on Reddit and I've been able to collect many beautiful and rare castings.\n\nBetween all of my hobbies and things I like to do, (not only Hot Wheels) I think a fair estimate of yearly cost is about $1000-$1200 give or take.\n\nHowever, My fiance doesn't support any of my hobbies. But she doesn't *do anything*. She has no hobbies or interests. She doesn't go out with her friends, despite having many. She doesn't read, she doesn't collect. She isn't physically active. Her favorite thing to do is sit on the couch and watch reality television while refreshing Facebook or playing games on her phone. \n\nRecently, I have conducted trades on Reddit and sold many things on eBay. This upset her last week when I was leaving to go to the post office with 9 boxes. She accused me of wasting money and called my hobby \"stupid\" and said that she doesn't understand my interest in \"dumb toys\". I explained that I was trading many Hot Wheels for just a few (as in trading 4-5 for just 1) and had sold things on eBay to clear space. This did not satisfy her and she said I should \"take a break\" because it was \"too much\". I accused her of being jealous because she has no hobbies or interests of her own.\n\nShe called me and asshole and told me to \"do whatever\" I wanted. \n\nI should note that we work opposite shifts. She works days and I work evenings so we don't get to see each other during the week. We spend weekends together and I DO NOT participate in any of my hobbies on \"our\" days. \n\nI should note that I have tried to encourage her to get her own hobbies and I have tried to include her in mine. She used to skate as a kid and I suggested she come to open skate with me and do some laps for fun. She refused, saying that she's overweight and won't be able to get up if she falls. I've gone as far as asking her opinions on Hot Wheels that I'm interested in getting, asking what she thinks of the color, wheels, model, etc, just to include her. I even tried to get involved in her television shows to put some effort into having something we do together but I just cannot watch things like Siesta Key, Family By The Ton or My Big Fat Fabulous Life. It's all absolute garbage.\n\nThe way I see it, it's my money and my time and it isn't effecting her life. She should support my hobbies and, for lack of a better term, fuck off and let me do things I enjoy without being nagged about it.\n\nAm I an asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for marrying a woman because she DIDN'T sleep around?",
      "description": "So I (30M) got married 2 years ago to (28F). Now I'll just call her Sofia. My my wife Sofia is beautiful, but most of all, she has a wonderful personality. She is reserved, incredibly kind hearted and mentally strong. She had all the qualities to make a great mother. (we're planning on trying for kids soon). She's Mexican and was born/raised there, and she is quite religious Cahtolic.\n\nNow I'm also Catholic as well, I come from an Irish American Cahtolic background. However it's more of a ''religious in name only'' sort of thing, I somewhat vaguely believe in a deity of some sorts but not really a strong belief in the scripture like my parents. \n\nAnyway, when I first started dating her, the first thing my mates said was literally ''Dude this woman is wifey material''. It became a bit of a running joke, ''wifey material''. \n\nShe seemed like the PERFECT woman and I was a bit persistant when I first met her but eventually she agreed to go on a date from me, from then on it was history because we did have a lot in common. So now we married but one of the reasons I married her, aside from her personality, was that she was a virgin. She didn't sleep around whatsoever, she held out for the ''right guy'' and that guy was me. \n\nSo when I was talking to my female friend (30F) I said that one of the reasons I wanted to marry her was because of her personality AND the fact that she was a virgin and didn't sleep around. I thought this was an okay view to hold but she called me a ''Fucking asshole'' because she pointed out that I slept around in my youth. \n\nIt's true, when I was in my early 20's, I did a lot of sleeping around and hookup culture. And I could have seen myself marrying those girls if I was left with no choice, but they were never my IDEAL choices for partners, so I feel like Sofia was a god send in that regard. My friend (20F) still said I was being a hypocrite however what right does she have to criticize my dating choices? AITA?\n",

Alright, so I'm into some pretty kinky shit and was watching a few vids of dommes on the ole phub last monday night. I came across a vid of a girl scissoring a guy and from the thumbnail the girl looked super familiar, I click on it and holy shit this is my co-worker who sits a few seats down from me and she's scissoring the shit out of this guys neck and punching/kicking him in the nuts super hard. I was like jesus christ, she mentions her domme name in the vid and I search for it and come across a page with her pics and session info and its 100% her. \n\nThe next day at work I told my other co-worker about this who I'm friends with and told her to swear to never tell anyone and begged her not too. I spilled the beans and by the end of the week the whole office has heard about it somehow, I specifically told this girl not to tell anyone but she did and I feel like shit now because apparently the domme co-worker in question is thinking about quitting. \n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA For removing our friend from our groupchat?",
      "description": "We're seniors in undergrad/1st year grad students now. In high school around junior year, our crew really solidified and we began having a groupchat. As time passed and people changed, we continuously made new fb messenger chats (to phase people out) and eventually crossed over to groupme. We ended up with a guys-only chat and a full-squad one. \n\nThe guys chat is pretty much just memes. The other one is a mix of memes and social planning. The past few years we've had two main events that we strive to get everyone to for a \"reunion\" since we all go to different colleges and schedules: a trip to a friend's lake house at the end of summer, and my christmas party. You could say these are always prone to everyone getting absolutely hammered/high (especially the lake trip) but it's really not a big thing and no one is pressuring anyone other than the usual \"c'mon man we should do one more.\"\n\nChristmas 2016, the friend in question here, we'll call her Karen, leaves early (everyone else stayed over). Karen was best friends with my girlfriend since high school (maybe even before). She was always more of a mom figure, and no one minded her leaving since we still got to hang out with her, do secret santa, etc. From this point on, she begins to become noticeably more distant and says much less in the groupme, but still maintains a steady friendship with my girlfriend.\n\nShore Party 2017 at my house, Karen attends for about an hour with her \"boyfriend\" who she also broke up with at the same time and then left. We were down there for 5 days having a high old time, but she showed for truly no more than two hours tops then left. One of my best friends brought his girlfriend and everyone else was excited to meet her and we really hit it off. In fact she's more or less taken Karen's place in the circle since she's been gone. \n\nLake Trip 2017, Karen did not attend. And it's worth mentioning that during the 2016 trip she was quite distant, always separating off with another friend. This other friend (lets call her Julie), Karen, and my girlfriend all are (were?) besties. \n\nChristmas 2017, again, no appearance from Karen. At this point, the friendship between my girlfriend and Karen seems to still be very intact despite their growing apart a bit. They hung out over christmas break and whatnot. From this point on, Karen says almost nothing in the groupchat. No memes, no response to events, nothing. Maybe like 3 random pictures.\n\nMy 21st Birthday 2018, Karen has already said she isn't going to the lake trip in august. She hadn't attended the surprise party for one of my other best friends earlier that summer, nor any other gathering we had between now and Christmas. In fact, we had managed to see one of our navy friend who was away at Marine OCS more times than Karen. \n\nAlready being fairly lit, someone suggested we truly remove her from the chat (we ban people comically all the time and re-add them for meme reposts, general stupidity, etc). I took the liberty of posting a ban hammer yugioh card meme, at which point my other friend uses my phone to ban Karen from the groupme. I took responsibility since it was my phone. \n\nAn hour or so later, Karen texts both me and my girlfriend. I don't have the messages anymore, but it was along the lines of she was truly hurt and thought we were all best friends. I ignored this (and also thought it was bullshit) until the next day because I didn't feel like having her drama ruin the party. \n\nMy response was essentially: *I believe I speak for the majority in saying that you've been distant and don't seem like you like hanging out with us. If I've misread you, and you want back in, by all means say the word.* She pretty much just said \"no, I know when I'm not wanted\" and that was that. She was fishing for a fight/apology and I wasn't about to give it to her. The vibe I got was she was mad we had broken the last bond between us all instead of her. \n\nIn addition, this lead to a bit of a fight between Karen and my girlfriend because she didn't stand up for Karen to everyone else. After reading their conversation, it was apparent to me Karen had been jealous/judging my girlfriend's success/lack of working over the summer, and this had been brewing for a while. Obviously my girlfriend was pissed/upset about that since she has worked very hard and deserves all she has achieved. Ever since they've been quite rocky as friends and IMHO it's time to move on, but that's not for me to decide for the two of them. Julie and my girlfriend are still best friends, and we all love hanging out with her. \n\nSo almighty judges of reddit, I'm curious, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "So let me start by saying I \\[27M\\] absolutely adore my fiancee \\[29F\\]. We have been together for almost 4 years but things have gone downhill pretty hard in our sex life. This is going to be a long story so I really would appreciate if you could sit back and read it all and give your honest opinions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting from the beginning she and I actually got together because I was friends with her ex-husband. After getting to know both of them I found out he was a verbally abusive drunk who at times even got her to lock herself in the bathroom in fear of him hitting her (I do have to point out he never did hit her) so I stopped giving a crap about being his friend but I became really close to her. We were close friends for just about a year before the inevitable happened and we had sex, they eventually got divorced, and she and I got together. After they had gotten a divorce she says her biggest issue was that he would never touch her or have sex with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting out we honestly had sex 2-3 times a day everywhere. I mean in the car (I had a Scion FR-S at the time, so good luck trying to imagine how that worked out), when we went camping, in my apartment, in her car, I mean it when I say everywhere. Things were like that for 2 years. After being together for about 6 months we ended up moving from Colorado to Just outside of Washington D.C. which is obviously a big move and she had never been out to this side of the country. I understand she would be a little depressed because she had never been to this side of the country and was starting over.  Our crazy sex life had continued for about a year after we moved then it started going downhill. We are at the point where we have sex MAYBE once a month. When I talked to her about it she would make comments like \"well you aren't sweet anymore\" so I tried doing things I used to do like lay with her and watch movies, make comments about her hair, tell her she's pretty, and other things to the point where she even gets giddy about what she says is \"butterflies in her stomach\". We'll have sex but then the next week it'll be something like \"oh you don't help around the house and it makes me not want to have sex with you\" So I'll keep up on the dishes, start doing more laundry, and try to clean a bit more around the house (with that said I have NEVER been good about doing housework and I have NEVER hidden that). Honestly she'll even say a girl is cute and I'll agree but she'll make comments like \"But you won't find a girl who likes to F\\*\\*\\* like I do\". I'm at the point where we ended up argueing about it last night because this is becoming a big deal for me and she said \"I'm not the pornstar you make me out to be\" with my only reply before I got up to walk away was \"you mean the pornstar YOU make YOU out to be\" (more info for that can be added if needed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love the crap out of her but our relationship started with and was built on sex and the comments she made when we first got together about our sex life never dying but I'm out of options, I've done EVERYTHING I can to change myself for her but it's never good enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry for the long rant but I want peoples opinions.

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have two children. His half brother and his wife have one child. \n\nTheir gifts are thoughtless, bad, and cheap (mostly and maybe intentionally for me - dollar store scarves and ceramics, grocery store gift sets for him which are an improvement). We’ve never done anything but be grateful, thank them kindly, and toss them later. I mean who fucking cares, we’re adults and can buy our own crap. \n\nFor this Christmas we asked if we could exchange gifts for just the kids and they agreed. We got their kids a large stuffed Minions toy, a Minions board game, and a kid sized blackboard/whiteboard easel. I cleared the gifts with SIL beforehand to made sure it was okay for their kid and what they needed. \n\nWhen they arrived at our apartment, my FBIL handed me a bag and said it was for both our kids - inside was a small handful of peanuts in the shell, an apple, an orange, and three chocolates. The baby was four months and couldn’t eat any of that. I thanked them and made a show of letting kiddo go through it and try to open the peanuts. \n\nIt was only then that I realized we’ve been buying them gifts and they haven’t for at least a year, and also missed some events the year prior. We even gave them two gifts for their first child’s birth because they decided later to baptize him. I had a painting of a lion custom made for him because he’s named after Saint Mark, and the lion is his symbol (or something like this, I’m not religious). My boyfriend considered a painting an especially bad gift for a baptism and reminds me of this often. When I tried to address the Christmas gift with the peanuts by asking if peanuts were considered exotic in the European country where we live, because they are very cheap in the US, he immediately shut that down as meaning mean and petty. \n\nI don’t believe in keeping track of presents and I tend to give little gifts throughout the year, just because I saw something that reminded me of that person. I honestly did not even notice this discrepancy in gift giving until this last Christmas. We always knew they were weird about gifts - they have not once said thank you for anything we or anyone else has given them. The first Christmas I made cards by hand and the SIL opened it and complained there wasn’t money inside. I thought that was so rude that it was freaking hysterical and wasn’t offended. But I did stop giving them cards in case it raised their hopes and since clearly they don’t like them anyway (without money that is). \n\nEven though this is my boyfriend’s family, I buy all the gifts. I have poured my money, time, and energy into this, and while I could pressure him to do it, i recognize that it’s easier for me to do than for him and I also enjoy it in a way. I would rather that he put his energy elsewhere in our family. I’m fairly sure that SIL is the one buying gifts for their family. \n\nShe is either deliberately with malice (not impossible in her case) not buying gifts for our kids, or she doesn’t think holidays and birthdays are worth buying gifts for (we’re not close enough to know what she does for her family). Or maybe she doesn’t consider us worth giving gifts to. In either case, it seemed pretty obvious to me - stop buying them gifts and move on from the issue. \n\nToday my boyfriend mentioned his nephews birthday was next week and we needed to get him a gift. I did not realize until now how undervalued this entire process has made me feel. I spend my time and money buying everyone in his family gifts, and he has never once thanked me for it, he has only ever criticized me when he felt the gifts I chose were bad or not expensive enough. \n\nWhen I got upset today he was surprised it was a big deal to me, and didn’t realize I never talked to him about it because he had been shutting me down and criticizing me for being selfish and petty every time I tried to bring it up (but he says he doesn’t remember ever doing that, even as I described instances and conversations to him). He says he doesn’t remember what gifts our children receive from them and they did buy us a book once they we read to them sometimes (cue eye roll here). He says he still wants to buy the nephew gifts this year. I told him I want to buy gifts for his nephew when he’s old enough to tell us what he wants so we can get it for him, and maybe take the nephew with our kids to theme parks or so when they’re big enough. \n\nBut for now I am through spending our finite financial resources on people who don’t appreciate it. AITA here? ",

      "description": "This has been going on just recently, and it’s getting kinda annoying. My friends, let’s call “G” has been my best friend for the past 9 years. We’ve been through thick and thin but this time she has just done it. I’ve gotten a boyfriend recently and ever since I’ve started spending some of my time with him she started getting a little distant with me. I thought of it probably as school, or family stress that would be over by the end of the week. I was wrong. Not long after I started asking her if she feels alright, or if she has any issues that she want to talk about, she tells me it’s that I’m being an asshole by using my time to spend on my boyfriend, and not her. I literally spend one or two weekends with him and I see G most days after school. \n\nI shrug what she said off and said that I love him and even though I spend time with him, he is in no way replacing you. \n\nThis was pretty clear for up until the time I left her house because after that she started spamming her sc story with pictures of her crying, saying how “the closest friends leave you in the dust for another man” and asked “why is everyone in the world a shitty person” if you were my friends I would always be your top priority like friends should have friends. \n\nThis is honestly pissing me off rn because I feel like now she only thinks about herself, and thinks her happiness should be the top priority. \n\nAITA? I honestly don’t fucking know right now.bye ",

      "description": "My brother and his girlfriend left yesterday to head over to Bali for their first overseas trip together. My parents have been going on since they landed that I should text them and ask if their holiday is going well. I said no because, well it's not something that I would normally do. My brother and I aren't that close and I think the last thing I texted him was if he wanted something from Macca's 3 months ago. I'm quite close to his girlfriend and she's like a sister to me, but still I don't really text her out of the blue as I see her several times a week. My parents have said that they're disappointed and that it's disgraceful that I haven't texted them and extremely rude.  \n\nSo I said I didn't really feel the need to text them because it's their first holiday together and I want to leave them be, it's only the second day of their week long holiday, and well I don't really feel the need as I said it's not something I'd normally do. I'm not saying I won't message them for their entire trip but yeah just not right now. What do you guys think? Am I being an asshole? I know it wouldn't be difficult for me to just text them and that I easily could, but I still don't think that makes me an asshole? \n\nI don't think I'm exactly in the wrong and I don't think my parents really are either, personally I just think we have different standards and expectations? \n\nFor context, I'm 20 and my brother is 22.  \n\n",

      "description": " \n\nThis happened a year ago\n\nSo, I met a girl thru tinder (Dec of 2017). We met at a bar, had drinks, went to my place and she spent the night over. For the next few days, we started messaging each other, just casual talk. As I had to go abroad during the holidays, we stopped talking as much.\n\nWhen I got back on January, we hooked up again. This happened a few times with her staying over at my place. Around the middle of January, she asked me what she was to me, confessing that she was starting to like me. I told her that I was unsure of my feelings and she was visibly hurt. I thought it over the weekend and I told her that we'll start going out.\n\nThings went well for the next two weeks, with us saying \"I love you to each other\". Around feb, she asked me if it was alright for her to hang out with her friends at a club. Seeing as I trusted her, I said no problem. So she messaged me that night, but her messages were kinda messy and weird. I didn't think too much about it and kinda forgot about it.\n\nA few months went by and she \"confessed\" that she was actually coerced by her so called friend. She was kinda hesitant about the details. Seeing as it was traumatizing for her, I didnt push through with it. However, I felt that some things were off so I did a bit of snooping. I managed to find out that the guy wasn't actually her highschool friend and was someone she also met and also slept with thru tinder on december (they met a week after we hooked up), after we first met. I confronted her about it and she cried, saying that the guy kept pestering to met her, so she agreed to meet at a night club with the condition that no sex was gonna happen. She forgot to bring her ID that night so she was denied entrance. The guy was so mad at her and started shouting at her. She felt guilty so she went into his car and went to his place. One thing led to another and she said she felt pressured so they slept together.\n\nI felt messed up after this and for the next few months, kept calling her names and when I remember what happened I thought of ways to emotionally hurt her. I was filled with so much hate so I called it off with her.",

      "description": "So my sister (14) is a straight up bully. She’s constantly going for me and anyone else she can, even if there’s no actual reason at all.\n\n\nOne of my (F 16) biggest issues with her is how she treats me. I am chronically ill and disabled. She regularly makes fun of my knee braces, my walker, and my cane, even the speed at which I walk. It’s not even lighthearted- even if it were, not funny- she’s straight up being a douche. \nShe regularly leaves me alone in places because she refuses to slow down a little. \nShe also makes fun of my appearance and clothes. Now, I’m not any sort of goddess or anything but I’m certainly not ugly. I’m very clean and obsessive about my hygiene. I take very good care of my skin and am lucky enough to not have a single dot (not that acne is actually ugly, it’s natural and I recognize that, but most people that have it don’t want it). \nOn the other hand, my sister is filthy. She always has greasy hair and a greasy face, she wears the same paint and snot covered sweatshirt. She’s even developed a hunchback from her shitty posture. \nBut, she always goes after me, and my clothes, the color I dye my hair, etc. \n\n\nShe also likes to come home and shit talk her classmates. She calls girls sluts just because she doesn’t like them. Absolutely one of those “I’m not like other girls” types. She makes up stories about how people “bully” her and then later admits they were false. \n\n\nI try and stay silent, but she continues to attack me. But when I snap and get back at her (which I’m very good at, I could probably destroy her entire life as she knows it... but I don’t) I’m the bad guy and the one that gets punished. \n\n\nOn the off chance my parents do something, they just take her phone, and she goes and slams the door and throws a tantrum. \n\n\nFYI, we are both in therapy. I have depression and social anxiety, so her harassment isn’t helping. And it’s already hard enough to be confident as a teen with a disability. She, on the other hand, has nothing wrong with her but a shit attitude. \n\n\nI GET that she’s a preteen and going through stuff, but that is not an excuse to be the way she is. I went through horrible things when I was 13, but my anger was always directed at myself. I NEVER lashed out at anyone, especially my family. \n\n\nI’m so tired of being treated like shit and her being allowed to get away with it. It almost makes me feel like I’m overreacting and not worth it. Am I the asshole for calling her out every now and then?",

      "description": "I met this guy David through a mutual friend,  Sarah, and we ended up hitting it off. He asked me on a date and went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and got some ice cream after. We mostly chatted about the movie but I had a nice time and liked him so I was enthusiastic when he asked me if I wanted to get dinner the next weekend. At dinner, we learned more about each other and had good conversation and I really started to like him. Sarah texted me asking me how it was going and while David went to the restroom I replied saying that it was really good. \n\nHowever, everything went downhill when he drove me home. After dinner we got coffees from the Starbucks drive thru. I was looking for a place to put my drink since the cupholders in the center console had his coffee and an old McDonalds cup. David noticed and said “oh sorry, here you go” and took the McDonalds cup, rolled down his window, and just threw it out!! I have never seen anybody just blatantly throw garbage like that so I really didn’t know how to react. I wasn’t sure what to say so I just said something like “did you really just throw that on the road?” And he nonchalantly was like “yeah” and shrugged it off. \n\nAfter seeing that, I really lost interest in him. I’m not a “save the earth” eco fanatic or anything but I recycle and you know, care about not actively trashing the planet. So seeing him just throw garbage out the window casually was honestly unattractive. David asked me out on a third date and I didn’t mention the littering but I just told him I enjoyed our time together but I didn’t think it was going to work out. \n\nSarah texted me asking why I wasn’t interested in him anymore after things were going so well and I told her honestly about what happened. She said I was being super petty and it was stupid to not see David again over one little thing after we getting on so well. However I don’t know what it was exactly, but something about that littering just rubbed me the wrong way. Especially because he was so casual about it, like it’s a regular thing. In hindsight I guess there’s way worse things he could have done but it just made me feel differently about his character. Sarah thinks I’m being bitchy for not giving him another chance, but I really have just lost interest. \n\nTL;DR: Started dating a guy and got along well until he littered. I’m no longer interested and my friend thinks its a stupid reason.",

With Jim, we all get pretty damn offensive to each other, but no one takes it seriously. This has included roasting people for their girlfriends, ex-girlfriends, and pretty much anything in general. Jim's been chilling in this group for just as long as Frank, and I've always gotten on with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo with that set up, we started into some small community with like 200 people in our region, and Frank was made the head of the group that we set up on that community.  This was alright at first, but over time our contributions were being minimized by Frank, as a lot of the people that we got were due to Jim and myself putting a hell of a lot of effort in. This was happening, as he got into a fight, and essentially tried to cut Jim out completely, though another friend, \"Steve\" who we knew for roughly the same time sided with Jim. As a result, Frank tried to cut Steve out too. Meanwhile, Frank was also trying to bring his brother in as a relatively major person, attempting to replace Jim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile this was going on, Frank also caused a lot of issues with people joining up with us, and others in the community, resulting in a lot of groups pretty much hating us, and warning groups from other regions to not get involved with us, despite our attempts at growing out. This resulted in me having to go to the other groups to apologize in an effort to keep us in the community on a regular basis, while Frank was doing this more and more often. This led to a lot of people leaving, because he was getting really toxic to anyone not in his circle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually he was demanding other groups to either leave the community or join ours, which set the final steps up. The other groups told me what they thought of the group originally before Jim and I tried to ease things up, and when we talked to a lot of the people in the group, they said the same thing, so we cut Frank out after trying to point the issues out for months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get it's such a trivial thing to end a friendship over, and I never really thought it was that big a deal, because we were simply trying to get along with everyone, but I get harassed by Frank or \"associates\" of him for this shit, accusing me of stabbing him in the back. Am I really an asshole for trying to have our group fit in? Since then, things in the community had been great, but still, I get some doubts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR long term friend ended their friendship because I removed him from a group that didn't like him, accusing me of stabbing him in the back.",

      "description": "I've been with my SO for a little over two months. We have a LOT in common. Similar or at least compatible religious and political views, views on money, similar tastes and preferences, compatible in bed and even several shared passions/hobbies. We're both pursuing undergraduate degrees and we both want kids.\n\nWe have an LTR since we're attending different colleges, but I try to visit as often as I can, and we were looking forward to a sleepover after she got back from spring break.\n\nI make a point of talking to her throughout every day at least through text or snapchat, and we facetime for at least an hour every day. It's the highlight of my day and she seems to look forward to it as well. We're both very open with each other and I don't think I've ever intentionally lied to her.\n\nI knew that I was going to have surgery (today actually) to remove a pilonidal sinus. I was a little embarrassed by the situation and because it was an hour-long outpatient procedure it wasn't at the forefront of my mind. I realized that I should tell her, but between midterms and some family drama it seemed like she needed more stability in her life, not more drama, so I didn't tell her until I was leaving for the hospital.\n\nI should probably mention that I think she may have some undiagnosed general anxiety. I thought that I was protecting her from more drama and more stress after we facetimed last night and she complained about stomach pain and not being able to sleep and all the ways her life was difficult, so I did my best to comfort her and didn't mention the procedure.\n\nI awoke from anesthesia to a few terse texts and then tried to talk to her, saying that I was trying to keep her from getting too stressed out since her life was so rough and she said that I had shattered her trust and she didn't want to see me anymore.\n\nShe's leaving to visit family on the other side of the country and I'm jacked up on painkillers so I'm in no position to drive to her house with a boombox over my head, am I an asshole? What should I do?\n\nTL;DR didn't tell gf that I was getting part of my butt cut out; now I'm out of the focker circle of trust and the girl I thought I might one day marry wants nothing to do with me.\n",

      "description": "I work at a doggy day care/ pet shop. There are workers in the front who sell products to customers and get a commission for selling things other than just food. Then there are workers like me who work strictly in the doggy day care, we can get tips for it but that’s the only ‘bonus’.\nToday we had a new dog in who was very cute, only a year old, and groomed very well. The dog jumped up and licked me. Oh god the smell, it was like god threw all of the farts in the world into my face. It left a lingering smell too, it was disgusting. Trust me, I’ve run into some bad doggie breath where I work but nothing like this.\nSo the next thing I do is look at the dogs teeth. The poor thing had plague all over, and you could see black gunk where the gums meet the teeth. The back teeth looked like they had fallen out already. It was disgusting. \nWhen the dogs owners showed up today I was the one free to take the dog out to them. When I got out I told the owner in the nicest/ customer friendly way possible that their dogs teeth were disgusting and needing to be seen by a vet ASAP. They were surprised, and didn’t realize that they needed to be worried about the teeth. I told them that we actually have a vet that comes in once a month that does teeth cleaning/ vet check ups for a lot cheaper than usual, and they were coming in this weekend! They agreed and I scheduled them an appointment. I then showed them where we sell the toothbrushes for dogs and the teeth cleaning treats. I walked them up to the counter and my coworker rung them up. \nWe don’t have the fanciest systems, so at the end of the day the worker in front writes out who made what sales and what commission they get. I was cleaning in front when my coworker (CW) said “thanks for the free commission!”\nMe: “oh, haha, I guess I did technically make a sale today, there’s no way for me to get the commission though, right?” \nCW: “nope”\nMe: “too bad!”\nCW: “Yup, so I get it!”\nMe: “you can’t just write that no one gets a commission?”\nCW: “I could, but why would I? I’ll write my name, thanks myallinall!”\nMe: “Oh.. will we get in trouble?”\nCW: “I’ll just do it, it’s fine.”\nMe: “Maybe if we ask the owner (she was in that day) she will let that money that would be a commission be donated to the rescue we work with”\nI don’t care what she does honestly, but now that’s she’s told me this is what she’s going to do I’m afraid I’ll get in trouble if it gets caught.\nMy coworker rolled her eyes and was about to say something when I noticed the owner restocking things and I shouted for her to come over. I explained what happened, and she said sure, give it to the rescue, but don’t ‘make a sale’ again— that’s not your job. I said I understand and moved on.\nWell now my coworker has told everyone what an asshole I am for not just giving it to her. She says it’s not like I could get it anyway, who cares. I’ve apologized numerous times but she said she doesn’t care. I’m confused, AITA?",

      "description": "Recently I got a new gf, first one in a while.  We've been together just over a week now. With her asking to be my girlfriend after the second date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the second date I got her to orgasm with fingers, but she didn't want to have full sex just cuddle. Second time she stopped me using my hand before she orgasmed because she wanted to sleep and just cuddle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird time I rushed to full sex because it seemed like there was a pattern with her losing interest the longer activity went on, we had 5 minutes of bad sex, after she didn't want to do anything else but cuddle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFourth time when we were cuddling, she complained when I caressed her . Fifth time we were in bed,  after having to spend an hour and a half watching some bad TV show, she kisses me deeply, but when I go for sex she says \"I don't want sex\", I ask her for clarification and she says \"I don't like sex, just cuddling\". I got so annoyed that I just walked out and found a bar to have a drink for a few hours. I came back to the house, the door woke her up and she just said \"Oh you went out\", and within 30 seconds she was back to sleeping. No question, no concern. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo at the moment I'm wondering when I should be bringing up this whole \"I don't like sex\" thing with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy I don't think I'm an asshole: Sex should be a standard part of any relationship, she's getting what she wants (a bf, cuddling, taken out for dinner) I'm not really getting what I want it should be a two way street. We're a new couple, we should be all over each other, it's only downhill from here. She goes on a business trip to another country next week for 2 months and since we're a new relationship, shouldn't she be making every effort to make sure we can survive the time apart, including making effort sexually? She spoke very sexually when we first met, she said she wanted to have sex on the first date but had work in the morning and then the next day she came round for sex. I feel almost like she lured me into a no sex relationship by being overly sexual at the start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy I may be the asshole: She is incredibly loving and affectionate in every other place but the bedroom, she does make an effort in other areas of the relationship like paying for some things. She wants to spend a lot of time with me. It's not like she doesn't want to be close to me, she likes everything EXCEPT sexual touching. I posted this on some relationship subs and basically got called an asshole for not just wanting to cuddle and spend time with my gf with no sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I have a work colleague, let's say his name is Bob. Bob (52m) and I (28f) became pretty good friends through work. To cut a long story short, it turns out Bob is 'madly in love' with me, despite knowing I'm in a very happy and loving relationship, and he has been married 20 years with 4 kids and 2 grandkids. He's sent me explicit messages and pictures. I changed my place of work and he followed me. I've told him either he needs to stop that shit or we can't be friends. He said he would stop. Fine. I hate the idea of hurting someone, even if they have been a complete twat, so this was the compromise. \n\nBack when Bob wasn't being a dick, I told him some very personal issues of mine involving serious sexual assault in my past.\n\nThat was 6 months ago. Cut to the last few days. Bear in mind I've told Bob to back the fuck off, stop trying to get anything sexual out of me, we're either friends or we're not, it's that simple. Bob announces, out of the blue, that he was assaulted when he was \"13 or 14\" by a male family friend. This then escalated to \"multiple times\". Today its escalated to \"I was assaulted and gangbanged by 5 men while they stood around taking pictures and videos\". When he was \"13 or 14\" this wouldve been either 1979 or 1980. \n\nI truly believe this is a lie. And I hate that I'm saying that. The thought that someone would lie about that makes me feel physically sick, and I also feel physically sick in myself for thinking someone is lying about it, but hear me out. I believe this is a ploy to get me to feel for him, get me to cuddle him and tell him it's okay. A lie to make it seem like we're more similar. A lie to make it so that I can't leave him behind because who would do that to someone so vulnerable? I also believe it's an attempt to \"one up\" my own personal experiences. As in, \"I've had it worse than you please pity me\".\n\nI've told him I am not the person to talk to about this. I am not the support he is looking for. Couple that with the fact I'm almost positive he's lying and it's really fucking me up.\n\nSo I told him he needs to go and speak to a therapist. I even know an excellent charity who will not charge you to speak to a therapist, and they usually get you in within a week or so. He's flat out refused saying there's no point, he's lived with it this long, he'll just \"Bury it down inside like he always has done\" and that I'm the only person he's ever told. He won't tell his wife because \"she'll want to take things into her own hands\", he won't tell his mum because it would \"kill her\". Etc. \n\nAnd yes... Trust me... I understand this is an unhealthy 'friendship'. Unfortunately, I'm too nice to tell someone to fuck off. We work in the same company, I can't just disappear or change my number or just stop talking to him because he will eventually bump into me and I don't have it in me for a physical face to face confrontation.\n\nAnyway... WIBTA for giving my work colleague this ultimatum? Thank you in advance for your input. ",

No high expectations, but it did seem like both of us felt a pull towards one another. Yes, and it was very romcom-esque and all that mushy bullshit. \nI have another trip planned for this summer, and he invited me to stay with him as long as I wanted, as well as a side trip together. Because I come all the way from the US, traveling for a month abroad can be quite expensive. Three weeks ago, after talking everyday for 5 months, he stop answering me. I didn’t freak out, and about 2 weeks later I ask him if he’s okay. No response. After week 3, finally replies that he had a bit of a mental breakdown that was more “hardcore than usual.” \nThis made me second guess my decision to visit him. Although I care very much about his mental health, I have to think about myself- what if he has another “breakdown” right before I arrive? I simply got a “sorry” (literally, just the word sorry) and then a small explanation. And side note, I was very hurt by his decision to ignore me. I told him that I’m unsure of visiting him and he believes I’m being selfish and uncaring. Is this a red flag or am I an asshole? ",

      "description": " Got a new job and the workplace has become increasingly volatile and I am attacked personally for workplace issues. I attempted to seriously voice my concerns with my boss about how yelling in my face multiple times a day makes it very hard for me to stay calm and focused, and that I see no light at the end of the tunnel. When I said this, the boss became very angry and yelled \"i dont give a FUCK if I scream in your face, I dont even give a fuck if everyone here screamed in your face, do your job\". This was after she threatened my job while in an anger fit. I cannot hold a reasonable conversation with her about why I am very unhappy working here because she gets angry and tries to blame it on me. I NEED to quit this job, no option. My life is going well other than this job but I am constantly so stressed about this job and i feel miserable and depressed purely because of the way I am treated at work. I typically love my jobs, and love working to improve my performance and become more valuable as an employee. This usually means I end up a pretty valuable and well liked employee. \n\nI have never in my life had an experience at a job where I was PERSONALLY and professionally disliked, and I have never quit a job other than when I had to move states. She will not listen when I try to tell her I need to leave this job just tries to fight about it. The last four people in this position here left in a week or less and I should have taken that as a warning. I am very scared to try and confront her more aggressively because I am a passive person that avoids conflict. I think that after the most recent anger fit I need to just stop going. I dont want to ever be someone to leave a job like that but I think I have no other option. She wont listen when I tell her I want to quit. The other employees are also scared of her and treated nearly the same. To best describe how it feels to work here, I feel like a cat turd that spilled out of the litter box onto the floor, and everyone is pissed off that it's on the floor but no one wants to pick it up. Plus a lot of yelling, personal insults and mean gossiping about me and in front of me. ",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live in the Midwest, which is boring af, so I have a social Facebook group where anyone local can join and we go to happy hours, bars, etc. Recently, a new person, \"Anna\" joined. When Anna came to our first get-together, she seemed A LOT older than most of us (20s-30s). She had grey hair and wrinkles but insisted she was 29. Throughout the night, she was really loud and rude. Afterwards, a few people told me they made her uncomfortable. She was just brusque and some of the things she said were socially inappropriate. A few of my friends expressed that they thought she had special needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, Anna showed up again. She was still loud and rude, and made comments to some people that were totally uncalled for. Before we got together again, I sent her a message to let her know that she was making people uncomfortable and we all had to feel safe and comfortable in this group. No response. Another get-together came, and she didn't talk to anyone. She just sat there and stared at everyone. So, after talking it over with other people, I decided to remove her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow she messaged me asking to be let back in, because she wants to meet friends in a controlled setting. She wants to practice making friends and picking up on their mistakes. Based on how it was written, I now really believe she has something wrong with her, either intellectually or a personality disorder. But I don't feel responsible for being her \"mentor\" or teaching her how to make friends. We're all here to hang out and have some fun, not be made fun of by someone. AITA for not letting her back in?",

      "description": "The story begins with me going on Tinder since I'm currently divorcing and there's nothing much I/we can do to save the marriage, trust me on this one. It's not like I'm looking for another long term relationship but rather I have some emotional needs that I'm currently working on with my therapist and such. Like, I am a really depressed guy with existencial anxiety ofteen feeling the need to know there's someone there that cares and look after me, maybe one or two \"good morning\" texts to start the day with a lot of energy and love. I've never been the kind of guy that have female friends and I'm mostly looking forward to get some. Female input may suit me well right now since I'm looking to change the way I look, dress and talk given I'm working for a big company now.  \n\n1.- I matched with this super cute, smart and cool girl the other week and we were texting and laughing and having a great time. She asked me about my weekend schedule maybe so we can go on a date or something and I said that on weekends is when I get to see my daughter. Her mood changed and we barely text each other right now. \n\n2.- There was this other girl I matched on probably this past Friday and we were having a great conversation as well but the things changed as soon as I mentioned my daughter. \n\nThis has been happening with pretty much all the girls I match, some of them have accepted to go out with me as friends but seems they do this out of pity rather than actually wanting to know me. \n\n**Disclaimer - I do tell the girls I am divorcing and seems as if that doesn't even matter. Conversation continues on the normal and we even forplay a bit and you know the drill. It's Tinder FFS.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I met this cute girl the other day and we've been talking and even exchanged phone numbers, she sent me pictures of her day, like whenever she's in the office, or driving or having brunch, you know. Like she's sharing her life with me. Things are working really good but I haven't mentioned my daughter and I'm planning on not doing for the time being. I realized that talking about my personal life to complete strangers is such a stupid move, this may lead to many bad things. I will once I get to trust her more and she demonstrates she can be my friend. Still, I can't shake this feeling of being a dick because she is like investing time and feelings on me and when I drop the bomb she may feel betrayed/deceived or I don't know, my mind is not my best friend right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not being 100% honest with this girl and misleading her emotions?

      "description": "This happened a long time ago (almost three years to be specific) but since back then I didn't know about reddit, and this thing still bugs me to this day, I must hear someone else's opinion on the matter.\n\nSo, there was this guy, let's call him Mike. We met in the 1st grade of primary school (I'm from Europe btw.) when we were just kids and basically we quickly became best friends. During this time we had ups and downs, but we remained best friends despite everything. Then middle school came. We went to different schools, but we still had great contact, also we established a great friendship with yet another guy, and so there was the three of us now. And finally highschool came. After three years apart from each other during middle school, Mike and I went to the same highschool once again, and even to the same class! But... This was the time things started to break.\n\nWith the beginning of high school, Mike started to spend less and less time with the remaining two of us. He began to hang out more with other guys, without us. Still, we had some kind of contact. In between the semesters I switched classes, and so we speaked to each other even less... But it wasn't the ultimate end of our relationship. You see... I had a crush on a girl from my middle school class, let's call her Monica. Monica friendzoned me for a long time, also after I told her that I loved her. And during the first grade of highschool (she went to the same highschool as us) I decided to break contact with her, as the relationship was clearly one-sided. During that time, Mike confessed to me that he'd like to ask Monica out (in a romantic way). I asked him not to, as I still was in love with her, I told him that when I stop having any emotions to her, I'll let him know and he can do as he pleases. He agreed. Long story short, Monica met with me after some time, as she developed feelings to me (that's a weird story, believe me), she also confessed that she met with Mike, despite my request. I was really mad at him, I felt betrayed. It was even worse because of the fact that he told her that they need to keep it in secret, so I wouldn't find out. When he texted me after some time, I cursed at him and told him to go to hell. He simply texted that he's sorry, and said nothing more. He wouldn't talk with me anytime later. He didn't try to apologize to me at school, or in anyway. Our 10 years friendship ended\n\nAnd so time passed, I dated Monica for 4 months and then we broke up, high school ended and now I'm in college. But this thing still bothers me to this day. My mother told me that I should be the first to try to patch things up. She told me that so many times that I started to feel guilty. I'm not able to make any new friendships since, and I fell into depression. Am I the asshole for not trying to patch things up with him?\n\nSorry for my English, if anything's wrong",

      "description": "So my brother is partial owner of a gym where I work. Today he and his fiancee brought in their son who is mildly autistic and has minor ADHD and left him with me behind the desk. I hate kids. I'm terrible with them and frankly have a bad attitude when it comes to children, my brother knows this. His son was pretty well behaved, but I got stuck taking care of him for about half the time they were here. I get paid 12 bucks an hour. I cover any shifts they need and I am not a baby sitter. So when they were leaving I asked my brother to keep a closer eye on his kid from now on.  I didn't raise my voice, and wasnt looking for a fight. I get that it's his business and he can do what he wants, but he WENT OFF. Screamed at me that If I dont like it I can leave right now. Told me to go fuck myself in front of a ton of customers. His fiancee was pleading with him to stop by the end and as he left he started to take it out on his kid. Afterwards I texted him that I was giving my two weeks as, regardless of my request, his reaction was completely unnecessary. He called me and half heartedly apologized and I told him I didn't accept and was still quitting. I dont need the job or the money, but up until now I liked it here. So my question is AITA for quitting? Did I make an unreasonable request?",

My parents divorced when I was 11 and when my brothers were 15 and we moved up to Canada, leaving my dad in Texas. \n\nFor the better half of 5 years I had little contact with him besides an occasional phone call or Facebook message. I didn't get any child support due to our family being too poor to afford a lawyer (I'm told my brothers didn't get any from their father either) and that left me having to pay for my university funds all on my own. Granted my university is definitely on the cheaper side (about 1600 a semester for full time students) but  it still helps to get as much as I can. My mom encouraged me to ask my dad for money as he should give me some assistance since he never paid child support. After a few months of hesitation I asked him about it back in August and he accepted to give me $250 each month until I left university or once I hit the age of 25.\n\nOne of my brothers recently lashed out at me for taking this money, as he had to work a full time job to afford his tuition. He said I was a traitor to my mom's side of the family and that I deserve nothing from what I get. I know my other brother is also uncomfortable about this but he said that it's not on me, it's on my dad. I feel like an enemy to my mom's family and I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong.

      "description": " \n\nThrowaway account for various reasons.\n\nThis is a long one boyos, sorry.\n\nRecently my older sibling has got in touch with me and we have been talking amicably for a couple of months after years of not talking.\n\nUsually this only lasts for a short amount of time as something will piss them off and they will demand that I grovel and beg for their forgiveness which I refuse to do.\n\nMe and my sibling have a lot of water under the bridge. I feel that they only ever come to me when their life has gone to utter shit, something which I take issue with. As my sibling is older than me they always always think that they are right. Like totally set in their ways which I understand to an extent but it becomes incredibly frustrating when you're talking to someone who won't even attempt to see your point of view.\n\nAnother reason I take issue with this is because they will demand that the whole family become involved and make time for them. To my mind I think that it's inconsiderate to demand everyone drop everything because you're going through a hard time through your own foolishness.\n\nRight now they're going through a tough time I admit, I have really tried, believe me to put all our issues aside and help them as much as I possibly could. I'm a forgiving person and I try to be happy go lucky and not hold grudges, but when people treat you horribly its hard to forget what they've put you through.\n\nThey will call **constantly.** I don't mean a couple of times, I mean constantly ring until you get so frustrated you throw the phone away, I can't even Google anything because their constantly calling (Thanks iPhone).\n\nI've explained that I'm in a very strict job where we can't use our phones freely, so I can't answer. To this they get really frustrated and tell me to make time.\n\nEven when we do talk it's for **hours.** If it was a pleasant conversation then I wouldn't mind. It's continuously about how their life is hard, they have always suffered - even though they've been given the best opportunities in life (money for college, a huge wedding etc). My sibling has inflicted a lot of pain on our family and constantly insults them which is very hard for me to hear but I never say anything because I don't want them to feel bad. They dig at my other siblings, my parents and expect me to be quiet. On the odd occasion I ask them to not be so insulting, they tell me \"I'm entitled to my opinion, you can't shut me down because you don't like it, either I'm your family or stranger\".\n\nWhen I don't pick up the phone I get guilt tripped into feeling like shit. They'll say \"Oh so you could come online for WhatsApp but you can't answer my phone call?\"\n\n\"Why are you so busy anyways? You're job isn't that important\"\n\n\"You need to prioritise me otherwise it's best we stop talking\"\n\nI feel like I have to give them a breakdown of my day to justify why I couldn't speak to them. If there's a gap, e.g lunch, or travelling to a meeting, they will ask why I never called then. The inflections in their voice makes me want to tell them to fuck off and never call me again because its so accusatory.\n\nThey will constantly message to the point where I switch my phone off because I can't handle the long suffering \"woe is me\" conversations.\n\nBefore I seem unreasonable my sibling has straight ignored me on the street when things were going well for them. They poisoned my niece's against me, saying that I don't give a crap about them when actually my sibling has never allowed me to see them unless I bring money, toys or food.\n\nNow my nieces' don't even acknowledge me. They call me \"**Him\"**.\n\nMy mental health has deteriorated these past years and I really want to focus on myself. I can't give my all to my sibling and I feel like I literally want to leave and run away.\n\nI always have a headache after we've spoken. They turn up at my house to take them out, they constantly guilt trip me into feeling bad and make themselves the victim.\n\nAm I the asshole for trying to distance myself?\n\nShould I feel guilty?\n\nWhat the heck do I do?",

      "description": "This actually happened a while ago, but I’ll try to explain as objectively as possible.\n\nMy friends and I are on a team playing a 5v5 MOBA video game. In this game it is nearly impossible to win while missing a teammate. So one of my friend is new to the game and pretty bad at it. He’s getting frustrated and at one point he dies and said “This sucks. I quit.” In response I angrily say “don’t quit you’ll ruin the game for everyone” we go back and forth a few times essentially reiterating what we have already said.\n\nAt this point we’re both pretty mad and and I say “quit acting like a toddler. You can’t just ruin everyone else’s fun because your not having fun” (ruin other peoples fun by making us play a hopeless game wasting 20 minutes). My friend says “you’re such a dick I can’t believe you’re getting mad at me over a video game.”\n\nThis is where I get really pissed. I pretty much just keep telling him to stop being a baby. Regardless of whether or a not a video game it’s an activity for fun and if someone wants to ruin everyone else’s fun because they’re not having fun then I think they’re an asshole. The teasing I got really mad is because after explaining my viewpoint he just disregarded it because it was over a video game.\n\nI’m now realizing how hard it is to write these posts because there is so much nuance and context to my story but this is the best I can do.\n\nAlso we are no longer friends and I explain it politely as “we are just different people.”",

I'm in therapy for it but as it is now i'm very averse to anything that may be dirty, I don't make direct contact with surfaces in public, dislike shaking hands and so forth. I also can't eat food prepared by someone who wasn't wearing gloves, so I don't go out to eat often and usually cook for myself.\n\ni recently moved and was invited by my new neighbors, a young married couple, to their home to hang out and get to know eachother. i had asked in advance if they were asking me to dinner, using the excuse that i had a lot of food sensitivity so i'd have to politely decline. he said his wife may be cooking for them but he didn't plan it to be a dinner for the three of us which was good.\n\nI went over and things were going well but as i was preparing to leave he told me what she was cooking because I smelled it and i made the mistake of talking about how i prepare that dish which let him know I'm not sensitive towards so my lie failed, and he said i should stay for dinner after all. i had just been watching his wife touch all the food by hand as she was preparing dinner and i got very bad anxiety at the thought of eating it. \n\ni know its an irrational phobia and her hands are clean, and i hate burdening other people, so i kept trying to find a way out of it until she came into the room and asked if i was that scared to try her cooking. i felt kind of trapped in the discussion and didn't want to be rude by continuing to lie so I admitted i have an irrational fear of germs and get very bad anxiety, that it isn't personal and i know she cleaned her hands but i can't eat food i don't cook myself.\n\nshe said \"wow\" and walked away from me and her husband told me I was being rude to come over and refuse to eat. I explained again it wasn't personal and that he had told me it wouldn't be a dinner so i hadn't planned on eating. he told me to leave and now when I see them outside they won't even acknowledge me.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This was a couple years ago. At some point in time he was living in his car after getting kicked out by his mom. His dad invited him to live with him, his stepmom(of 15+years), and stepbrother, until he got back on his feet. He was never really close with his dad, but he still cared about having his respect and what he thought of himself. A few months into living there he and his stepmom grew a mutual attraction for each other, and they ended up having sex while the dad was out with the stepbrother. Over the course of him living there whenever they would get the chance they would go at it. He eventually moved/got kicked out, but it didn't end after that. she would make excuses that she needed to take him his mail so that she could get away so they could have sex.\n\nI feel bad that no one really knows who he is and what kinds of things he's willing to do even to family. There is lots of blame to put on the stepmom, but this isn't the first time he has done something like this. \n\nI'd really like to put the truth out there for everyone to know who he really is, but i think i'd be fine with just letting his dad know so he can decide what to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I have no issues with giving away water, letting them use the restroom, having some conversation, etc.\n\nBut there is one couple that comes in almost every morning. They pick through the ashtrays for cigarettes, they sink-shower in the bathrooms and always leave a mess, and they ask for 2 cups of hot water every morning for their oatmeal or something. I would like to start charging them for the cups. \n\nThe cups are compostable, so more expensive. Obviously, I'm not the one purchasing the cups, but I feel that they overstay their welcome and take advantage of our hospitality. We have many homeless who come through a few times a week, and I don't mind helping out, but their behavior feels disrespectful to me.\n\nI work the morning shift five days a week. The other two days, another coworker works and always gives them the cups with no problem. So far, I have done the same, but I think at some point we need to do something to discourage their behavior. But maybe I'm being an asshole? I can't tell.",

      "description": "My boyfriend (M25) and I (F21) have a long distance relationship. We see each other almost every weekend. For various reasons (among them: I have roommates and he lives alone) I go to his place more often than he comes to visit me, and I also spend my semester breaks at his flat while I'm working. We agreed that I don't pay rent when I'm there as he is working a well paid full time job and I'm still in college. \n\nI have stored about one third of my clothes at his place, so that I don't have to move them around all the time. Out of the seven shelves in his wardrobe, two are mine, plus one out of four drawers. As a result of this, my clothes are in his laundry as well. And as he lives in his flat \"full time\", he also does laundry more often than I do. I will sometimes do it too though, especially when I'm there for semester breaks or longer weekends. Whenever I do our laundry, I treat all our clothes the same: I wash, hang, fold and sort in all of my and his clothes equally. He does so as well, except for the last step. He will fold my clothes, then stack them all together randomly (so, for example, first a tshirt, then socks, then pants, then a dress...) and puts that stack on my shelf as it is. I have offered him multiple times to have some of his clothes stored at my place as well, but he said no to that. If he had clothes stored at my place though, It'd never come to my mind to treat them any differently than my own stuff. \n\nAs a result, as soon as I come over to his place, I have to sort in all my clothes to the correct pile. It's not like I have a lot of different piles, just 8 different piles for different type of clothing, and the drawer for underwear and socks. It's not rocket science to figure out that tshirts should be on the tshirt pile, pants on the pants pile and so on. For me, having to sort them myself seems like an unnecessary addition of steps as he puts my clothes in the wardrobe anyway, and I don't think that sorting them before is much of an issue. I also don't care if he placed items on the \"wrong\" pile or something. The whole thing makes me feel a bit like I'm not welcome to his flat each time I have to sort my clothes. As his flat has somewhat become my home base (I'm not really getting along with my parents atm), this always feels like a little stab and a \"hehe, see, it's still MY flat, and MY flat alone!\", and as if he doesn't want me to store my stuff at his place and, thus, live with him. When I told him how I feel about it, he said I'm overreacting. \n\nHis arguments for doing as he does are the following: \n1) He doesn't know which pile is the correct one for which item, and he doesn't want to learn it either. \n2) He's not my housekeeper. \n3) I should be grateful that he's even doing my laundry. If I don't like the way he does it, I can do my laundry myself at any time. \n\nMy boyfriend has proofread this and is okay with how I described the situation. So now tell us, reddit, who of us is the asshole? ",

On top of all this we figured out today she has mites so I covered her in dust treatment to try to hopefully rid the filthy bastards. When we discovered her injured we brought her inside the garage in a small box with food and water. Surprisingly lola has a bright attitude and is eating and drinking but unfortunately her leg or fatherless back doesnt seem to be doing much better after about a week.. what do you think? Should we just let her go? We love her and want her to live but don't want her to suffer. Its hard to decide because she doesn't act like shes in pain...

While we were out, a woman was walking her dog and spotted my dog in my front yard. She started yelling at me to get my dog inside and that I'm a dick for having him off a leash.  I picked up my dog and just listened to her yell at me for a couple minutes before she turned and walked off.  The whole time her dog was growling and antsy while mine was nervous and  stayed by my side.  He is well behaved, trained and listens to commands.  He is also extremely friendly, hence why I let him off leash in our yard fairly regularly. ",

      "title": "AITA for suggesting my GF not pay for her sister’s vacation?",
      "description": "So me and my gf recently got into an argument over how she is going to spend her money. So normally every year my gf’s dad, her younger sister (Samantha), her youngest sister (Rachael) and I go on an annual cruise in the summer. Normally, the dad would pay for Samantha’s and Rachael’s cruise tickets since they both do not have real jobs yet and are still in college. My gf and I pay for our own tickets as we each make around 80,000 / year. \n\nMoney must be tight this year, so the dad said that he would only be able to pay for 1 person this year and my gf suggested that she would pay for the other ticket. I told my gf that that is not a good idea, as the cheapest ticket for this cruise is at least $1500 including taxes and fees. My gf is a very thoughtful and compassionate person and who’s always willing to support her family if they need help, whether it’s ordering an Uber for her sister to get to work or helping pay her mom’s rent; I am fine with that and it’s a great quality that I love about her. However, in this case I think it’s a bit silly to pay for someone else’s vacation and I explained to my GF that $1,500 is not chump change. \n\nShe said that she can pay it on her credit card and she can always pay it back. I explained to her that credit cards are not free money and you have to pay it back. Also, she has $24,000 in student debt and I told her she needs to focus on paying that down before she subsidizes her sister’s vacation. I’m also paying her portion of our rent just so that she can pay off her student loans faster.\nWe also have a 3 week vacation to Korea planned in the fall that we have yet to book hotels for, which will be probably be around $2,000. I’m trying to explain to her that just because you pay for it does not mean you can afford it. And while I understand that this cruise is a family tradition, it’s not life or death situation.\n\nI was trying to suggest alternatives like between now and summer, couldn’t Rachael get a part time job while she’s at college and at least help pay for a portion of the ticket or if Rachael’s Mom could chip in a little bit. I understand that family is supposed to help out family and money is just a tool, but I feel like in this case, my gf shouldn’t be subsidizing her sister’s  vacation. If her sister really wanted to go then she would just get a job on the weekends and at least contribute something.. I don’t want to control how my gf spends her money, but I do want to make it clear to my gf that her idea is a bit silly, especially since she has debts of her own. After our argument my gf won’t talk to me,  accuses me of being cheap, giving me the cold shoulder, etc... AITA?\n\nTLDR: GF wants to pay for an expensive cruise vacation on her sister’s behalf so that they can take an annual family cruise despite her having 24,000 in student loan debt and other expenses. AITA for suggesting that she does not pay 1,500 for her younger sister to come along?",

The baby survived 2-3 hours.

      "description": "I’ll keep this as brief as possible but it’s somewhat complex. Apologies in advance for the length and any mobile formatting issues. Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nMy main group of friends is made up of lots of siblings from numerous families, interspersed with best friends who’ve married brothers from the same family, siblings marrying best friends’ siblings, younger siblings growing up and integrating. Nothing weird but I describe us using a diagram! We span in age from around 29-48 or thereabouts.\n\nI recently went on a three week holiday (I’d never been away for longer than 10 days previously), to the other side of the world to see some of my family. Brother, sister in law (who’s also my best friend), niece, nephew, father and sister. I had a decent size suitcase but realised about two weeks before leaving I had so many presents for them I was going to be hard pushed to fit in enough clothes etc. They moved over this time last year so I had a backlog of birthday and Christmas presents to top up.\n\nA few months ago a friend had asked me if I could take a couple of t shirts and little bits for the kids (my sister in law is also one of her best friends and their children are friends). I said sure, of course.\n\nA week before my flight her sister (another friend) came to my place for dinner and a catch up because she was going to flat/cat sit for me while I was away. She’s been living at home saving up a deposit for her own place and although I knew she was doing me a massive favour she’d also said that she was looking forward to a bit of privacy and independence. I lined up a weekly cleaner, wrote three pages of notes on anything and everything and cleared drawers and wardrobe space for her. At this catch up she handed over the ‘little bits for the kids’ which her sister had given to her, which turned out to be a pretty hefty box, 30x25x6 cm, weighing 2kg and stuffed with  shirts, books, cards and toys.\n\nI felt actual dismay at the size of it. But I sat down with the friend I was going travelling with and we tried to work out if we could fit it all in. We just knew we couldn’t so she texted and said we’d both tried but we couldn’t manage it and we were really sorry. Let me make it clear that this was a shitty move on my part - I should have texted myself. It wasn’t a deliberate dodge but as I discovered later when I saw some of the messages the friend with the parcel had sent about me I realised I’d fucked up and said I was so sorry, I didn’t think, we were together when we sent the text and it was a total brain fart.\n\nAnyway, prior to this realisation, the friend whose box it was sent me a series of escalating text messages. Things like it was a waste of clothes and books(?), how could I leave for my trip having done that to her (I hadn’t left and wasn’t due to for 5 days), that I would have been welcome to take it all out of the box and fit it in that way etc. I assured her I hadn’t left yet. But I also said it wasn’t just the box, it was the weight and bulkiness on top of the rest of the stuff I was taking. I said I was really sorry but I’d had to ask my mum to take back a present she’d given me to take over as well. I was going to be hard pushed to get enough clothes in there! I sent her a photo of my case and she asked if I could just take the birthday present for nephew (a t shirt and a book) and the letters/cards from her and her kids, she’d post the rest, and I said yes, no problem (I’d left enough space for this - i.e. what she’d originally requested). Silence, no acknowledgement, nothing. So I just packed them and took them.\n\nAfter arriving I saw the messages she’d been sending about me to the friend I was travelling with. As mentioned, as soon as I did I apologised for passing the buck and not telling her myself, because it was clear she was upset about it and I knew I’d messed up. I also confirmed that the kids had been given the present and cards etc and they’d been received with thanks. But in her messages she was also ranting about how irresponsible I am and (the really upsetting part) that she thought it was the ‘least I could do given her sister had agreed to cat sit for me’. \n\nAs another layer of fucked-up-ness her sister then didn’t turn up the first day of cat sitting so my neighbour had to step in. Sister texted me at 7pm the evening before my morning flight asking me to put the autofeeder on as she wouldn’t be there until the day after she was supposed to come. After that, she barely replied to any messages until I texted her sister apologising, after which she switched back to normal. She’s not a slow or sporadic texter usually and this was not just a coincidence. I have no problem with sisters confiding in each other and having each other’s backs but I feel like my poor bloody cat shouldn’t have to suffer for it. His feeder only runs for 24 hours and it was going to be 36 by the time she got there. He’s also an indoor cat and gets very lonely without company :(\n\nNow I feel like either a) her sister isn’t actually the friend I thought she was or b) she is and this girl is overreacting, manipulating and lashing out or c) I’ve been a shit friend for letting her down on the parcel in the first place. When I texted her apologising for the brain fart I mentioned I’d seen the texts. She came back to say ‘Thanks for clarifying. Don’t worry about it.’ So she knows I’ve seen her saying pretty awful things about me, she knows I’ve seen that she said her sister, someone I consider a friend in her own right, was only helping me as a favour to her. But she clearly believes she’s justified in saying those things and that she’s done nothing wrong. She didn’t thank me for taking the things I did end up taking.\n\nJust as an aside - the destination country was Australia and I was departing the UK, both of whose postal systems are extremely good. The parcel would’ve made it no problem. Her husband makes a lot of money in finance and she is a stay at home mum. We’re both around 40 (too old for this stuff imo but maybe that’s me being the asshole).\n\nAlso, photo of my suitcase (pre-clothes packing) attached. Her parcel is on top with the ribbon.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/nV8CnJe\n\nAITA? I don’t know what to think and it’s really playing on my mind. Should I have tried harder to fit her stuff in? Am I wrong to expect an apology for her behaviour when I’m the one who let her down? \n\nThank you so much for reading if you’ve gotten this far and apologies if it’s a bit confusing! I’m confused myself tbh... :/",

      "description": "Background: I attend University in a city approximately 2 hours from where I live. I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I’m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city’s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there’s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I’m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I’m usually pretty exhausted. As it’s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn’t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She’s a little older, but I wouldn’t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says ‘You can sit here’ beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn’t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I’m sitting down 😒 But it’s very obvious when I’m standing, many people ask me if I’m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don’t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I’m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn’t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don’t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. ",

      "description": "So to start off I’m a bar tender we do sometimes have homeless people come in ask for waters or drinks (I don’t charge for waters)  or to just charge their phones I’m fine with it. \nHowever tonight, we had a guy come in I assumed he was homeless but wasn’t sure he came up to me and I was like “how can I help you ?” \nHM:alcohol I want alcohol !” \nME:okay what type would you like ?\nHM: ALCOHOL!!!! ALCHOHOL! \nME:  would you like vodka, whisky etc? \nHM: alcohol!! \nAt this point I’m like okay dude I can’t help you if you just keep saying the same thing. At this point I get my manager and say hey this guy at the bar just keeps telling me he wants alcohol but won’t tell me anything else. And my manager talks to him and was like you gotta go buddy and he’s just like I want alcohol. Then we had to get another employee to get him out (he was literally grabbing onto the bar and they had to pull him off) and in the process of getting the man out he tripped and fell somehow which I feel bad about. He kept standing at the door and kept trying to come in (which my manager had to keep him out) and he stood outside the place looking at me through the window crying with his hand over his head where he fell.\n\nI don’t know why I feel like ass for this but I think it’s mostly in the process of kicking him out that I feel mostly bad about.

We'll call her M. She invited a few friends to go bar hopping, including a friend we'll call C. C's brother offered to be the designated driver for us. As the night progresses, C's brother buys us round after round of drinks. We did not ask him to do that. He just ordered for us, one right after the other. We got pretty toasty, so looking back, I probably would not have allowed him to spend so much money on me if I wasn't.\n\nThe next day, M told me that C's brother wanted about $50 repayment from each of us for the drinks. I said absolutely not. No one forced him to buy drinks for him all night, and we never agreed to reimburse him for it. Needless to say, C and her brother were pissed and refused to talk to me, though it wasn't like we were close to begin with.\n\nI should add that he did not make a pass at me, and I was not flirting with him whatsoever. There was no romance involved in the situation. He bought drinks for everyone.\n\nSo AITA?",

I cook 3-4 times a week and do other chores in and around the house and we consider it the rent. Now last week I woke up to a blood-curdling scream. I quickly put on some pants and rush to the bathroom where it came from, in there was Jess half naked in a corner hyperventilating and crying. I try to calm her down and she starts yelling at me. I leave thinking she \"probably\" didn't want to be comforted she was half naked.\n\n30 minutes later Jess swings open my door and now more collected says that I'm to blame for her getting fat. I look at her and say \"getting\"? Normally we joke around like this and she'd say something about me going bald and we'd laugh, not this time she yelled about being 60 kg (132lbs) now. Later she enters my room again this time directly complaining about the fact my food is too unhealthy. What she meant with that is that I guess she likes it more than the food my mom makes and eats more of it. Since I try to cook healthy and at least think I do.\n\nIn the evening I made a salad for dinner and I get complaints from everyone that this isn't food, even from Jess complains about it. Then I explain what happened that morning and get told to make healthier food for Jess by my mom and that \"it has to be food\". I did enjoy the salad.\n\nSince then every meal has was a complaint of either it being unhealthy or being gross, which I'm still convinced what they mean by unhealthy is that it tastes good and they just eat more. example of the unhealthy stuff was spaghetti, home made mushroom sauce (mushrooms, flour and a bit of milk and some spices) and grilled chicken with garlic.\n\nOh you bet Jess' milking this, she needs new clothes because I fattened her up a dress size. proceeds to go out and come back with new clothes which I presume are her normal size since it looks about as tight as usual and often with some candy or chocolate...\n\nSo my entire family blames me for all of this. Even though I'm under weight myself and probably eat more from my own meals than anyone else.\n\nTl;DR My stepsister is getting fat and blames my cooking and everyone in my family agrees with her.",

      "description": "In our house we have agreed that I cook, he does dishes. I wash and dry laundry, he puts it away. Last night I made a labor intensive, but delicious, meal at his request. I also washed and dried several loads of laundry which I laid out on the loveseat (not in a pile, that’ll make wrinkles). Tonight I made a quick dinner because he hadn’t cleaned the dishes yet and then went to lay on the coach and snoop around on Reddit. My husband had started hanging up clothes and mumbled about there being a ton of dishes. I nodded in agreement and continued my online relaxation. \n\nAfter a few minutes I noticed he was passive aggressively slamming the clothes around so I asked what was wrong. He claims I should be helping him because there is so much to finish. As far as I was concerned my chores were done! I don’t want to be the bitch but when I was washing, drying, and sorting several loads he was playing Xbox. When I spent three hours making a meal from scratch, he took a nap. It never occurred to me to bitch at him for relaxing when I completed my agreed upon chores. Is it wrong of me to want to relax now? Does the fact that I’m female change the expectation? I am an executive in the corporate world and I’m worried that my way of thinking is too black and white, because I relate this situation to duties assigned to my employees. I can also be known as a hard ass. Should I approach my home life differently? I don’t know if this matters, but my husband holds a similar position at his job. Maybe he’s feeling frustrated because he can’t delegate his duties? I’m not sure. I need a second opinion. AITA?",

Seemingly out of the blue the ex decided she needed space to find herself. While crushed I understood that we had not been very happy together. \n\nI told her I would move out into my friends while I shopped around for an apartment. Most of our belongings are mine, TV bed, furniture, cookware, etc.  I told her I would be back to collect them once I had a new place.  Another reason I decided to leave is that we were informally renting the home from her sister.\n\nWhile staying at my friends I was able to confirm my suspicions that she had been unfaithful. (I can go into detail on the investigation but would rather not relieve that). I also found that she had linked her Venmo account to our joint savings several weeks back and had been purchasing about $180/week of Cocaine form our drug dealer. Total about $600.\n\nBetween the stealing and the infidelity I was livid. So I waited until she was at work and with the help of my friend went back and moved all of my things out.\n\nShe was blowing up my phone and I have been called every name in the book. I do feel bad essentially leaving her with an empty home but my reasoning is two fold. I was not sure who my ex was anymore and didn't want to lose my things since I never signed a lease or anything. Secondly I didn't think I could look her in the face without erupting in anger. I do feel bad and that brings me here, so let me have your judgment. Am I the Asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "This happened about two years ago. At the time, i had heard rumors about a party being set up for those in my class in secondary school and was very interested to join. So, i decided to ask around and finally got the names of those planning the party and decide to ask them if i can come and offer my help, thinking of a simple yes or no answer. Instead, i receive no answers or info about the party until the day it was supposed to happen( even this i found out from another friend who wasn't even planning it) or if i was even invited or was to help in some way. At some points some people  directed me to someone else , and then it would go nowhere with the again other person stating \"I'm not planning the party, ***** is! Ask him/her!\" And then directing me to another person who would repeat it over and over until the day before the party.\n\nAt this point, I'm about 70% sure they don't actually want me to go to the party, and get pretty pissed at both being left out and most importantly being bounced around and treated like a fool. So, seeing as i was due in the area for some errands, i decided to gatecrash, and act dumb to screw their party up. So I did it, only telling my good friend that told me in the location in the first place, and ONLY leaving to gatecrash at about 3pm i get a msg telling me not to come, less than 1 hour before the party was due to start. Of course, at this point im indignant, and go there anyways, wishing my good friend a happy birthday (the party was to celebrate those that had their birthdays that month) and after taking a small 'greeting' parade and some trolling left to do the errands.\nAITA for doing this? What else should i have done?(In hindsight, i do feel it was petty, but those people really pissed me off.",

      "description": "Recently I got into an argument with my roommate about how he is disrespectful he is to me. Let me explain what I think has happened.\n\nBefore we left for the restaurant, we were just talking and he started to sit on my bike. I immediately told him to get off my bike because I thought it was rude. He did not get off my bike and said *NO.* I was a bit frustrated and I said nothing after. But I did tell him off a bit saying don't use my things without asking. Now to explain, I am protective of my things, I usually don't like it when people use my stuff without asking; however, if they ask nicely I usually let them. A few weeks back, I let him on my bike before and let him ride it around the university, so what. But I don't want him to keep on riding my bike over and over again mainly because he has his own bike.\n\nDuring dinner, us friends were having a good time eating out. I said some joke about him being so full (food). I basically said *you shouldn't of eaten a full meal before coming to the restaurant, haha.* All of sudden he blew up and said *F\\*\\*\\* you, I don't trust you at all. That is why I leave my door locked because I don't know what you will do?* The entire table went quiet and looked at both of us. After that I did not say much during dinner. Once we got back home, I blew up on him saying don't ever disrespect me like that again (I was furious and hurt). After that, all he said \\*Sorry, is that what you want?\\*Is that what you want me to say? Before it could get worse I just walked into my room and locked the door.\n\nThe next day(today) I asked him to come talk to me and we did. I asked him why he said such rude things over dinner last night and he said *He was just joking*. And I was essentially skeptical about this response because who says such hurtful things and says that he/she was joking. Then I said something along the lines of *I know all jokes are based on some truth.*And he said *Yea, but you let your other friend ride your bike the other time, why can't I?* I said you did ride my bike around the uni and I let only one other friend ride my bike but only when he asked nicely. (Friend rode the bike only once) \n\nNow you know the story. As of right now we are still not on speaking terms. **Am I the asshole for not letting my roommate ride my bike?**\n\nWe are both in our 20s, College Students.",

      "description": "This happened today and I feel bad. My bf wanted us to see his family today to celebrate Christmas early since they will be out of town on the actual day. I agreed to go knowing I had work the night before and the night of the get together.\n\nThe problem arose when I got out of work 2 hours late Bc we were extremely busy, I work overnights. Originally if I got off on time I would have been able to sneak in at least 4 hours of sleep and I was willing to work with that and be slightly tired for work tonight. The problem was getting out late meant I would only get 1 hour of sleep as bf lives an hour away so I’d have to drive there before getting sleep. And we would leave his house for his parents.\n\nIt’s very important to him to see his family on holidays although they do visit a handful of times during the year. And it’s important to him I go to be part of the family. I like his parents very much. But he doesn’t like to go without me.\n\nI texted him when I got home explaining I wasn’t comfortable going to work tonight on so little sleep as my job is physically demanding for me. So I apologized profusely through text (he was still asleep the lucky bastard lol no hard feelings just teasing. \n\nI proceeded to go to bed and slept a good 8 hours and feel ready to work tonight now. Problem is my bf decided not to go without me and they rescheduled for Thursday night after Christmas coming up, so that I could go.\n\nMy schedule has already been made and I’m pretty sure I work Thursday night as well.. and he asked me to take off that day. I’ve recently started this job about 2 months ago and still get anxious asking for days off, especially since the schedule is made already. \n\nI requested a different day off this week with plenty notice before, that was accepted a week ago for his birthday, I wanted to surprise him and know I could have that day with him for his birthday. \n\nI honestly don’t have the motivation to see his family if it’s going to cause strain on me getting proper rest and being able to do my job efficiently.\n\nPossible asshole moment is that I am more concerned spending time with him on his birthday than seeing his parents, I’m socially awkward and usually sit quiet for hours while they all talk. I’m not sure I want to see if I can trade the day of his birthday to take the day off to see his parents. \n\nPart of me really wishes he just went today without me instead of trying to reschedule so I could go. Now causing me anxiety Bc idk if I should cancel the day I have planned with him for his birthday, just to be off so I can go with him to see his parents.... I’d rather make his birthday special than hanging out with his parents. \n\nPlease help me reddit. AITA for flaking out on me going to his family Christmas so I get decent sleep and, I have a whole day already guaranteed off for his birthday? Should I try to switch shifts knowing if I did that I wouldn’t get to romance him for his birthday?\n\n\nI just don’t think I can get the night off to see his family and still have his birthday with him, which is more important to me than spending a few hours with his family with twiddling my thumbs the whole time.\n\nTL;DR I flaked on going with my bf to his parents due to working overnight and getting a lack of sleep for work the same night. Bf reschedules Christmas get together and expects me to take off to make it later this week. Schedule already made. I’m not sure I can take off on such short notice nor do I want to set a bad precedent as I am still new to this job",

      "description": "So I have a toddler daughter and we have limited options on babysitting which we use usually on more important stuff, but this time we went partying with my wife. However, when we arrived at this indoors party, I saw that some people are smoking there. I was confused at first, because this is disallowed by the law on such place where I live. Also, I can't stand even faint cig smoke indoors. After a while I decided I don't want to be there under such circumstances, although previously we were both looking forward to the party. My wife got angry at me telling I ruined the party and our date for her (I admit I was visibly annoyed, on the other hand I was trying to suggest an alternative like let's go to cinema instead). She told me it's my fault because I should have adked whether there will be smoking indoors when it bothers me so much, because it was \"underground\" party and I knew there many weed smokers (read: law breakers) attenders who I should not expect to follow the no-indoors-smoking law. But I think it's unfair, most smokers were smoking outdoors which I am completely OK with, just a few a-holes destroyed the indoors breathability and the a-hole keeper or a-hole organizer would not care.",

      "description": "My partner and I are disagreeing on how I should take my recently prescribed medication for depression and anxiety  (Prozac aka Fluoxetine) I'm not a stranger to taking SSRIS before as I took zoloft from the ages of 5 to 16. What prompted me to start taking SSRIs again is the increase of panic attacks and my lack of emotional stability and ability to regulate my emotions properly.   \n\n\nMy boyfriend who I have been with for about 3 years now has talked to me about maybe taking medicine again and I agreed. I made a doctor's appointment to start SSRIs again and we discussed my options. My partner suggests that I have pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder as he's been taking notes about how I act generally and wants me to take a specific medication intermittently. In the doctor's office he told me that he would only feel comfortable with me taking fluoxetine as he had done research on it prior and how it alleviates PMDD symptoms. I instantly told him in front of the doctor that he's not within his bounds. It created a really awkward and uncomfortable environment for me at my appointment and I honestly wanted to just ask him to leave.   \n\n\nThe doctor ended up prescribing me fluoxetine. My partner and I have had some arguments whether I should take it intermittently rather than everyday. I told him I feel much more comfortable taking it everyday instead of intermittently as it makes me feel more secure than taking it intermittently and prior I had taken zoloft everyday. To which he responded, that I might not even need it when I'm not experiencing symptoms.  \n\n\nFor whatever reason, he can't seem to let it go and I can't really either. I'm really not in a good place mentally and I think the further the stress of going back and forth when I'm in a weird state is doing more harm than good. I've asked multiple times if he could just let me do what I'd like to do, seeing as how it is my prescription and I'm the one that is making the choice to put it in my body. It just makes me really confused and hurt and every time I tell him I want to take it everyday he tells me I'm not thinking rationally. Which I get, I'm not doing the best right now but I don't know how to talk to him about this anymore and I really just want to avoid discussing it and I get angry very quickly when discussing it now.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole? Because I sure as fuck feel like one.",

She’s 5’8 and weighs about 120lbs. She has no ass. I brought up the idea of weight training glutes to her and offered to pay for her gym membership and protein supplements.

Her body looks exactly the same and I honestly feel like I’m being ripped off. I confronted her about it and she told me that she’s been consistently going to the gym four times a week and that I was an asshole for accusing her of being lazy. I told her that it made no sense that she was going supposedly to the gym for eight months, yet still didn’t have an ass. I told her to just ring up and cancel instead of wasting my money. She started crying and we haven’t spoken for about three hours. I’m not sure if I pushed her too far or not. AITA?",

Apologies for the length and grammar mistakes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I had a brother whom I was very close to. He was a year and a bit older than me. He went through a phase of hanging out with the 'wrong' crowd for a while but copped on very quickly after a short altercation with the police. He moved to a better school with better sports facilities; could have been proffessional athlete and was extremely popular. I then moved to the same school a year later. He was always very protective over me. He once tortured me for smoking weed and I haven't gone near the stuff since, one of the best things he did for me. He hated drugs and was influential in stopping many of his friends from trying stuff. He didn't have any problem with cigarettes and alcohol. He was a heavy drinker.\n\n(He was 17 and I was 15)\n\nAfter I followed him to this new school, i made lots of new friends. They all already knew my brother as he was very popular and was on the first football team, thus i was somewhat popular aswell. No one would have crossed me in school because of my brother's reputation etc. and thus I had it fairly easy. \n\nMy brother commits suicide. He had severe clinical depression. I had no idea until after he had passed away. My parents tried their best to give him the care he needed. I handled it ok. Was in a state of shock for a long while after. I never mourned in front of others. At his funeral I was comforting my friends more than they were comforting me. \n\nAt this time, a few of my friends and I formed into a group. The group started when we used to go to the 'lane' outside school for cigarettes. Went out every week together etc. This group quickly developed into the 'wrong' crowd sort of group. We became heavy drinkers and participated in anti-social behaviour. Our group would start fights at teenage discos against smaller people that wouldn't have stood a chance against us in a fight. I wasn't proud of this and thus wasn't that involved but not exempt from it. One of my friends 'Sam' was the worst for picking fights with people smaller than him. We had many disagreements over this but none that lasted more than a day.\n\nThey started doing drugs (ecstasy, MDMA and 'yokes'). I drew the line there and started arguing almost daily against this. These were my best friends and they didn't understand why I didn't want them to do drugs. I simply didn't want to go near the stuff for two reasons. 1) Out of respect to my deceased brother who hated all sorts of drugs, and 2) I was afraid I would not have been able to control myself, I was still grieving (6-8 months since my brother's death at this stage).\n\nTo keep myself from doing drugs I felt I had to keep it out of the group, as they kept talking about how good it was and I felt I wouldn't be able to handle the temptation for much longer. I fought hard on this and lost a lot of respect from the group for this. I was acting like their 'nanny' as they put it. Some of the guys in the group were sound and sympathetic about it more than others, but they were all doing it secretly and not telling me anything. One of my closest friends, Sam, was the worst when it came to lying about it. The morning after a night out we were talking, I asked him the question if he did drugs the night before, (he clearly did), and *he swore on my brother's grave he had not*. **\\*This is why I still have the grudge today\\*** I left the conversation at that as to avoid a fight. I confronted him about it two days later where Sam admitted he did do drugs but denied swearing on my brother's grave. \n\nI walked out of the group after that. At the time, they were all of my closest friends, and it was very tough for me to do that. I went from going out with them 6 days a week, to barely going out once a month (with another group i kind of knew). This was a very low point in my life. After being in that high school for two years, I moved back to my old high school (due to my attendance, failing grades and my brother's passing) and finished my last two years of high school there.\n\nIt was impossible to walk away from the group completely. We lived too close to each other and ended up at the same parties via our mutual friends. I made up with most of the group eventually but never returned to hanging out with them.  The group sort of dispersed after high school but remained friends. Despite that, I still had a grudge against Sam, and the grudge grew and grew as time went by. After high school, we both coincidently ended up in the same course in college. Over the space of 5 years or so, I had only spoken to him two or three times, despite seeing each other at least once every week or two. \n\nI never really 'hate' anyone and am very passive and never aggressive with people. I have always felt uncomfortable using the word hate. With Sam it was different. I hated him. Whenever he was around, even though i wouldn't be speaking to him, I would find myself getting an urge to go over to him and pick a fight with him. I never acted on it though. The main reason being is that we have many mutual friendships that I don't want to jeopardise. He is closer to many of them than I am. I would most likely come out looking like the bad guy if any confrontation were to happen.\n\nHe has tried only once to talk to me since we stopped talking in high school. He chose a really awkward time and I said to him to ask me again later that day. He didn't. I am taller and bigger than he is so I get a strong sense that he is scared of me and would avoid confrontation if it were to occur. He has clearly forgotten why it is that I have this grudge against him. Apparently he has matured since according to a mutual friend, but I have seen him act otherwise on snapchat stories, thus I have reservations about believing that. Maybe I haven't made it clear to him enough as to why I choose to ignore him. It is very obvious to the both of us. He knows I am doing it just as much as I do. I am afraid to talk to him in fear that I could end up lashing out at him. I feel ashamed that I might resort to violence. I never lash out at anyone but am afraid that it could be different with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? We are now both 21 years old. I know 5 years ago he was the asshole but now after such a long time, have I now become the villain for holding the grudge? Avoiding each other is impossible as we have many many mutual friends. Ignoring him has sort of worked until now but it doesn't help with the grudge. I am beginning to no longer enjoy nights out where he is around or in the same building. Am I going crazy or getting too obsessive about it or am i justified?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "For some info, I'm 24f, he is 28m.\n\nI want to start by mentioning that I am a very infrequent Tinder user. I use Tinder exclusively for one off, no strings attached sexual encounters. I generally find I don't NEED sex too often, but sometimes when I get really stressed out sometimes I just really need a hookup to bring me back down. When I use Tinder, I find someone who is cute, nice, and DTF. I have no intention of anything more than a one night stand with these guys, I am not looking for anything serious or emotional. I just want some good, fun, stress relieving sex when I need it. I am upfront about this with guys I talk to on Tinder.\n\nRecently I re-downloaded Tinder. I matched with a few guys that I found interesting, but most of those conversations petered out. I found one guy in particular who I matched with, who was cute and pretty charming. I made it known to him that I was just looking for a one time hookup; he was interested. \n\nWe flirted via message for quite a while and made plans to meet up this Saturday. He lives about an hour away, but I was fine to travel for a hookup. We had ramped up flirting this week, and were dirty talking last night. I said something along the lines of 'i bet you have rocked a lot of girls worlds with those moves'. He replied back that he has never actually done ANYTHING sexual with anyone before. I found out that the guy is a complete virgin.\n\nI was upset by this information for a few reasons. I was pretty frustrated that he had not been upfront about something important like this at the start, the same way I was upfront with him about what I was after. I am frustrated because I agreed to travel an hour's driving time to potentially have bad, awkward sex with someone who does not know what they are doing (I'm not interested in sticking around to coach him). I am honestly a little turned off by the way he completely killed the mood, and being a virgin at his age comes off as a bit of a red flag. And finally, I am scared of having to deal with the emotional aspects of taking his virginity. I made it clear this was a one night thing, and I don't won't to get caught up in the aftermath.\n\nI am thinking of just bailing on the whole deal, but I haven't told him yet. We haven't spoken much since he dropped the bombshell. I feel a little bad for wanting to bail, but ultimately I think it might be the right choice. \n\nWIBTA if I bailed?",

Before we became “official” I visited Suzy’s house and stayed the night, our families know each other well so it isn’t a huge deal.  The following day we spent time with her mom, Jan let’s say, and Jan kept referring to me as a boyfriend to everyone we bumped into then apologizing after each encounter.  Sowing a seed I think.  Then, Jan asked me a question referring to Suzy as my girlfriend, and I responded in a way that signified that I’d be happy to have her as my girlfriend. Not fully understanding and fairly irritated at that point of the day. Well, that night it was just the talk of the household and it stuck.  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Not much backstory is needed, but my neighbors just got a really fast toy car thing for only kid. This thing is legit. I don’t know what they’re called, but it is really fast and metal and was probably really expensive. I’m going to be calling it The Cart\n\nAnyways, The kid (let’s call him Billy) loves The Cart and he drives it every day. His parents are always watching him and making sure he’s being safe, but it’s tiring to be super vigilant after the first couple of weeks, so they topped watching him as closely. I understand that. They still look up from whatever they’re doing every 45 seconds or so so whatever. But we live across the street from the elementary school that everyone goes to, so every school morning the street is packed with school parent’s cars because no one wants to use the small parking lot that is under construction. I was walking my kid to school and Billy turns from around a pick up truck and is going full speed at my boy. This was the biggest scare I’ve gotten since my kid almost got ran over but my wife pulled him away. I guess I was having some PTSD but an incredible load of adrenaline shot through me and I grabbed my kid and yanked him by the backpack into the car to my left and I grabbed The Cart as the other kid was riding it and flipped it sideways. Luckily Billy was wearing a helmet because he kept sliding while sideways and his helmet has a few scrapes on it. As soon as I saw that my kid was fine I rushed over to Billy. He is screaming and crying, but perfectly fine. I feel really bad because I didn’t even need to flip his cart because I already pulled my kid away from his path, but it was all so fast I did it without thinking.\n\nAfter everyone was calmed down, the neighbors were asking me what happened because he pick up truck was blocking their view. I told them the whole story. The Cart is ruined, but we didn’t talk about that. They had mixed emotions about my response. On one hand, I saved both kids from colliding and no one got hurt, but on the other hand, I almost severely injured their son in order save mine. It was all instinct though I wasn’t thinking about it. The dad was happy that everyone is ok, but the mom was pissed at me, and for good reason. I would be acting the same way. I was just scared about the fact that I cared so little about the safety of Billy and just flipped his cart.\n\nSo I guess it’s not whether or not I’m the A-hole, but rather a question of whether or not I’m in the right.",

He was rich and full of himself and he had kind of gotten into talking about his job, which was not the job of someone who cares of other people. He literally said his job is to ruin other people's jobs (I don't want to go into specifics so I don't reveal who anyone is, but he is absolutely right). He was trying to pay for everything for me and admitted he likes having power over people by being kind of rich. We hung out, he gave me some coke (he doesn't do drugs and his friends from out of town gave it to him) and we did it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfterwards we talked about making plans to meet up again, and I was cool with it. *Then* we went out to dinner. When we went out, he kind of treated all of the staff really shitty and got into a little fight with the people at this burger joint for making our food to-go instead of for-here. That's a huge deal for me and I kind of wanted to walk out then, but I didn't. I realized right then I didn't want to see him again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFifteen minutes after dinner, he takes me back to my car (we met at a coffee shop first) and keeps pointing out how he just paid for everything and said something like \"I treated you like a hot girl\". I don't know how much of that was like a power move. So now I have promised to meet this guy, but haven't set up any time. I almost want to meet up at a park or something and not do anything (I'm broke and unemployed) and never see him again to keep my word, but feel like that's equally fucked up",

      "description": "To preface I would like to say that I am 22 he is 27, we were on and off for about a year and a half, and we never used protection. \n\nWhen I first found out I was pregnant, my daughters father (let’s just call him Carlos) was insisting I get an abortion. When I told him that I didn’t want to get an abortion, he got really upset and said I got pregnant on purpose to try and trap him because I knew he was going out of the country (he’s in the Army), I just wanted his money and how I should prepare to be a single mother, be on section 8, welfare, food stamps etc. then proceeded to threaten me. Carlos told me he did not want his mom to know about the baby then blocked me from both of their social media profiles.\n\nWhile Carlos was getting ready to leave the country, he was staying with his mom in a different state. Then, he tells me the Army changed his orders and he’s now going to be stationed in a state off the mainland and living there permanently. At this point, we were still arguing sometimes, but not as often as before. Carlos also tells me he still hasn’t told his mom and still wasn’t planning on doing so. \n\nHe tells me he wants to know when I go into labor, when I’m at the hospital, and when the baby is born and if everything’s fine. I agree and do that. For the first few weeks after our daughter was born, we were getting along great and weren’t arguing at all. \n\nA couple months go by, Carlos and I are still getting along so I make the suggestion that he should meet his daughter. He seems to be open to me flying with our daughter to stay with him for about a week. We start to make plans for us to go in the summer, but he wouldn’t be able to pay for anything because he just moved into an apartment/condo and his rent is an insane amount and he barely has any money. I tell him I would be willing to pay for the ticket to go out there and at first he says no, but then comes around to the idea. After this, it seems to me he started trying to find any and every reason to start an argument. I finally say that I’ve had enough and tell him I’m done and I’m not going to come out there and I’m not going to send him anymore pictures of our daughter until he can apologize to me for the way he’s been treating me.\n\n I blocked him on every other social media and I filed for child support. Carlos is now telling some of his friends that I am crazy, I’m keeping his daughter away from him and he doesn’t fully believe that she’s his daughter. He still hasn’t told his mom as far as I know, so I tried reaching out to her twice, both times I didn’t hear anything back from her. \n\nMy daughter is now 6 months old and next week I have to take her out to do a paternity test. I have been feeling like a real dick for filing for child support after saying I wouldn’t in the beginning of my pregnancy. I gave him over a year to come around and today I’ve been feeling like I did this all too soon. \nSorry it’s so long. ",

I know her finances are none of my business, but hearing \"We can't affoord\" this  is irksome, I love Koda and am more than happy to help, I just also don't wanna be a huge asshole for bothering about something that  \"might\" be none of my business?",

      "description": "My partner and I recently decided that the idea of a big, expensive (75ish people, $30,000) wedding we had discussed did not feel right. We are not discussing having a much smaller wedding at a local outdoor attraction, which offers permits for weddings of 25 people or less. \n\nI ran the idea behind my mom, and we began to discuss the guest list. When I told her I only wanted to invite immediate family (my parents, my single living grandparent, and my only sibling) she became really upset. She couldn’t understand why I would want to invite my friends, who may not be in my life forever, and said I should invite my extended family (mostly her brother, which would involve inviting six people total).\n\nI have nothing against her brother, we just aren’t close and he doesn’t know my partner well. I would be surprised if he could name five things he knew about my relationship. \n\nI want my wedding to be only people who know one (preferably both) of us really well and are an important source of love and support in our lives and relationship. My uncle is not, and my friends are. \n\nI know my mom is really close with her brother and he has helped her through a difficult last year. She was recently sick and he took time off work and flew down to take care of her on a pretty regular basis. \n\nHowever, I don’t feel like my wedding is where that needs to be recognized/appreciated. My wedding is an important step in my relationship with my partner, and it’s not about the rest of my family. I also don’t want my wedding to feel like a performance, and I’m worried that due to my low self esteem, having people I don’t know very well will make me feel like I’m putting on a show the whole time. I’m worried if I give in to my mom I will end up resenting her for stopping me from having my “dream wedding.”\n\nSo am I the asshole here? Should I skip inviting my friends to invite my extended family? Should I give up on the idea of having a small wedding and let my mom pay for a larger event? ",

      "description": "I was meeting a couple of my girl friends for lunch at 1230 and planned to chill a bit at home after. I was going to a huge family dinner later which always starts at 6/630. \n\nMy sister was informed of the dinner plan, the lunch plan and the stay over plan at least a couple of days before.\n\nFast forward, my friends were in the flat. Note that these were all girls and have met my sister a thousand times. It was 5ish, I went to her room to tell her that my friends were leaving soon, so were we. I found out that she was far from getting ready. I was a bit pissed because it usually takes her at least a good 45mins to get ready and another 45mins to get to the dinner place. I was sure that she would be late. The way she dealt with it was to ask me to go first so that I wouldn’t keep chasing behind her back. I did and I arrived on time. She ended up arriving at 715. \n\nWhen we revisited the issue that she was late later that night, she then revealed that she couldn’t get ready because there were strangers in the house. But all she needed to do was taking a shower. The walk between the toilet and her room was just 1s apart. She could do everything else in her room. It was not a big flat but my friends and I were just chatting in the living room. The toilet and her room located along the corridor which could hardly be seen from the living room. I couldn’t understand why having other female non family members would make the 1s walk so difficult. There is also another toilet further down the hallway, so occupancy shouldn’t be the issue. I think her thinking was really weird. I couldn’t get it. I understand that having strangers in the house could be uncomfortable. But I don’t think it could go thiiiiis comfortable that you would be an hour late to a 30 people dinner. \n\nTLDR: Sister was an hour late to a family dinner because she couldn’t get ready when my girl friends were in the house.

      "title": "AITA for getting out of the startup I created with friends?",
      "description": "This happened about two years ago. \n\n\nMy college professor had an idea for a startup and recruited me and two friends (Friend A and friend B) to get the idea going. We submitted it to an startup incubator program of 1 year duration and we got accepted, so we started working pretty serious in this project. I've had just got out off college, so I decided to commit full time to this project.\n\nIt's worth to take note that there was no contracts signed by any of the parties. We were just a bunch of friend that counted with each other's and willing to make something work.\n\nAt that point, my professor talks to everyone that it's important for us to stick together and don't abandon the project because that was the only way the project would work out. He emphasizes this to me, since I already had abandoned a startup before that I started with friend A and friend B.\n\nTen months passes by and three things happen:\n\n1 - I became the key member of the startup, as I was the one most thecnicaly capacitated member able to build a prototype and had the most \"spare\" time to do it.\n2 - I start distrusting the viability of the project\n3 - I noticed that I was working on something I was not passionate about\n\nSo after some back and forth toughts about leaving the startup afraid of the reaction of my colleagues, I finally muster the courage to do it. And as expected, the reaction wasn't that great.\n\nMy professor and friend A called me an asshole for doing it. Friend B was kinda ok with it, since we actually had talked about that between us and he was thinking in leaving the team too.\n\nSince friend A and my professor was so upset with me, I offer to work for them for free part time for 2 months(which was the remaining time for the incubation program to finish) so I can help them build a prototype for the project and help train and find someone to replace me. I also say I'm giving up all my shares of the startup and I would take zero money of future income they would make with the prototype I was helping to make.\n\nThey're still not happy with it, but I had made my mind and there was no way I would keep working on something that was making miserable for what it would look for the rest of my life. So after some time of them trying to reason with me for me staying on the group, they finally take the deal and I compromise to work for them for those two awful and awkward next months.\n\nAnd so I did.\n\nDuring that time I also believe my professor kinda of abused of my offer and pushed some extra work for me that was not planned for the prototype. He also called me on for delaying a deliver during a week while I was really busy taking care of my girlfriend who we found out had a tumor on her knee and pretty much couldn't walk. Still I delivered what I promised latter.\n\nFriend A and friend B were actually pretty cool to me during those months and kinda acted as if nothing had happened. I can say friend A was upset with me, though(which was pretty understanble).\n\nAfter those two months I finally was free for that slave-kinda period that sucked so much and finally could spent my time on my new projects.\n\nA few months latter I hear from friend B that they ended the startup. Which was not a surprise for me actually.\n\n\n Tl Dr:\n\nSo... AITA for abandoning a startup with my friends after I compromised with them, even though I offered working for them for free for a while and giving up any future income?\n\n\n",

This is sort of the last battle in a long running battle between my sister and I which started when we were still small. I don't like her, I try to love her as a sister but don't often succeed. Because of that relationship she is accusing me of being an asshole and trying to \"get to her\" by using my niece of being a proxy. \n\nI started suffering from an eating disorder when I was 15. I was both anorexic and bulimic. I had inpatient treatment, anti-depressants, therapy, hypnosis, you name it and nothing helped. When I was 18 (I'm 23 now) I discovered a new realm of treatment (also could be called a philosophy) called Intuitive Eating. It basically tells you to eat when you are hungry, food is food and there is never such thing as a \"good\" or \"bad\" food. For some reason this philosophy sunk in with me and I finally, finally started recovery. \n\nI had suspected my niece was suffering from a similar disorder for several years but this was confirmed by my mother. I emailed my niece several articles and blogs regarding Intuitive Eating. I also ordered her several books from amazon about Intuitive Eating and Body Respect by the most respected authors and scholar in the field. \n\nMy sister came unglued and accused me of setting back my nieces treatment by years. I tried to have a rational discussion with her regarding how it helped me and she said that my niece is a minor and I need to keep my \"pseudo scientific bullshit\" away from her kids as well as some other choice words. \n\nI swear to god I was trying to help, the books I sent were written by Phds and it's an area where I have experience.

      "description": "So I (19F) just got into an argument with my mum (47), and long story short it all started from when I made a comment about how her and my father can barely speak English, despite having lived here for 20 years. \n\nWhat started off as something I said in passing blew up into something which led to an explosive argument and lead to me storming off to my room. You see here’s the thing, she was complaining about how it’s so easy for people who live in England and speak English to get their way and sort out their problems. I then said maybe if she had actually put in the effort to learn the language and the customs of the country she lived in, she could effectively sort out her problems too.\n\nHere’s what she said, that there’s no need to ‘waste’ her time to become more educated or learn the language of a country she doesn’t see her self staying in for long. She also proceeded to talk about how she is a mother and doesn’t have time to invest in learning the language. \n\nRight. Okay. That doesn’t make any sense. \n\nShe then said she doesn’t want to become educated, or learn about other cultures or customs and just wants to focus on religion because she’s an old woman.\n\nI then remembered something she used to preach about all the time when I was a kid, about how the prophet once said that people must be knowledgable and educated in the lands they live in and in general. \n\nSuddenly she shouts at me, calls me and animal lmao and says my arguments are ‘invalid’ and I need to fix up? \n\nI just walked out, my last words being,  ‘you know they say being unreasonable comes with old age.’ \n\nAITA for trying to encourage my mum to educate her self and getting annoyed at her unwillingness to do so? \n\nI’m not crazy right?

      "description": "AITA for not suggesting to pay rent?\n\nSo for the past couple of months I've been living with my aunt rent free. I stayed there through the last semester of school and a couple of months of unemployment. I recently found a well paying job and I am looking forward to saving money so I can one day buy my own apartment. \n\nMy aunt is by no means well off, she has a low paying job but manages to live comfortably. She is extremely frugal and good with her money, and do to financial finesse and getting lucky with the market she owns a great apartment almost debt free. \n\nWhen I got my new job I realized I was being paid a considerable amount more than my aunt. This made me extremely guilty about not paying rent. It would be great to be able to stay there rent free for some time so I can save up for an apartment... but still, it feels kinda assholey.\n\nHowever, my aunt has never asked me to pay rent, never implied that I should or that she'd like me to. Most likely she'll never ask me.\n\nAm I the asshole for not taking the inicitive and asking her if she'd want me to pay rent?",

My friend is a martial artist (krav maga, taekwondo, boxing and formerly judo), and while I took a year of karate at high school, I've never been into a real fight, because I'm usually pretty good at avoiding fights and calming aggressive people down. She on the other hand is pretty hotheaded and fearless.\n\nAnyways, we were at a party and when we went outside to smoke we got approached by three aggressive douches who asked us if we could \"lend\" them some money to pay the entrance fee. Before I could say anything my friend told them to go fuck themselves. This didn't really help in that situation and eventually I got hit in the face. My friend immediately jumped at them and took two down before they could do much (I hope the second guy's balls are ok lol). Since I wouldn't know how to fight I didn't get involved with the third and just kicked the first down when he tried to get up so at least he'd stay out. In the end we got out ok, but she got a bloody nose from the fight. I still feel kind of douchey for not trying to help her. AITA?",

I kind of figured that they would get easier as I get older but honestly they just get worse and more upsetting. My parents are in this miserable relationship where my dad has been cheated on over and over but is too afraid to leave, my mom is a horrible manipulative unpleasant person, my dad is a huge racist and can't go ten minutes without saying something about black people or muslims, my siblings are just as bad. I just don't agree with anything they say, they are really judgemental about my life while totally miserable in their own lives, and they constantly make jokes at my expense. I'm sick of going to family functions just to feel depressed and lonely. I don't know how to talk about this stuff to my family because it's fundamentally a part of their personalities and how they have always interacted with me. So I decided not to go to thanksgiving this year, just hang out where I live a few hours away alone, and i got called an asshole for it.

He’s blaming it on his high protein regiment.  I’ve never heard of protein causing such a thing, but he knows more about that stuff than I do so idk.  Cover up isn’t really an option even if I could convince them because they’re so big. They honestly look like little cysts.  I’ve tried convincing him to go to a dermatologist, but he just refuses to do anything to fix the problem.  I know it seems shallow, but they’re so big it really is making me unattracted to him physically.  I care more about him than just his looks though so I’m riding it out and hoping that it’ll clear up or he will finally go and see someone about it.  Until then though it’s awkward going out places with him.   I feel like everyone is looking at us.  I feel awful for having these thoughts, but I really can’t stress enough how big these things are.  I don’t want to shame him over his appearance, but at the same time physical attraction is an important part of any relationship and I feel like he should at least go see someone about them.  For now though I’ve just been making excuses to stay in with him or to go to more private places when we do go out.  ",

There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?",

It was a major event that has devastated the city.\n\nI have tenants in both properties and both properties we flooded with what they are calling black water, which is basically sewerage. The rear tenants have been fantastic, the front tenants have given me problems for a while. \n\nWhen the properties flooded I put my life on hold and drove the 5 hours to try and fix the properties as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen I arrived I found the rear house in much better condition as the tenant had placed sandbags and stacked their furniture, whereas the front tenants had done nothing (there was several days of warning). On top of this there was clear signs of long term neglect on the property, which the tenant has been warned of previously. \n\nI spent a week scrubbing and power washing the properties. During this week I grew concerned about the state of the front unit. I decided for health and safety reasons that the place was not livable. One reason is that the front tenants have decided not to throw away a lot of furniture that I know was contaminated with sewerage. Unfortunately I'm not ensured for this event and my only option is to move down and fix the property over a couple of months.\n\nNow the tenant is fighting me as they do not want to leave, but I'm extremely concerned that leaving them there will result in heavy damage to my property and their health.\n\nI am very sympathetic to their cause as I know their business was also affected and it's challenging finding accommodation at the moment due to the floods.

      "description": "So To preface this, going to cut some of the details due to political leanings and crap to not influence you fine people.  \n  \n\nFor reference, this happened yesterday. \n  \n  \n\nI have a friend, let’s call him. R. R. Made a extremely disrespectful comment on a post my fiancé shared on Facebook. I texted him privately saying he needs to apologize for being disrespectful. He is fully claiming he wasn’t, he’s just voicing his opinion. I kept bringing up how he can have a discussion but telling someone “ get over your feelings “ while trying to start the discussion is extremely disrespectful. He refuses to see that it was, and kept trying to shift the discussion to talk about said political issue. I eventually layed down the line telling him he has to either apologize to my fiancé, or else him and I are done as friends. Since then, I’ve heard nothing from him.\n  \nNow that the day has passed and I’ve calmed down and thought it over, I feel as if an apology would not be good enough and I’m just feeling done in general about him.  \n  \nHowever, I’m having very mixed feelings. He’s one of my only 3 friends on this world, including my fiancé. I’ve known him longer than my fiancé, and if I ditch out on him it’ll just reinforce more of his views.  \n \nWIBTA if dispite all this I still just tell him ‘I’m done’ with his bullshit?",

      "description": "Yes, this is a throwaway account. Also this is loooong.\n\nSo. I had an online friend for about 1.5 years, we were quite close in that we talked very frequently, nearly everyday. We talked mostly about mutual hobbies but also some serious stuff: she was struggling with depression and I offered her support by sharing my own experiences and strongly encouraging she seek professional help which she says she did. Because of her struggles and because she often expressed her difficulties with having \"high empathy\" and other people's problems upsetting her too much I  kept my more serious problems to myself and only talked about issues after they were resolved. The biggest ongoing problem I ever came to her about was venting about roommates. I also shared with her that I was the opposite of her, I have rather \"low empathy\" so it was fine for her to vent to me about anything. And it was fine. I had my annoyances (any argument/disagreement ever, even silly philosophical discussions, she would become upset and I would have to ask if she would like to drop the topic and she would say yes... but not without getting in the last word, which nbd but admittedly it had started to bother me) but it was largely fine.\n\nI was promoted at work at around the same time she began coming to me about a guy she had known years ago reconnecting with her and how they had been \"talking\", but then he ghosted after finding out his cancer was back and could have been serious. I told her I was sorry, told her about a friend of mine who had cancer who had gone through the exact same situation, and it probably wasn't personal, he just needed some time and to hear results etc. She continued to complain, and then said she \"felt like crying, but that crying wouldn't help\" so I responded with that there are actual benefits to crying and that it was okay to feel sad because \"sad things are sad, and there's no reason to be ashamed\" \n\nNow, because of my promotion, which I told her about, I had been working more hours and was mentally fatigued so I wasn't responding as quick as I normally did. She complained that what I said was patronizing and really detached. I apologized because that wasn't how I meant it, explained again why I was tired and didn't realize that it was patronizing. She then said it was okay and that if I was tired/didn't feel like talking to let her know.\n\nSo I told her I needed a break for a bit. Mistake. She blew up at me, insulting me and declaring I was a terrible friend and that she was always there for me even when it \"wore [her] out\" and to go f*ck myself and all the time she wasted talking to me and other very personal low blows. \n\nI got a bit defensive, told her that it was ridiculous and that I only said I needed time to adjust to my new schedule. She went on to complain I wasn't empathic enough that she just wanted the \"smallest scrap of human empathy\" from me to help her deal with this. She went on to accuse me of faking the whole friendship.\n\nI defended myself and pointed out I had previously told her how sorry I was she was dealing with this in a few messages over the past few days, and eventually that she \"was looking for reasons to feel hurt.\"\n\nThe next day she apologized, said she had been drunk and was so sorry but still kind of backhandedly maintained that I was being too \"logical/patronizing\" and not being a good enough friend and I needed to be more understanding of why she lashed out at me. We went back and forth a bit, I tried to stay civil but reacted badly when she criticized my \"robotic\" nature and that she couldn't help that she was \"raw, and real and messy\". I hate that garbage and told her that it was incredibly rude to imply I wasn't \"real\" just because I can handle my emotions. She apologized again \"that wasn't how she meant it\". I tell her I still need some time and space. Especially after all of this. \n\nShe continues to message me. I asked her again for space. She \"just want[s] [me] to understand\" then she goes on to bring up a friend she'd told me about before that she had feelings for and that she has the same \"intense feelings\" for me. I tell her there's nothing other than friendship from me (she already knows I'm happily in a long term relationship as well). I again remind her I want space. She continues to press her side of things and that she just cares about me so much. I gave up and just blocked her.\n\nShe sent a long apology message to me from another account that I did not know about. I ignored it. Stopped logging on to my account because I felt so angry and I guess violated, but it's not like I was afraid she would do something in rl. (We live in different countries) \n\nMonths go by. I'm not as angry about it any more, I log back in and see she's sent a few more messages. Mostly apologies and how much she misses me and regrets what she did, like being so negative. It came across almost sycophantic to me with how much she praised me for being a good friend and that she ruined it, but some of the stuff was just so wrong (I obviously didn't stop talking to her because she was \"too negative\") that I clarified my reason for blocking. I felt like she should know that it was my boundaries being pushed. And in the last few months I realized I kinda missed talking to her (though in retrospect it may have been I missed talking with someone about mutual hobbies and not actually her). She made it clear she really wanted to be friends again so I decided to try, though I warned her it might take time to be as friendly again. Also remind her there's never going to be anything more than friendship. She understands and promises she'll respect my boundaries. It goes fine for a few days but the website we've been using to communicate is Tumblr and with the bans happening she's afraid we won't be able to stay in contact. She gave other contact info, I responded kinda vaguely and just said hopefully it won't come to that. She pushes it. I brush it off again, and then she asked directly and I told her I wasn't comfortable giving her more ways to contact me right now.\n\nShe grew upset, said that made her feel like a stalker. That she thinks the reason I contacted her again was probably because I was still mad and trying to hurt her. She asked if there was even a point continuing to talk.\n\nI've already had enough of the drama and I guess I hadn't even realized how disconnected to her I felt. I just didn't even care that I hurt her because it seems so easy to do, I didn't feel hurt like the first fight, just exasperated so I told her no, probably not after this. I said, more or less, she still wasn't respecting my boundaries and if she can't handle that I don't completely trust her yet after what happened that it's unfortunate but I'm not going keep arguing and fighting to prove I am/want to be her friend. I wished her all the best, but this wasn't going to work.\n\nShe chewed me out, said I wasn't even trying to understand her feelings, that she was just being honest and trying to express herself and then blocked me right after.\n\nAm I the asshole?  Should I have done more to understand her side? Was I unreasonable for not wanting to give additional contact info?",

      "description": "I'll start by saying I'm atheist. My friend is very Christian, but used to be atheist herself. Recently, she has been talking about pretty much only her religion and even told me she has for awhile now been 'witnessing me'. She has been worried that I'll go to hell because I've 'rejected God'. I asked her \"Haven't you also rejected God?\" And she said \"Yes but I repented.\" I know she cares for me and is worried for me, but it kind of makes me upset that she not only thinks that, but that she told me about it. Especially since she knows talking about religion makes me uncomfortable, and even though she says she wants them, I feel like I cannot truly express my opinions as an atheist without very much offending her. I honestly think religion is complete BS and a bit cult like. Am I the asshole for feeling offended here?",

      "description": "My husband, our toddler and I are house sitting for my parents while they are away for a few years. I always had a not so great relationship with my mother but I thought it would be better after having a kid. My parents are visiting for a few days and I am trying to improve my positive communication skills but I guess it's a failure.\n\nI asked my mother to watch our kid while we did something outside. I was hoping they would play together even though I feel like she is not interested in her unless there are people around. We came back home to our child in front of the TV and to my mother cleaning an already cleaned house. She was saying that her new appliance is not working well and that she'll bring it back to get refunded. I say she could also exchange it and she starts to shout she wants her money back. Ok. I went to the kitchen to prepare a cake for my birthday, she enters and it goes like this :\n\nM(other) :\"Didn't you say you'll prepare leek ?\"     \nMe: \"Yes...I'll do it later\"    \nM: \"Why are you so aggressive to me, you don't need to talk to me that way\"     \nMe: \"I won't talk nice to you if you are not nice to me, you were shouting at me few seconds ago\"    \nM: \"I wasn't shouting at you...you don't need to talk to me that way.\" After a few minutes she gives up on the appliance situation.    \nM: \"I'll remove the rug in front of the couch, summer is coming, they are disgusting anyway so enough\"    \nMe: \"We will remove it later, it's still a bit cold.    \nM: \"I am the one deciding, it's still my house\"     \nMe: \"I am just asking you to leave the rug for now, it's safer for our toddler.\" I was screaming at her because I lost it. She is leaving on Monday for at least a year, we are the ones living here. My husband had to quit his job and we moved between countries to not leave their house empty (meanwhile our flat is empty and we had some project there). My parents pressured me almost everyday to come \"home\" but I feel like we are guests in a stranger house. \n\nM: \"I don't understand why you behave like this. Why are you always screaming at me ? You cany talk nicely to me, it's always ending like this, we will never have a normal relationship anyway because you are so aggressive.\" And she goes on for five minutes. We had an argument earlier because I asked if they could tell me beforehand when someone is coming or when they decide to take an appointment for me...not a few minutes before it's happening. According to her I was mean for telling her how I feel so I just say I'll stop talking.\n\nIt always ends up with her telling me that I am aggressive, mean or even that I'm only nice to her when I want something, which I think is false because I'm never asking anything to anyone. In fact if I ask her for advices, she's answering in a condescending way so I just don't ask her anything. \n\nAnyway, am I the asshole for telling how I feel or is my mother overacting?",

      "title": "AITA for arguing with my dad about a storm?",
      "description": "Alright, so a little bit of backstory here.\n\nI am horrified of loud noises. I think it began with a fear of fireworks which escalated into a fear of balloons (even unfortunately yelled at my uncle because he was rubbing a balloon in my ear), gunshots, even loud talking, and now recently, thunder and lightning. I am terrified of these noises or anything associated with them (i.e. I can't be in the same room as a birthday party that has balloons or (recently) a rainy day for fear of thunder and lightning).\n\nA year ago, I had a traumatic moment when a lightning bolt struck our neighbour's tree and split it. I saw red, white, and blue flashes that actually hurt my eyeballs. The sound of the thunder clap after the strike made me drop everything I had, clutch my ears and scream like a banshee. I was horrified and in tears with my heart pounding in my chest. I was trembling, my brother called my phone to see if I was alright, stuff like that. I've been afraid of rainy days and dark clouds ever since.\n\nBack to the present. So I'm at my dad's house and he has to go to work, which means that I can go to my grandma's house. Grandma's house is about 500 feet down the street, about a two minute walk. Being in the South, we have a lot of rain problems. I get anxious when I see dark clouds or when it starts to rain because I'm scared of thunder. My dad wants me to take my umbrella since I was carrying a lot of stuff. But after hearing a clap of thunder, I try to say no and that I was afraid of the storm.\n\nHe brushes it off and I try to explain that I'm scared of my umbrella catching a lightning bolt, as well as the sound of thunder. He again brushes it off and says that my umbrella is plastic (certainly doesn't feel like it). I argue with him for a bit about the supposed myth that holding an umbrella during a storm is sure to attract lightning (I believed it).  \nSo I'm sitting here looking at the storm and borderline about to scream because I'm having very bad flashbacks about that lightning strike. My dad lectures to me that I'll be fine and that umbrellas don't attract lightning, that I'll have the same chance of being struck with or without an umbrella, and that I should stop \"acting like a baby.\"\n\nI explain to him about the lightning strike I heard and (personally I believe) that I developed a kind of PTSD from it (or some kind of trauma). Dad tells me that \"PTSD is only for military or army stuff\" and I'm sitting here about to honestly bawl my eyes out because of the thunder. Either way, I take the umbrella and go outside, but then I start hearing loud beats from someone's car and interpret it as thunder booms. I start to RUN down the street, terrified of the sound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for arguing with him and refusing to leave the house?",

      "description": "So I (16F) have been with my girlfriend (17F) for about three months now. Like a lot of girls our age, she has a spam account where she basically posts whatever she wants - like things she wouldn’t want a future employer seeing if they searched her name. Obviously this is private, and only people that she trusts can see it. \n\nI don’t have an issue with this; I have one too after all. However, a month or so before we officially got together, she used to post very revealing pictures of herself. There weren’t any nipples revealed due to instagram’s policies but that about the only things hidden. \n\nJust to be clear, we’re in the UK, where the legal age is 16, so we’re all good on that account. \n\nI spoke to her recently about the fact everyone that follows her account can see her nudes and that it makes me a bit uncomfortable. I already feel like she’s out of my league so it does make me feel a little shitty. She just told me that it’s her body on her account, and that’s what makes her feel good. \n\nAITA for feeling uncomfortable that all our friends can see my girlfriend naked if they wanted (and probably have in the past)? Is it unreasonable? ",

      "description": "So atm I’m technically in two schools in a way? During the day after my first period only on B days I get on a bus and leave my regular school to go to another. So I get on the bus after my class and some dude is sitting where I normally sit, that’s cool, I had joked with him before so I walked up and said jokingly “Riiisee” and he looked up at me with a somewhat angry expression and said “fuck you”. I was like okay maybe he’s just a little sour today and I suppose I suck for joking around like that.\n\nSo I sit down like one seat in front of him to his right. I’m chilling listening to music and not paying him mind. Suddenly I see him grab his book bag and just place it in my seat without even asking me. It’s a public bus so l have no claim to the seat or anything but is it really okay to put your shit in another persons space? I look at him confused and I say no. He says nothing and just smiles, so i put his things on another seat across from me.  And heres where he starts to get upset and keeps trying to put it back on my seat over and over again but I keep moving it. And I look at the window at the seat he’s in and it’s literally only SLIGHTLY drizzling through his window and some of it is hitting his bag. \n\nAfter my repeated refusals he says, “Man why are you being a little bitch” and at that point I was sick of his shit and went off at him and told him, “No you’re being a little bitch because you can’t handle a little fucking drizzle on your book bag. It’s not the end of the world if your book bag gets slightly wet quit being a bitch.” After which his face frowned yet he said nothing else  and then he just moved himself away and put his book bag back where he was originally sitting. \n\nI don’t feel bad for it, but AITA?",

      "description": "We had several polite conversations. His habits would change for a few days. Then go back to me taking care of his small mess. I know I shouldn't care about a few plates. And I didn't care. I was takinh care of a few small plates. But he thought then that it would be ok to leave out pots and pans for a week, two weeks. And then he would act like it was such a small task, why even bring it up, aka why don't  you do them for me.\n\nWhat I'm learning from this not to do a thing for some people even if it's small. Because as soon it will be an inch, it will be a mile.\n\n-He had the audacity to place my breakfast dishes on the my clean ones because I have a very early class. They were left out for hours. Not the weeks he leaves things out.\n\n-Whenever he can tell that I'm pissed, he flat out \"forgets\" that it's his shit and refuses to clean his mess up.\n\nSo I've yelled at him 3 times in the 6 months I've lived here. They were arguments where I'm straight up yelling. He gaslights me and tells me I'm crazy or that I haven't taken my meds because of the way that I'm acting. But how many civil conversations do I need to have? I've lived in many places. It's rare that this has ever been an issue.\n\nTL;DR Am I the asshole for yelling at my roommate because he won't do his dishes?",

She wanted to try an open relationship for a month.  I was one of her firsts and she wanted to explore     She’s also bisexual and never acted on it and wanted to explore that as well. \n\nWhen we had this conversation I was in internal meltdown mode.   I was considering ending the relationship.   I honestly felt that this was the death of our relationship, but just a slower death than usual so maybe I should just end it quickly.  \n\nAfter I had calmed down though I decided to at least try it.  I love my gf and if this is what she needed I can at least try. \n\nSo February came around and it began.  I’m also bisexual so for the first time I downloaded grinder.  A gay dating app.   I’ve never used it before.  Right away I started getting messages.  I really didn’t want to go straight into sex at first so it took a couple days before I found someone who actually wanted to go out on a date.  \n\nIt was like a part of me was revived.  I had forgotten a huge part of myself being with my gf and having that night woke that part of me up.  I started meeting more and more people.  Men and women.   Dating in my early 20s was always so hard for me, but for some reason with these apps it just works.  \n\nGf wasn’t having the same experience.   She went on a couple dates, but didn’t feel a connection to any of them.  She said they made better friends.  \n\nGf asked me today if I just wanted to end the month now and I said no.   I could tell she didn’t like that.  I don’t want to hurt her, but I’m not ready for it to end.    ",

I didn't want her to go without a date and she was clear that she wanted to go with a friend, so I offered to go with her.\n\nThe dance was alright, though we were never really that close of friends, so we only really had a couple of awkward conversations. During the dance I kept on looking for water or finding other friends so that we would have something to do/talk about. All in all, I was willing to do this because it meant she wasn't friendless at HC. \n\nAfter homecoming, things got a bit weird. From time to time she would approach me with really uncomfortably intense conversations, and got really close to me. Around then I was figuring that she liked me, despite the fact that I had essentially friend zoned her when agreeing to go to HC as friends. Asking around, a couple of my friends told me that she did in fact like me.\n\nThings continued to be awkward until her schools Sadie Hawkins dance came around, and she asked me to it AS FRIENDS. \n\nAt this point I was just confused. I thought going with her to HC was a mercy move, because her closer friends all had dates, but now she was asking so early that she could have chosen anyone else that was a closer friend. Obviously she was asking me as a date, which makes me wonder why she emphasized going as friends.\n\nI lied and said I was busy that day, but then the polar vortex led to that dance being rescheduled, so she asked again. I knew I couldn't lie again, so I told her the truth, that I felt uncomfortable going to the dance with her. \n\nThings went back to the way they were, but she was still being uncomfortably intense, so I began avoiding her, since my words were clearly not working. Whenever she would approach me, I would keep our conversations polite and brief, then I would leave soon after.\n\nAITA for doing this? I'm just really tired of dealing with her and I don't want to lead her on. My hope is that she will lose interest in me and move on to someone else, but I'm also afraid that I might kinda be the A-hole for avoiding her. Help!",

      "description": "I wanna talk about this. But the last time I went to reddit to vent, it back fired so bad. I feel like I can’t ever post anything online bc she’ll always see it or recognize the story. \n\nThe last few weeks, she’s been going through a rough patch. I always try to stay by her side and not be hurt when she doesn’t reply to my texts/calls. But recently she’s just given up. She’s put a lot of pressure on me, saying that she’s only happy with me. That I make her so happy and that she wouldn’t be alive without me. She means that. She wouldn’t be alive to this day if I wasn’t by her side. I do a lot for her, I’ve given up parts of me to be there for her. Now I admit that I’m the one who tends to be closed off, but whenever I try to talk about what’s bothering me she’s at work, or doesn’t see my text, or just straight up ignores the text. For example, one day I tweeted something about having a bad day. I get a text from her asking what’s wrong and i replied with 3 things.. she didn’t even respond til hours later after I sent another text asking her something. Straight up blew me off which only made my day worse. \nThen a few weeks ago she was taking care of my hamster but I left my hamster in my apt while I was on a trip bc my friend said she’ll watch her until she could drop him off with another friend of mine. All she had to was put him in his little kennel thing and put his cage in the car as is bc I ran out of litter and my friend who was watching him was gonna change it for me. But instead, My best friend dumped out his entire cage FULL of litter onto one of his play boxes and left it there for 2 weeks until I got back. WHO DOES THAT?! WHY?! \nI came back to my room smelling like a fucking horse farm and little bugs and ants everywhere. I couldn’t even sleep in my room I was so disgusted. I slept on the couch for 2 days bc I was pissed she did that. I’ve cleaned up after her dog AND cat a million times. She’ll call me from work begging me to go over to her place and change the cats litter box bc she forgot. Or to go clean up after the dog bc he had an accident and “you know I can’t handle it after work. Can u please just go over and clean it up for me? I’m so stressed out.” And as much as I hate it some days , i still do it thoroughly. Bc I know she has OCD, so she has her standards with things and I do it the way she asks me to. But really?! She couldn’t have taken 5 minutes to dump the litter in a trash bag?! And i never brought it up to her bc her life shit kept piling up on her and like I stated, she would just ignore anything I brought up that didn’t relate to her. \nI remember one day she texted me while she was drunk, and asked if I could tell she was. And I replied with “yes bc ur actually acknowledging my texts AND replying.” She “ouch that hurt lol” ........ hmm truth hurts sometimes \n\nWell now it’s today, and she was supposed to check on my hamster the past 2 days while I was busy. I never received a text back yesterday about him. I ask my roommates to check on him, and they say that they’ve been watching him and feeding him bc they assumed my friend was coming but she never showed up. Yet she told me she saw him and was fine. I understand she’s going through stuff right now, but if anything there is an animal that needs care and she is ignoring him. No matter what I was doing or how I was feeling, I got up and checked on her pets. \n\nokay sorry the format is weird, I’m on mobile and I’m just really flustered and let these (and some other) smalls things pile up again and just needed to vent it out. thanks for reading :-) ",

      "description": "Some back story, I live in a small college town in “student living” apartments. The other week night I was peacefully sleeping the night before a test when I was woken up at about 2am to the sound of a movie playing ridiculously loud and the neighbors screaming along to it. It was loud enough that I could figure out exactly what movie it was. I got out of bed and walked over to their house to knock on the door and politely ask them to turn it down a bit and maybe not sing along. No answer. You could also hear the movie in the hallway loud and clear. I go back to my house and try to go back to sleep, they had stopped screaming but i could still hear the movie. \n\nAbout 30-45 minutes go by and they start screaming again to another song. I get up go to their door again, no answer. At this point I had been up for over an hour and gone out into the COLD to try and resolve this myself so I call the non-emergency line to report a noise complaint. The cops go by their house and the tv immediately goes off for a short period of time. After the cops left neighbors decide to start banging on the shared wall knocking down several of my things and scaring my dog then turn the tv back on. AITA for calling the cops even though I went by their house multiple times?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I, we've been dating for a little over 5 months but we're childhood friends so we've known each other for almost 11 years and have been through a lot together. She's away visiting family right now and was feeling pretty miserable and I've tried to be optimistic telling her it'll be fine she'll be back soon, and it was okay at first. But, the past few weeks she's been getting colder and colder not really ignoring me but clearly not caring about our conversations, she often just responds with \"mhm\" or \"okay\" and I don't really blame her for that I know I'm not always interesting to talk to. When I ask her how she's doing she just says meh or that it's not going good and I ask what's wrong but she just tells me to drop it and she doesn't want to talk about it. Last night I apologized because I couldn't think of something to talk about and she said \"just leave the conversation if you don't want to talk. Don't apologize and try to make me feel bad\" and that kinda hurt that she would think that's what I would want, she struggles with depression and has mood swings but not like this, she's getting distant and isn't showing any affection anymore. Am I the asshole for not being supportive enough please tell me I'm okay with being in the wrong, I just want her to be happy\n\nEdit: I'm adding this even though there's no way it'll be read again just to say this relationship has ended it was rough the first few days and it's still hard on me but I have friends that have really helped try and keep going with my life.

      "description": "So I have worked for this company for 3 years. It deals with property management and I work for a fairly large company. My office however is very tiny. Just 3 people total that work in the office (2 full time 1 part time). Part time covers all weekends (every Saturday and occasional Sunday depending on occupancy) except if scheduled in advance and agreed to by me as I will be the one covering/working extra. \n\nAs it is a small office we will make deals covering for each other so we don’t have to waste our sick/vacation time. Ex. Leave at 3 to go to dr and let coworker leave at 3 the next day as a trade. I did this for two days for a trip to WA a few months ago but nobody had to cover me (as someone was already going to be there) and I worked two extra days *before* going to compensate. I’m extremely reliable and never take vacations or call in sick. \n\nPart time had a school thing in another country for the week of spring break. This is all fine and dandy. I am told I will be given time off when she gets back in order to cover it. Sundays shouldn’t be an issue because our trend is high. Well. Both weekends I had to work Sunday due to occupancy. So I have worked 23/24 days straight. I’m exhausted and I’m also a mother AND a student. When I was told I’d be given time off it was made to sound like I’d get like a 4 day weekend at least. Part time is back this week and boss tells me to pick which day I’m either coming in late or leaving early to compensate myself. I’m dumb founded. 3 hours late or leave 3 hours early one day is all I get for this? This is bullshit. I worked an additional 22 hours on top of the 48 per week I’m already there for two weeks. My anniversary was Sunday and because of the occ I had to miss it. \n\nNobody had to work extra time when I was gone and I’m not being given the compensation I believe is fair AITA For Being pissed off?

I was fine with him kissing me, when he started putting his hand down my pants.

I offer him money then and there and he refuses and says not to worry about it \"I needed a new one anyway\". well about three weeks ago he messages me and asks me for 50$ for his new grill out of the blue (im in college and definitely am tight on money).\n\nam i the asshole for not wanting to pay this? he told me to worry about it. and didnt mention it the whole 13 hour ride back. not to mention the whole 2 months that have passed since the trip. Im not particularly close with this guy and have no problem saying no.",

      "description": "I'm in a serious relationship with this girl, she's my best friend and THE person for me, and speaking overall, everything is great between us. However, she is a devout Christian, and I never have been. When we got together, everything was set to go except for one thing, she needed me to go to church with her. I agreed of course and have been going for a few months now, but each time I go, the most desperate I become.\n\nI have never been a religious type of person, but I have never actively rejected it either. I figured I would quickly become religious or faithful, but I haven't. It appears as though I am drifting even farther from religion as time goes on, I just don't see any logic in it. I TRY to believe it, I TRY to have faith, but I can't feel it. I don't see how people believe in it, I can't connect with it. None of it makes sense to me, none of it fits. I don't know what to do, and I hate it.\n\nChurch is miserable for me, she's Pentecostal so they get pretty into the preaching, and I feel like an awful person for not agreeing with what's being said. I'm constantly stressed out in service, it's pretty clear that I'm unhappy at times during church, and I think she can see it. I worry I'm going to upset her or offend her, and I don't want to do that. I do try to sympathize with the Bible, but it makes no sense to me. I feel no draw to the faith. I would do anything for this girl, that's why it tears me up to not be able to become a Christian in any sense, it feels impossible.\n\nI feel like I'm in the wrong somehow here, this all makes me feel awful. I feel like it's my fault for not believing. Am I betraying her trust by not being \"holy\"? Am I in the wrong here?\n\n(I'm in no way blaming this on her either, it's not her fault I'm unable to become a believer.)",

      "description": "oh boy this is one hell of a story, but it's not terribly long.\n\nwell, I'm kind of the weird person that dates people online before meeting them. so I'm dating this girl, right? and we have been calling / facetiming each other and texting for a while now. about 3 months. so one day I told her \"goodnight, sleep well! text me when you wake up\" and she said \"goodnight, you too!\" and then in a desperate message she said something along the lines of \"almost told you I love you ahah\" I took this as kind of a hint that she wanted me to say it. so I kept that in mind. well, our conversation carried on despite us already saying goodnight and it being 3 AM. we were talking and getting really flirty with each other, like we do. but she told me something that she's been hiding from me- and rightfully so. apparently... she was married already. but she told me not to worry, and that they never talk any more and that her parents wanted it and that she didn't actually love the boy and all. it being 3 AM, I justified this. I brushed it off. at the end of the night, before we both went to bed, I told her I loved her- and I did. it wasn't a lie. but morning the next day I realized what she said. she's married. not dating someone else, literally married to another person. we were dating over the internet (with plans to meet btw)- how am I supposed to know she never talked to the guy. how can I trust her to be faithful to me if she couldn't to this guy- she said she dated him for four years before marrying him, and then she left him. how do I know she won't do that to me? I told her what I was feeling, and that I don't think I want to pursue a relationship and that we should part ways, and never talked to her again since that morning.\n\nso reddit, AITA for saying i love you and then leaving, or is it justifiable being how easily manipulated I can be in the moment?",

      "description": "... or am I better off just getting through the lease and leaving in April?\n\nI love my roommate. They are one of my greatest friends. Ideally, they would remedy the issue and we would sign an extension on the lease. That would be my end goal.\n\n#### Backstory:\n\nMy roommate has a cat which I knew before we moved in together. We agreed that the litter would stay in my roommate’s room since I was concerned about my dog going through the box. Both animals have free roam of the common areas as do we, and we each take our animals in our rooms for the night.\n\nI don’t know if it’s a litter issue or a cleaning issue, but the cat started peeing on anything and everything a few months ago. I begged my roommate to take the cat to the vet which they begrudgingly did but apparently the cat was so poorly behaved the vet could not take blood from it. The cat was treated for UTI, but the peeing has continued.\n\n#### Issue\n\nThe cat odor is insufferable.\n\nAt this point, the entire apartment smells. I have purchased an air filter, dozens of air purifiers, and cleaned all common areas. Nothing covers it for more than an hour or so. My roommate claims she smells nothing and cleans properly after any accidents.\n\nA neighbor has complained by leaving a note on the door and I suspect we’ll be served a notice to cure between thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nBeyond possibly getting evicted, the smell is unbearable. The entire apartment smells like ammonia. My eyes water. There’s no pee yet that I can tell on my furniture, but I suspect the cat gets free roam while I’m not home and has accidents that aren’t cleaned fully.\n\n#### TL;DR\n\nMy roommate’s cat pees everywhere. The whole apartment smells like pee. My roommate does not smell it, but a neighbor has complained and I’m afraid my landlord will take action.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I threatened to leave, possibly sublet my room, or otherwise find a way out if she doesn’t fully remedy the issue? Or am I better off covering up the odor as best I can and just making it through the lease?",

      "description": "So I have been working exclusively for a smaller company, they offer me projects with payments ranging from 5,000 to 10,000. All up front. I have done this for three years.\n\nRecently I have realized that I could make more money freelancing, so with my previous employers blessing I have started working for other companies in different areas.\n\nMany people in my profession accept partial payments. I do not and I do not feel comfortable doing so as you never know who you can really trust.\n\nSo anyway, I accept a job for 25,000 from a company I have never worked for before. They needed this done quickly so they offered a high number without haggling. They did not tell me \"half up front and half later\", they simply gave me the money which I immediately noticed was light by 12,500. I ask whats up, and they say that i will get the other half after the job is done.\n\nI say thats bullshit, and that I want all of it upfront or no deal. They take this as an insult that I dont trust them (which is true) but I just say I dont work like that. In the end I return the money and they're not using my services. I was also threatened because apparently I wasted their time or some bullshit.\n\nNow the person who set me up with them says I just burned a bridge and that I fucked up badly. Oh well, I can go back to working for my old boss, whatever. My logic is that even though its a supposed industry standard if you dont specify before the fact you cant blame someone for not being cool with it. My contact says that I should have told them I wanted all of it since I was the one doing things weird.\n\nSo whose the asshole?",

      "description": "First of all, excuse my poor english. It's not my native language but I hope I can make myself undertood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently working at my family's bussiness. My grandfather founded it almost 40 years ago, and it's been run by the family since then. After he died, my father took control of it, as he was the older of 3 brothers and had been in the bussiness for longer and had more experience. His brothers were still involved and all seemed to be just fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 5 years ago, we found out that my uncle was stealing huge amounts of money and that the bussiness was almost broke.   It was really shocking for us, specially for my father, as he 100% trusted his brother. Of course everything went downhill since then. As you can imagine, it was a massive family conflict. They managed to legally exclude my uncle from the bussiness, got him to pay back some of the money, but it was actually a little porcentage compared to how much it was missing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy this time, I was starting the get involved in the bussiness. In part because I needed a job, but mostly because I wanted to help my dad in this rough time. His other brother had a stroke because of the stress and couldn't do much. We took a couple loans, had to let go some employees and restructure the bussiness. After almost 3 years of struggling, we payed the loans we got and reached financial stability. Eventhough I don't really enjoy my job, I decided to continue because the pay was ok, I already knew the bussiness and, to be completely honest, it is hard to find a well payed job in my country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always enjoyed drawing, and I think I'm fairly good at it. But it's a hobby of mine and I never thought of it as something to do for a living. About a month ago, a friend contacted me with the project leader of the company in which he works. He showed him some of my works and he was very interested. I met him by Skype and a week later he offered me a job. Eventhough is a starting possition, I would make in a month what it would take me almost 6 months in my current job. I would get payed in american dollars, which is not really common in my country. And, on top of that, I get to work from home without a schedule. I said yes without hessitating a second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I told my family I would leave, they got really mad. I told them that I will train someone to fill my place, as I won't have a schedule in my new job, so I would be able to still dedicate some time to that for a couple months. That was not good enough for them. They said it was betrayal, that I have to continue with the family bussiness, just as my father did. None of my siblings are involved in the bussiness btw, so I don't understand why it's my responsability to do it. It is awful, as literally every member of my family is against my decision. Even my uncle's wife is mad, eventhough she's still getting paid for the job my uncle couldn't do anymore because of the stroke. It's really messed up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will, nevertheless, take the job. You get oportunities like this once in a lifetime. But it feels really bad how my family reacted, even those who are not involved in the bussiness at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Family bussiness almost went broke, I helped to save it. A couple years later I get offered my dream's job and my family gets really upset because I accepted and left the family bussiness.",

I think this was the highest weight I've ever had.\n\nI've had a past full of people telling me that no one would ever date an ugly person like me.

I suspect the growth spurt started around 3rd grade as I got confused as to looking way older than I am. I have stretch marks, scars, acne, etc. The thing that started to trigger negative thoughts were the clothing I wore.\n\nMy parents get me sizes way more bigger than I am, and at first I thought it was because I was growing in height. I later found out that it was because they expected me to get fatter.\n\nThey made comments that I was lazy, I would get obese, I would end up in the hospital, they'd have to get XXXXL clothes for me one day, etc.\n\nThese added up with the comments that if I washed my face more I'd get light like my mom, if I washed my face more I wouldn't have this ugly face, etc.\n\nOn my 11th birthday I threw up the birthday food because I was upset about my weight. And the cycle slowly turned from Bulimia to Anorexia. Luckly, I managed to stop before I weighed less than 99 lbs.\n\nRecently thoughts of eating and my body has spiked to a low because I was petrified what I'd look like at my prom photos. I kept these thoughts secret as I thought I'd get over it.\n\nOne day my parents talked about how lazy I was and I'm gonna end up like this woman on TV (she was morbidly obese).\n\nI fucking broke down.

      "description": "Throwaway account yada yada yada.\n\nA short time ago I broke up with my gf. I signed up to Tinder just to see what happens – searching for neither hookups nor new relationships. Just browsing. I matched with A who seemed just a bit too enthusiastic about meeting me.\n\nWell, I went to the date and met B instead. She explained the situation like this:\n\n* A's Tinder game is weak and B, as her friend and as a psychology student, helped her out by taking over her Tinder account and texting with several guys, including me.\n* When B set up the date, A got cold feet. She didn't know me, after all. So A threatened to stand me up and B felt bad and went instead.\n\nWeird flex, but okay. I asked her how they could have thought this was a good idea, but was determined to have my coffee. So we did and grabbed some food afterwards. All in all quite alright as a date, and we agreed on meeting again.\n\nIn the next morning, A started texting me.\n\n* In her version, it was all a ruse to get B out there. B is pretty busy and neglects dating, so A tricked her into finding someone on Tinder and meeting them (me).\n\nShe was pretty proud of herself and spammed me with the face-with-tears-of-joy emoji (which may or may not have made me a little bit miffed). I chose some rather plain words to express my unhappiness with being the collateral damage of their double game.\n\nI still intend to meet B a second time (as promised), but I have to admit that this whole situation pisses me off. It's not B's fault, but I still don't see a real future. Am I the asshole for bitching about the setup?",

      "description": "As a kid I was diagnosed with cancer, the op was successful and removed all the tumor but my kind was particularly aggressive and known for spreading, So I was but on the harshest chemotherapy regimen possible after I finish the absolute maximum I could of radiotherapy, There are no words to describe how absolutely horrible and terrifying cancer treatment is let alone going through it as a kid, but I overheard a doctor telling my parents that the chemotherapy causes damage to the inner ear and that they will only give me so many treatments until it starts badly effecting my hearing. Childhood me wanting the least pain and suffering then deliberately missed a few noises and added a few in to the next hearing test because the treatment was hell and at the time I just wanted to stop feeling so bad, And it worked they dropped my to a less potent version that had less sevear side effect\n\nAdmittedly in hindsight I want to travel back in time and beat some sense into childhood me for pulling such a profoundly stupid stunt when my life was the cost of it fucking up, but to this day I still feel an unease thinking about it. I'm not sure if this is the guilt of lying or the fact I gambled my life as a kid for a small reprieve of suffering in a very shitty situation. \n\nFor a bit of context I was not a double digit age at the time but I was old enough understand somewhat what was going on. I knew it was cancer and I was told multiple times I wasn't going to die by the doctors and consultants treating me.",

      "description": "For the background - I'm from Poland, where tipping is gratuitous and usually reflects gratitude for a good service. Today I've ordered pizza from Domino's, paid about $15 online, including $3 something for the delivery.  When the delivery guy came, asked for a sign for receiving the pizza and asked by tip. I was already surprised, because as I mentioned the tip in my country is voluntary and waiter/delivery guy never asks for it, but after I wrote \"1\" in the tip section, the delivery man said that the delivery fee is not a tip, and that 1 dollar is a little and that he had to go upstairs to deliver my pizza etc. I politely said no and went back to the apartment. Being curious, I've done some research suggesting that the MINIMUM tip for such service is $3 or 20% of the order. And if I'm giving less I'm basically an a\\*hole and should make my own food if i cannot afford to tip, as many redditors say in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7njhpf/people_who_dont_tip_pizza_delivery_drivers_why/)  \nMy way of reasoning is that the tip should be given only for good service, is voluntary, and that I've already paid a fee for the delivery - and It's employer duty to pay his workers. AITA? ",

She was the one who asked me out, it turns out that we both felt the same about each other for a long time, but neither of us had the balls to ask until now. Unfortunately, we would have been much happier if this happened earlier, because we have around 1\\~2 months of school left before we graduate, at which we would inevitably have to break up, because we are both going to different corners of the world with university choices. \n\nBecause of that, I keep telling myself to not get too attached. Someone asked me what this relationship really meant to me, and I still struggle at that question. Truthfully, right now it feels a lot more casual, a fling kind of thing that will end soon. I also realized that I have no idea how to date, so this can be seen as practice... for the \"real thing.\" I just put off thinking about it for a long time because these thoughts make me really uncomfortable, and I like her a lot. \n\nBut at the end of the day, I can't with a straight face say that I am in this relationship for love. It's just that the fact that it will soon end is troubling me a lot.",

      "description": "(sorry in advance for mobile formatting and length!!)\n\nSo my job is in administration/facilities and I have been in my team the longest--which is maybe since Nov 2017, so not that long over all. I trained the current team members and literally wrote the manual; suffice it to say that I know my job. I am known as being meticulous (or anally retentive if you're being more unkind) due to my previous experience working in serious debt and fraud, and that kind of fastodiousness to maintaining spreadsheets, records and paperwork is something that has carried over into my work with this employer.\n\nTowards the end of last year, we had a few people leave the team, and because we were so short staffed, it was an incredibly stressful time, where I think everyone's work slipped, including myself. Around the same time we had one of our team members become our manager, leaving our previous team of five go down to two, including me. We have to give customer service to a building of 800, and we were spread very thin, so we have had people on a rotation from other offices and temps helping out where they can which is good, but they still don't know the specifics of the job as much as me, my colleague and my manager. \n\nWhen I first started I was given the security portfolio, meaning I manage the organisation of new starters, including their key cards and logging them into our security network. I got to know the archaic system better than anyone else, and I can do anything in this system quicker than you can snap your fingers. This being said, we had a huge influx of new staff towards the end of the year, and I somewhat began to neglect doing this role in as timely a fashion as normal. More urgent tasks came up, and new users weren't getting done as soon as we wanted, much to my chagrin, because you can't just tell someone to go away if they come up to you in person with some urgent issue that needs resolution. This new manager and I didn't get along when we were colleagues, so now she was my manager, she used this to lord over me about petty crap, and this was one thing she had genuine proof I wasn't doing as I should, so she took the whole security portfolio--the thing I know better than everyone else--and gave it to my other remaining colleague, who we'll call Mr Slim. This guy is one of those lads who seems to be able to do anything wrong and is still liked by our manager. He had a habit of just disappearing for hours at a time, would take random smokos all the time and still isn't publically told off for it; I was 10 min late back from an appointment once and I got publically yelled at in front of the team. This is the same guy that openly called someone \"too Jewish\"--as a himself a GERMAN. So, admittedly, imo I work with arseholes and I am a bit biased in this situation.\n\nFast forward till today. Mr Slim has been managing this security portfolio for about 3 months now, and he was recently away for about three weeks with a mysterious illness which he poorly communicated,  so we were on edge every day not knowing if he was going to be coming in or not until he would finally text our boss. While Mr Slim was gone we found a whole raft of unfinished, badly done or just not attempted work that was assigned to him or he had checked off as having been done. He hadn't been documenting anything correctly, and my beautifully maintained spreadsheets and system of putting together a starter pack was completely ignored and destroyed respectively. There's a whole bunch of stuff still unaccounted for, and the whole team, my manager included, is pretty pissed off at Mr Slim, despite letting a lot of it slide. In response, I'm given back this security stuff to fix as it hugely impacts our customers. Mr Slim is very friendly, and comes off as much more likeable than me (I have Asperger's) and I am aware that it makes his mistakes a lot more palatable than mine.\n\nSorry for the long explanation, but my problem is this: right now, whenever I try and do something in the team, Mr Slim jumps in and tries to do it before I can, even when I have said it in my daily outline in our morning meeting. I said I'd train the newbie after lunch? Cool, I come back from lunch to find Mr Slim in the middle of training him. I said I'd collate a whole bunch of data from some emails? The emails start disappearing as I am going through them because he's started doing them too. Boss asks the team to do something and I say I'll do it cos it's in my area of expertise? He tears off after I've already stood up. I've started to get a bit more aggressively assertive with him re why he's doing this, telling Mr Slim it isn't ok for him to just take my work out from under me, but he just laughs it off as if I'm lost in those wily female histrionics again, making vaguely patronising or misogynistic comments to me that I can't actually pin down as either but that make me uncomfortable. I've tried going to my manager, but in her view as long as the work gets done, there shouldn't be any issue. If I defend this, it looks like I'm hoarding work and *don't* want it to get done on time. When I defend my reasons for being thorough in maintaining spreadsheets with complete information and consistent capitalisation in our emails to staff and records, I'm made to feel as if I'm a nagging nancy and that I'm too sensitive. I KNOW I'm better at the job than Mr Slim, and I do take things seriously because I think it is important to doing the job well, especially since I wasn't doing so well last year. I wouldn't mind so much if he would just ask before jumping into doing my work--sometimes I left that email there because I was awaiting more info, not because I was lazy. I have reasons behind what I do, but no one wants to hear it.\n\nTL;DR my work colleague jumps in and does the work I have been assigned, my boss doesn't seem to care as long as the jobs get done, and I'm being made to feel like I'm too sensitive for reiterating the importance of accurate record keeping. AMTA for being pissed off at Mr Slim here or am I really just some hysterical woman like he said?",

I got his ig &amp; a few hours later he Dm'd me \"hey we should hang out soon, lets get drinks.\" I told him I'm down to since I was actually pretty interested &amp; thought he was cute. We ended up getting drinks.\n\nIt was a bit awkward for the first 10 minutes but its not like I knew him well. After 6 shots it was getting more lively. I got too confident &amp; kept drinking. I was at my 16th &amp; it all hit me like a ton of bricks. I was DRUNK. I kept going to the bathroom to puke &amp; Mike noticed &amp; came with me. He held my hair while I threw up, was rubbing my back saying its okay; trying to comfort me. I was a mess &amp; ended up passing out on his lap. He paid everything even though I offered &amp; drove me home. He even stopped at a gas station to buy me water. On the way home he was holding my hand &amp; when he dropped me off he asked if he could hug me. My friend who works at the spot we were at text me like \"i think he likes u he had his arms around u\" I was expecting Mike to not want to see me again after all that, but he still wanted to talk.\n\nFew days later, he said he wanted me to meet his friend John. He sends me a snapchat of him &amp; John &amp; Im like tell him I said hey. Mike says \"John asks if you think hes cute\" I'm like yeah. I show a pic of John to my friend Abby &amp; Im like \"hes cute. lets do a double date.\" She agrees.\n\nWe get drinks with the boys &amp; Abby that week. I meet up with them, &amp; as soon as John sees me he gives me a hug &amp; he's like nice to meet you. Tbh, I was starstruck by John. We sit at the table &amp; me &amp; John are hitting it off.  John asked if I think he's cute, cool or whatever, I said yes. Mike was barely talking. I was trying to include him but he didn't seem up for it. We went outside to smoke, &amp; I asked Mike if i smelled like cigs. I know he was mad cause he's like \"Don't ask me. I smoke too\" super coldly. So I asked John &amp; hes like \"nah you smell sweet.\" We left (I was getting a ride home with the guys) but John hugged me like we were saying bye to eachother.\n\nI admit I DM John later. We'd talk &amp; I'd notice he'd lowkey say things to make himself look better &amp; make Mike look bad? Might be overthinking it but he'd be like \"after we came home Mike had another two beers. Just like the night you two went out. He drinks like everyday. I only drink with my friends, I'm a healthy guy.\" Mike still seemed off. Barely texted me. I text Abby too, &amp; she's like \"idk if John finds me attractive. I didn't get flirty vibes from him, at least not to me.\n\nI'm not gonna lie and say I wasn't trying to get to the talking stage with Mike. We were almost there. So, AITA homie hopper for thinking about pursuing John? Is John the asshole for \\*maybe\\* trying to make his homie look bad? And again, AITA for talking to John even though I know my friend was kind of into him? I know nothing is official but please. Let me know if I'm being an asshole. ",

      "description": "TL;DR I asked a parent/child due to keep questions until the end of a movie as kid’s questions were disruptive. I got called a jerk and got reminded about capitalism. \n\n-\n\nThis happened a few weeks ago, but it is still eating at me. \n\nI went to see a 9:30pm showing of Bumblebee. There was a dad and his maybe 8 year old kid with him sitting one seat away from me, with an empty seat between us. Every few minutes the kid would loudly ask a question about the movie. \n\nAbout halfway through the movie I was getting annoyed with the loud questions, so I lean over and (trying to sound cheerful) ask something along the lines of “Hey y’all, could you please keep your questions until the end of the movie?” I aimed this at both the child and the father, as some parents would get upset about a stranger talking to their kid, but also because as a kid it hurts to hear people talk about you right in front of you. \n\nThe dad immediately called me a jerk and said he paid his ticket money just like everyone else. I ignored his comment and went about trying to ignore the kid’s questions for the rest of the movie. They didn’t do anything to “retaliate” like get louder, but out of the corner of my eye I could see the dad look directly at me everytime the kid asked a question. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for anonymously giving a bunch of expensive acne products to an otherwise beautiful girl who works at Subway?",
      "description": "100% throwaway account here. Will probably never log in after the dust settles from this (if there is any). \n\nI understand this is a convoluted question and it's a convoluted situation. I also hang around this sub enough to know this may get SHP or even troll accusations but I swear on everything this is real. I can give screenshots of the last product my ex wife purchased or whatever if no one believes me. \n\nSo I'm recently divorced. Ugly, ugly divorce where ex and I can't even stand to be in the same room together. We paid a fucking small fortune in lawyers fees because she wanted to argue about bullshit like who got patio furniture and the bird feeder that I didn't want anyways. In the end I just threw up my hands and said fuck it, she could keep everything, I just wanted out as long as I never had to see her again. Well we fought about that too because after saying she wanted the house, she didn't want the house and I had to dip into my 401k and IRAs to buy her out. Not that I even wanted the house, I just wanted her the fuck gone.  My ex-wife had pretty severe acne and the only thing that ever worked for her was this company called Paula's Choice. it worked so well that she would essentially buy thousands of dollars worth of the product at once in fear they would change the formula or cancel a particular creamer or whatever. So after all the shit was settled and I thought all her stuff was gone I found what has to be $1500 worth of brand new, sealed product tucked away in a closet in the garage. I thought about giving it to her but figured that would lead to more calls with lawyers because the last time I tried to give her something back pre-divorce she accused me of hiding things from her which cost us dozens of hours of lawyer and investigator time to figure out what else I was \"hiding.\" Seriously. Fuck her. But I didn't want to just dump $1500 of high end skin product so I figured I'd give it to my sister or something. \n\nSo because I'm a pretty pathetic divorcee, I eat at the Subway around the corner from my house 6 nights a week, maybe 7. A month or so ago a new girl started working there. I would guess 18 or 19 and stunningly gorgeous and also very sweet. She knows my name, she's acts like she's happy to see me, she doesn't judge me for gaining 30lbs eating their heart clogging food. I mean this when I say this...I have ZERO designs on her romantically. I'm too old, I'm too fat and I don't even think my dong works after being emasculated in the divorce. I am deadly seriously when I say this. Subway girl is a nice person who gives me a couple of minutes of happiness every day and that will always be the extent of our relationship. \n\nDespite her spectacular bone structure, piercing blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair, Subway girl has really bad acne. And as much as I think she's super cool, I really get the feeling that it affects her confidence. To be very honest, this girl should be out dating, having a great time, being the bell of the ball and not serving me Spicy Italians at 9pm on a Friday and although I don't know, I think her skin has something to do with why she chooses to work so much instead of go out. Again...all presumptions on my part and maybe very assholey of me. \n\n\nSo I decided wow, this is way too big of a serendipitous moment to pass up. I have boxes and boxes of expensive acne treatment and I know a super cool person who really could use the stuff. I decided that I'd just give it to her. After I thought about a little bit I figured me just walking and handing her the products really would be creepy and give some sort of implication that I wanted something in return from her. Again...I do not. \n\n\nSo I typed out an anonymous note and said basically \"Subway Girl, I work as a distributor for Paula's Choice Skin Care Products. I have a ton of extra product older product left over and would love for you to have it. Unfortunately, I would get fired if the company found out I was giving the stuff away and I hate to see it go to waste so I must remain anonymous. But you have always been so nice and courteous to me that it's yours free of charge. If you find it works for you it can be purchased on Amazon as well as Paula's Choice dot com. There are detailed instructions on how and when to use the product, enjoy! \" And then shipped it to her via USPS care of the store so I knew she would get it. \n\n\nI can actually tell she's using it because just like it did for my ex, her skin improved dramatically almost overnight. She has not acted any differently towards me so I know for a fact she doesn't think it was me. She has no reason to and very simply I felt good about doing a nice thing for a nice person. \n\n\nUntil my sister found out. My sister doesn't need the product so it's not a jealousy that I gave it away...it's that my sister thinks I am an incredible creep for what I did. She says no matter what I say outloud, I'm secretly hoping this young girl will know what I did and sleep with me. She said plus, by giving acne product to a girl with acne I was pointing out that she had a major flaw and was not a cute person. My sister then passed all this to my mom and grandma and now they both think I'm a creepy asshole who made this girl feel bad. \n\n\nI can add any info if needed but...am I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "This happened a year ago. My bf and I have been together for four years, and they’ve mostly been very happy!  When I graduated, he and I were both going through a rough time- I had bad anxiety, and he was very depressed. The stress of me moving back home overwhelmed him, and he broke up with me for a month. We reconciled, using the time apart to work on our issues, and I feel that we’ve been much stronger since.\n\nI was invited to be my bf’s plus one to a wedding of an old friend of his. She is not that close with my boyfriend, but close to a few friends of ours. When my bf broke up with me, he let her know I wouldn’t be coming. When we got back together, he asked her if I could come (the wedding still wasn’t for 5 months) and she said no, which I understood. However, the way that she said no upset me. “I only want serious couples to come together, and you and Saara aren’t serious.” At this point, he and I had been together 2.5 years...which is longer than she’d been with her husband.\n\nHowever, I understood it was her wedding and didnt want to make a fuss. What bugged me is that for a while, my bf was in denial that his friend could say something mean and kept defending her. I didn’t want him to stand up for me or anything, just acknowledge to me that what she did was mean. \n\nHer wedding came and went, and during the wedding, her husband was a homophobe to one of my bf’s and my friends “Jeremy”, even refusing a hug from him in front of all the guests and insinuating it was because he’s gay (Jeremy hasn’t publicly come out yet, which is extra shitty). I told my bf that his friend, “Ashley,” should have stood up for Jeremy and that she’s a bad friend and values her fundamentalism above friendship. He defended her personality but not her actions. \n\n Last August, we go to one of his mutual friends’ weddings. Ashley is there. I try to avoid her without seeming obvious, as I’m not the best at hiding my feelings. She saunters up to me, and this conversation follows:\n\nA: “Heeeey, Saara! What a great wedding, huh? Weren’t you at my wedding last year?”\nMe: “Hi, Ashley. No, actually, I wasn’t.”\nA: “Oh, you wouldn’t have liked it anyway. It was super nerdy, just books everywhere.” \nMe: “Ah, yes. Well, I wasn’t invited. Or, I was...and then I wasn’t.”\nA: “Oh.”\n\nMy boyfriend saw this conversation and after the wedding told me he was upset with the way I was cold to Ashley. I will admit that my tone was very level and monotone, while normally I have a “bubbly” voice, but I hadn’t done that intentionally. I know I wasn’t being friendly, but I also think I don’t have to love Ashley. My boyfriend agreed with me, and we also both agreed to lay the issue of Ashley’s character to rest. However, browsing this subreddit has got me thinking: was I the jerk? \n\nIf it counts at all, two of my boyfriend’s close friends, who are also friends with both me and Ashley told me that Ashley has a habit of trampling on people’s feelings and they were proud of me.",

We had a couple of mutual friends on facebook so instead of ignoring her I replied with \"awww thanks\" and in general trying to be nice.\n\nAnd after all this time, she just hit me up a few days ago with just \"What would you do if you were being bullied?\". I couldn't just ignore her even thought I didn't know here so I asked her if she's being bullied. Long story short she started telling me her life problems, while I slowly cramed myself into a pit I didn't know how to get out of. She told me she was being bullied, I told her she needs to tell someone and repeatedly told me she can't cause she's shy and she doesn't have a good relationship with her parents.\n\nI told her many times that she needs to tell someone. She then started messaging me very frequently, she started getting very personal. I tried to give her a hint everytime by answering is monotone ways, but she always just continued. It got to the point where she would tell me she did something, and after I answered with just a \"that's good\" she would just respond with \"haha I am going to shower now, I'll text you later\" and expected us to carry on a full on conversation. She even told me once that she used to cut herself etc. \n\nShe became a huge burden and I had to constantly worry about a random girl who became hung on me for no reason and I felt the need to stop what I am am doing to be her pshycologist, I couldn't take it anymore, so I just told her she needs to seek help and I wish the best for her. I then set my visibility status to not show on anyone, and then pressed ignore on her messages. AITA for feeling too much pressure to help a random girl on the internet because she wanted to constantly talk and told me she would cut herself when I didn't respond for over an hour?\n\n\nTLDR; random girl on the internet keeps messaging me every 10 minutes for weeks, telling me her problems and threatning she would cut herself if I didn't respond, so I blocked her since I couldn't take it anymore.",

I've also been in on/off states of mild depression, which is very out of my character and probably why I don't feel like I want to date anyone at the moment.  \n\nI started talking to this girl about 2 months after my relationship ended and explained how I didn't want to get into another one yet.  She said she wanted a relationship but understood and wanted to hang out anyway.  Long story short we've been sleeping together occasionally for the past few months.  We also talk fairly regularly but it's mostly friendly \"how are you's\" and the like.  Occasionally she would ask me if I'm feeling better yet (obviously wanting to know if we can start \"dating\") and I've so far always told her no, not yet.  \n\nToday she asked again if I was feeling better. I said no and that I'm still not ready for a serious relationship yet (which is true).  Well I guess she didn't like that very much and asked if I've only been talking to her because I wanted to get in her pants, etc.  AITA?",

      "description": "This was under a year ago but it bothers me from time to time.\n\nI met this girl at work and she was pretty and cool. We talked and joked around whenever she came in (I worked at a gym). Always talking about something. One day I built up the courage to ask for her number and to go out sometime. She said totally and everything was gravy. We texted all the time, she invited me local bars and we played pool and she would buy drinks and I would buy drinks. We got very close in a short time. \n\nAbout 2 weeks after of talking and all that I told her I was into her and asked if she has similar feelings and she gave me the whole I think you’re great but I’m not ready for a relationship thing. Which was fine cause I enjoyed her honesty but she was still very touchy and a bit flirty with me. \n\nSo her car breaks down and is getting repaired and I offered to drive her to work and back and she said thanks and it was no problem and she invited me back to her place that night to cook me dinner. We were having laughs and then after we ate we went to her room on her bed and laid shoulder to shoulder and talked then played some board game and again shoulder to shoulder faces only about a few inches away and I thought maybe she was waiting but I told myself if nothing happens now then it’s never going to happen.\n\nNothing happens and in my mind I’m like that’s cool we are good friends and I can just forget about those more romantic feelings. So for the rest of the week I drive her to and from work and I ask for nothing in return.\n\nFinally, it’s the weekend and I didn’t need to drive her or anything and we didn’t text for like a day cause we were both busy. She texts me and tells me about what she’s been up to. I text her back saying “Did ya miss me? Lol” \n\nShe then goes on this little rant about how I crossed the line of what friends are with that. That she isn’t looking for anything and she was uncomfortable. And I didn’t respond anymore after that. A week later she texted me what’s up and I ignored that. I 100% wasn’t flirting. So yeah. AITA ?",

      "description": "My girlfriend (F18) and I (M17) are in a committed long distance relationship and have been for about a month and a half now. We met in an online game (League of Legends) about four months ago, and have been in a discord call with each other for at least three hours a day since then with the exception once or twice a month. We have a really strong relationship, and I am planning on flying out to visit her this summer.\n\nWe never really get in arguments, but occasionally, 4-5 times a month, she will get in this really quiet mood and while in a call with me just not talk. It is very bizarre and seems to happen out of no where.\n\nThe most recent time that this happened was early in the day and is the reason I am writing this post. We were in a call and everything was fine, but I wanted to go downstairs to hang out and talk with my family. I told her this and she seemed fine with it, so I muted myself in the call and went downstairs. About 20-30 minutes later I get back and when I return she didn't sound okay (when she gets in these moods she talks in very short sentences and sounds just sad). I could obviously tell that something was wrong and I wanted to try and make her feel better, so I ask her what was wrong and she responded with nothing and that she is fine. I waited a little bit but she doesn't seem to be better, so I ask her again and got the same answer. I interpreted this as she just wanted to be left alone, so I just listened to music and stopped talking.\n\nMaybe after 15 minutes of her not being in a good mood she turns on the screen share in discord and starts playing YouTube videos. When she started this I was in the middle of listening through a playlist my friend made to help them add or delete some songs to improve it. I didn't say anything at first because she seemed to be in a better mood and the videos were pretty easy to ignore, but then she started playing louder music, more obnoxious, music which made it harder to focus. Because of this, I turned up the music from the playlist so I could try and focus on it. She would occasionally try and talk to me but I would not hear it because of the volume of the music I was listening to.\n\nThis made her angry that I was not responding to her all of the time. She then muted herself and began to act in the sad way that she was previously. I felt really bad because she was in a much better mood and then seemed to back-step to how it was before. \n\nI decided to just give her space again and not speak, which ended up working because within 30 minutes she was back to normal like nothing happened.\n\nTL;DR - My girlfriend was in a bad mood and, I did not know the cause of it, so I tried to help her feel better by talking to her. After failing she eventually felt better and got mad at me for not giving her enough attention.",

      "description": "To start this off I’m 19. My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I’m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I’m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to “get off my ass and do some real work for once”. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said “I’ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don’t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.” I responded with “You always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can’t you do it now, I’m sending out the bills for this month.” He replied “Fuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.” This is where I got pissed off “First of all” I said “ you are not my boss, I’m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it’s going to be me telling you.” “I’m not taking orders from a damn kid” he said. “ Look, I know it’s hard to take orders from someone that’s young and that is new here but you know what’s harder?”there was a pause and he said “What’s that?” “Feeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.” He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn’t said anything to be since. \n\nSo AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?",

My mum works 2 days a week, 12 hours and uses the benefits system to lower cost of housing and my step-father hasn’t worked since he was 16 and doesn’t help towards the rent at all.\n\nI recently started working, as an apprentice for very minimal amounts of money, and it’s screwed over my mothers benefits. She wanted me to pay rent, which I was happy to do. Then she told me to tell the council I lived at my dads to make her benefits go back up and then I don’t have to pay rent! Bonus!\n\nBut now she wants rent again, even though it’s cheaper for her again. She doesn’t get my child benefits anymore, but I pay for my food, water etc. And I feel like she’s trying to con me out of money for her gambling addiction.\n\nFor added context, my fiancée is pregnant and lives with her parents, and she doesn’t work due to issues with her previous workplace. I need to save money up to buy baby clothes and other bits etc. \n\nMy mother had a massive argument with me this morning about being selfish etc. Because I focus on my fiancée right now, for obvious reasons. I think it’s really pathetic.\n\nTL;DR mother and stepfather have benefits to pay rent, I screwed over benefits system to help out yet I still have to pay rent when I pay for other expenses, mother has a go at me for wanting to focus on fiancée who is pregnant.\n\nAITA for wanting to leave my home ASAP to live with my fiancée?",

      "description": "Okay so a little context, I’m 23 in a serious relationship and have a whole host of medical issues. I’ve never wanted a kid, even at age 5 I found the idea of baby dolls etc just ugh. This idea evolved and changed as I did and eventually developed into where I am now which is even if I wanted one having one with my medical issues would just be dumb and dangerous for everyone involved. \n\nMy cousin is the eldest of us all and has always been a family woman (honest to god I see nothing wrong with that, it’s just not for me) she’s happily married and is expecting her first. And so the family has gone into a bit of a baby craze. \n\nI live quite far so I’ve avoided most of the madness, but I went to see them all last weekend with a knitted blanket I’d made for her as a gift. This started the comments: “you’re obviously very mummsie think of what you could make for your own” “you’d be a great mum” “it’s what you were born to do” “oh your opinion will change when you’re older” \nTo all of this I just laughed and made jokes just trying to get past the awkward but it’s a full 4 hours of these little gripes till my cousin says: “Honestly [my name] you’re so stubborn, believe me in a few years all your “opinions” will change then that job of yours won’t matter. I just hope it’s not to late and you don’t end up alone and bitter. Honestly having a kid is the best thing a woman can do and nothing can compare” \n\nThis really angered me so I (somewhat tipsy and just kinda very done) snapped back “well sorry I have more ambition than being a breeder, have fun with a wrecked vagina” she broke down crying and that pretty much put an end to the family gathering. \n\nI feel horrid about it all and I really didn’t mean it. She’s always wanted a family and I’m so happy for her but I’ve felt like I’ve always respected her choices and she’s never respected mine and it kinda popped at the worst moment. I really want to say sorry but she’s now posting these really pathetic and snide fb posts and i really am just kinda tired. \n\nSmall note: my cousin and that side of the family knows about my medical conditions, I even brought them up to point out how unsafe it would be. But they still continued. I know that doesn’t excuse what I did but I hope it explains why I got so angry. \n\nTDLR: at a family gathering and got crap for not wanting children, I snapped at my pregnant cousin and now she’s posting all of this stuff on fb and I just want the whole ordeal to be over.

      "description": "My partner and I have been married for 7 years, and were working on advanced degrees together for the first 5. I graduated and got a job 2 years ago, when we had our first kid. As a student, my partner isn't being paid. I'm our sole income, we pay tuition, and I have a side business for extra cash as well. \n\nTax time came around, and I realized we could put some money into retirement accounts rather than pay it in taxes. We have the same type of retirement account, but my partner has more $ due to prior contributions from parents. I tried to gently suggest that since mine is smaller, and since I am the breadwinner (didn't phrase it like that), that I should put the full amount in my account (still far less $ than the difference in our accounts). Partner says that's not fair, and that it shouldn't matter if we're going to stay together anyway. I think we should each be in a position to to take care of ourselves, and since I am currently earning for everything else, including tuition, I should get to make this contribution to my own account.\n\nThis amount that we'd get to avoid in taxes is really all the extra we can afford right now. We aren't paycheck to paycheck, but we don't have a ton of savings either. Other than this, what I earn is our money, and goes to family expenses. I don't give my partner an allowance or monitor their spending, we both use a joint account. So AITA for wanting this extra for my own retirement account?",

      "description": "So, to clarify, my sister and i have a fairly complicated relationship. She was the favorite growing up. I always felt like an outcast in my family and it lead to me picking on her some. Because honestly, it's the only way i could get my family to even notice i existed. But my sister and i? We don't like each other at all. Because, honestly, she ruined my life and stole my childhood from me. She was pretty much the baby of the family, spoiled rotten.\n\nAnd i've really taken any way to get back at her i could growing up. Even today.\n\nSo this Christmas, i decided to pull a little prank on her. I got her a \"gift\". It was an Xbox One. So, i gave her the wrapped Xbox and told her it was an apology item and that i was sorry for everything i ever did to her. She was so happy, i gave her the present in front of our entire family. She opened it and talked endlessly about all the cool features written on the box.\n\nI told her to open it. And when she did, she started crying because it wasn't an actual Xbox. I just bought an empty Xbox case and just put a big rock inside. All she said was \"Where's the real one\"? and i revealed it was a big prank. There was no Xbox. I told her to go plug it up and play with it.\n\nShe threw the box on the ground and told me \"I hate you! You're the worst brother ever! You ruined my Christmas!\" and ran off crying into her room.\n\nI looked around, expecting my family to laugh at it, but they just stared at me with a dissapointed look. They scolded me about it.\n\nBut really, was it really that bad of a prank? Are they just babying her? Was it just a harmless prank?\n\nAm i the asshole for pulling this prank? Or is my family just babying her?",

      "description": "My (27f) have been living with my brother (32m) for the past 7 years. We've lived in the same house the whole time. 2 years ago I bought the house and have been renting it out to my brother and a roommate. Their rent is super cheap with all bills are included, and I haven't raised it even though my taxes have gone up about $400 a month in the past 2 years. I also pay for all the communal house supplies like detergent, paper towels, towel paper, etc.  I have also paid for pest control that he caused (I won't go into details because then someone might recognize him from the post), even though it wasn't my fault, wasn't in my room, and cost nearly $3000. He never offered to pay or to help out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother doesn't have a college degree but he has a decent job as a warehouse manager. The problem is that he hasn't paid his rent on time in more than a year and a half. April is in 2 days and he hasn't paid me a cent for March. Every time I bring it up he says he is trying his hardest and he has anxiety. I know he could pay his rent on time if he tried. He never cooks at home, never takes his lunch to work, and goes out drinking with his friends at least once a week. And this isn't the first time he's done this type of thing to me. He rented my old car from me until it broke down for good and never paid for it. Nothing. He drove it for months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like he's just taking advantage of me because I'm his sister and I'm getting sick of it. The extra money each month is really nice but I don't need it. I felt like I've e let him walk all over me. I think he needs a real kick in the ass. I'm done enabling him. I'm going to change the WiFi password and not tell him since technically he hasn't paid for it. I will give him the password when he is caught up on his rent. But what I really want to do is tell him the next time his rent is late, starting in May because there is no way he will be on time on April, that he has has a month to find a new place to live. My Dad has offered to employ him and give him a place to live for free, and my mom has told him that after my sister moves out he can live with her, also for free, while he goes back to school but he's chosen not to. Will I be the asshole if I tell my brother to grow the f up and pay his rent on time or he needs to find a new place to live?",

      "description": "I’m new to reddit. I usually just browse and read, however after what happened today, I felt the need to make an account and post. \n\nAnyways, so my husband and I decided to watch that new video from Gillette. The Best Men Can Be video to be specific. As we were watching it, I looked over at my husband that seemed to be getting a bit worked up about it. \n\nThe bit where, the woman is walking on the street past 2 guys and one of the guys starts kind of strutting after her, until his friend holds him back saying, “not cool. Not cool.”\nMy husband got visibly annoyed. So I turned to him and asked him what’s wrong. \n\nMy husband than started saying, that he didn’t agree with that bit. Because what if his friend just held him back from finding someone he loved? \n\nI explained to my husband that, woman don’t walk on the streets to find love or a partner. That most of the time they’re just minding their own business and trying to go about it without having to be hassled by men like that. Even if he wanted to approach her, there are better ways than doing it like that. \n\nHe than countered argued, but what if she wanted him to approach her? I was kind of blown away because to me that’s basically saying, that she’s asking for it? \nI then said to my husband that he his views are sexist and then even went to ask him how’d he feel if it was our daughter it was happening to? \n\nHe kind of shut up than and refused to talk to me and told me to drop the subject and that it didn’t matter anymore and he didn’t want to talk about it. \n\nI’m really disappointed in his view point and I really didn’t think he was like this. Most of the time he’s really respectful of everyone especially women. It kind of makes me second guess our marriage and even puts me off wanting to have kids with him.\n\nSo Am I the asshole for calling him out? \n",

      "description": "During a long road trip I stopped off with my 4yo daughter for dinner at a family run rest stop type café/restaurant we’ve been to many times before. My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  \n\nShe’d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.\n\nA bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she’d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she’d been pretty funny.\n\nWhen he brought the food over though he didn’t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her “do you know you are really beautiful?” She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn’t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said “the man is talking to you” he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. \n\nI was uncomfortable for a few reasons: \n\nI didn’t like his tone or the look on his face, I’ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman\n\nIt’s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice “beautiful” inappropriate\n\nI made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn’t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it’s their secret and not to tell mum.\n\nI feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  \n\nAlso did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?\n\nI’m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She graduated college this past December while I graduate in December of this year. She got a full time job in her hometown, about 2 hours away, &amp; moved in with her parents along with the baby. The plan is just to wait till I graduate and then we’ll get our own place down there.\n\nHere’s the problem. His new daycare is $800 a month and she wants me to pay half. I think that this is unfair. I’m working an internship and spend about $900-$1000 a month on rent, utilities, groceries, etc. She’s living with her parents rent free, is making more than I am at her new job, and her only expenses are gas, daycare and diapers. Everything else is provided by her parents. So I told her that I feel it’d be a bit unfair for me to have to give an extra $400 a month when I’m already scraping by as is. Her reasoning is that it’s hard to take care of a baby “alone” and he’s both of our responsibility, which is true, but I’m still not understanding why she needs my money when she’s more than capable of paying his daycare on her own. I honestly think that she’s just being cheap.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My (22f) gf (30f) wants to move to a nicer property when our lease is up. I’m a student, and I don’t have time for a part time job until summer rolls around, so to say money is tight for me would be a fair assessment. \nThe properties she’s looking at are way out of my price range. I can’t tell you how much I’ve stressed this, but she’s dead set on these (admittedly nicer) flats/houses. We could afford it, but my half of the rent and bills would leave me with literally nothing left over.\nI understand that she maybe wants somewhere more ‘adult’ than our little flat, given that she’s a bit older and she works hard for her wages. She says her dad would give her some money towards the rent each month for both of us, which kind of negates the ‘adult’ factor for me tbh. And no, I cannot take money off my parents unless I’m in dire straits; my pride won’t allow it. \nI feel like a total dick because she’s at a point in her life where she wants a nice place to reflect how hard she’s working. Not that our place isn’t nice - it’s small, but it’s spotless and in a great location. I feel blessed to be where we are, and it’s not exactly as cheap as something I’d have chosen for myself. But she wants something better, which I can understand. I just don’t want to do it. Even though technically, I could. That’s why I’m asking you: \nAITA for refusing to move to a nicer property?",

We both struggle with our own mental illnesses and we have grown so close because of our understanding of each other’s insecurities. I can’t see myself with anyone else.\n\nShe has made huge strides with her anxiety and all though she still has episodes, she copes really well. She is a very emotional individual.\n\nI was admitted to a mental hospital this past year for major depression, anxiety, and signs of psychosis.\n\nI’ve recently had an issue with medications making things worse. When I told her about this, we both agreed that meds weren’t supposed to be long term. Then she starts talking about what would work. Prefacing with; “saying you want to get better, but not having the energy to do so contradicts itself.”  That felt like a low blow because *I do* want to get better and *I don’t* have the energy to do so. She then starts telling me that I can’t be reliant on anything other than diet, exercise, a routine, and some meditation to fix me up. She doesn’t believe that there is more to it than just that.\n\nI know there isn’t a magic pill to fix it all. But I’ve tried to consistently do all those things and I’ve still ended up with a gun against my head. I wrote a long message about how I’m not her and tried my best to explain to her that my brain is crippling me severely. \n\nWhen she tells me what I need to do fix myself up, I can’t help but have the knee jerk, “oh thanks I’m cured” reaction. \n\nI know she is just trying to help but she keeps exemplifying a lack of understanding. She makes me feel like garbage for using medicine to help.\n\nAITA for being so upset and hurt by this? Is she right to think that all I need are some basic lifestyle changes? Is there anything I can do to convey that I truly need the extra help?",

When I asked more questions she pretended like she didn’t know what I was talking about. Today she came to school (we are seniors in high school) wearing his clothes.

      "description": "   This is long and has some talk about self harm, just a quick warning ahead of time.\n\n   Okay so i have this friend. She has fucked up, super controlling parents and she always ranted to me about her parents and I could relate, because my parents aren't the greatest either, so I'd reassure her that once she moved out for uni she would feel significantly better and more free. \n\n   So she moved into residency for her university back in September, and I moved into my apartment in a different city. I'm in second year so I know how busy and overwhelming the first few weeks of a semester can be, but bc she took a gap year and was only going into first year, she was unprepared for the work load and adjustment period. She would call me almost every day and ask for advice on how to talk to people on her floor, how to meet people in her program, etc, and I'd explain how to do so while attempting to get through my own workload and readings.\n\n   I didnt mind helping her at first, but then she started getting more demanding while also not taking my advice. She'd call me while I was in lectures and spam me with messages demanding that I answer her call because she had something to ask me, but every time I'd tell her I was in class, she'd get angry and upset and throw a fit, and I'd feel bad for not answering her. She would also refuse to take my advice on how to meet people and she would always lament and complain that she doesn't talk to anyone, and I'd ask her if she did what I'd recommended and she'd say no, then go on to expect other people to talk to her first. \n\n   I got tired of that, but I didnt vocalize this bc she needed someone to rant to and I'd rather her rant than have her bottle it all up. Then she started talking about her mental health and her self destructive thoughts, and at first I'd attempt to help her, because I have a history of self harm and I'd give her alternatives. I always felt exhausted after those conversations and in a worse mental state, and it very quickly started bringing back the same shit I'd dealt with five years before. It got to the point where I'd dread answering her calls because I KNEW that she was going to talk about that stuff and not listen to me saying that it put me in a bad state that hindered me to the point where I couldn't complete my school work.\n\n   It got to a point where I snapped at her and said, \"This stuff is affecting my schooling, I want to help you but its bringing back bad memories. You have counseling services offered to you on campus, use those\". After that she sort of backed off and stopped calling, and then stopped contacting me altogether, leaving my snapchats on read constantly. I found out from a mutual friend that she had turned to him to rant to instead of me and didn't go to the counseling, and he had the same reaction as I did after 2 months of her only talking about her mental health and not listening to him. He called her out on treating both him and I the same, and she twisted it around and ended up blocking him after an argument in which she said he was only acting like this bc she \"wouldn't send nudes\" to him (he's never asked her for nudes, and she even got jealous when he flirted with me and not her?) and then shaded both me and him for have a fwb relationship and essentially called me a slut for it (????). \n\n   After he told me this I got upset at her for twisting his words and not listening to the points he was bringing up, how he felt she treated both him and i like therapists instead of friends. I stopped responding to her altogether and I still recieve calls and voicemails (where she's crying) from her despite this happening in early December. \n\n   Am I the asshole for getting upset at her and for taking our mutual friend's side? I feel bad for ignoring her and not answering her calls, but I also dont want to be put in a bad mental state again, especially since im so overwhelmed from second semester. (Also I'm sorry this is so long but it's like 4 months of drama with her and I tried to keep the more important details but I suck at editing.)",

      "description": "So I (22F) am in a relationship with (21M). We've been together for around 2 years now.\n\nWe lived together for over a year, but i moved away for my studies in september (2hours drive). So new school, new friends. \nNow my bf has always been the jealous kind, while i am not at all, i just trust him and if he cheats on me. well i'll leave him, not going to ruin my mood thinking of things what \"might\" happen. \n\nAnyway, 2 months ago my bf  found some fb messages some friends from my new school sent me, particularly three. First two from a good friend, let's call him M, one being \"you can come to the party but you have to sleep in my bed\" and the second one \"you're gonna blow the candle lmao\" \nThird message was from another friend from my new school , and was a drawing of a boy smelling a girl a-hole (charming i know) \nSo he got really hungry, told me I am a whore for letting people talk to me like that, that they just wanted to get me, and that i was hungry for c*cks. (Charming again, i know)\nI tried to explain to bf that those were just jokes, M said to sleep in his bed precisely because at parties i always sleep on the couch and not in his bed because i have a bf.  The drawing was because second friend drunkenly told he liked to smell ass. Why not.\n\nSo i have no feelings but friendship for these guys, nothing sketchy ever happened with them! And IF they wanted me they wouldn't say such things would they? You don't get the girl by telling her to \"blow the candle\"\n\nI said sorry anyway, because those messages are chocking and i understand that he would feel mad. So I let go of how bf insulted me and sincerely apologize. He told me that i couldn't continue seeing them or talking to them, and letting them talk to me like that.\n\n\nFastforward 1 months, i go to a party with M, thinking that i will talk to him, tell him to stop making sex jokes and such. I go to the party, it goes well, and at around 11pm i get my bf on the phone and tell him where i am. Big mistake. \"You're a whore\" \" you choose them over me\" \"i told you not to party with them\"\n\nI apologize again, things are tense but we don't want to break things of. \n\nSo that was a month ago. My bf is at my place for an entire week rn, and in two days he talked about \"my friends\" and how i should just \"go back to them\" at least 5 times already. He is not over it at all even thought i stopped going to parties and talking to them as much as i could.\n\nAITA for letting my friends joke like that to me? AITA for feeling really wrong having my bf tell me who to talk to? \n\nI hope this has enough info and not to much mistake english is not my first language. Thank u\n\n",

      "description": "So rewind back to December. It's the morning of December 24th, and I wake up in a pool of my own blood (thanks mother nature), and go straight to the bathroom from my room down the hall, and let my dog out of my room as I go, that way I can let her outside to potty once I'm all cleaned up. Now, before we go into any more detail on that, I have to backtrack and say that my friend, his wife (former roommates now) and I all knew for sure that my dog was in heat, and they have an unfixed male, hence why she slept in my room. Friend's responsibility is to make sure his dog is put in his crate if he leaves the house for any amount of time if SOMEONE isn't awake and around to watch him cuz their dog literally humps anything that moves (owners included). Back to the story, I come out of the bathroom (literally in there less than 3 mins), and his dog has already tied himself to my female and his owners are nowhere to be found. Turns out friend had gone a few houses down to his dad's and his wife was at work. He'd left his dog out and his logic was \"you were asleep and I was only gone 20 mins\". He showed back up 15 mins after I walked out to the dogs tied together. His wife and I have gotten into several arguements about this since then with her insisting that sole blame and responsibilities for the incident and resulting puppies (5 of them) is on me, the most recent being tonight. Note: I was working on getting her spayed at the time but didn't have the extra cash even with a county voucher due to bills and unexpected things coming up. So tell me reddit, AITA? Cuz I sure the hell don't think I am.",

      "description": " \n\nSo I'm in university and in my residence you share a bathroom with the person living next to you. From September to now, my roommate has been playing loud rap music in the washroom, even in the morning, occasionally yelling and acting like a buffoon, and always forgetting to unlock my door (which isn't too big of a deal because I can easily open it with scissors or something, but what irks me is when I forgot the first few times to unlock his door, he made a big deal about it and apparently unlocking it like that could cause it to break). Since I'm a non confrontational person, I didn't want to bring up with him, and also because he's much bigger than I am, but over the past two weeks I decided I should do something about it because I cant deal with this bs for another few months. So over the past week - week and a half ish I told him multiple times, at firstly kindly, to turn the music down and to remember to unlock my door. He'd say okay and whatever, but the next day or two, he would be doing the same thing again. I, getting angrier decided to start loudly knocking on the door and yelling at him to stop the next few times it happened again. Yesterday, I once again, kindly, told him if he can stop doing both of these things and he said okay.\n\n \n\nThis morning, I was woken up at 7:15 am to the sound of awful rap music while the guy was showering and afterwards I heard his mom calling him about something and him laughing. When I went in the washroom after a while, I made a sarcastic comment where I thanked him for waking me up and called him a fucker while I was in the shower. Fed up, I decided I would go file a complaint with my RA, outside her door is a November calendar with  birthdays of people living on the floor written on the dates. Turns out it was my roommates birthday today.",

      "description": "So recently I've been watching a lot of r/ videos, and has brought some memories back of some bad experiences (for better or worse). A bit of backstory, I have one younger sibling, who loves to go out often with his close friends and girlfriend for a drink. He usually stays out late and comes back home latest around 2-3am. Because of this, my brother and I don't talk to often, but on the occasion we do it's usually asking if I can help drive him or get him something. Occasionally my brother will ask for booze (since he's 17), I agree, thinking this will give us a chance to talk for a bit. The conversations usually end short as I give him some booze and he shortly leaves with his friends. But one day came along where I decided to refuse help him out and as he usually says \"Be a bro\". \nThis story happened about 4 months ago, around the Holidays. I was approached by my brother with his girlfriend while I was playing some Pokemon in my room.\n\n* LB: Little Brother, ME: me\n\n* LB: Hey can you drive my girlfriend and I to a vape store and get us some e-juice?\n\n* ME: Wait what?\n\nHe proceed to explain to me that you need to be 19 or older in order to buy stuff for vaping (I had no idea)\n\n* LB: Can you drive us to a vape store, its close by, not even a 10 minute drive.\n\nI think for a moment and how I've been so lenient on him with booze that I decide I shouldn't do this to him as I personally don't support vaping.\n\n* ME: I know I've been easy with you to help you get alcohol but vaping is where I'm going to have to cross the line\n* LB: Come on man, its not that bad\n* ME: Yes I know vaping isn't necessarily harmful to you but I don't support it, therefore I won't help you go and buy you this stuff for your vape.\n* LB: *Scofs* Well OP, there's worse things to get addicted to, vaping isn't bad at all\n* ME: Yes but...\n* LB: But what? Huh?\n* ME: It doesn't present you well, it just looks shitty to me when you go \"take a hit\" you're so much better than that.\n* LB: WOW OK, THAT'S WHY? Honestly OP do some research, vaping great for your health and is definitely less addictive than weed, the booze you've been buying for me and or your dumb gaming. Seriously, you're so stupid man.\n\nHe walks out of my room proceeding to slam the door. At that moment, I was pretty pissed off that he came into my room and asks me if I can help him out and after refusing goes on to tell me that I'm in the wrong for telling him, no. I'm still personally against vaping, I find it very unattractive. But what do you guys think should I loosen off about vaping being bad or do you agree with my point of view?",

      "description": "Today is my birthday. I am in the camp the believes once you're over 21, birthdays aren't really celebrated. I don't expect everyone to get together and take me out to dinner or something. I don't even expect a cake.\n\nMy husband is an amazing husband and father. He is very good to me and our kids, but he is a terrible gift giver. Gift giving is his his worst love language by far. On our birthdays we just exchange small gifts with eachother and I always bake him a birthday pumpkin pie (his favorite.)\n\nWell this year we were talking about what I wanted for my birthday, and I have been really struggling this year in my role as a mom with taking care of myself. So I decided instead of asking for something I need like I usually do, I decided to ask for something I wanted that would be a special treat. I found a scarf on Amazon that I really liked, it was $12. I sent the link to my husband while we were in the same room, and told him that was what I wanted for my birthday. \n\nFast forward a couple weeks and we were planning what to wear to a wedding that would be the day before my birthday. I asked my husband if he bought me that scarf because I would like to wear it to the wedding. He said no, I sent him the link again just incase and didn't bring it up again because I didn't want to nag him. Also,I know he likes things to be a surprise, so I thought maybe he was just making it seem like he wasn't going to buy it to trick me. \n\nA few days ago I was making biscuits for dinner and made a comment to my husband about a pastry cutter. I said, \"You know, a pastry cutter is one of those kitchen tools I think about getting sometimes, but I would only use it a couple times a year and it would just take up space we don't have the rest of the time.\"\n\nYou can probably tell where this is going. I woke up this morning to a pastry cutter on the kitchen table, and a couple other kitchen gadgets he's been complaining we don't have. No scarf. \n\nAnd then on top of that, he told me yesterday he invited his mom over to watch the kids today so we can go out for my birthday. We don't have money to go out, and his mother coming over means I got to spend the morning of my birthday cleaning the house so it was MIL ready. And I didn't even want to go out, I would have much rather stayed at home with my kids and made a cake with them. \n\nI'm upset, I don't feel like going out. I'm trying not to bitch and moan and just be happy that my husband got me anything. But I'm definitely disappointed and feel like I wasn't heard today.",

      "description": "This girl and I have been in a serious relationship for a couple of months now. We’ve been pretty open about our past relationships and we both have said in the past that honesty between partners are important. \n\nWhen we were starting out this was the story I knew. She had a boyfriend (guy A) for three years, she found out that the guy was cheating so she broke up with him. They were just starting a long distance relationship (she was assigned in another country) back then. A few months into her new job, and a few weeks after they broke up, she started a relationship with co-worker (guy B). This was brief, lasting just a couple of months. She said she didn’t feel an investment from Guy B’s part, and she felt she still loved Guy A, so she broke up with the Guy B, and eventually got back with her Guy A. They lasted another three years, Guy A even proposed. After a year of being engaged she felt that the guy wasn’t really committed so she returned the ring and they weren’t the same ever since. They finally broke up for good, a month after she met me and we started dating. \n\nA few days ago I learned that she actually cheated Guy A. After breaking up with Guy B and getting back into a relationship with Guy A, she did break things off with Guy B but they continued having sex afterwards. She did this for three years and stopped only after Guy A proposed. She said she did it because she was really hurt by what Guy A did, and it was sort of getting back at him. She said she didn’t have any strong feelings for Guy B, and she wasn’t even sexually satisfied with him (at least that’s what she said to me). \n\nI can’t understand her side. I wanted to know why she did those things. She’s telling me that this was in the past, and she was stupid back then. I believe her, she’s a nice girl, and in all fairness to her she’s the one that brought the thing up and confessed everything. \n\nNow I told her that I’d reassess our relationship. I starting to get more details about her relationship with guy B since I need to understand and empathize with her. I’m a guy big on fidelity, I’ve said to her in the past that I’d never would have given Guy A a chance back then. Now I’m thinking of ending things with her. \n\nAITA here when I wasn’t the one she cheated on?",

We have a friend in common which is my GF's bestfriend and she bought a trip for my girlfriend and her which is my girlfriend's dream destiny. When my girlfriend found out I acted all surprised and happy for her, but in reality I'm a little bit pissed off at our friend because I was planning on doing the same trip when we did 1 year, I even already started saving money and all... Also I'm quite upset because our friend only informed me when she had paid for everything and booked the travel for valentines, meaning I won't be able to spend valentines with the woman I love...\n\nNow, my girlfriend has been called for a surgery she's been waiting for 3 years   and the surgery is going to be at the end of January. I'm ashamed to say this, but I'm kind of hoping the doctors won't allow my girlfriend to travel, because I think our friend should have told me about the plan previously, especially since they are going to travel on valentines. I don't want to say anything to my girlfriend because I don't want her to go mad or sad in her dream trip, and I can't really say anything to our friend because she'll just tell my girlfriend...\n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Hi all! Made a reddit account to ask this based on the advice of a mutual friend between both the parties here, and I would like to receive judgement!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'll cut right to the chase, I (lesbian/22) spend 90% of my free time on chat sites that have no association to my real life identity because it lets me really just relax and be me without the fear of harassment or long term judgement. I have a few friends on these sites that I've had for a few years now, including one I've known for 3 years that we'll call Rocky. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Rocky and I get along really well, we're both into the same things, and due to the anonymity we can talk to each other about stuff we can't talk to people we know in real life, namely anime girls/hentai. (laugh all you want). However I have made it clear I'm gay and would never reciprocate his feelings, which he seemed to understand (I know it sounds weird to warn people about that beforehand but trust me, it helps in the long run.) and the one time he said he thinks I'm \"probably beautiful\" I shut it down saying I am not looking to be hit on, we can talk about hentai but I do not want to be an object of your desires. He agreed and we were fine for like 8 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever last week, we were talking about something I won't get into when he says \"Damn I'd kill to see you masturbate to that x)\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was at a lost and kinda... panic blocked him? I haven't wanted to speak to him again, honestly I feel betrayed and posting this isn't easy. A mutual friend said I'm not in the wrong but he's really sorry and I should at least hear him out. When I refused she accepted it, but I still felt guilty since he was apparently like crying over it. She said I shouldn't feel bad and if I am conflicted I should ask about it here. Am I in the wrong?",

Anyway, in October (so not that long after, considering we were dating for over a year and a half), my ex informed me that she planned on starting dating again and I was like, okay, this still sucks but you've got to move on with your life. \nShe started seeing this guy, who's super nice and I really like and he makes an effort with me so I'm really supportive of her being happy and I'm glad she's found someone really great, even if it can't be me.\nThe only problem is that is still really hurts when I see them together, when they're holding hands and giving each other like caring looks, you know, the usual beginning of a relationship stuff. \nJust hanging out together, as a group, I have no problem because he's very easy to get along with. Like I said, I like him as a person, and she's still a really good friend so I feel like a massive asshole being mad at them for expressing their love for each other when I'm around. It's just the cutesy little things that I remember us doing when it was her and me together. It also sucks that I'm now the only single one in our friendship group (that she introduced to me).\nI'm afraid of bringing it up to her in case she gets defensive and I seem like I'm being petty and should just get over it. I'm not even sure she realizes it hurts me. But sometimes when we've been hanging out for a while, the jealousy spills out in little nuggets of meanness, and I feel like a class A jerk.\nSo AITA? Or is it okay for me to be upset with her for being, in my opinion, a little tactless?\n\nTL;DR ex and I broke up in August. I still hang out with her, and her new boyfriend, but sometimes get irrationally angry/jealous when they're being cute together.",

      "description": "First let me say this happened when I was 18, I am 22 now. I started a job and quickly became friends with one of my coworkers and we began to hang out (no romantic feelings). Anyway flash forward 6 months he goes to Disneyland for the weekend but ends up in the hospital when he comes back. When I talk to him he tells me he got some bad pot and had a really bad high; this struck me as odd because back then, you could only smoke medicinally in CA and while he had a card the shops were regulated so I didn't think something bad could get in. Anyway over the next month it comes out that it was not pot that ended him in the hospital but meth (which to point out he was 22 at the time so he was old enough to know) He had continued meth when he came back and began drinking at work which of course got him fired. He went to rehab and I didn't hear from him for another 3 months til a Facebook message with him apologizing to me. While I appreciated the apology I had no interest in rekindling our friendship nor was I forgiving because I didn't want to get mixed  up with that. I was also in the middle of a nasty breakup and to be honest didn't want to deal with it. Long story short I ended up hurting his feelings immensely by not forgiving him, and he blocked me on all social media and my number. A year goes by and I decide to try and reach out to him to no avail. It has been another two years and despite making another account I can't find him, so even if I wanted to apologize I can't. I won't ever condone that behaviour but being older I now understand mental health and addiction better and feel terrible that I can't make amends. AITA for not forgiving him when I had the opportunity?",

I lost control of my car after the back tire blew out and totaled my car. My parents are having to pay $500 in damages and I feel like shit but I’m having trouble with taking all the blame. \n   \nTo start my dad originally got the car for $50 not $50,000 but $50 from a stranger who bought a car from his dealership. After that it was stolen for a bit and during that my brother wrecked his car so he got mine and I was left with Uber. Which would’ve been ok if he hadn’t completely trashed the car while he had it, he’d do donuts in parking lots, hot box it constantly, and he even got in a few minor accidents. By the time I got the car their were 23 problems in the transmission alone and it couldn’t go on highways because it couldn’t go fast enough. I still loved having a car though and all the freedom that came with it. \n\nThen came two days ago. While avoiding the freeways I went down a backroad that they warned me about but like I said the car can’t make it on the freeway. I was on my way to my friends house when I hear this screeching noise coming from my car and before I know it I’m being helped out by some Good Samaritans who heard the crash. \n\nThe crash itself wasn’t that bad but my car was in pieces and I got pretty beat up (the airbags didn’t go off) I was just thankful to be alive but my parents won’t let me forget that the crash was all my fault and that after I buy myself a new car that I owe them the money back. Which is gonna be hard because I now have to get a job within walking distance from my house, still I get it. I told them that I’ll take full responsibility for the crash as long as they recognize that they’re to blame for some of the elements that went into it. They dismissed me completely and continue to act like I’m just some dumb teenager trying to shift the blame.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I don't really know if this belongs here but I want to know if I'm crazy. Here's some backstory:\n\nI started dating my bf this past December. He works as a landscaper and there's a guy, who we'll call Joe, that he has worked with for years and is friends with. Bf doesn't drive so when we spend time together I pick him up. Landscapers obviously can't work when it's raining a lot or has rained too much. When that happens bf sometimes stays over at my house. Sometimes Joe will call bf a lot. I thought it was a little weird but no big deal. Joe is also bf's ride to and from work. Okay, with that out of the way, here's the story. \n\nBf was sick and took days off work. He wanted to stay at my house so he came. Joe messaged me to see if bf was with me. Bf went back to work and found out that Joe had told their co-workers that bf was staying out of work just to be with me. We were very upset by this because that's not what happened. Bf told me that he got that straightened out and that is how he is.\n\nSo then bf ended up with the flu not long after so he was out of work a few more days. Joe messaged me again looking for bf. Bf was at home and had been sleeping because HE HAD THE FLU and wasn't even answering my calls, but I told him I would tell bf to call. Bf told me that Joe had called him many times which pissed bf off because Joe didn't have any real reason for calling other than to bug him because Joe was at work and bf was at home asleep. Joe told bf that if he wasn't at work the next day then he didn't need to come back at all. He really thought bf was with me and not sick. Bf was pissed. He called his boss and everything was fine.\n\nBf and I planned a date night one Wednesday night. Bf mentioned it and Joe had made a comment about me buying bf a truck would stay with me. That hit me the wrong way and I told bf that  Joe acted like I wanted bf to lose his job.\n\nYesterday was my birthday. I've been on a weight loss program since October and I've lost 73 pounds. I am so proud of myself and told myself if I stuck with it and done well I would take my birthday off work, with no kids, and do something for myself.  I asked bf in late January if he could come and his boss oked it. We had a great time! I was looking at my Facebook notifications this morning and saw that there was something from Joe. I find it and it said, \"happy birthday when can I have my helper back lol\" On my freaking birthday! I don't know why this upset me so much but it did. Bf sees it and tells him that he needs to stop saying things like that because it bothers me and makes me feel like he hates me.\n\nI just feel like Joe is acting like an overprotective mother that's afraid someone is trying to take her baby away or even like a jealous person with a crush. I just don't understand why he acts that way or why it bothers me so much. That's about all I can think of right now. So, now I ask you all.......Am I the asshole???",

      "description": "AITA for getting my feelings hurt for something my sick MIL is (or isn’t) doing? \n\nSome backstory: My BF and I have been living at my MILs house for a couple of months while the house we bought together is being renovated. About a month ago, she was having trouble breathing and went to the hospital. While at the hospital, we visited her and got her anything she needed. One day she said she wanted us to bring her pills that were by her bed to help her sleep. We bring the pills. \n\nJust to be sure she can take them, we checked with the doctor to make sure these pills won’t interfere with anything she’s already getting.  She was furious. Tried to rip the pills out of my boyfriends hand. Starts yelling and saying all kinds of hurtful things about my boyfriend (that she knows will bother him), that we don’t love her, and when I try to say something she tells me to leave her family alone. We end up leaving the hospital with her yelling even though the doctor told her she was approved to get the same pills but it has to given to her by the hospital. \n\nFast forward to when she comes home: She keeps her distance from us. We keep our distance because there was no apology or thank you after we cleaned the whole house from top to bottom so she can come home to a clean, sterile environment.  She’s still not fully recovered or back to her old self and after a while, my boyfriend puts their differences aside and tries to be there for her. I talk to her here and there. \n\nOne thing he’s always done and expected from me as well is kissing his mom on the cheek before we leave the house and when we come back home. I used to do it before but stopped after the whole situation. Since she’s still not back to normal, I try to start doing it again but when I kiss her on the cheek now I get the cold shoulder. She turns her head away from me and doesn’t kiss me back. You ever tried to kiss or hug someone and they obviously didn’t want it? That feeling. \n\nWhen my BF does it she kisses him back. It hurts my feelings when my kiss is obviously not wanted and so I stop doing it. It ruins my mood and my boyfriend is upset that I don’t do it anymore, that she’s sick and I should put my feelings aside. Am I the asshole? ",

We are currently still living together in the apartment complex that I am working at. \n\nLiving with my ex (which is actually more peaceful than living with my gf) has eaten away at me for quite some time. I threatened to quit my job and move out a couple months ago during an argument, and she begged me for a month so that she can find a new job and relocate out of state. It's now going on two, and while she's made some progress, I can't stay here forever. She's selfish and manipulative. I'm doing my best to be the better person and give her time to sort her shit out, but I'm just about at the end of my rope. My hours got cut again at work and I'm just barely making bills work as it is. I've had a place to live lined up for the past 2 months.\n\nIf I were to quit my job, she'd have 7 days to vacate the apartment. I can't shake the feeling that I'd be the asshole for leaving like that. Tell me how I should feel. \n\nThanks yall.",

      "description": "A few months ago I went fully no contact with my friends. I feel as though it had been a long time coming. There were a few reasons I did it.\n\n1. They tried to show me nudes in front of my girlfriend when we went to dinner. I was just so dumbstruck by why they would even think it is a good idea. On top of that they continually would try to get me to check out girls both in front of her and not in front of her. I told them multiple times that I didn’t appreciate it but they didn’t get it.\n\n2. One member of my friend group was accused of sexual assault. I wasn’t at the party mentioned but another member of the friend group walked in on him doing it. Yet they all just kind of wrote it off and didn’t do anything about it. That really rubbed me the wrong way and made me question their morality.\n\n3. Anytime I would try to bring up issues that I had with them they would completely dismiss them and even get openly angry at me. \n\nSo with all of this I just didn’t want to put in the work to fix it anymore. But at the same time I worry that I might have been to rash and maybe should have given them another chance. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "First I will say that in many ways my girlfriend(39) treats me(37) better than most of my exes have. We met in high school and dated for awhile. I then moved out of state and the long distance thing didn’t work for us. We both moved on and had numerous relationships. I was married for 15 years she had 2 marriages lasting 14 years total. \n\nAbout a year ago we ran into each other and things kinda picked up were they left off. Within weeks she moved in with me and things were going good for awhile. Then shit got weird. She lets her dad control almost every aspect of her life. He tells her how and when to do almost everything. \n\nShe has since started distancing herself from her dad. Now that she has been around my family and sees how a normal family acts with each other. \n \nMy big issue is her talking to her ex a lot. I have told her it bothers me and she says she understands. But if he calls instead of asking him what he needs she will have a 30-45 minute phone conversation with him. They have no children or property together. She has lied to me about them talking and I have seen her deleting text messages between them before. \n\nThere are never any sexual undertones to their calls or texts. \n\nShe also has a “brother” that lives out of state that calls often 4-7 times a day and then texts constantly. \n\nShe allows her friends to be blatantly disrespectful to me as well without saying anything to them “oh that’s just how she is”\n\nI have a child with my ex and keep any calls or texts child related and never delete anything off my phone. \n\nAnd not that any of them have but if any of my friends disrespected her I would have to seriously consider if I want that friendship to last. \n\nSo AITA for considering ending this relationship?",

      "description": "The dog across the street from me is often neglected and abused by her owner. She is kept on the chain 18 hours a day, all day, with barely any food or water. When it rains, she doesn’t even have a shelter. She’s skinny, malnourished, and starving for attention and love. It’s incredibly sad, but the owner has proven interest in keeping her, which is why animal control doesn’t give a shit. My parents have called animal control numerous times, so has many of the other neighbors. I do want to see her rescued and given a new home.\n\nMy parents called a pit bull place a few hours away from us, and they have expressed interest in taking her, but they can’t come here. My parents planned to kidnap her and drive her the three hours. But since my neighbor has cameras, they did this in the middle of the night. At 4:30 in the morning they took the dog off the leash, put her in the car, and are currently taking her to a pit bull friendly shelter three hours away. \n\nPersonally, I don’t like this plan. Not only is it illegal to kidnap a dog that isn’t yours, but it’s stupid. The guy is an angry drunk and has assaulted people before just because of noise complaints. He has a history of violence, and I’m afraid that once he sees through my parents’ faulty plan and thin lies, someone in my family is going to get hurt. I suggested the shelter people come here and get the dog themselves, or go through animal control by saying they have proof the owner is neglecting the dog. Everybody shot down those ideas. Everybody involved wanted to go along with the kidnapping plan, everyone except me.",

      "description": "My wife and I have been rebuilding our lives over the past 7 months after my failed business and year long separation which was very close to divorce, but ultimately resulted in us giving it another chance. We have 2 young kids and our family dynamic is very important to both of us. A big goal for both of us has been to get our savings in a spot where we can buy a home for our family and get out of the apartment that has so much baggage so that we can enter into the next phase of our lives. \n\nAbout 6 weeks ago I started a new job. It was a tough decision, since I had to leave some unvested stock at my old job which would have gone a long way toward a down payment on a house and I would need to get a car for the new job. I negotiated a big signing bonus and higher salary to account for the cost of switching jobs and getting a car.  My wife and I agreed together that I should take the job. \n\nNow I have been paid the bonus and a huge amount of income tax was taken out, which has convinced my wife that it was the wrong decision to take the new job. The math did not work out in the way that we hoped. Once this became a very heated issue, I thought about the stock at the old job and realized that tax would have been taken out of it as it vests also, so we didn’t have as much there as we thought either, but I haven’t shared that part with her yet. \n\nI think it was still a good move to take this higher paying and bigger opportunity of a job, but she is convinced that I am selfish and shouldn’t be trusted since I didn’t get our savings account the the balance we were expecting and it is going to take us longer to save for the down payment than we expected. I’d like to have a productive conversation about it but am giving her some time to calm down because she’s not herself right now. Am I the asshole?",

I have always had plans to have a large guest list, so we agreed early on that we would have a no +1 rule except for married and engaged couples, and guests that aren't family should be kept to only ones we are genuinely close with.\n\nWell it turns out my boyfriend didn't realise how many people I had planned to invite, and it GREATLY outnumbers his list of guests. My boyfriend has about 6 people on his list to invite, I have over 100 lined up. He has on his list his parents, and 4 of his friends. \n\nHe has never been good and making friends, and has pretty much only had his 4 friends throughout his life. None of his friends are married, or engaged, or have kids. 2 of his friends have short term girlfriends, 1 is single, and the other has been with his girlfriend for about a year.\n\nMy boyfriend asked if we could ignore the rule for his friends, so that they would be more comfortable, and also to have more people he knows on his side (he is friends with all of these girls, but not close enough that they would be considered as individual guests). My answer was no, because it's not fair to guests on my side. We agreed I would think it over before making a definitive choice, so I haven't said no for sure yet.\n\nWIBTA if I said no? I have friends who have longer relationships who aren't getting a +1, and I don't think it would be fair to bend the rules for a couple of people, and not the rest.",

At some point I ended up being the only person ringing people up at our registers and I get to this lady who is insisting that I totalled up her items wrong. I tried to show her how the clearance items she bought were discounted on her receipt, and even totalled up her purchase on a manual calculator in front of her. She insisted that it was still wrong. At this point, I have a long line forming behind this woman and people are getting impatient. Then she tried to accuse me of being \"racist against Mexicans\" which, would be dumb because I am literally half Hispanic. I am fairly light-skinned, but still. I told the lady this, and then she called me a \"fucking faggot\" (I am also fairly butch) and I said \"excuse me???\" And she repeated what she said. So I told her \"get the fuck out of my store\" \n\nThen she says that I can't talk to her like that, but I just told her that it was HER who couldn't talk to ME like that and then I handed her purchase to her and told her to leave again. \n\nAm I the Asshole for being so brash?

      "description": "My partner and I have been fighting a lot lately. There are plenty of reasons why, but the most concerning to him is that we don't spend enough time together. We both work full time, similar shifts ( just off by a few hours). The problem is that I go to school full-time, too. He knew when we got together that I am going to school. He knew I am aiming for a difficult degree that requires a lot of my time. I've made it clear to him in the past how important this is to me because I've put it off for so long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn our most recent fight he brought up again that we don't spend enough time together. I realize it's not an ideal amount of time, but there isn't much to be done about it. I  honestly think considering how busy I am, we spend a decent amount of time together. Dinner almost every night together before I get into homework, I try to take breaks based on when he'll be home, etc. I'm in the last year and half of my degree and classes are only getting harder, meaning I need to spend more time doing homework. I tell him I give him every spare minute I can, but homework comes first. He suggests that I lighten my workload (take fewer classes). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am absolutely floored by this. I think it's an extremely selfish thing for him to ask of me. I tell him so, and absolutely not, it's non-negotiable. I refuse to take fewer classes because he can't cope with the amount of time I do have for him. Honestly I was so blown away that he would even suggest it, I lost my temper a bit. I didn't say the above things in the nicest tone. He surprised that I didn't take that suggestion well and said that he thought that it wasn't that crazy of an idea because he thought the relationship was more important to me than that, and is making me out to be the asshole in this whole thing. I've refused to talk about this any further with him because I just won't take fewer classes because he needs more of my attention. So, AITA?",

      "description": "Okay, the title seems a bit mundane. I was friends with these 2 girls (Me, 13M) They constantly mocked me and made fun of me and everything. It got to a point where I was afraid to talk to them in fear of being made fun of or yelled at or degraded. So, I was pretty sad one day, for the reasons above, and this girl from a different friend group came up to me and asked if I was okay and that she missed my happy and goofy self. The next day, she asked if I was alright again, and she invited me to their group. This was only about 3 weeks ago btw. I didn't join, because I still considered girl 1 and girl 2 friends. But today, it got to a point where I finally had enough of their shit and I got up and left their table and sat on the table the girl above invited me to.  \n\n\nNow it is this afternoon. I texted girl 1 that I was on the verge of happy tears and that I was done with both of them, and that I made insanely better friends, and that I was tired of being mocked and made fun of, and I called them toxic. She then went absolutely batshit insane and slandered my name among old friends(Not the ones I made today) and she told me to fuck off over instagram and she said she wants me to get the fuck out of her life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "My gf still lives at home and so do I. We are both 20 but we haven't been able to afford moving out. I love her and think she's the one, but..\n\nI have a pretty good situation at home. My girlfriend? Not so much. Her parents fight every day, they're poor (actually so poor they had to borrow money from her). They mentally abuse her pretty often as well- they don't know it (I hope) but if she told them they do they'd just say \"Well that's how we talk so you better get used to it\"(they're that kind of people).\n\nBecause of their situation and their crippling marriage, their language is pretty harsh and they get offended easily. Any inconvience becomes a huge problem and it's usually my girlfriend's \"fault\".\n\nThey're pretty nice to me and have only been mad at me once (because I didn't take any photos at a party- sorry I was too focused making it a good party). But they're not nice to my girlfriend, who works really hard to help them. A lot of the time she can't come over because she's busy taking care of her brother (5yo), the dogs or the house. So she always asks me to come over.\n\nI'm getting tired of coming over to take care of their house, kid and dogs. I don't get paid and all I want is to spend time with my girlfriend. I'm okay with helping out with the dishwasher or laundry, especially if some of it is mine. But I'm not their personal gardener or babysitter.\n\nThe atmosphere at the house is horrible. Everyone is angry and my girlfriend feels like shit and cries every day because of it. She often gets shit from her parents for stuff that's their fault.\n\nTheir house is too small for that many people, and they hoard. It's not the kind of hoarding you see in movies, but there's too much stuff everywhere. A lot of spaces would be open, but they're full of boxes and bags with stuff. The kitchen table is always full of mail, dishes and general stuff. Same goes for every space such as tables, counter tops and the tops of boxes. There's shit everywhere. Any time you turn a corner you're bound to tear something down.\n\nThe cherry on top: they have two dogs. One is mostly potty trained. He's about 5 years old. The other is a puppy and he's forgetting all his training because they never practice. He's been peeing inside for a year now. Some parts of the house smell like pee because of it. They don't have time to train him and when they do have time they don't. He also eats a lot of shoes and other things, since he doesn't get any stimulation.\n\nThe dogs don't get a lot of walks and don't get fed a lot. Especially the puppy needs long walks since he's a big dog with lots of energy. I don't like leaving my stuff outside my girlfriend's room since I'm scared it'll get eaten/peed on.\n\nI don't like feeling bad and don't like seeing it. I get frustrated and depressed because of the state of the house and the atmosphere.\nMy gf is not at all like her family. \n\nAITA for not wanting to spend time there?",

      "description": "Ok, long story. I help my parents with a ton when they ask, in fact, between my older brother and I, it's usually me that goes out of my way to help. However, when I can't, they tend to try and guilt trip and yell. My mother has been having eye problems, and has to go see a doctor in another town, due to a bad infection. Full disclosure, she claims she can lose her eye if it isn't treated. Though she tends to exaggerate, a lot, about things, I don't know if this is one of those times or not. Also, my parents have an upcoming vacation to Texas, this is important later.\n\nI live in the middle of Illinois, and we've had some very cold weather lately, and many have been calling off work. Well, I'm working a 12am to 8am shift this week, and I have a new position I just got not even 2 weeks ago. I was told that taking a point in my new positions probation period of 1 month is not a good idea, and I'm also almost to a year without taking an attendance point. If I make the year, any and all points I have will be removed. My father also works here.\n\nMy mother asked me last night to take her, claims she has no one else to take her. I tell her I have a really chance of being forced over for another 8 hours, as they've forced all the others in my level of position the past 2/3 days due to weather call offs, so I'm at the top of the list. Leaving after a force is also a point. The appointment is at 1pm, and 12-8's are my hardest shift, because I have sleeping troubles as is, but trying to sleep during the day is very hard for me. I usually get off at 8am very tired, but she wants me to get off work, go home, (nearly a 30 minute drive itself), shower, eat, then drive her an hour to another town, be there however long the appointment is, and drive an hour back. A nap beforehand is not gonna be possible, I know my body, I'll either not be able to get to sleep, or I'll sleep right through any alarms. By the time we get back, I'll have very little time relatively to sleep, get up, eat, and drive to work, then be able to stay up all night. \n\nNow they are mad at me, my dad is furious because I guess he has to take a vacation day off to take her, and that cuts their Texas vacation short, (I assume 1 day off their 2 weeks they planned to be there). Idk why they didn't ask my brother, and I don't feel they can use the excuse that he will be working, because this has just as much to do with my job too.\n\nAITA for not risking my job to take my mom to her appointment?

He had not brushed his teeth in over 48 hours and tried to cuddle with me. I pushed him away and told him I found it unattractive to not brush his teeth. \n\nThis turned into an argument where I told him unless he brushed his teeth every day there would be no kissing. I feel justified because I brush my teeth twice a day every day without fail and I quit smoking for him a few years back because he found it gross, though it's good for my health. \n\nHe told me I was nagging him and that if it was so important he would do so and angrily apologized, he explained that sometimes he forgets and feels lazy and doesn't do it. He only brushes his teeth once a day as is, so this is very noticeable. \n\nUsually he never goes that long without, skipping a day then brushing the next and would brush at my request if we were to have sex or cuddle and what naught. I never hardlined him until today  because it got to what is in my opinion an absurd length of time to go without brushing. And I'd asked him to work on that kindly in the past.

There were some candy wrappers in there and those were gone too, so I think they tossed it out because they thought it was trash, not looking inside the card.

Still, $200 isn't chump change, no matter who you are.  It's not the first time they've thrown out things that I need, but this is a whole new level.

      "description": "Bit of backstory, in order for it to make a bit more sense, in 2010 I moved to the U.S. from Venezuela, just me my mom, brother, and sister. My biological dad and my mom divorced when we were young so the whole impact of it didn't really phase me as I still saw my bio dad every week.\n\nWell after moving to a whole different country, the relationship between my bio dad and I has obviously weakened among the years. There's the usual birthday calls or New Years greetings, but besides that, just small talk every other month or so. Though with these monthly messages always come passive aggressive talks that almost guilt trip me into having a relationship with him. Don't get me wrong, he will always have a spot in my heart as he is my bio dad, but now I have a step dad that I see everyday and bond with daily and love very much. But these messages my bio dad sends me are infuriating, almost as he wants me to talk to him not out of willingness but as \"I'm your dad talk to me\".\n\nThese messages always go something like this \"Hey Tazze24 I just wanted to say hi and see how you're doing?\" \"Oh, everything is going well\" \"Well Tazze24 I'm so happy, that's good\". Now reading aggressiveness through text is tough and this was all translated from Spanish to English so there's definitely some variation, but I think you get the point. Now I certainly know that the \"I'm so happy, that's good\" was not actually suppose to be nice is because after that, he messaged me about how he wanted to talk to me more and how he and my brother talk all the time. But personally, I don't really want to talk to him daily and have conversations, I just don't really need him to be a father figure anymore.\n\nI don't know, maybe I am the asshole in this situation... It's just annoying being constantly guilt tripped into talking to him more.",

      "description": "I was at a restaurant where the bathrooms are single stalls. The doors are wooden with textured glass, like the door to a principals office. I was using the restroom (bottoms exposed!) when someone rattled the handle, pulled and pushed it and then pressed their face against the glass to look inside. It was a kid, and I could make out his face clearly so I’m guessing he could likely see me? \n\nWhen I got out, the kid was waiting outside. Before he went in, I said “If the restroom is occupied, please don’t try to peek in.” And he stuttered out a “Sorry I didn’t know” before his mom (who was sitting at the table right outside the stall) turned around and started yelling at me. She said “How do you know it was him? It’s frosted glass he can’t see anything, and he’s 10 by the way so I don’t know what you - an adult - are implying.”\n\nShe got all in my face and was extremely defensive that I, a stranger, was telling her kid to not peep on women in the restroom. I don’t know if he was being a little creep, or if he’s being a kid and doesn’t know what’s okay and what’s not okay yet. She then said he walked away to check another bathroom, and that maybe some adult man did it and maybe I should go find him to yell at him.\n\nI left the situation because I wasn’t trying to engage with her or cause a scene. Later my fiancé told me he saw the kid do the same thing to another bathroom door as he passed by. \n\nAnyway, given that she was sitting right there, I’m guessing she saw his behavior. I don’t know if she said anything to him or not but her reaction felt completely out of line to me. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying anything to the kid at all?",

(no offense to hollister)\n\nThe first one was at my birthday party 2 weeks ago. I had it at Round One with bowling and karaoke. B was just being straight-up rude: bowling gutters for everyone, hitting people in the neck as a \"joke\", and went so far to throw his drink at T1 but missed and hit F and got his sweatshirt stained. And then B complains about having these fingerprints on his hollister shirt. He started fights during the party as well. I did say some things to him, like stop bullying everyone you dumbie and fuck off tho\n\nFast forward to a few hours later, at my house cause I wanted to have a slepover with my friends. B says to me that he didnt want anyone touching his stuff so I told T1,T2, and F and theywere perfectly fine with that. We wanted to play super smash ultimate but B didnt even want to talk to us. All he did was hook up his xbox into my monitor, and played minecraft the whole time. The only time he went out was to try to talk, but then a fight happened. He started saying a girl (that was pretty much a little sister to me) was super annoying and childish. I told him to f off but then the argument gets to a point) that we told him to stop braggin about his Hollister and B said stuff about influencing the whole school to wear Hollister which isnt true cuz my cousin got me hollister but whatever\n\nI kinda feel like Im not a good friend cause i didnt try to mend bridges or anything I just let it be\nAnd.. now the final part\nIf you arrive before school starts, you sit in the gym on the bleachers, and i was sitting close to B (note that Im on a soccer team outside of school and made and the school soccer and volleyball team. B made the soccer team by the slimmest chance and got cut for volleyball) I was asking my other friend if he wanted to come to my volleyball game and this happened:\n\nB- So you think youre better than us cause you made the volleyball team? \nMe- No, Im just asking my friend if he wants to see my game.\nB- Ya know, your just lazy you dont run at all in soccer your a goalie and you dont do anything in volleyball (note that im kind of overweight 5'4 150 lbs)\nMe- Just because you can do lacrosse doesnt mean that whatever I do isnt healthy\nB- yeah but you arent moving at all youre just standing there.\nAnd then I called him a dick and walked away \nI then see him talking to T1 afterschool asks if I was \"still hung up on calling me lazy\" to which i flipped him off and walked away\nT1, T2, and some other friends also told me that hes been talking bad about me, although I did do the same to him\nSo, strangers of Reddit, should I mend bridges cause Im TA or is B TA?",

      "description": "I’ve (25m) been with my gf(22f) for 3 months official, seeing each other for 7 mos before then. \n\nWhen we got together, i told her one of my boundaries is i dont date girls still friends with their exes or are still in contact with anyone with whom they have sexual history. She assured me she feels the same; however she said she is still in contact with her ex she lost her virginity to. She said they hooked up for a month and since then they remained friends and he has a gf too at this point. She asked me if this would be acceptable, i told her my boundaries are just that and if she does not feel comfortable with them, we should not go further. She agreed.\n\nThis weekend while showing me some snaps, i saw his name with a smiley beside it indicating they’re “best friends” on snapchat. This means they communicate alot. I found it interesting how his name never pops up on her notifications so i asked her to show me the options beside his name and behold his chats are set to “do not disturb”. I also found it interesting how she communicates with him only through snap chat.\n\nI told her she betrayed my trust by continuing communication with him in secret after saying she wouldnt as she “respected and accepted my boundaries”. I told her the trust is now gone between us and packed her stuff and sent her off.\n\nWas i the asshole?\n\nTldr: broke up with gf when she continued secret communication with an ex after agreeing she wont",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my boyfriend of 3 years \"because it was long distance?\"",
      "description": "Hello everyone, this is my first post to Reddit. I've been lurking on this sub for a while and have been wanting to ask this for a while because I still feel bad about it.\n\nSo, context. I (22F) had been dating my boyfriend (28M) for about 3 years, basically since I started college. We got to know each other and were flirting back when I was still in high school, before making it official when I was a bit into college. It was long distance; I went to college about 2.5 hours away from his home. Despite seeing each other only once a week, it was a pretty great relationship. We were really built on trust and communication, and it was perhaps the first time I was really in love.\n\nFast forward to this past December. He came to visit my family, and while he was here, was talking about a big YouTube animation project he was working on. He was very excited about it, telling my parents about it, even showing us a few episodes. One of the things he said was that he was a voice actor for this project, and played a specific character. After he left, my sister made a comment that it didn’t sound like his voice. I listened a few times. Sure enough, it wasn’t. Cue spiraling, “was any of it real” questioning myself, and a depression nap. I knew he was dealing with something at home, so I waited until he was done and sent him a message like “We need to talk” or something. We had a Skype call that was very tearful on both ends where I explained what’d happened and why it’d upset me. He told me that it was a mistake, he really had thought he’d gotten the part, and when he realized that he didn’t, he didn’t correct himself. I told him I needed a couple days to think about it and our relationship.\n\nSo I realized a few things: he’d met my parents several times but I still hadn’t met his (though in fairness they live in Australia right now), most of our mutual friends were my friends (I had met his friends once for a D&amp;D game), and that both of those things are probably because we live so far apart. In the Skype call I told him I was breaking up with him because I couldn’t do long distance anymore. He was really shocked. Our relationship had been going so amazing and this was the first big problem we’d had, and it was because of one dumb little mistake it had fallen apart. I assured him it wasn’t because of the lie but the distance.\n\nApparently, he has an anxiety problem where he thinks one little mistake will make everything come crashing down, and me breaking up with him will just contribute to that. Right after our breakup he was really depressed and had to seek a counselor again. So, I’m here to ask: AITA for leaving my boyfriend after our first big problem? (Sidenote: I probably won’t change my decision since our breakup is three months out, I just want to know if I’m the asshole.)\n\nTL;DR: Bf of 3 years accidentally lied about a project he worked on, I broke up with him after this even though it was our first real argument “because of the distance,” AITA?",

      "description": "I’m not exactly sure how to word this, so forgive me. Basically, my ex (we’ll call her Alyss) and I had been dating for around 6 months and she broke up with me very suddenly recently.\n\nEverything seemed to be going well, but some background might be helpful. Alyss has some ongoing health issues that affect her life, and she also has a very intensive and stressful job. Recently, that stress from work has taken a toll on her mental health and Alyss told me she would be seeking out a therapist. I fully supported this, figured that she knows her own mind better than anyone and that if she felt she needed help, seeking it was a really healthy idea. As far as her ongoing phyisical health issues, I’ve always tried to be available and help her as much as possible. Overall, it never played a massive role in the relationship but we took it one day at a time and were very conscious of any health issues springing up. As far as the relationship goes, we get along well and haven’t had any majors fights. We have had some disagreements but we always made sure to view it as “us vs. the problem” rather than fighting each other.\n\nI don’t want to veer off topic, so to get more to the point; we’ve been away from each other for about 2 weeks due to some conflicts with work that weren’t avoidable. We weren’t overly bothered by it, so it seemed, but we missed each other. We have been discussing moving in together so we were definitely committed to this. Being apart was just a small hurdle that work was throwing at us.\n\nThe day we were going to see eachother again/work would be back to normal, Alyss asked if she could call me to talk. Over a 5-ish minute conversation in which she sounded distraught and tearful, she said that this couldn’t work. She informed me that work was too busy, and that her mental health was in a very bad place. So Alyss broke up with me. I told her that I understood and that I only wanted what was best for her; I genuinely do think that someones wellness, physical and mental, should come before most things.\n\nNevertheless, I’m hurt. Our relationship was good. We were committed and I love her and we planned on moving in together. I respect her decision and want happiness for her but I feel like I’ve been thrown away like something unwanted. She just did this in a short phone call and we’ve not spoken much at all since. Would I be the asshole for confronting this and telling her how I feel? I feel so small and a bit stupid right now. I know her mental health is not good and I feel like I might add to it and be an asshole if I bring this up at all. Maybe I should let this thing go, I don’t want to talk her into getting back together at all, especially right now. I guess I just want closure.\n\nThanks everyone. Sorry for the long post.",

I was acquainted with them, but I never spent much time with them or anything. I thought of girl A as more of a friend. She was happy and usually kind to me. Girl B was gloomy and not as nice as girl A. They dated and, over time, both expressed attraction to me. Girl A did it first, going as far as to send me lewd messages, but I liked her as a person so I just smiled and went on with life, not looking to peruse her or anything. I'd still say hi to her and I acted like nothing had changed. Girl A would sometimes tell me about problems she was having with Girl B, how she said Girl B felt cold to her. Not long after, Girl B said that she liked me as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what did I do? I told Girl B that I liked her back. I told her I'd be with her if she left Girl A and she did it pretty quickly. The next day, I hear from Girl A that she was dumped and I was sure to console her and take her side, playing Girl B out as a bitch. Needless to say, I never followed up with dating Girl B. I never had interest in either of them, but I wanted to end what I felt was a shitty relationship while helping the person I liked and throwing the one I didn't under the bus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't hear much from Girl A after that. Girl B loathed me, entering a gothic/emo phase up until I graduated and never saw or heard from her again.",

For background, I also knew from talking to her that her boyfriend was also Jewish and they have been together since college (so 2.5 years at least).\n\nWe had a departmental event and she brought her child and the man I thought was her boyfriend, since he was in her profile picture. He was also wearing a Yamaka so I doubly thought it was her boyfriend. Now here's the thing, her baby was clearly half black, and this dude was just as white as she is. I was curious so I facebook stalked her and found an old profile picture with a black guy who looks just like the kid.\n\nI wasn't trying to start shit or anything, I didn't say anything to her or the guy obviously, especially because the kid was with them. I asked a group of other students, who I'm friends with, if her boyfriend was sure the baby was his, as a joke. The girls in the group got really upset with me and told me that the guy was her brother and the black guy I found on facebook was her boyfriend. They accused me of \"jumping to sexist conclusions.\" Again, I wasn't trying to start anything and I didn't say anything to the girl and it's not like I could've known the guy was her brother, I was just making a joke. The girls in the group won't talk to me now and I'm worried this is going to start a whole thing if they tell the girl what I said. AITA?",

It started when BF (who I am still friends with to this day) was getting picked on by B, B was shoving him, teasing him, just being a downright asshole, so when I come over to see what’s happening, B punches me in the face, tackles me to the floor and starts berating me with racist slurs. \n\n\nBF tried to shove B off of me, but didn’t manage to budge him off. He was wailing on my face with fists and kicks. I probably wouldn’t be here today typing this if the bell hadn’t rung. At that point he had to get off of me. So he did, but right before leaving he just grins at me.\n\n\nBF and I rush immediately to the principal. My T was also there photocopying some pages in the office. BF and I start telling them what happened, my teacher was a very nice lady, strict but not to strict and actually dealt with issues. But this time she was fuming, for this bully was infamous in our school, so they immediately believed us. They then check CCTV\njust to make sure and you can clearly see me getting knocked the fuck up. They really didn’t have to do that because I had a bloody nose, black eye and busted lip. \n\n\nI went to the nurses as both my and his parents were rung about what happened. I go home early because of the injuries but he has to stay to deal with it. \n\nSince I went home, I wasn’t in the rest of the story, but my friend told me what happened the next day. What happened was, it turns out he was suspended for 2 weeks. He had been suspended before but never this long. He was crying, begging not to be suspended. But his time was long gone.  \n\n\nWhen the suspension was over, he changed dramatically. He started doing worse in school, he started getting bullied himself and he would occasionally breakdown in front of the class.\n\n\nHe had already been diagnosed with ODD, ADHD and OCD before the incident. But after this, the symptoms become much more severe.\n\n\nHe’d always look at me with a death stare and only take his stare off me if he was asked a question. I felt like I was in the wrong in the situation, I still feel in the wrong. Could somebody please give me advice?\n\n\n",

He didnt know what the big deal was, that it was \"harmless, everyone gets it, its painless and just makes your eye pink\" and stuff like that. The argument ended with him making me feel bad cause he said, \"I cant believe you would cancel a special day for us over something so small. Im hurt.\" \n\nNow I feel like an asshole for cancelling.

      "description": "Hi Reddit!\n\nPosting from my throwaway account. \n\nSo, my mom is generally a very nice person. My dad divorced us a few years ago, yet he does his Fatherly duties. We still hang out and Father/Son bonding things together. I love them both to the moon.  My mom currently has a boyfriend, who is like a second father to me.\n\nNow, since I was a little kid, my parents had issues. This made my mom sleep in my room with me and my dad in his room. I was quite young and I don't remember any of this. Fast forward to the divorce, she still sleeps in my room and my dad moved out. The Divorce happened in 2010, and I was 10 years old then. \n\nWhen it came to 2013-ish, I felt quite uncomfortable with her sleeping in my room. I gently asked her to go sleep in the vacant Master Bedroom in our house. She denied and continued sleeping in my bed. \n\nThen in 2015, I had enough. By this time, I've noticed more of my friends sleep in their rooms alone and I wanted to do so too. I asked her continuously to leave my bedroom and sleep in her own room. FYI, her boyfriend sleeps in that room whenever he's over. She sleeps there sometimes, but mostly in my bed. I kept asking her and finally, mid 2016, she moved. \n\nNow, it's 2019. I'm almost 19 in a few months, and she still brings up the issue, like she's still salty about it. Even my relatives agree, and she says \"until I moved out to marry your dad, my two brothers and my parents all slept in two large king sized beds. I don't see why we can't sleep in one bed\". Her parents were very well off btw, no poverty issues. \n\nNot gonna lie, I feel so much more comfortable without needing to share a bed with someone, even with my mom. And ever since she left my room, I am strictly not allowed to close my room door, even if I'm on a private call with someone. I gave up caring about it years ago. I still do share the bed whenever we have a lot of guests staying over. \n\nMy relatives have been grilling me about it ever since, and I'm starting to wonder if I did wrong. AITA?",

      "description": "About a year ago my sister had her baby and after living with her child and boyfriend for a couple of months in their apartment my parents offered to swap them my brothers larger apartment (that my dad bought for him) with hers since it's a lot bigger and is located in an environment better suited for children in my city Copenhagen.\n\nSince my sister's apartment was owned by her boyfriend, and since they do not have shared economy, the way they made the move was my parents buying the boyfriend's apartment for the cooperative equity price set by the association, and it was therefore a third party setting the price. This swap was requested by my sister and her boyfriend for more space, and my parents saw it as a favor. \n\nWhile filling out the paperwork the boyfriend asked to receive whatever profit the apartment would make after we sell it in case of the association bumping up the price, but my dad declined, arguing that a sell is a sell, feeling like he was already doing them a favor.\n\nNow we are in the the situation where the association has decided to bump up the price of the apartment significantly, around 50k $. The boyfriend is expecting to  recieve this money since he otherwise feels like my parents would be stealing from family.\n\n The boyfriend's mindset is that since my parents are in the upper-upper middle class in Denmark the money would have no influence on their economy, but could do a ton for them, which is true.  \n\nFrom my parents perspective it's more of a principle of not handing out money even though my parents both regret ever doing any \"business\" with family members as it has destroyed their relationship to the boyfriend and therefore worsened it with my sister too.\n\nI'm siding with my parents in this, potentially also wrecking my relationship with my sister. Does this make me an asshole and a shitty brother? ",

      "description": "My son graduated magna cum laude from college a couple of weeks ago, and my wife left me to invite my parents and she invited hers.  Because we live closer to her parents, they rode with us in two cars for the 3 hour trip south. \n\nMy relationship with my parents is at best, \"conveniently distant\".  They are not involved with their grandchildren much at all. They rarely make an effort to drive two and a half hours to visit us, and it's always on us to make it out to their home for holidays. Once our children were in High School, my mom decided that she didn't want to exchange gifts, because she didn't know what to get them, and that shopping was too stressful. I gave her the idea of gift cards, but that was not \"thoughful enough\".   They are right wing Christians in their late sixties, and genuinely good people, but never fail to ruin a holiday gathering with their politics, light conspiracy theories and batshit opinions. They have no filter and will bait anyone into an argument or an opportunity to complain about politics, taxes, guns (talk of shooting a dog that lunged at them), and veiled racist comments. I've heard my mother complain about bike lanes in town, ffs.  I've been dealing with this for 30 years, so it's easy to tune them out; but it's exhausting to me and it is very uncomfortable for my wife and two adult children. No one wants to be around that negativity. We almost lost my wife a couple of years ago to a surgical accident, so we all know how short life is and we try to enjoy it and let each other be who they are without judgement.  We know we are flawed but we know we are all trying to just be happy. So I decided not to invite them.  It was my son's day, and a day for me and my wife to be proud of his accomplishment. I didn't want it to be soured by their bullshit.  Her parent's are not an issue; they've been divorced for twenty years recently had to deal with each other again due to the medical trauma. Somehow, they are able to behave themselves. \n\nToday, we drove out to my parents' home for the for a Christmas lunch. And the topic of graduation came up and of course it was mentioned that my wife's parents were there. I caught a couple of glances from both my parents, but ignored it. No one flat out said, \"why weren't we invited?\", but I felt that vibe.  Then, upon returning home I called my mom and let her know we got home safe, but she was very short with me.  I'm not going to hide the fact that I didn't invite them; nor will I deny if they ask, that it was my decision. So am I the asshole? \n\nTLDR: My parents are difficult to deal with, so I chose not to invite them to my son's college graduation. ",

      "description": "Ok, so some background: about one week ago my SO told me her sister is coming to visit to see their father (we live in the same city and her sister lives far away). So she arrives and only then they wonder where will she sleep since my father-in-law's home is already packed up with family members (and already was 1 week ago, so it's not like it was a surprise). So then my SO just sends me a text message saying her sister is sleeping in our house. Like a \"just informing\" message. I talk to her and explain that although I don't have any problems with her sister sleeping in our house, I didn't like the way it was organized. They knew perfectly well that there wasn't enough space for her in their father's house but only when she gets here they \"realize\" that. My SO's family has this kinda philosophy like everything is everyones, not sure how to explain it, but it's like they share/give everything (for example, several of my SO's clothes are with her sisters and vice-versa, I gave my SO a laptop and it's already with her brother, etc). I told my SO that they should've known her sister would need a place to sleep and what they did is irresponsible and manipulative. Like, she's at my door, of course I won't turn her down. But I didn't like it, I felt that it was disrespectful towards me, a total lack of consideration. My SO just says it's her family so the door is always open and I explain to her that the problem is how things were badly organized and the lack of my input and that it could even be Pope Francis that I would be bothered nevertheless. In the heat of the moment and pissed off I also said she should just make copies of our house's keys so that she could distribute them among her family and make our house everyones. So now she's calling me a jerk and that I don't have any hospitality. Bear in mind that this is not the first time this kind of thing happened with her family. They just show up, no warning, nothing, and expect us to extend the red carpet. And I'm not talking about some urgency or when something unexpected happen. I'm not used to this kind of thing. Am I being the asshole here?",

My sister on the other hand in her eyes, is a perfect angel and couldn't do anything wrong. I get along with my sister very well.\n\nI dropped out of high school because I would miss weeks at a time.

      "description": "I have a friend who I would’ve considered one of my best friends if you asked me about a year ago but recently it’s been going downhill. Let’s call her RF. \n\nLet me explain the 2nd most recent incident - my friendship group decided in December to have a bit of festivities among us and do a Secret Santa. There are five of us and we all chose the name of our gift recipient from the hat. It must be noted here that we asked everyone in the group if they wanted to do it or not - RF did not object.  After this selection, at lunch on the same day, she tells me that she’s my Secret Santa which didn’t really bother me that much- I’m not really a stickler but not going to lie - I’m probably her closest friend in the group and I kinda felt like she’s wasn’t going to try because of this. \n\nSkip to the last day before Christmas break and it’s Secret Santa time. I came into school feeling kinda hopeful that she’ll actually bring something, only to come in and for RF to say “Sorry I forgot” with fake sympathy. What’s worse is that I could tell that she didn’t even bring in anything. I walked off without even saying anything. RF then asked me at break to go with her to the canteen  so she could go buy some breakfast or something, I said I’m going to class and walked off. For the rest of the day, she didn’t apologise once  and tried to copy answers off me in Literature. She even had the audacity in that same lesson to say to me “Oh I bet you’re upset, Secret Santa is childish and let me be honest, I was never going to bring it in, I couldn’t be bothered”. \n\nSkip to last Friday now, I left the lunch hall early to go hang out with another other group of my friends because I didn’t really want to look at RF’s face if I’m being honest. I enjoyed my lunch and came back to class and a mutual friend tell me about the discussion they had in the toilet. It had stemmed off one of my friends asking “Shall I use the hand sanitiser that K712 gave me?” (It was part of my Secret Santa gift to her) My other friends say yeah but RF says “K712 gave you that?” and my friend then clarifies it was part of the Secret Santa. RF then replies “Lol that childish Secret Santa that I wasn’t a part of, I felt kind of bad haha” to which one of my friends then replied “I can’t believe you would do that to someone who you would consider one of your best friends“. She was then quiet after that.\n\nSorry for the long read, I’m just trying to think about this properly because the obvious choice seems to unfriend her which is doable but the problem is she’s written you not got any other friends outside this friendship group. This isn’t the only incident but it’s been the most obvious case of “Should I unfriend her?”  \n\nIf somebody could just give me some advice that would be helpful, Thanks in advance. \n \nTLDR: A friend has been constantly off and I don’t really want to be around her anymore. Problem is she has no friends outside of the friendship group - Cut her off?",

      "description": "CONTEXT: Ever since I (M,15) was a little kid I’ve been bullied extensively and I never had any real friends. I grew up with extreme trust issues and to this day I’m constantly scared that I’m the odd one out in every friendship group I’m in. \n\nI’m now a Sophomore in high school and I attend a youth group every Tuesday with some friends. These friends are a group of Grade 12s (Seniors) along with Sophmore and one Junior. They’ve all been a group for a little bit and I recently joined in the summer.\n\nThese friends are all really awesome and I’m especially good friends with the Junior (let’s call her E), who is the girlfriend of one of the Seniors (let’s call him C). I’ve known C since I was young, but since he’s older I didn’t talk to him much before now. We’re now good friends.\n\nAnyway, last Tuesday I had a breakdown at youth group. Me and this group were watching Hereditary and someone asked if the dog died, and asked someone to google it, so I did. They all got “mad at me” for spoiling the movie, and I got upset because they asked me to find out (I found out later they were joking). I have a social disorder and I can’t tell when someone’s being serious or not, as well as anxiety and depression, so I took it seriously. This isn’t the first time this group has made jokes making fun of me; C pretends to bully me and I’m fine with it, but I’ve started to read too much into it.\n\nLong story short, I left youth group in tears and didn’t respond to E and C’s texts asking where I went. I later returned after finally talking to E, where she told me I was only noticing the times everyone was saying things about me. I trust and love E and I don’t at all think this was gaslighting or anything, and I think I was reading too much into it. When I got back, everyone acted differently and a lot more gentle with me.\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve broken down in front of these people. I love them and I’m afraid that I’m being a toxic friend and that they feel they have to walk on eggshells around me. AITA?",

The gist of it is she didnt believe me when i tried telling her i was depressed years ago and instead of helping me i just got punished for it. She took away my bass and bass lessons until i “cheered up”. Shit like that. I also got yelled at for having anorexia \n\nThat and combined with her bipolar behaviour (things like trashing me and my siblings rooms and hitting us for things that arent our fault, then apologizing 15 minutes later with the classic “its ok mommys allowed to be mad” excuse) and in general just calling me a miserable brat pretty much every day of my life has made it so i cant be around her without almost having an anxiety attack. Shes just literally trained me to be afraid of her. \n\nSo am i a dick for telling my dad it would ruin Christmas for the entire family if she came over to his house?

Because the cousins are all adults, the family decided to only buy gifts for the youngest kids, all of which are less than 10 years old. So far, no problems. \nFamily Christmas night, and my aunt bought my mom a present. And my mom bought my aunt a present. And my aunt bought my sister and BIL a present. And my mom bought my older cousin a present. And long story short, every single person present, including my wife, was gifted something, everyone except me. Afterward I brought it up to my wife, and she told me I was acting selfish and being ridiculous, but I disagree. This never went any further than me complaining to my wife, but I've clearly never forgotten. I don't care that I didn't get a gift since it normally consists of a somewhat fake smile and fake enthusiasm. No, I didn't care about no gift, I got pissed that the family agreed no gifts, and then every single person received a gift except me. Since I haven't gotten over it, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently moved to a city a few months ago. I've brought with me two friends from where I've moved. Now, the city we moved to is pretty expensive. So we decided to split a 2 bedroom between the three of us. Myself and \"T\" both have our own rooms, while \"S\" does not. S is in the living room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was something that was discussed between all of us before moving. Originally, myself and \"T\" wanted a 3BR for the three of us, but \"S\" insisted that he is not willing to pay more than $600.00 for an apartment. He also had even tried to engage us in sharing a 1BR.   \n\n\nI was reluctant to this, but he was insisting and it was originally \"T\" and \"S\"s ideas to move down here, so I figured I didn't have any sort of leverage, so I kind of just went with it. I ended up finding the property and signing the lease alone, even though I didn't want to the only name on the lease as I wasn't sure how serious my two roommates were about moving. I discussed this with T and S, and neither were responsive, S even insisted that if T's not on the lease, then he shouldn't have to be either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, surprise, it turns out sharing a 2BR with 3 dudes is straight-ass. \"S\" who is in the living room is a total slob. Now, \"S\" didn't move down to the city with the rest of us until a few months into our lease, and at first things for me at least were pretty cool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpon S moving in with us, he decided to restructure and reorganize the entire apartment. All of the stuff that I had in shelves, moved to different areas or shoved into different closets. He also moved the entire set up of the living room around. We originally had discussed dividing up the living room and having a barrier down the middle to \"S\"s living space from the rest of the room, but he decided to instead put his bed right by the walking space from the front door. His argument is that it's providing more room for guests. Me and \"T\" both have brought up this concern, but he literally told us he does not care how we feel, that's how he's going to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, S is constantly talking about how much he wants a relationship and a girlfriend. He's consistently in a bad mood and slugging around. The three of us even got in an argument the other day because we advised him we're not really comfortable with him bringing online dates home and hooking up in the living room, especially considering there is no sort of room divider or private space for him. This is the first real argument I would say we've had together, and he threatened \"Do you want me to move out?\". I didn't respond as I wasn't expecting that sort of response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like a dick because the following :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA) I wasn't originally going to be a roommate with T and I feel I've somehow compromised a prior arrangement\n\nB) S paid rent for a couple months and didn't actually live on the property.\n\nC) I agreed to be in this situation and now I'm realizing it's not working for me.\n\nD) These are long term friends that I've had that I'm now finding it's not working for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if I'm the asshole for wanting to kick him out. I just feel pretty stressed out about the whole situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for telling a girl my close friend is hooking up with that she’s just going to end up hurt again?",
      "description": "Backstory: Good friend of mine (27M) was hanging out with this chick (26F) on and off for over a year. She really liked him, but he didn’t like her enough to want to date her. He was happy to hook up with her and get her to buy him stuff. He brought her around enough that I got to know her some... nice girl, working single mom, has some mental health issues but regardless she was always cheerful. I am not normally the “white knight” type at all, but this chick had no supportive male figures in her life, so when I saw her out around town I’d always ask how she was doing and stuff. Eventually she realizes my friend isn’t ever going to date her, she has a bit of a mental breakdown (last time I saw her she was bawling at a bar), and they stop hanging out for a few months. \n\nSo last time I spoke with her, she seemed like she was in a good place and I wished her well in her future dating. So I hang out with my guy friend last weekend and he mentions they’re back to hanging out again and it’s the same as before (he’s still not wanting to date her but likes her coming over to hook up and buying him stuff). \n\nIt bummed me out and with her mental issues I feel like she’s being taken advantage of a bit. But, they’re both adults and make their own choices and I generally stay the fuck out things like this. In all of my wisdom, I end up texting her later that I was bummed she was doing this again after how bad it ended last time, and with him still openly not wanting to date her at all. She gets upset/embarrassed that I know about it, asks my guy friend why he said anything, and subsequently guy friend gets mad at me for saying something (I wrongly assumed she would not say anything to him). \n\nI was trying to reach out to her while not being judgmental directly towards my guy friend, but now everyone is mad. This is why I normally stay out of this shit, and if it was about an actual girlfriend/fiancé/wife I would never have gone there. However, I know I would want an acquaintance to reach out to me if I were in the same situation. \n\nAm I an asshole snitch brocode breaking white knight douche? I genuinely have zero attraction to this girl, I just was bummed she was going to burn herself again. ",

      "description": "This happened a few months ago and I'm curious about the judgment this sub has on it.\n\nThe basics of it are I'm white and he is black. We disagree on that whether or not black people can be racist. He said no and I said of course they can, anyone can be racist.\n\nIt lead to a fairly heated argument and he eventually told me to disinvite him from my wedding and delete his contact information.\n\nHe stopped talking to me that day after I asked him if he really wants to go this way. We have been close friends for over a decade, but recently due to myself not being progressive enough (im just guessing, I have no idea) he had a harder time being friends with me. He said that we have a clashing of world views and couldn't go on with it, or something to that affect. Memory is a bit foggy.\n\nAnyways, my question is AITA for just letting it die like it did instead of trying to make it work again? At the time I left the choice for him to make as I didn't really want to let end just like that.\n\nAsk any questions if you have any, I left it pretty bare as I had no idea what was important for the question I had.",

      "description": "My wife and I live in a magical neighborhood where everybody knows everybody. Mostly everyone is friendly, and we have some neighbors that would truly qualify as friends - like the ones in this story. We've known these neighbors for at least 2 years, participate in activities together, have each other over for parties, and recently have even traveled over a weekend together. We've really clicked on a lot of values, conversations, and senses of humor. We all can tell some pretty raunchy jokes, and sexual innuendos abound. They're Catholic (we're not) and they have a very young baby (~3 months old).\n\nSo last weekend a mutual neighbor-friend invites my wife and I and this other couple over for dinner. The 5 of us are having a great time, making conversation and laughing, all sorts of jokes. Our host had made a cheesecake for dessert, and asked someone to whip some cream for a topping. The husband from the other couple happily obliges and quickly starts making masterbation jokes as he beats the cream (too easy, right?)\n\nAs we're eating, the other couple tells a story of how he likes to tell jokes but she often messes them up, and he proceeds to tell a joke about being embarrassed to have sex with fat girls, and then she told it how she butchered it.\n\nIn the course of conversation they mentioned how their baby slept through mass, and how the priest likes to wiggle the baby's toes on the way out the door.\n\nI must have made a face like I was holding in a fart because our host leaned over with a twinkle in her eye and said \"priest joke?\" And I said something to the effect of \"ehhh I'm just not sure they wanna get the priest started so early...\"\n\nAnd the dude said to me, seriously offended, \"you may think that that is something to joke about, but the rest of us don't find it funny at all.\"\n\nMy wife quickly and sarcastically retorted, \"Yeah, we draw the line at fat girl sex jokes\". And everyone was quiet for a few seconds while trying to regroup.\n\nThe evening lasted another 30 minutes or so, and the rest of the conversations felt forced and awkward. I've since seen the wife of the other couple and we acted like everything was fine, but I haven't seen the husband.\n\nObviously no decent human finds it funny that priests have actually been so predatory. Just like I wouldn't have found it funny if he was actually in the kitchen beating his dick into a mixing bowl on front of us. Not every joke is funny, but I feel like my joke wasn't out of line with the rest of the humor of the evening.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I ordered an item that didn’t arrive after 1 week of the estimated delivery time so I took it upon myself to report a case of an item not delivered. \nI sent a polite message asking if they could double check that they sent the item or if it has tracking. The seller didn’t reply for 3 days (granted, they’re a pretty big store). The item ended up arriving and I closed the case and left neutral feedback - 1 star for seller communication and delivery time. I then get a feedback revision request from the seller claiming that late delivery times are the postal service’s issue and that it is against Ebay policy to leave neutral/negative feedback for this. Then they threatened to leave me negative buyers feedback and list me on the ESF (idk what that is. Apparently it blocks you from looking at certain sellers’ items.) \n\nAnd here, I got pretty angry and sent a message basically throwing shade at them. In a nutshell I basically said that I left a neutral rating due to poor seller communication and that I can’t be reported for this. Then I low key threatened to report them instead if they try to retaliate with negative buyers feedback because it’s unfair (idek if you can “report” to ebay about these things tbh). They sent a message back saying they’re disappointed I couldn’t amicably resolve the issue and that they will take action detailed in their message against me. I then criticised them for not being able to take the neutral (not even negative) feedback on the chin. I told them they already have a lot of neutral/negative ratings and that it accurately reflects their services and I don’t know why they’re trying to hide it. (They have thousands of positive ratings for their store, with maybe 100 neutral and negative ratings in total.) \n\nI was kind of pissed off about this at first, but now I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong. Is 3 days a long time to leave a message like that without reply? Should I have revised the feedback seeing as I received the item anyway? ",

She was the Stage Manager (kind of like an assistant to the director, who was the teacher) for the Performing arts program she loved. All her friends were in it, she'd been doing it the whole time she was at this school but started causing problems this fall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe kept telling actors they were \"acting wrong\", getting mad and insulting people, and getting angry with the director. She was warned that not changing her actions would result in her getting booted from the program. She didn't change, and like she was told she was no longer welcome there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe texted me saying that she got kicked out after I heard (and verified through both people who like her and people who don't) what had happened, but she said that she got kicked out because everyone hated her.\n\nI told her that's not true.\n\nShe has a history of always being the victim, and sometimes she is but as one of her only friends I tend to stick up to her and at least when I'm talking to her support her side of the story.\n\nThis time, I knew what had happened and I decided I needed to say something before she went too far down her current path and ended up with no career or life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I said, in roughly these words \"I think that maybe you need to hold yourself accountable for your actions. Sometimes, you aren't the victim and this time I think that you are the sole person responsible for what happened\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't take too kindly to that, and while I kept trying to say similar things nicely she kept saying \"oh you're gossiping with \\[person that doesn't like her\\] behind my back, you are a terrible friend, maybe you should listen to me before believing other people like everyone else\" and other such things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? Should I have let her believe she was wronged? Or was it right of me to try and help show her that sometimes people, including her, make mistakes and should hold themselves accountable for their actions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

      "description": "So me and my brother are on very good terms, and I decided to invite him and his family over for dinner. My brothers friendship means a lot to me, and I would do anything for him. \n\nTime Skip to after dinner, and my brothers daughter comes over to my 60 gallon fish tank and starts banging on the aquarium glass, resulting in the fish being visibly stressed as they frantically swim around. She then throws a tantrum in front of me and her father, and yells that she wants the white clown fish. Mind you that white clown fish costs up to $40 (not too expensive but a fair amount for an exotic fish). I try to comfort her by telling her that she can visit anytime to watch the fish. But her tantrum persists and she starts a big fuss. \n\nNow mind you my brother had helped me a lot when I was in Uni, and I have developed a very strong bond with him. So after seeing that my brother was visibly discomforted after his daughter would not stop screaming (she is 13 yrs old), even after he and his wife tried to calm her down, I decided to give in. I bagged it up from my aquarium and gave it to him. That’s when she stopped crying and demanded that he give it to her (the nerve on that little shit). After she took the fish, she started shaking the bag vigorously and laughing. I told her to stop shaking the fish, but she chose to ignore me. To my brother, it seemed like she was so excited and happy that it was hard to contain her self, but I felt that she was purposely trying to kill the fish. So I snatched it away from her, and put the fish back in the tank. \n\nOf course she started crying again and making a fuss. But what bothered me the most was the annoyed expression my brother had. He told me it was a stupid fish, and that I should just give it to her to make her stop. I responded by telling him to discipline her, because judging by the way she is acting, she is spoiled rotten. Of course my brother took that personally and decided to leave with his family. \n\nTime Skip 2 days later. I apologized to him, just so I can get back to good terms with him. It’s not that I had to apologize, but rather I didn’t want our relationship to crumble over his bratty daughter. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for any typos. Using mobile. ",

      "description": "This happened like two hours ago, and although it’s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI’m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We’re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said “it just sounds like they’re both really insecure” and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) “it sounds like all 3 of you are insecure”. And Ashley goes “What? What did I do?” And I replied “date a 14 year old.” \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn’t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was “too far”. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified “that was just for *insert my name here*”\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone’s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she’s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don’t think I was in the wrong, it’s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?",

      "description": "Okay so here's the tea and strap in I'm sorry it's kinda long. I don't have much connection to my bio dad bc he has drug issues and my second dad I don't talk to at all because he blocked me on everything when I was 13 and I found out he only talked to me to avoid paying child support. My third dad was great, untill his first deployment when I was around 6ish. He was sent to iraq during a time when it was really bad over there and he came back with several PTSD. Because of his PTSD he would have \"episodes\" he would tell me (as a 7/8 year old) that there were dead bodies in the house. He called the cops because of gunfire that was just loud noises from the street (we lived in a city) he wouldn't pick me up from school because there were too many Muslim girls in hijabs there and it triggered him (eventually leading to us moving from the city into the whitest suburb he could find and I was also not allowed to have many of my Muslim friends to the house) when I would not clean to his standard he would scream at me until I cried and throw things like plates and dishes all across the floor. When we moved and i was older. He stopped having full on episodes unless he was drinking. In one case my mom and him were both drunk and my mom tried to take my baby brother away from him during a fight. He ended up dislocating her shoulder. When he would come back from deployments there would be a period where he would be unemployed but also had spending problems because he was overseas with out luxery for so long. (He would buy massive televisions. He got a boat and a new car.) Him and my mom would fight about money and I remember my first depressive episode being in elementary school over one of these fights. I decided that my parents wouldn't have money problems if I killed myself because I cost too much money for them and I tried to poke a knife into my stomach. I got older and he deployed two more times and his symptoms went up and down. Last year him and my mom both got into another drunk fight and he slammed her repeatedly into a door, and she was very bruised. I took my younger brother (who was 12 at the time but who has mild autism so he acts much younger) to a friends house. I wasnt that close with the friend but I didn't have anyone else to go to at the time so the situation was very awkward. A few months later my dad admitted to having a drinking problem and decided to quit drinking. He got a lot better and I went off to college. While I was away at college I was told my parents were getting a divorce but would continue living together until the lease on the house ended. It gets dicey here. \n\nI came home from winter break at the start of last month and my dad had started drinking again. My brother was not handling it well and took out a lot of his anger on me as well as binge eating for emotional reasons. My dad had already yelled at me several times over while I was home and I had had several suicidal episodes due to these reasons. Finally I asked my brother not to eat the food I had gotten to make dinner that night and labeled it all accordingly. My brother ended up eating it anyway while I was out with a friend. I went downstairs and told my dad who freaked out at me. He told me 'if I was so selfish that I couldn't spare some rice and fruit for Audie then I should pack my shit and get out of his house' so I shut down and went to my room. The next day my mother called me to tell me she was bringing home food for me and my brother and to tell my brother so that he wouldn't make anything before she got home. Unfortunately my dad had told my brother to make pizza before I had the chance to tell him so I called my mom to tell her that my brother had already eaten. I start to get ready to go to a goodbye party for my friend who was shipping out the next day and my dad calls me into his room and starts to yell at me for \"calling my mother behind his back\" and \"acting like I run shit\"  he then tells me that I contribute nothing to the family and that I'm lazy. (I gave him and my mother 2000 dollars aka all of my savings to pay for bills while he was unemployed and worked full time to buy groveries for the  family) He tells me that my grandmother (the person I am closest too) doesn't know how lazy I am and that I won't do any work.  So I said \"what the fuck do you want from me? Do you want me to leave?!\" And he told me I had 96 hours to get my shit out and whatever was left would be thrown away. I immediately called my friend who missed her own goodbye party to come and get me and my stuff and she drives me two hours north to my grandma's house. (When my mom gets home with food that night he says the same thing to her.)  Im too tired to explain it all but my grandparents already know about my dad's history of abuse and episodes. So she immediately clears a room for me and starts helping me find a job. My aunt and uncle find out about it and offer me a nannying job at their house where they will pay me. I take the offer but I know it's only because of what happened with my dad. I'm too embarrassed to explain all of it to them so I simply say my dad kicked me and my mom out. (Please note that my brother is my father's own child who he has always understandably favorited. My brother is safe in the house.)  My dad texts me several days later saying I blew things out of proportion and sends a seemingly nice message but to me it felt manipulative. I only got the text after I told his mom (my other grandma what happened) he calls me a liar in the text and my brother calls me a liar as well and tells the family I'm lying and that I abandoned him. I'm too embarrassed to tell my family what really happened. I feel a lot of guilt for not stepping in over the years or calling the cops during his episodes. \n\nLong story short. I know that his PTSD is the reason he acts this way and I feel like shit for not being more accommodating to his mental illness but I couldn't take it anymore. I feel like leaving was partially my choice and that if I had refused to leave none of this would have happened. AITA for leaving? For not doing anything earlier? Or am I really blowing what he said out of proportion? \n\nI'm sorry this was so long",

      "description": "Background info if it’s relevant: I’m in my first trimester, hormonal, my husband and I have been married two years but together much longer. I don’t normally come to Reddit for relationship advice but I wanted an unbiased opinion.\n\nMy husband has always had few boundaries- he leaves the doors open when he poops, bathes, changes, and walks around the house fully nude/in his undies and has since day one.\n\nI am the opposite but I am aware that it’s not a huge deal if he sees me naked or smells my poop and I don’t usually take issue with these things. \n \nHowever, when I retreat to the restroom in the evenings to use the toilet and take a bath, it grates on my nerves when he comes in and interrupts my privacy. He tends to come in and start talking to me about my day, about his day, and may try to touch me or kiss me. \n\nFor me, my nightly bath is my alone time. I enjoy spending it alone and decompressing. I have told him multiple times that I prefer he leave me alone during this time, and I’ve felt this way especially since I’ve been pregnant. IMO, I’m naked, I’m laying there like a beached whale, I feel gross, I’m trying to have alone time, I’m trying to relax, I don’t want to be touched, the bathroom is small, I don’t want to make small talk during that time, etc. I even lock the door to keep him out and he just unlocks it and comes in anyway. I usually shoo him away and we move on.\n\nToday he stayed out late and came home when I was already in the bath. He comes into the house and yells hello. I yell hello back and then say “Please don’t come in here.”\n\nHe comes in anyway to give me a kiss, bends down by the bathtub, tries to kiss and snuggle me and rub my belly and talk, and I’m just immediately like “okay, now leave” and try to push him away.\n\nHe is upset because he spent “all day thinking about his wonderful pregnant wife” only to come home and I was a “rude snob” to him. He says I’m rude, selfish and disrespectful. He thinks that my desire to have privacy is ridiculous, that I shouldn’t care and I need to get over my “insecurity/fear” of him being in the bathroom while I’m in there (especially since he’s going to watch me give birth.)\n\nI’m irritated because I don’t think I’m asking a lot, and I consistently ask him to leave me alone in the bathroom. I understand that he was trying to be nice and talk to me after a long day, but I wish he would listen to me when I ask to be alone— regardless of whether he thinks the reasoning is stupid or not. I feel like he’s not respecting my boundaries, but he seems to think boundaries aren’t needed because we are married.\n\nHe is upset but I really don’t feel in the wrong about this. I know if I talk to family they’ll all back me up because I’m pregnant, but I want unbiased opinions instead- AITA?",

I will refer to her as TFM (toxic family member.) \nAs an example of her manipulative behavior, when I got married and  TFM’s mother, who is in absolutely no way related to us, wasn’t invited to the wedding, TFM pitched a fit to her father ON my wedding day absolutely REFUSING to come to the wedding unless he picked up his ex wife and brought her with. [the mother is the same way... manipulative, untrustworthy, lies cheats and steals to get her way... that’s another story for another time.]\nAnyhow...\nQuite recently there was a big show of drama that TFM caused out of jealousy to have something her way and in the process stabbed my whole family in the back, because she refused to report the situation when we found out about it and told her to go to the police, but then turned around after refusing to report it and told the school counselor that the family knew and wouldn’t do anything about it. \nSo TFM stabbed my whole family in the back and actually got one person in huge legal trouble over something that was her choice. And it’s not the first time she’s done something like this to get her way. She’s very disrespectful and manipulative and I’ve never had much of a relationship with her due to that and the fact that she’s not that close to me anyway. \nBut shortly before the recent drama went down my husband and I had a baby and we’ve been feeling like we aren’t comfortable having TFM around our child. We feel like overall this person is just drama and toxic to us and more especially our baby. \nHere’s where I’m really lost though. \nWe’ve been able to just generally avoid contact with TFM and haven’t had conflict yet... but the baby’s birthday is coming up soon and we are going to have to talk to two people in our family who are still really close with TFM that we don’t want her to come to the party (or be involved with the baby.)\nDespite coming up with multiple non aggressive, non personal ways to address this with them, these two family members are HUGE on family in a very traditional sense and no matter what we say, we know they’ll be upset. We love them and it’s not personal to them and we REALLY don’t want to upset them, but we’ve talked at great length about the situation and just feel that TFM is... well, toxic.\nWe’ve even asked multiple other “third party” people who agree that the situation is such that this person needs to be cut out. But I have one very close family member who is telling us that it’s not worth the negative feelings and drama it will cause with the two family members still close to TFM to ask for this person not to come. (Even though the person saying this has told one of those same very sensitive family members something of the same magnitude about another person she cares deeply about...)\nSo reddit... \nAITA for feeling the need to cut this person out, while potentially risking the feelings of other important family members?

      "title": "AITA for taking my alcoholic mother's dog away from her?",
      "description": "TL;DR I took my drunk mom’s dog away. Now that she’s sober, she wants the dog back.\n\n\nMy mother is a recovering alcoholic. She had long stretches of sobriety until I left for college in 2009, and her and I have an honest, no-bullshit relationship.  She is a binge drinker, and her binges last weeks and months before she can even get a day sober.\n\n \n\nIn 2013, the year I graduated and came home, she decided to go to a breeder and buy a thoroughbred Boxer puppy she named Rosie.  She's a sweet dog, she's very energetic, and very needy. If the weather is nice, she likes to spend most of the day running around in the fenced in backyard. She goes through a big bag of dog food every two weeks, and she takes big massive shits.  If she's not getting the attention she wants, she'll whine and paw at you until you acknowledge her.\n\n \n\nI moved out of the house in 2014, and my mother's drinking got much worse. She lost her job, stopped paying all of the bills, and got a DUI (but didn't go to jail). Her neighbors would call me saying that she was going door to door asking for money, and that sometimes she wasn't even dressed. Her whole family cut ties with her except for me. I became her caretaker, stopping by every other day just to make sure that she was still alive. I took her to detox at the hospital half a dozen times. When she could get a few hours sober, I would take her to AA meetings.\n\n \n\nWhile all of this is happening, Rosie is with her in the house. She would go days without food. She would shit where ever there was an open spot on the carpet. She would eat whatever my mom left out (chips, raw meat, Oreos, whatever). The neighbors said that the dog never was never let outside anymore.\n\n \n\nAfter a lot of internal debate, I took Rosie and gave her to a family friend who wanted her. My friend lives on a farm and has two other big dogs. Rosie has all the room in the world to run around now and she's a completely different dog. She's happy. \n\n \n\nI really struggled with this decision because it meant that my mom was now completely alone in her suffering. I know having Rosie there didn't stop her from drinking, but it gave her some comfort. I can't imagine what it must have been like for my mom to sit alone in a house, with the lights off, the whole place smelling like shit and piss and beer, and have absolutely nothing and no one that loves them. I would suddenly burst into tears at work or in the car or eating dinner because the thought would cross my mind that she has no one.\n\n \n\nFast forward to this year - I took her to detox in February, after which she went to rehab. She had 45 days sober, but then relapsed again. I helped her get sober in September and she went to rehab again. She has 41 days right now. I'm really proud of how far she's come this year, despite all of the things that are going wrong (losing the house, no car, no job). That said, she is asking for Rosie back. She pleads with me to help her get Rosie back, and tells me how lonely she is and how she drinks when she's lonely. She says that Rosie was the only thing that kept her sane when she was in the house.\n\n \n\nI said no - Rosie is happy where she is now.\n\n \n\nAITA?\n\n",

He’s more like a friend than a father figure to me though because he came into my life at a later time.\n\n- He does not have kids of his own.\n\n- I only met his parents like 3 months ago and have only actually seen them like 4 times.\n\n- I have no problems with his parents. They just came into my life too late for me to be super affectionate with them.\n\n- My blood family isn’t really affectionate. Like at family gatherings we hug each other when we see each other and again when we leave. And we don’t really talk too much outside of family gatherings. \n\nSo his parents make me feel really uncomfortable. I’m in college, and they’re insistent on treating me like a 7 year old. They comment on my posts “my baby is doing _” or something similar. On every single post (which I delete their comments.) Not even my blood grandparents talk to me like that, or comment on my stuff like that. They’re insistent on me calling them papa or grandma, but I just call them Mr. and Ms. _.  Also the few times I’ve seen them they act like I’m a kid. They throw up a huge fit when I vape (I picked it up to support my mom using vaping to quit smoking. She’s cool with it) and when I drink. (My mom is also cool with that.) \n\nAgain, I have nothing against them. They just came into my life too late to have that sort of significance to me. Am I an asshole for being this way?",

Anyways here's the scenario.\n\nI recently was taking a history exam and a peer called me out for looking at my phone while the professor was out of the room. My peer said \"That's enough. People study too hard for this shit\" too which I replied \"that's why I'm looking at my study guide\" and quickly put away my phone. Given I was looking at my study guide on my phone which is against the rules am I the asshole for thinking that since I'm paying for the class and it's my education it should really be none of that students business? The professor has never graded on a curve so I can't see it affecting my peers in anyway whatsoever. Let me know. I think it's up for debate.",

      "description": "My work has a great perk of providing lunch items for free. Salads, stuff to make sandwiches, frozen crap, etc... \n\nLast Friday when I'm coming in to start my day, I see a guy take 6 lunchable protein packs out of the fridge. If you are not familiar with these things, they are meat, cheese, and nuts or a chocolate snack. [http://www.proteinproteinprotein.com/en/originals](http://www.proteinproteinprotein.com/en/originals) \n\nThis guy then proceeds to make a sandwich out of the meats AND THROW THE REST OF THE PACK AWAY! \n\nI'm am not easily offended, but this got me. I was so poor growing up, that we didn't have food sometimes, and this got me heated. \n\nAlthough it may be passive aggressive I decided to leave this picture on his desk. [MGMT - Control Yo Self!](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sTjkBwFbm4Y/hqdefault.jpg) With a lil caption that said \"Don't Waste Food!' and \"Jerk!' at the bottom. \n\nDidn't wanna make a huge scene. I mean, this is my place of work. I even decided to cut the part off that said \"Jerk\". I felt it was more f@#ked up to NOT say something.  A work buddy of mine text me saying that he was causing a huge scene over the weekend. Calling me a bitch, and saying he \"didn't need this crap\". \n\nHe then proceeded to put the picture back on my desk with the Jerk portion dug out of my trash and put it back with the picture. \n\nAt first, I thought, hmm, maybe it was none of my business. But EFF THAT! It is my business. This place is my community, and I am very grateful for the free foods. They only buy about 40-50 of the little packs for approx. 200 employees every couple of days. I mean we have lunch meat if you wanna sandwich. You don't have to throw away more than half the 6 containers of food, because you only want a small portion of them.  Not to mention the 795 million people in the world that are literally starving.\n\nIDK guys AITA?",

I know she has a lot of friends who are guys, most of which I know personally and am completely comfortable with. Had she asked about them, I would’ve been perfectly fine. However, she asked if she could go with someone she was friends with from work, who happens to have a massive crush on her. In addition to this, he gets visibly annoyed when I am brought up in any conversation and often insinuates that he could do better. I politely told her that I wasn’t comfortable with this, and asked if she would be willing to go with other friends of hers. She said they were all busy, and told me she just didn’t want to be alone then. I feel justified in my decision, but I really don’t want to be over-bearing. Am I the asshole for asking that she doesn’t go to dinner with this guy on Valentine’s Day? ",

It’s an accelerated program (one year instead of two) and virtually everyone is going off to medical school once we finish here. \nIn class today, we were discussing cultural differences - and what we might consider “moral” or “immoral” and how a lot of it is based off of cultural context and understanding. \nA female classmate of mine brought up how female genital mutilation in some cultures in Africa is totally immoral &amp; shouldn’t just be written off as a “cultural difference that we should accept.” Fair enough - can’t say I completely disagree. \nHowever, our professor asked her opinion on male circumcision in the United States?\nHer response?\n“Oh, that’s fine. Those babies are way too young to even remember the pain anyways.”\n\nThat response genuinely took everyone’s breath away &amp; quite a few people had disgusted looks on their faces. She wouldn’t back down from that point &amp; kept pressing it, which really made everyone uncomfortable. Me being me I turned to her &amp; said “I really hope you reconsider your career in medicine with an attitude like that.” That visibly upset her - tbh kind of my point. The class ended shortly after and the professor pulled me aside to let me know that what I said was uncalled for, so AITA? ",

Cooks for her, cleans for her, drives her everywhere, pays for everything for her, etcetera. I see in her that she hates doing it and she physically is not in a place that she really has the ability to do all that. \n\nIt's made me really think about the future. My SO's parents and my mother are all around the same 5 year range at around 58 years old and I've come to realize that it may not be very long until the choice comes up where they either will need a 24/7 in home caretaker, or they'll need to be in a nursing home. All three of them have made it very clear that none of them are going to a nursing home, but I know that none of them will ever have that kind of money either. \n\nMy SO has another sister and brother, but my SO is pretty convinced that their already-established lives won't permit them to care for his parents so at this point he's low key planning our future around having to care for his parents when they get older. \n\nMy mother and I never had much of a relationship  long story short, she is narcissistic and emotionally abusive. Every time the topic comes up, she basically guilt trips me into feeling bad for not wanting to care for her when she becomes unable to, and it always ends with me saying \"I'm not planning for that right now.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to care for either my mother or my in-laws when they're not able to anymore? If I do that, I'm pretty certain that I won't be able to pay bills, and what about my future children? How old will they be? Will I need to take care of them as well? Will my SO help me, or will he just go to work, come home, and go to bed? All these things I wonder about and it really stresses me out about the future. ",

I love her but she's the kind of person who loves to gossip and seemingly makes a hobby of talking about other people live's. I can't help but notice she talks and talks about cousins, family friends, etc, and how great they are doing, how they are having kids, the money they make, jobs they have, etc, but barely talks about my life or interests at all, except to bug me about having kids myself and tell me I worry too much. But I can't help but feel like this constant bombardment and being compared to other people only makes that worse for me and insecure. I'm not saying I should be the focus of everyone's attention but being that she's visiting me I would think she would care somewhat about my interests, and not just praise all these other random people the whole time, many who I don't even really know.

So we are a team and both are reliant on the other for keeping a good progress. Shes been with the company about 4/5 months and its been OK so far, small problems with timescales but we've been working through them and getting better. (In case it matters I've been with the company about 3 years and were both in our mid twenties)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo on to the issue, it happened over the past 2 weeks and I'll explain it in the order it happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo week one I was off on holiday Monday and Tuesday, went in to work on Wednesday and was told L hadn't been in the past two days and had been doing work form home (no one said this was OK to her she just said wasn't coming in, working form home), 10am comes round and I get a message form her saying today would be the same, Thursday she is at college all day so not in the office, friday dont hear anything from her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeek two, shes in on Monday morning for half a day then has to go to college, that's fine progressing skills getting qualifications dont have any problems. Now small office so didn't get a chance to ask her privately if everything was OK but she never said anything to me or to my/our supervisor. Tuesday sends me a message in the morning saying working from home again and hear nothing else all day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Wednesday we hear nothing, send her a message and so does one of the others, no response. Thursday is the same, hear nothing, couple more messages sent and phone calls from both the office manager and our supervisor go unanswered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriday rolls around and fully expect the same but no, when I get in my supervisor tells me shes been in contact and turns out her gran died. Now I know what your thinking at the stage, that I am definitely an asshole for thinking she should be fired but hold your horses. It is very sad that her gran died and different people deal with death different ways but as cold and heartless as this sounds when did she die? I know what you're thinking again, definitely the asshole but if she died in the first week why didn't she tell us/someone on the monday of the second week when she was in? If she died on the second week why was she working form home all of the first week? To me a full day of no contact is perfectly fine after something like this but its the big bad world and after a day you have to at least acknowledge your work trying to contact you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole for thinking that after working form home for a full week with no context and no job progress and then ghosting us for most of the second means that she should be fired?

      "description": "I live in a 3br/2ba house with another roommate and we were looking to rent out the master. A friend was having issues in her house and asked to move in, so it seemed like a solid fit.\n\nPrior to moving in, we explained that the shower in the master was draining slowly from a previous r/m. She was aware of the issue but myself and the other current roommate (CR) offered to help out where we could. It is in the lease that any clogs are the tenants' responsibility. She was also aware that when myself and the original r/m moved in, we had to unclog all of the drains.\n\nThe CR and myself have poured multiple bottles of Drano down and attempted to snake the drain, as well as using a plunger to try to clear our the blockage. When this wasn't working, we asked if she had a power drill. She borrowed one from a friend, but left it overnight and returned it before using it/asking us for help. She is now refusing to borrow it again because she doesn't like to. She said she has a plumber friend that would do it for free, but he's not really moving on this so far. \n\nWe made it very clear that this was the situation prior to her moving in and that we'd help out, but now she is saying that she's hiring a plumber and withholding the rent for that. She mentioned that \"now I have to move again, this is ridiculous\" as though she would be moving out because of this.\n\nShe asked CR and me to help move after already-long days. We spent over four hours being the only 2 moving anything. She watched and mentioned that her previous move was done by professional movers and she paid them upwards of $350 - all while complaining about us moving. We were not compensated for our time.\n\nShe is free to use our shower while we find out a good way to fix the master, and I've made it clear that I'm happy to help her out and snake it, but can't afford a drill myself. If she can get her friend's drill, I could get it done in likely less than an hour. I feel as though everything was clearly discussed prior to her moving in and now we're essentially being blackmailed by rent withholding to just pay for the fix ourselves. We have already invested a considerable amount of time and money on something that seems like just needs a drill to solve. I am still trying to reason with her regarding the drill, but right now I'm hitting a roadblock. In the meantime, I'll keep reaching out to friends to see what's available.\n\nWith that, was/am I being an asshole through all of this? I feel like I'm being incredibly helpful, and the shower situation was explained thoroughly prior to moving in. I just want some non-biased opinions in case my judgment is being clouded from frustration.",

      "description": "AITA for setting a limit on giving Christmas gifts to my children (2Y &amp; NB) from their grandparents. \n\nWe have asked every year that please do not buy our children lots of presents. We limit it to 4 presents where as an outfit (Top, bottom, socks) counts as 1 gift and the rest of the items (toys, books, shoes, etc...) count as 1. We don’t have a lot of room and don’t want our children to expect lots of gifts every year. We believe that Christmas is more about spending time with Family and not about how many gifts to give or receive. Also, we mention no large items. Again, we don’t have the room. \n\nMy parents reluctantly give in to our demands, but my in-law (MIL) has a hard time following these guidelines. She flat out said I do not think I will be able to do this. \n\nNow, to give a little background. In the past, my parents would give around 10-15 gifts for their grandchildren. That’s a lot to me. They did the same to my siblings and myself growing up. Don’t get me wrong, I thank them for all they have provided but to me it’s too much. As for my MIL, she will give upwards of 40 gifts per grandchild and about 20 gifts to children and significant others. Not even all of the gifts are even wrapped. The gifts would range from little toys to playstations tp TV to MacBook and such. She would easily spend 15k-20k on Christmas alone and who knows what else during the year. \n\nSo last year, my parents gave our daughter the 4 gifts but added a few extra items in her stocking. I was fine with that. My MIL gave 12 wrapped gifts, all with multiple items inside. So, I got up early and hid half the gifts so my daughter wouldn’t seen them. So it looked like she only bought 6. \n\nI know she has a spending problem. My wife’s siblings all say just accept the gifts and get rid of them when you get home or just give them a list of what you want so you don’t get crap. This goes for both themselves and their children. Last year, I just did not accept any gifts from her to me. My wife receive about 4 or 5 gifts plus a gift card. We both got significantly less than the others. I only ask because this year she mentioned that wasn’t able to do Christmas gifts this thanksgiving, we rotate holidays with my family and my wife’s, and that she will be mailing them to us. \n\nAITA for limiting gifts and refusing any that over the limit?",

      "description": "My mother has brought to my attention lately that things at her house have been pretty bad. My sister moved back in over the summer, after mom kicked her out previously. From what I was told, things were going great with her and she even decided to go to counseling, per mom's request. \n\nEvery year, my step-dad goes to get a tree around December 15th. Not a big deal, right? Well, once sister found out, she confronted him about them planning things without her and trying to ruin her Christmas with her kids. Mom said sister came into her room and was yelling at her about never including her. Mom said she heard what sounded like a hit coming from the living room, so she got up to check. When she walked in, sister had hit step-dad. Mom says she attacked sister and started hitting her as hard as she could. Mom blacked out, from texts later sent. Nephews were yelling at sister \"Mom, stop. Stop hitting.\"\n\nNext day, mom cuts sister's phone off. Sister starts walking down the halls, banging on the door every time she walked past. Yelling out \"Does your husband know you're fucking ----\" \"I'm going to call immigration\" \n\nAfter then, she's been sweet to mom. \n\nMom has been having mental health issues, called her counselor and told them things like \"I just want to get in bed and sleep forever\" Her mental health facility told her if she didn't get to their office within 15 minutes, they would be calling police and ambulance since it is a threat of self harm.\n\nFew days later, mom says that sister was getting ready to go out after mom told her she wasn't going to babysit. When mom called sister into her room to tell her nephew #2 was hungry, sister insisted she was about to be picked up to leave. Mom was recording her, so sister tried to grab the phone. \n\nNow, mom is dealing with having to go to different counselors or go to the psychiatric ward. She's sleeping all the time, much like she did when I was in high school. \n\nShe told me Friday she was thinking of calling CPS because she had to call the police on sister for the 2nd time. When the police were there, they said sister could go into whatever room she wanted. Then sister told police that there were two immigrants living there.\n\nI told mom if she needed temporary custody of the kids, I would take them. I raised nephew #1 until he was about 2 or 3. He's now 10. \n\nSister is on and off drugs, mom is in and out of depression. \n\nI am stable with a husband and child. I have messages and videos to prove I am fit to care for nephews.\n\nSo...am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Mom and sister are crazy and I want to get custody of nephews.",

      "description": "          I dated this girl for about a month and a half and I just broke up with her a couple days ago. Ever since we began dating I could tell that she would “fabricate” stories about her life (ex: she told me and my parents that when she was 19 years old, she trained dolphins at Seaworld). Even my mom caught her on 2 of her lies and brought them up to me later. Anyways, she would lie like this almost on a daily basis, and it would be quite obvious, but I never called her out on it because I didn’t see the need to, although it did bother me that she thought I was stupid enough to get such a blatant lie past. \n          Fast forward to this past week, she went to the doctor to see if she could get an IUD, and found out that she has HPV, which caused her to get cervical cancer. I don’t have HPV (I get STD tested every year, as well as I got my HPV shots) and seeing as HPV is an STD, this made me very uncomfortable about whether or not she’d been cheating on me, or just even what other diseases she might have. She told me that the cervical cancer is most-likely easily treated. However, I wasn’t emotionally invested in the relationship anymore because of all the lying in the past, and this was too much stress for me at the moment, as I’m currently in the middle of a tough semester in school and playing a season of baseball. So I called her and broke up with her because I can’t deal with everything right now and she told me that she “knows why I’m breaking up with her” and “when the going gets tough, I won’t be there” and hung up on me. \n\nAITA for breaking up with a girl after she developed cervical cancer from an STD?",

I've been keeping to myself because I don't want to get into a fight, and history has shown she reacts well and is easier to have a conversation with when she realizes by herself that her actions are affecting her relationships.\n\nAnyway, this morning she was up early which I thought was odd- I thought her new job started tomorrow not today and when she said Good Morning to me I just said 'Hi' and shut my door.\n\nNow I see she's posted on instagram that TODAY was her first day not tomorrow, and she isn't answering any of my messages apologizing for not wishing her luck and asking how her first day is going.\n\nAm I the asshole for the way I handled this situation?",

      "description": "Bit of background, my girlfriend and I are both in our late twenties and have been dating exclusively for a couple of months, we’ve known each other for about six months in total. We’re both women and so far things have been going great apart from an incident that happened at the weekend that’s left me feeling a bit weird.\n\nThis weekend we went out locally with a group of her friends and some plus 1’s that neither of us have known longer than a month (about six of us in total, all gay women) to have a drink at the local bars. It is important to note that one of the women has feelings for my girlfriend, they went on one date before we got together and my gf told her that she didn’t feel a spark and moved on. The woman, however, has a habit of telling my gf she still likes her when she gets drunk, but that’s a story for another day. Gf usually ignores or reiterates she isn’t interested. We started drinking and all got caught in a transient rainstorm so trooped back to my girlfriends house which was the closest to dry our hair and get warm before we went back out to continue. Everything was going fine, we arrived back and popped the fire on then started taking it in turns to dry our hair using her hairdryer in the living room.\n\nMy girlfriend disappeared to her room to change her trousers into dry ones with it being her house, the next thing I know she’s back in the living room wearing a short top and *nothing* on her lower half other than a pair of high cut black underpants. I was confused, she’d just come from her room with plenty of trousers to wear, I asked her why she was half naked and she told me she was drying her trousers on the radiator and was waiting for them to be ready but skirted around why she hadn’t just put some shorts/trackies/anything on in the interim.\n\nShe then proceeded to walk around the living room like this for a while, I noticed the other women looking uncomfortable and the woman who is attracted to her also looking awkward. The next day when we were sober and alone I told her I thought it was inappropriate, especially considering she’s aware one of her friends still has feelings for her. She doesn’t agree, her house her dress code apparently. She wasn’t impressed with my view and basically told me I was a dick for even bringing it up. Honestly it felt a little exhibitionist and disrespectful to me.\n\nI left it as I didn’t fancy escalating it into an argument and felt I needed another opinion - perhaps I’m a prude? I don’t know. I just feel at our age we should be past that type of silly behaviour. It’s left me feeling weird about the whole thing and questioning on whether I want to pursue this relationship. So Reddit, AMITA?\n\n",
