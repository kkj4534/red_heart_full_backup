      "title": "AITA for playing videogames with a girl when My gf hates her and has told me not to?",
      "description": "So about a year ago I was paired up with this girl (who I will call W) for a project in my biology class. As we are working I start to just chit-chat with W about stupid things and videogames come up. To my utter suprise she is a avid gamer and it happens she also plays xbox. She is really into fallout and so am I. We then end up going back and fourth on Instagram about fallout 76 hype and other gaming stuff, and I would send her hella memes. We play often, and I have her favorited on xbox (this is important later). During this whole time my gf of a year and a half asks for my Instagram password and I willingly give it to her. So about a week after I give my gf the instagram password I go to send W a meme I made and I cant find her anywhere in my recent dms, I just think its a weird glitch and go on with my life. Later I go to unblock a different friend of mine after he spams me with 400 messages (he has done this several times after I smack him in for honor so now I just block him when he does it) and I see W on my blocked list. I wondered how she got there for a seccond but eventually just think nothing of it. I unblock her and go on with my day. A few hours later my gf calls me sobbing and asking why she isnt good enough for me and all this and that, obvoiusly im confused and ask her whats going on. She yells at me for unblocking W when \"clearly\" she has a problem with her. I dont know what really I did so I hung up.\nNow everytime I try and dm W she is blocked, and gf will always get mad when she sees the notification that W sent me something. I threaten to change my instagram password if Gf keeps getting upset over the simple jokes and stuff we send to eachother. And then she gets even more upset, so I get even more upset. But I can see where she is coming from. She has told me several times that she is jelous that W and I have more in common than gf and me. She also told me that W is more attractive than her and I honestly agree, but I do love my gf and it hurts me that I have to hide my friendship with this person because its driving a wedge in my realtionship. \nIn the summer gf comes over and we put up netflix on the Xbox, about 30 mins in I hear the notification  *ding* that it makes and look over, W just came online. Gf gets really mad that I stoped paying attention to her to pay attention to the xb. But then she sees who it is that I looked over for and she slapped me saying \"why that bitch on your xbox\" I try and explain why but she dosent want to hear it. So I get angry at her for always doing that and that I just want to have some friends. She told me that I can be friends with anyone but her. This arguement ends how it usually does when we argue about W. Gf just ends up leaving in a bad mood. \nWhen school started back up in the fall me and W have a class together and gf and I have none. This reaply tilts gf and it brings up another arguement about things out of either of our control. There is nothing either of us can do so we let it be. The first day rolls around and since me and W know each other we sit together in class to talk and what not. The gf hears about this and goes all out when I see her. I end up just getting sick of having so many arguments about W that I change my insta password and go out of my way to not see gf for about a week to let things cool down. This was the wrong move in hindsight. Gf gets dumb mad about that and turns out she been going at it with W over Snapchat and insta the whole week. I dont know If im just acting childish or she is.\nAbout a month later me and gf chillin by my locker after school and W walks by, and I think to start somethin she says \" thanks for that color pack in warframe, im a broke boi so you came in big clutch with that gift.\" Gf really didnt like that because I told her me and W stopped playing games, which was a lie. So of course it starts a arguement later and at this point I am done with all this so I just roll over in bed and ignore her till she gets tired and leaves. \n\n\nTL:DR: me and this girl play games and send eachother memes everyday. But my gf dosent like it but against her wishes I do it anyway",

      "description": "So, my boyfriend really wanted a new TV. As I was fine with our current TV and am a student (he is working full time) I said fine, as long as I did not have to pay for it and it wasn't too big.\n\nHe started looking for one and even showed me one in the store of similar size as the one he wanted. In the store the tv did not look so big, so I said fine (it was 55\" our former tv was 37\").\n\nWell, now he bought it and I hate it! We live in a two bedroom apartment and I feel like it takes up  the whole wall of our living room! It looks much bigger than in the store.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I ask him to return the TV that he bought for his money which I already agreed upon and buy one that is smaller?\n",

      "description": "Me 23f\nHusband Neil 24m\nFriend Ann 27f\n\nMoving in with Neil 3 yrs ago was the first time I lived by myself, &amp; I got very used to it. Neil is very tolerant of other people, but there's few that I can be around for long periods of time &amp; not need a break. Ann is not one of them. I know that my standards for that are high, so I told myself I'd have to get over it &amp; take a break when I needed it.\n\nThe reason Ann moved was due to some medical treatment she needed, &amp; she'd just finished her degree &amp; wanted to transfer her job up to our area of the state. We saw this as a win-win; we'd see her more often, she'd get a great deal on rent, &amp; we'd have some cheaper bills. We also all 3 got a raise around this time, so moods were high.\n\nIn just five months, all that's changed. Part of it's due to money stress. Ann's student loan payments hit, &amp; she was unprepared for the amount they were taking. For a while we'd have to help her monetarily with a lot. Things have evened out in the last 3 weeks, but it was rough going for a bit. Obviously this was very stressful for us, &amp; it was compounded by the fact that Ann didn't seem to be doing what she could to get a hold on the situation and spent all her time playing games. She blamed most of this on her depression, but this feels like a flimsy excuse to me, especially because I've had depression for over a decade, but we're all adults &amp; shit has to get done.\n\nThere's also behavioral stuff. The more time we spend with her, the more we realize that she isn't a responsible adult. For the first 3 months she didn't even have bill money to us on time. This was blamed on her ADHD. Every time we go to her about an issue, we're given some excuse &amp; a promise to do better that falls short. There's been multiple strikes, mostly involving food/dishes, but also taking things w/o asking, the amount of noise she makes when we're sleeping, &amp; asking us how to do the simplest shit like we're her parents.\n\nI've reached the end of my rope. I reached it over a month ago, but tried to rein myself in because I know I'm less tolerant than others. Now even Neil is tired of it. We rarely have time to ourselves anymore, &amp; he gets even less of a break because he works with her.Â  We were all close friends before, but now I dread going home. Communication on both ends hasn't been perfect, but I feel like we've given her multiple chances &amp; she isn't improving. Now her money situation seems to be stabilizing, &amp; Neil and I have talked about telling her to find an apartment. It's not like we want to kick her to the curb - we don't want to be assholes, she is our friend &amp; we care for her a lot. We just don't think we're compatible to live together.\n\nTldr; Good friend moved in with my husband &amp; I, but in &lt;5 months has gone from fun to a strain. We want to tell her to move out, but worry this makes us assholes.",

      "description": "Ok so some context. I occasionally sleep with this guy with ADHD. Heâs pretty good in bed so I keep him around but he has ADHD which that in itself isnât the issue. The issue is that his medication prevents him from performing at his best, so he sometimes opts to not take his medication so he can have sex. Sex is admittedly better but holy cannoli in a ravioli does that boy just talk, and talk, and talk, and talk. And itâs such disorganised speech - he can go from topic A to topic B to topic Z to topic A and B again with very little input from me because heâll interrupt me. Itâs like Iâm listening his whole stream of consciousness. Iâm very quiet and mellow and with someone Iâm sleeping with, I donât care for the small talk. Iâm very âletâs have sex and then leave my houseâ. Itâs harsh but Iâm honest about it at least.\n\nA few days ago he came over, it was very apparent he didnât take his meds. He was fidgeting, talking quickly and disorganised, it was just a mess. Eventually I basically told him to shut up and to fuck me. It worked, but then even during sex he was trying to talk. I jokingly said I would put a ball gag in if he didnât stop. He stopped which was good.\n\nI was talking to some friends and some of them told me itâs kind of asshole-y of me to say that. I obviously wasnât rude or mean about it but I can see where theyâre coming from. I am sympathetic. On one hand I understand that people with ADHD (or any developmental disorder) arenât doing it on purpose, itâs just how they are and hippy, open-minded me wants to say that you shouldnât change yourself to please the neurotypical folks. On the other hand, you should learn to dial it down a bit. I also suspect heâs on the spectrum but Iâm not a psychiatrist so I canât make that determination. ",

      "description": "Person in question: Bob, person absent in day one: Joe, other person: Rod\n\nMy group of 4 are assigned a project to do. We all divided the work to jobs. Bob had to write conclusion (4 short pieces) and plot data, I wrote the rest (3 paragraphs). Joe draws 2 diagram, Rod draws 2. Joe only finishes 1 and I draw the last 1 and edit all of the work. I was the only 1 that took work home, they all made bullshit excuses everyday. But they at least did their work in class, except Bob.\n\nBob just wrote down data copied from my notebook. He couldn't even get that right, wrote the data wrong, and only did half of the data work. Then Bob just played games on the computer. I had to fix his work and do the other half of the data work. I took all the work home and almost completely finished the project by myself except the coloring for the diagrams. I juggled the idea of doing the job of writing the conclusion that Rod promised to do. I had some hope that Rod actually did do his job. Just in case I did the 2nd half of his work, so that I could add on to his, or (worst case scenario, at least what I thought at the time) I can join it with his 1st half of the work.\n\nI go to class and ask Bob if he finished his work yet. He did not, he didn't even start it. It has been a whole week after we started the paper part of the project. He makes the excuse that he didn't have time because he was helping out in his kitchen??? (he was probably referring to washing dishes). He said he started it, showing me a blank document with just a title. He also demanded me to share my 2nd half of the conclusion that HE said he would do. By now I was completely pissed off. I ignored his demands and told him to write it. He said he would at home. Then PROCEEDED TO PLAY A LITERAL FLASH GAME! I just stared at his screen and he said that he just opened this up right now.\n\nI knew he wasn't going to do it, so I took all the work home, and planning to finish it by myself, I already almost finished the first half of Bob's work. The only reason I'm still putting up with this shit is because of my grade.\n\nI'm seriously considering to go to my teacher, tell them everything, and ask them to remove Bob from grading if he doesn't show up with his work next time I see him (he has the whole weekend to do it) WIBTA if I did that?\n\nJust to review:\n\nOT: Original Task\n\nWTD: What They Did\n\nRod: OT: draw and color 2 and write a piece on the back of 1, WTD: draw and color 2; Joe: OT: draw and color 2 and write a piece on the back of 1, WTD: draw and color 1; Bob: OT: Write four short pieces and plot data. WTD: plot data wrong and only half of it, did not write his 4 short pieces; Me: OT: Write 1 piece but I planned to help the others after I was done, later I volunteered to do the pieces on the back of the diagrams which were two, What I Did: drew 1, edited all diagrams, wrote 7 pieces, recorded the data, fixed incorrect plotting then finished.",

      "description": "I saw this sub reddit on YouTube a couple of days ago and then this happened so I thought I'd post it on here.\n\nOk so some backstory, I have a friend who we'll call John and he usually invites people over to hang out and a lot of the time I'm the one who's not invited, which doesn't bother me unless he tells me that I'll be invited and then doesn't invite me kinda like this story. When I am invited usually it is because he needs a computer problem fixed or he wants something from me. Don't get me wrong there are the occasional times where John will invite me around just to hang but if someone is left out 9 times out of 10 it will be me.\n\nSo early on in the week John approaches me and asks if I'd like to come to his house on the weekend with another friend who we'll call Bill. I gladly accept and we go about our day. Fast forward to Friday and I haven't heard anything about what time, what day ect and I'm starting to think that he called it off but later on in the day I here Bill talking to John about what he needs to bring to his house and when i asked John what time I should come over he says \"I only invited Bill so you cant come\" I'm sad and angry at this point but I keep my mouth shut as I don't like conflict.\n\nI'm thinking of confronting hm and asking what happened but before I do I'd like to know am I the asshole for being annoyed in this situation?",

I say no because of the history behind it. Contextually, he's from the UK, I'm from the states. We've fought about this for a day or two now. \n\nIn a comment section on social media, he says white people should be able to say the n word and that it has no consequences. People reply to him calling him names and saying he would get jumped for saying the n word publicly. I read over it and he looks to me for support and I say firmly \"That's fucked up of them to have insulted your appearance/called names in a civil discussion. I dont agree with your side of the argument /or/ insulting people you dont know.\" I tried to talk to him about it further since he always attempts to be edgy and bring it up, but he shut me out and said \"I don't want to talk about it.\" He has since not talked to me today.

      "title": "AITA for complaining about my building's janitors to HR?",
      "description": "So when I started this job two and a half years ago, one of the first things I noticed was that the janitors for our building would sit outside of my office for up to an hour and a half each morning for their morning \"break\". (We have chairs set out there for students who are waiting to see their professors.) They would talk and laugh raucously (often about work-inappropriate subjects, or trash-talking other employees), blast music and videos, and generally make it impossible for me to concentrate. My job requires a lot of time spent coding, and I am most productive in the morning, so this was a pretty significant disruption for me. I began closing my door when they arrived, but they took this as an invitation to close my office door \\*for me\\* before they sat down. They also started speaking to me only in whispers. I've tried to convince myself they were just being considerate in their own way, but honestly it pissed me off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this were their only break during the day maybe I'd get it, but they would also take their lunch in the same place outside my office for another hour+. Then my office is next to a lady who is close friends with one of them, so they would spend a lot of time hanging out next door too, in addition to their \"official\" breaks. Altogether it was about three hours a day I was having to deal with this (I started tracking it because I thought maybe it just felt longer). I should mention that most of us empty our own trash and vacuum our own offices, because we're lucky if the offices are vacuumed once a month, and the trash is left so long it starts to smell. Finally around Christmas, I was bombarded with emails from our department (i.e., the lady who is friends with one of the janitors) asking us to donate money to them as a holiday gift (there were eight emails total over the space two and half weeks). That was a bridge too far for me, and I finally complained about all of the above to HR, with the suggestion that they create a break room specifically for housekeeping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently their morning break is only supposed to be 15 minutes, so this was a big deal to the people in charge. Now the janitors refuse to make eye contact when when we pass each other, and passive-aggressively take their breaks a few steps down the hall where I can still hear them complaining about how awful and ungrateful I am (they don't use my name, but it's obviously me). The coworker next door told me that the chairs outside my office are the only warm place in the building for them to sit. And I'm starting to feel like a bad person because I know janitorial work is difficult and often thankless, and I seem like some uppity girl with a cushy desk job who has no idea what they do (I did work in housekeeping myself at one point, but they aren't aware).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Last week, my husband suggested I arrange foster son have an overnight visit with his mom over the weekend for my birthday.  I arranged that, and I also got a babysitter for him for a few hours when he came back.  \n\nPlans for this weekend that he told me about were going to see Penn and Teller (I listen to Pennâs podcast all the time), which he ultimately didnât do since he couldnât get tickets (This was for an already sold out show rescheduled for Tellerâs back surgery) I told him about another show nearby, but he never looked into it.  He then told me heâd take me to a strip club, which sounded like a lot of fun.\n\nHe was on call this weekend, but he often trades with co workerâs when they have things to do.\n\nSo, ultimately, Friday I dropped my foster son off and then came home, cooked my daughter dinner, and then didnât do anything.\n\nSaturday we picked up foster son, babysitter came, but he was just supposed to watch foster son, since heâs only 11 (MiL was there for emergencies, but generally not to be relied on), but out 3 year old fell asleep.  Husband decides after an hour to wake the 3 year old up, so she started crying and we sat in the parking lot of the burger joint I picked out for almost an hour, before weâre able to go in.  Previously said he would order a veggie burger for my birthday, ends up with chicken instead.  \n\nHe did get me two Penn and Teller shirts and decks of cards, which were really cool.  Iâm just bummed that there was no birthday card, no plan, not even a cupcake, and all the high expectations he gave me all fell through.\n\nSunday, I feed the kids and take them to various parks for hours, he says heâll clean the house.  Spoiler alert: he didnât. Says he was working the whole time, but the hour or so after I came home he was watching TV.  Says he would put clothes away, only puts his away, leaves the kidsâ to me. \n\nFinally, when Iâm tired and I go to bed, he says âMaybe if I do better on Valentineâs Day, I can have sex before my birthday (September).  \n\nSo I bitched at him this morning about saying heâd put the clothes away and leaving them, about giving me shit for not wanting sex, about not even trying until Iâm in bed anyway, and then just making a passive aggressive comment like Iâm supposed to jump his bones for that.\n\nBut I also feel like an asshole because he did get me some cool gifts, even though I didnât get to do anything I wanted to do.  But Iâm an adult and I know no one gives a fuck about anyoneâs 33rd birthday.  Also, Iâm now aware he hasnât planned shit for Valentineâs Day, which is in 4 days, so obviously thatâs not going to happen, which made me more annoyed even though it hasnât happened yet. (I got him a card and am making him a steak dinner for Valentineâs Day).\n\nTL;DR husband got my a birthday present but otherwise ignored my birthday, then whines about not getting sex.

      "description": "Some background Iâm 17. My mother had me when she was like 20, and since I was a child Iâve always been told not to get a girl pregnant, always use protection etc. I understand because my mom has to learn a lot on her own with me growing up. I also smoke weed sometimes, I have a 4.0 in school so it doesnât affect my grades or anything. My mom previously smoked but now just drinks. Iâve been busted for being high before, our agreement is that when I turn 18 I can smoke weed.\n\nThis incident happened two days ago, but basically I got home around 8pm and I had just smoked earlier. I came outside to go get ready for bed when my mom said âAw, nobody respects my counter sign. Itâs a sign thatâs propped up on the counter and it was fallen over with the rest of the knick knacks. \n\nI even though I was high, decided to go fix up the sign because I felt bad no one respected it. So I fixed it all up and she saw and said âthanks!â Then she noticed I was high, convo went like this:\n\nMum: Are you smoking cigarettes?\n\nOP: No Iâm not.\n\nMum: Youâre either doing that or bud.\n\nOP: No Iâm not mom.\n\nMum: Youâre lying to my face. \n\nWe stopped talking after and I showered cause she told me to.\n\nWhile I was showering she searched my room upside down and found some condoms which she was very upset about because she didnât know I was sexually active. She laid the condoms out on my bed and hasnât said a word since.\n\nI know lying is bad, but me mum always has a  habit of telling me these ârelatableâ stories like oh Iâve done acid when I was your age or molly at this club, smoked cigarettes all the time. At parties they go off the chain, getting alcohol sickness all day. I think me doing this occasionally isnât bad, Iâm not doing it in the house just outside. The sex I think Iâm justified sheâs always been telling me to wrap my willy and I have with a girl who she really likes. They also have a job relationship where my gf delivers errands for my mother for cash.\n\nMy mom also refuses to speak with me, she hasnât since she just says whatever, even when I was asking for payment for college applications she didnât care and I needed to get a friend to loan me his card because I donât have one. I also donât know if my girlfriend/mother work relationship still stands. \n\nPlease help, am I the asshole here?\n\n",

So we are doing a 200m race and we are about in the middle, now a lot of people think that you can just muscle your way through the race but itâs very much technique, I guess technically you could muscle your way through at 200 but only if youâre really fit and itâs still much easier to follow technique. Ok so we are about halfway through the race when the person right in front of me takes the pedal out of the water (BIG no no) because Iâm going really hard and I canât talk because Iâm so out of breath I canât tell her to keep paddling even if I did sheâs one of those people who kind of feels entitled so it probably wouldnât of worked anyways. So we get off the boat (I canât remember if we won or not) and I was angry. I went to go confront her but she really didnât care. So me and my other friend on the team went to go talk to the coach about her asking if she would not race anymore or at least to talk to her about it. I mean I felt kind of bad after but at the same time I want the best team as possible.\n\nSo\n\nAITA for going to complain to my coach on my teammate?",

      "description": "I run my own cleaning business, last week we went to work on a house in the process of renovation, along with me and 6 of my employees there were also workers there to fix the electricity outlets and others installing lights. One of my employees went to her car to grab her supplies and found that she'd forgotten her brush, we were working in a different town from where we live so she couldn't drive to get it and, I believe, used her common sense and knocked at a home opposite to ask if they could lend her a brush for an hour. They agreed and she finished her job with no issues at all, then returned the brush to the lady. Two days later I was spoken to by one of the projects managers who said he needed to have a word with me, he told me a worker from another company had saw my employee borrowing a brush and was \"concerned\" . I couldn't believe someone had taken the time to report that and later that day I received an 8 paragraph email about the \"incident\" being unacceptable. The week after he told me the work was not up to his standards, with absolutely NO feedback, I'd cleaned absolutely every surface and not a thing was left on the floor, when I asked him what the issue was he replied complaining about smell, I told him the smell was completely unrelated to my work and the issue was with the actual floorboards to which he said I was too argumentative and hostile, I decided then to quit the project and told him to find another cleaning service because I didn't have time for pettiness affecting me when I work 8 hours almost daily. He remains firm that his actions were perfectly in line as so his partners. So am I in actuality the asshole here?",

He of course complained and told the teacher that I was taking his cards instead of mine but as I predicted, teacher didnt believe a word of what he was saying.\nSo AITA for taking his cards?\nReason why I bring this up 10 years later is because this weekend I was in one of those nerdy shops, and I saw one of my cards was selling for 30$, so I might have stolen something more than pokemon cards.",

      "description": "(*Throwaway because of reasons.*)\n\nI have been making IMDb pages for a bunch of short films that some friends of mine made a while ago. Mostly because I'm adding to my own IMDb record, and I was an actor in one of those films.\n\nMost of the people have been cool about this, but it recently got to my attention however, that one of the people who appeared in one of the films did not like that I published their real name and photos of them on the site. The photos are screenshots from the film, no photos on their \"personal\" profile.\n\nI am trying to remove the imagesI, but I don't think I can do anything else, since I contacted MDb and they said;  \n&gt; it is our policy not to alter or delete any kind of correct/factual information or credit from our records. In line with this policy we cannot delete this name because it exists and was available to the public, likewise, as the name was credited on the film itself, the credit and name page will also need to remain listed.  \nSo other than removing the pictures, there's not anything I can do.\n\nI don't think I can be faulted for posting factual information on IMDb. This person is credited with their actual name on the short film itself, and the short was screened publically and is available in full on Youtube.\n\nAITA here? I guess I could have considered stuff like this, but then again; they chose to be in this film and be credited with their real name. Idk. I have Asperger's Syndrome, so I unfortunatly have a history with making people mad with it being my intention.\n\nAlso; I will not provide a link to either the short or the IMDb page, so as to not expose this person further.",

      "description": "TL;DR: I get called out asking a friend for a girl's number out of concern after she got disconnected from a group discord call. When she asks why I did it, I have a brain fart and don't remember, apologize, and subsequently lose a couple of friends in the process.\n\nOk, so this is gonna need some heavy backstory. The girl, (we'll call her S) was in my chemistry class during my sophomore year in high school. We chatted throughout the year a couple times, but there was no other interaction outside of class. Fast forward to my junior year, and I make new friends with fellow nerds who also happened to be friends with S. I say fellow nerds because we all happen to be nerds. We like anime, memes, video games, etc. So it's through these friends that I start talking to S again. Anyway, we would all hang out in group calls on Discord, and just shoot the breeze talking about anime, memes, video games, etc. At this point, after a couple months, I started to develop feelings for S, and I think the rest of the circle might have known as well? (I'm not very sure, this is high speculation.) Whatever, one day we're in our usual group call and S suddenly disconnects. Of course, this can happen with internet and electricity and whatever, and I may have quite possibly overreacted, but I decided I wanted to know if she was OK. She wouldn't reply to messages on discord, and I thought maybe she'll come back eventually. About an hour or two of passes, and I hop off my computer and start to get ready for bed. I check to see if S responded to my messages on Discord and she still didn't. So, I decide to ask one of her friends who was in the group call with us for her number but I didn't say why, because I didn't want anyone to think I was that concerned. As I message this friend however I start to think that maybe I'm over reacting and it wasn't a good idea, and say \"nevermind\" and \"good night.\" I thought nothing of it at the time, but as it turns out that friend told S what happened (which was the right thing to do) and confronts me in a group messaging room with the entire circle present. So, I will admit I sort of panicked when this happened. She blatantly asked me why I did it. Since I panicked I couldn't remember why and said so.\n\n\"Why did you do it?\"\n\"You could've just asked me for my number.\"\n\"Is it because you like me?\" (That one really sucked :( )\n\nMany other similar questions were asked and I couldn't answer why because I had a massive brain fart. All the while I kept apologizing and in the end she said we couldn't be friends anymore and the rest of the circle felt the same way. I was really bummed. S graduated that summer, as she was in her senior year. I have not seen her since then. To this day, I still see the rest of the circle in the school hallways sometimes. Anyway, enough with my rambling. What do you guys/gals think?",

      "description": "A couple days ago a coworker of mine who Iâm on friendly terms with, but is not my friend (if that makes sense), called me as I was pulling out of the parking lot for the day. He lives in an apartment about 10 minutes away from our job and he knows that I live about 40 minutes away in the other direction by his girlfriends job so he asked if I would bring her the medication that she forgot at his place. Iâve never met her before. Iâm a very socially awkward person so the fact that I donât do well on phone calls coupled with the strange nature of the request made me panic and say yes. I still donât really know why he didnât just take it there himself or if there was something else he had to do because I didnât ask, but at this point Iâm just assuming itâs because he knew I always already going that way and didnât want to drive that far. Apparently the medicine was important enough that she *had* to have it that morning, not sure on the details of that either. \n\nLet me emphasize that I really did **not** want to do this, but the extra trouble that it caused me was not very bad. Following him to his apartment and then taking a slightly different route home added about 15 minutes to my commute and having to go through the awkward âhey are you ____? Hereâs your medicine see ya!â made me uncomfortable but it wasnât the end of the world. \n\nWould I have been an asshole if I said no to him? It wasnât really a big deal for me to do this, but as far as I know the only reason he didnât do it himself was because he didnât want to drive all the way there himself. ",

      "description": "I went to a Halloween Erasmus party at a local night club in Poland. I got there with my roommates from other EU countries but as soon as I got there I joined 4 friends from China.\n\nWe were all having fun and drank beers quite a bit before started dancing. 2 of my friends were dancing with a girl for like an hour, 4 of them had been chatting with her and her friend for the whole night.\n\nThen I joined up with the girl and 2 guys. The girl was really cute. I asked her if she was thirsty, she said yes and we walked outside to get a beer. We went to a different spot to dance and made out eventually.\n\nSince then 4 of them stopped hanging out with me without telling the reason. I thought they were just busy travelling everyweek.

      "description": "so petty shit IK. Any way me and my friends like to hang out at this youth centre thats free to enter. They have one tv with a PS4 and you can rent a game there. There is a time limit for 1.5 hours, and pretty much every time I go there it's a bunch of migrant kids playing FIFA. They're pretty loud in general, but not loud enough to get banned, and if someone else rents a game they basically hover like vultures waiting for their fucking fifa game. They don't respect the time limits either. \n\nAnyway, they are not well liked, and we usually sit and watch them, picking them apart and mocking them. They're pretty loud so I like getting the staff to tell them off, since they annoy me. Anyway yesterday i rented a game, and sat there to myself waiting for my buddies when these things basically sat down in the couch with me, and stared at me, asking me when they could play. Me being the asshole I am went on the internet on the huge TV, put on the nastiest gore (dismemberment shit) and just waited for them to leave, which they did.\n\nWhen it was their turn I intentionally talked loudly about how the \"trash\" was gonna play their \"shit soccer game\" because they are too inept to play real football, and almost hit one of them over the head with a chair since they mouthed off to a staff member, this kind old lady. My friends think I went overboard even though they hate these guys too, are they right? AITA here?",

I must preface to say she's never cheated on me at least to my knowledge. She likes to drink, a lot. I'm always with her and I never leave her alone for obvious reasons however she gets friendly with other people when she's had enough. Namely men. She does not say anything sexual to them and she introduces me as her SO but she doesn't shoo these men off either. After a while she's laughing with them and will sometimes hug goodbye. This makes me furious and I've told her on several occasions but she gets defensive when I bring it up.\n\nAlso all of her friends are male and I do not allow her to go alone with them drinking. She says they've never shown interest in her as they have known each other since middle school but I know how some things happen. We got into a huge fight because she told me I make her feel like shit and think she's a whore for being too friendly to men. My friends think I'm doing right by her but some are saying I'm an asshole. Am I an asshole for worrying too much?",

      "description": "This was a little while ago, but it's still nagging at the back of my head. \n\nBackground: my parents, grandmother, and I went to Germany to visit some more family (grandmother's sister and her family who I'll refer to as my aunt, uncle and cousin). My grandmother stayed at my aunt/uncle's apartment, while my parents and I were at an AirBnB. My mom got sick halfway through and wasn't able to do much of anything for a good few days. Before the trip, my aunt had gotten tickets for us to see a variety show. The day of the show I happened to get sick as well, and by this point my mom had been sick for a while. \n\nFast forward to that evening, we all meet up and find out that my grandmother, aunt, and cousin had all gone shopping. It wasn't a planned outing, just a spur of the moment, but my mom didn't take it that way. She was moody immediately after finding out and I could overhear her venting to my dad about how she couldn't believe she wasn't invited. My dad and I hate shopping, so I can see why she would have liked to go with people who are more into it, but I can't agree with her being upset with them for not inviting her; especially not when they knew she was sick and it was a spur of the moment decision.\n\nLater that night, my parents had a yelling match over the whole thing. I hid in my room because this sort of thing happens a lot with them, and in the end they tend to try to drag me into it somehow which turns into a huge thing (not just a ten minute discussion; sometimes these arguments will go on for hours even if I insist on agreeing with them on the matter).\n\nThey did, of course. When the yelling stopped a couple hours later, my dad came in to my room extremely pissed and started telling me not to believe my grandmother (they thought she was lying and intentionally didn't invite my mom). I stayed neutral with him, but when he kept insisting that I take their side, I told him I didn't want to talk about it. I was sick and felt drained from going out to the show; frankly I thought the whole thing was petty and wanted to sleep. He tried to push me further, but I kept saying that I didn't want to talk about it. I wasn't even directly involved with the situation. He ended up relenting, but telling me, \"If you ever need to talk to us about something, we won't listen to you.\" I hardly ever tell them about anything personal, but the way he said it still rubs me the wrong way.\n\nAm I the asshole for not giving in and talking about it?",

(The last time I talked to her, she wanted to study medicine.)\n\nShe: \"It has become international management after all. Master then goes to Enviromantal Sustainability and Resource Scarcity.\n\nWhat are you doing?\"\n\nMe:\" How did you get from the plan to become a country doctor to international management?\"\n\nShe: \"Is somehow more creative than working in a practice/hospital :)\"\n\nMe: \"Do you already know where you would like to go at some point or do you have a concrete job description in mind?\n\nShe: \"Why do you want to know all that suddenly?\n\nme:\"  Because I'm interested in what happened to the people I've known since  the fifth grade. It's exciting what happened to everyone after such a  long time.\n\nBut if it bothers you, I can also stop\".\n\nAfter that, I got blocked. Completely perplexed I wrote a sms.\n\nMe:\" I don't have to understand that now, do I?\"\n\nShe:\"  Say, who do you think you are? If you just arrive and want to know  SAchen, without even writing a sentence about your own current  situation, after years without contact. You have no idea how people  might have changed and if they might want to forget the past rather than  keep it alive.\n\nWhat you also can't know  is what \"people from the fifth grade\" (from over a decade ago) have  experienced with people/men, and you obviously don't know what even this  sms messaging can mean for a woman. So you don't have to understand  \"that\" if you wanted to, but it would take you a step further.\n\nI don't want any contact with you. \"\n\nMe:\" I am sorry if I did something that offended you.\n\nCertainly  you have had many experiences with other men, but I for my part have  always had very positive memories of you. Please correct me if I am  wrong!\n\nIf you are still interested I study \\[...\\].\n\nI sent the sms to understand why you acted like this.\n\nI  actually thought it would be nice to get back in touch after years and  find out what happened to the other person. I just wanted to be kind.\"\n\nThat  she blocked me and didn't want any contact is clear. I acted against my  own word. However am I wrong when I say, that she overreacted?\n\nPlease... What am I missing here?\n\nPS: I'm sorry for my poor English. Me no native, me stupid German.",

      "title": "AITA for giving a two-week delayed $1 tip to a sketch artist on the NYC subway",
      "description": "This story is from about two years ago but has stuck with me for a while. I was riding the S train subway from Grand Central Station to Times Square after work at around 8PM. Usually at this hour the S train subway is quite empty - since rush hour is over - so everyone can get a seat. However, because this train service only makes one stop (to and from GC and TS), many musicians, artists, and homeless people tend to ride the train to try to make a quick buck from the frequent riders.  \n\nI sit down on this day and see one of the regular riders/artists who usually draws facial sketches of riders during the 5 minute duration of the ride. At the end of the ride, he gives them the drawing and he expects to receive a tip. I notice that he usually tries to draw and charm attractive females so I was surprised that he wanted to draw me (31M) on this particular day. \n\nSo he does the quick sketch and makes jokes in between to get the whole car laughing. We arrive at Times Square and he gives me the sketch but I don't have any cash on me. He says for me not to worry and that I can get him next time. The sketch was actually pretty good given he had about 5 minutes to draw it in between stations. I actually hung it up on my fridge for a while.\n\nSo a couple of days go by and I don't see this guy. And naturally, I feel kind of bad because he did a decent job and wasn't really begging for money - he was kind of cool with just giving the drawing away for free. \n\nI hop on the S train a few days later and there he is. The only problem: I have a $1 and a few $20s in my pocket. Clearly, I am not going to give him the $20 for the amateur drawing. I didn't ask for it nor did I expect to receive. But I decide, to hell with it, he's doing the best he can, I am going to go up to him and thank him for the drawing from two weeks ago and give him $1.\n\nSo I approach the guy as he's about to do a drawing at the beginning of the ride and interrupt him to say, \"thank you - here's $1 for the drawing you did last week\". Huge. fucking. mistake.\n\nNext thing I know, he's stands up and gets in my face. He says \"are you fucking, kidding me? you're going to give me $1!? what's wrong with you f*ggot?! what the fuck am I going to do with a dollar, you racist piece of shit.\" He then stands up and proceeds to throw the $1 in my face. Mind you he clearly doesn't even know who I am. He then proceeds to take out his wallet and begins to throw more dollars at me. He's now yelling and cursing at me telling me to take the dollars and that I need it more than he does. At this point I am completely shocked as to what was happening. I was trying to do a nice thing and pay back the guy for the drawing he did for me a few weeks back (mind you I didn't even ask for the drawing in the first place). Everyone on the train at this point is looking at me and I am completely appalled. I thought to myself, this is the last time I am giving money to anyone for anything that I didn't ask for in the first place.\n\nI am wondering, holy shit am I the asshole for only giving this guy a dollar for his amateur shitty drawings after the fact?",

      "description": "So a little bit of backstory, my friend and met on the first day of college (almost a year and a half ago) and we have pretty much been best friends ever since. We spent at least an hour together a day since freshman year, and as sophmores we live together in a house. One of his best friends from his home town is a pretty cute girl (lets call her rebecca), who has a pretty strong history (about a 2 year relationship) with his other close friend (lets call him jeff) . \n\nOne weekend about 4 months ago, rebecca came up to visit my best friend. Rebecca had a boyfriend when she came up that wasn't Jeff, because Jeff and rebecca broke up about 6 months before this. Long story short, Rebecca and I ended up hooking up. In my defense I had no idea she had a boyfriend until after. She told me she really liked me and that she was super into me and blah blah blah. So when the weekend is over, she heads back to my best friends home town (about 5 hours away) and broke up with her boyfriend. Since then we had pretty much just had a snapchat streak and texting. \n\nFor new years, my buddy and i drove back to his hometown to celebrate it with his parents and then go to a party that night, where both jeff and rebecca would be. Now I didnt have any expectations for this party, since I thought that jeff and rebecca would be together due to their strong history and what not. Well when we got to the party rebecca was all over me, and i was trying to play it cool, because i wasn't trying to make out in front of a bunch of people i didnt know, and i told her i didnt want to make jeff mad, but she reassured me that there were no more hard feelings. About an hour and a half into the party i told her I had to go to the bathroom, and she said she did too, and i obviously had no problem with it, so we went to the bathroom together and we made out and what not, and jeff ended up walking in on us. After that he pretty much came up to me and told me to find a different party to go to, and walked over to rebecca and shoved her causing her to fall down, telling her to \"be more private\" so that is when I walked over and told him to back off, and found my buddy and we all left, including rebecca coming back with us. Since then, he has not talked to any of us, including rebecca or my best friend, leaving him on read 3 times. My best friend insists it isnt my fault, since theyve been broken up for over 8 months, and I wouldve had no idea that he still had feelings for her, but i sure feel like a huge asshole. ",

      "description": "Hey there,  today I had an outburst of emotions. \n\nFor months,  this one person had it on me.  \nI am in a truck driver apprenticeship atm and we,  the apprentices,  have to go on the daily delivery tours with the truck drivers.  \n\nI am having a blast with these guys except that one guy. \nEver since I attended this apprenticeship,  he bullied me.  Even the slightest mistake made him cuss me out in front of our customers. No joke,  he called me useless for missing the dot on the letter \"i\" when signing the delivery papers. \n\nYesterday,  a fellow apprentice fed me some info as to why he bullies me. \nThe usual age for first year apprentices is 17 to 18 years,  I am 21. So my fellow apprentice told me that he treats me like shit because I am older and I am supposed to know how to work,  yet I have the same amount of knowledge and experience as the other apprentices that started with me. \nI took a few wrong turns in my life and ended up a little older in the apprenticeship. \n\nI confronted him today,  after I got publicly cussed by him  out for smoking during a break. \nI called him an unfair piece of human garbage that doesnt belong in our society for treating future workers for that company like that,  and I said he shouldnt even be allowed to take apprentices with him with his biased and self centered behavior. (He thinks hes the best). \n\nMy Boss sees it as justified,  the other apprentices too,  but the other truck drivers ignore me now and everything I fought for in my life seems to crumble,  so,  Am I the asshole here?

      "description": "I own a gymnastics facility and have a family who joined us in September and has not made a single tuition payment on time.  The policy is that tuition is due no later than the 20th of the month for the following month (i.e. December tuition was due November 20th) to avoid a late fee.  They have until the 30th to pay.  If not paid by then, their spot in class is forfeited and they are removed from the roster.\n\nThis is now the 3rd month in a row I have had to assess a late fee to them.  They lost their spots before due to non-payment so they are fully aware of the policies and that we do enforce them.\n\nTechnically the only money they actually owe me for services already rendered is the $5 difference in November tuition from when one of the kids was lives up to a more advanced group.  Itâs $5 and itâs whatever.  Thatâs not the issue here.\n\nTheyâre not bad people but arenât the greatest clients either.  Aside from the late payments, they bring a bunch of people to the classes (including small children who arenât well-monitored), their kids are dirty and kinda stinky and waste a lot of our paper at the front desk (letting their kids scribble all over our pre-printed forms).  \n\nThe mother, who is in charge of the account, has been pretty scarce lately. I reached out to her via email to ask if she wanted to discuss the due date and see if we could come up with a solution to the payment issues.  She never responded.  Iâve also seen her once since then as she has her kid participate in a parade we did last weekend and it never came up.\n\nI donât have anywhere in my policies that you could possibly be turned away for paying late all the time.  However, I also feel like common sense/courtesy should kick in at some point and someone shouldnât be surprised if they are perpetually late with tuition that eventually you may no longer be welcome back.\n\nTLDR:  A client never pays on time and has been non-responsive to reminders and attempts to come up with a solution.  AITA for telling them they are no longer welcome at my business?",

By early 2018 my mum had started a relationship with a workmate she had been working with for years. She swears they were only ever friends up until that point. She told my dad about him at the end of last year. He was so hurt. I organised a family event that will include the extended family on both mine and my partners side but I did not invite mum's new partner because I don't want to hurt my dad. My mum is deeply offended and is refusing to attend unless he is invited. I will not budge. AITA? ",

      "description": "Throwaway account. \n\nTwo years ago, my sister asked me to borrow 3k to help start up a business she was planning. She is an incredibly hard worker and it sounded like an amazing idea. Also it was start up capital and she said in 6 months, she could pay me back. She had asked to borrow 1k a few years ago while going through a divorce and she promptly paid me back. So I had no reason to suspect this wouldnât be the case. \n\nFast forward, itâs been 2 years. She got engaged, planned an extravagant wedding, got married, and had a kid. She also had to let that business idea fall to the wayside during all of this bc sheâs been to busy for a second career. \n\nI know money is tighter now for her and her husband but itâs been 2 years. She keeps bringing it up, like yeah Iâll be able to pay you back half in a few weeks time or hereâs $50 to take off the loan. I told her Iâd rather her pay me back all at once bc itâs hard to keep track of $50 here and there. \n\nHer reasoning is that since Iâm an excellent saver and donât have a husband/kids I donât need the money right now. Iâm planning on moving soon and I wanted to do it without dipping into my savings (itâs in an account that breaks the interest if you remove it before a certain date). \n\nIâve been hesitant to really ask for the money back, although I do acknowledge that I need it sooner rather than later when she brings it up bc I donât want to put her in a hard place. But WIBTA to ask for it in lump sum before moving? ",

      "description": "So my dad told me my mum was in tears this morning because she thinks I don't care about here. I can understand why she might be upset about my lack of contact but I think she is blowing this all out of proportion. As a side note this isn't the first time it's happened. \n\nIt started when I moved out. I was in University and holding down a part time job. She felt that I didn't care because I wasn't talking to her. To be clear I didn't move far. I was a 15 minute walk away, she walked to see me on numerous occasions. I was also popping back home about once a week, not for long but I was still there. Often I was going to the gym and stopped for a shower as my parents house was closer. \n\nThat was a couple of years ago and for financial reasons I have moved back in, although I spend most of my time at my girlfriends house. But I make a point to send at least one night a week there, either me or the two of us. \n\nI don't talk much when I get home, to either of my parents. I work long days and if I'm lucky I get one day off a week. I and a couple of others are starting a new business and it has taken over my life. \n\nShe thinks that my lack of contact is not caring. I acknowledge that I could be doing more but it isn't as if I haven't tried. My mum love Scrabble and I have suggested playing over an app so we could play whenever, but she won't do it. She is very lacking in technical skills, but I have offered to set it up for her but she still says no. \n\nThe other thing I feel is unfair is that all she has to do is text me and ask how things are but she won't. She \"doesn't want to intrude\" on my life that she believes she has no part of. \n\nI don't know where she gets these ideas. That I don't care or hate her enough to bring her to tears, but I don't. I never have, I'm just trying to do my best in work and for my girlfriend who has her own set of problems that affect her very badly at times, but I won't get into that. \n\nThis has happened before and I'm on the edge of telling her she needs to grow up and realise that me not calling her everyday doesn't mean I don't care. Please tell me what you all think. ",

Her mom and dad are bigger, but her mom is probably a size 12. Her dad has a beer belly.\n\nI run xc with her for fun, but itâs not my main sport, we are both pretty good athletes and very fit. My mom is a size 0 or 2 depending. And dads not in the picture.\n\nConversation(paraphrased)\n\nWe just finish sexy time and it was great as usual, \n\nWe are just talking and I tell her how beautiful she is which leads to a tangent which is basically \n\nGf- yeah I love how flat my stomach is right now, itâs kind of crazy how Iâm never gonna look this fit again\n\nMe- what do you mean? Like you wonât stay in shape?\n\nGf- well after hs and college I donât really have to workout anymore, itâs not a big deal if I gain some weight Iâll just be normal\n\nMe- I guess, but what about your husband or bf at the time, I personally would want my wife to stay fit because I plan to\n\nGf- Iâve seen how my dad bugs my mom about her weight, I just donât really think itâs that big a deal\n\n\nThe conversation wasnât gonna go anywhere so I just kinda quit.\n\nBut today I was reminded of this situation. I dated her for a few months more before I left for college and I just never saw her in the same light again. \n\nI am not saying sheâs the asshole, but since getting downvoted to oblivion for saying I would let physical appearances affect my judgement of a person after 6 months well I just want a bigger take.\n\nPs go look at my comment history, you donât need to roast me about saying Iâd break up with a girl after 6 months if she lost an eye or gained enough weight to increase clothes sizes permanently. After 6 months I probably donât love the girl, I donât know anyone who falls in love that fast but I certainly do not.\n\nTldr: aita for expecting my significant other to stay in shape with me throughout our relationship ",

Well today while visiting me, we were getting ready to leave to go out to eat, my roommate walked in. We were just talking back and forth, when she said âI amâ and I responded with âgay, I knowâ and my roommate went into the bathroom to take a shower and we left. I realized it was a mistake but thought that it wouldnât be a big deal \nAfter about an hour I received a text from my roommate basically saying that I am homophobic and he feels uncomfortable to be around me. \nAm I the asshole for saying it as a joke to my straight girlfriend? To be clear, I have no problem with LGBTQ+, and have no reason to have any hatred towards him, I just want to understand why I should be labeled homophobic because of a single comment",

      "description": "So to begin this all off, I am not against smoking weed every couple days to relax, but I do not personally like the act of smoking.\n\nThe girl I was with for around 8 months has a bad past with depression and was emotionally abused by her previous ex. But when we met, she only smoked every once in a while. As the relationship went on, she began hiding the fact that she was smoking more and more, and she was suddenly getting sick every couple weeks. Most of the time she would end up in the hospital and she would usually stay the night and head home with painkillers.\nAfter a while, she would begin getting âsickâ during bigger events, like my Senior prom. She was losing weight at an alarming rate too and I honestly didnât know what to do. \nAfter our 8 month anniversary, i sat down with her and talked to her about how i was worried about her drug use. \n\nShe began getting defensive about everything and accused me of cheating, and throwing out other insults.\n\nI simply ended it right there.\nI am only 19 and i dont want to be drug down this early in my life with problems like this, and her actions could get me in trouble at school or with the law.\nBut on the other hand, i feel like i just ditched her when she probably needed me most.\n\nSo AITA?\nHow would you guys have dealt with it?\n",

      "description": "Sorry for the wall of text, but I wanted to give as much perspective on the situation. As well sorry for any spelling, grammar, or format errors, I'm typing this on mobile. \n\nSo my Mom has this boyfriend Tom, who I honestly can't stand. When she first introduced him to my sister and I, it was pretty clear my sister hated him. She tried calmy telling my Mom this, but she just ignored it (possibly because my sister moved far away for her job and thus has limited contact except for short visits). \n\nI have tried spending time around him but don't enjoy it. He has lied to Mom, practically cheated on her (long convoluted story there), and everything that comes out of his mouth is a complaint, or criticism of some sort of institution (often either the government or US Education system). He will endlessly talk during movies and TV shows either telling us every last biographical information on the actors, film crew, and producers for movies produced before 1970, and for those after poking at every minor plot hole, media trope, or character flaw.\n\nMy Mom has tried time and again to insert him into family functions but never warns us. He has attended Thanksgiving for the last two years, Christmas of 2017, and she has occasionally invited him to a family dinner without telling anyone (he is just there at her place when we arrived).\n\nThis all reached a head during last Thanksgiving. For my family Thanksgiving is a huge holiday filled with days of lots of good food and alcohol, that we all contribute to. He showed up the Thursday of and didn't leave. My sister just isolated herself in the guest room she was sleeping in, however as I sleep on the couch while I'm visiting, I could not escape him. I was distant and cordial until he started mocking my sister's eating habits and a few other thing, which she could hear because the apartment isn't that big. At that point I saw red, and while I kept quiet, I probably became rather curt with him. The best part of the holiday was the one morning he went back to his place and the tense atmosphere left with him.\n\nThis reached a head as the next time I saw my Mom, she tried to lecture me about being kind to her guests (yet I apparently don't count as one even though I don't live with her). I had to tell her that I tried to give him a chance but I can't stand him. The only nice things he has to say are about her, and I can see why his own son won't speak to him and I don't want to spend any time around him if I can help it. She tried to tell me to call him out on his behaviors I don't like, but I don't feel comfortable telling him he's acting like an ass and has to stop. After this she just got defensive and shut the conversation down.\n\nAnd less than a month later when my sister comes up for Xmas, my Mom begins to act majorly passive aggressive and cold towards us. I tried to make things lighter and did slightly succeed, but overall the holiday felt hollow. On top of it my sister subtly informed us she has volunteered to work Thanksgiving and Xmas next year (and thus won't be around). The only positive thing was that Tom didn't show up. However, since then any interaction, if one occurs, with her feels strained and like she's not there. \n\nI am just hurt and livid as I'm watching my family fall to pieces because my Mom has decided this is her hill to die on. I understand she wants a partner to feel happy and fulfilled with, I just wish it was someone who didn't behave like an ass ninety percent of the time. Am Ithe ass hole here for telling her the truth in hopes she realizes how bad his behavior is?\n\nTldr: my Mom's boyfriend is an ass, after a long time of her not accepting me and my sister find him distasteful I had to put it bluntly, and now she is pulling away and letting the family fall apart.",

He has a close online friend from Europe who he had admitted he had deep feelings for before he met and the feelings were still prominent when we first began dating.

I confronted him about it, and he defended himself saying it's because the friend says it to him first and he must say it back lest she gets angry.

I have a big family and I only get a 20min window when I can play my piano with no people downstairs.\n\nI see my uncle, who is currently visiting, on the couch, sleeping. I try to set my piano up quietly, when my dad comes in and wakes him up, to move his car. They both walk outside, so I start playing. I have a concert coming up soon, so I need to practice.\n\nI get halfway into my piece, when my dad and uncle come back and start loudly talking while walking around. I get pissed, turn around and say:\n\nIs it necessary to scream around right now?\n\nMy dad quietly says:\n\nNo.\n\nAnd they keep quiet. I keep playing my pieces, when uncle's wife, my aunt comes downstairs with her 3yo. They make much more noise, so I stop playing. They want some ice cream or somethin, so they are trying to get ready. I grab my phone and browse reddit, not playing the piano, right in front of them. They leave, I finish my playing and come back upstairs.\n\nI tell this to my mom and she got angry at me, and that she didn't raise me like this. She said, that now the uncle will be offended and will nag about me telling him to shut up for a long time.\n\nAITA for this? ",

      "description": "I met a guy on a plane today. It was a short flight and I usually get some work done while in the air but as soon as I took my laptop out of my bag he asked me if I fly from this airport frequently (it's a really small one with 4-6 flights departing each day). I told him I'm just kind of a long-term tourist in this country and that I'll be leaving in several weeks. We then proceeded to have a really nice chat, he works in the same field as I do so we shared some stories, then he told me he could show me some places off the beaten track if I wanted to. At first I was totally into it, because I don't really know many locals yet and have only been to the main tourist attractions. \n\nBut then he started asking some really private questions like which part of the city I live in, what my daily schedule looked like, if I shared a flat (I lied that I do because I felt uncomfortable) and if I spent many evenings with my flatmates. He said we should definitely meet up so that he can show me around. He asked for my phone so that he could save his number and told me to message him as soon as I get off the plane. I didn't. Would I be an asshole if I never contacted him again? Is it just my paranoia speaking? I probably should've never given him my phone in the first place but I have a hard time saying no to polite people.",

It seemed like things were perfect and it was everything I wanted until right before we had sex she said \"this is just as friends right?\" And I didn't know what else to say so I said yes, but that feels like a lie, because I've liked her for three years now and I don't think I'm capable of just having sex with her as friends. I never did anything about it because for a long time she was in a relationship with my friend and then for a while we were living in different cities. \n\nI know I really should be honest with her, but the sex is fantastic and when we're hanging out and kissing and cuddling and having sex, it almost feels like it's a real relationship, and that feels amazing, and I'm not sure I have the will power to end that. We've been doing this for a while now and I feel like an asshole every time we fall asleep cuddling and I'm thinking about how great it feels to finally be with her while I know she's just thinking this is some fun between friends.

      "description": "My (24f) ex (28m) bought me a shotgun for my 21st birthday for clay pigeon shooting. I was going to buy it for myself, but he insisted to get it for me as a gift, and I was very grateful for that. So it's registered under his name, but I live in a state where you can gift/privately sell guns without papers. I was in college at the time so I never felt comfortable having it with me, and I only went shooting with him, so we decided it was best to stay in storage at his house. \n\nAfter dating five years I broke up with him (he was emotionally abusive but idk if that adds anything to this). He tried to change and work it out for a few months after, but ultimately it ended. I haven't talked to him in a few months, but before we stopped talking I did ask if I could have it back and he said sure, but never got around to it. He has other things of mine that I'm taking the L on, but I do really want this one thing in my possession.\n\nI finally feel confident that the gun would be safe where I live now, and that I can safely use it on my own. And also some friends have expressed interest in clay shooting in the future, and I would like to join with my shotgun.\n\nThe problem is - I randomly ran into him last week and he ignored my existence. So (unbeknownst to me) we are not on good terms. I thought we ended things alright (not great, but semi amicably), but I guess I was wrong.\n\nWIBTA for asking for the gift back after all this time? And if he were to say no wibta for pursuing it further or should I just drop it?",

My two main subjects are math and physics, which i quite enjoy.  \n\nMy class is great, except for this one dude. I'll call him Tim. It had only been a week in our new class, and everybody else started to take distance from Tim. We do include him in parties, so it's not like we are being mean. But, Tim did not show up half the time. When he was at school though. he would chatting on Discord or sleep, Although we do find it amusing when he's asleep, I can't stop feeling kinda sorry for him. \n\nThe problem is, when we are told to work on our own, he has no clue what we are doing. Tim always goes: \"OP (or some of the others) what are we supposed to do, and how\" ? Then I'll tell him what he has to do. Of course Tim still has no clue, because he either slept through or wasn't paying attention when the teacher taught us something new. \n\nMy medium-sized guilttrip and the entire reason i made this post, comes because the teachers always talk about making sure everyone is in on the topic. Also, when we make our own groups, nobody wants to have Tim in their group. \n\nI really think he should take responsibillity for his own education, but I feel somewhat guilty because i know i can help.\n\nAITA??\n\nTL:DR: Kid in my class is always sleeping and never paying attention, but I don't want to spend my time helping him always. \n\n",

      "description": "This was a previous job but would like to know if I handled it OK.\n\nBasically the job was a really good one, but it didn't pay amazing and had a greatly reduced staff during the summer (my contract was ending and I would have to reapply next season if I wanted to work there again). Part of the job involved staying ~2 hours from civilisation in a small cottage with another staff member (a sister location, essentially). When I was sent to the cottage, I was always put with a girl (let's call her Jan) who I didn't really get along with.\n\nI had the final stay at the cottage, and went back to the main town. Another staff member (April) took my place with Jan. While hanging out with April's boyfriend, he told me that Jan had been telling everyone that she suspected I had masturbated while staying at the cabin. April then sent me a message that Jan had also told her that the boss had visited the cottage, and while there the boss had supposedly told Jan that \"there was no way in hell Hootinglance is getting a written reference\" for any future jobs. (keep in mind that the current job was one that I was qualified for, that I worked hard in, and that I loved, and that me and the boss got on very well (or so I thought)).\n\nI was very upset. I went into work the next day with a resignation letter in my pocket (there were only a few weeks left anyway) . I saw the boss and told her about what Jan was saying. Boss told me it was just a horrible rumour and that of course she'd give me a reference. We had a big cry together. I didn't give her the resignation letter.\n\nThat night I was riding my bicycle when I got a call from Jan. I hung up on her (I was busy, having a good time, and didn't want to talk to her). She kept ringing me back until I picked up. The following isn't word-for-word the conversation but close enough \n\nJan: \"I just thought we should clear the air a bit\"\n\nMe: \"okay...\"\n\nJan: \"boss told me what happened. I'm sorry you got upset, and I hope you can accept my apology\"\n\nMe: \"No. I don't accept your apology.\" *hangs up*\n\nBoss messaged me shortly after. (everything from here on is the actual messages, just altered names) \n\nBoss: Hey Mate, I donât want to pry in how you deal with things, but I think you need to hear what Jan has to say or youâll be angry for ages! Iâve spoken to Jan this afternoon, who has said she has tried to apologise &amp; you hung up on her. Yes, she hurt you, and what she did is unforgivable, but how many times did she hang out your washing at Cottage, put all your dishes away &amp; whatever else was not done? This would annoy me and you if you had to pick up someone all the time. Giving people a fair go &amp; an opportunity to make things right is so important. I know she was hurtful, but she realises that she wants to apologise to you. To ring someone you know is angry at you takes a lot of guts. Iâm not taking sides, but remember that you are a decent &amp; well-mannered guy &amp; try and find it within yourself to give her a chance and make things calm. Iâll leave it in your hands. I hope you find it yourself to reconcile. \n\nSo I messaged Jan.\n\nMe: boss texted me, telling me that you'd complained to her that I didn't accept your apology. Didn't think I'd have to explain adult relationships to you but here I go. This isn't primary school. You did a shitty thing spreading a rumour, not apologizing, acting all knowing and smart, and then when you finally did apologize, you said you were sorry that I got upset, not for doing a shitty thing. You were sorry that I had a problem. You however did nothing wrong.\n\nRegardless of whether this is what you meant, that's what you said. Even if you had apologized correctly, I don't have to accept said apology. It's not some magic word that makes everything better. If I said \"oh that's fine\" I'd be lying. I'm not going to make myself into a crutch to make you feel better and I'm not going to lie and say everything's magically solved cause you called me one time. Any good karma you've built up, or any annoyances I've done (e.g. forgotten to hang washing out at cottage) are negligible and irrelevant to the current matter. I could go through a list of all our contentions, but it's beside the point. I don't forgive you. If you want to complain to boss again that I'm being mean or whatever, fine. Drag me into her office and I'll tell you I forgive you. But it'll be a lie. At least I'm being honest about it. I don't have to accept your apology. Does this mean I'm brooding over it and crying myself to sleep every night? God no. But you can't do a shitty thing then expect it to be negated by saying the magic words. Welcome to the complexities of adult life.\"\n\nShe never replied, and we never spoke again. Am I the asshole? Should I have accepted her apology? ",

That being said though, I guess I know the basics and how it effects people. Which is why it makes me angry when these emos constantly bring up that they supposedly have crippling depression depression.\n\nCause from what I heard, people who legitimately suffer from depression  seldom or don't bring up the fact they have depression at all. And to me, it seems like emos just think that depression is just having a pessimist view on life. Completely underestimating Depression for people who don't have it.\n\nAgain, I would love to hear if I am the asshole or not. As it would allow me to help people dealing with this mental condition. And it would allow me to separate those actually dealing with depression from the phonies using it just to get attention.",

      "description": "So here's the whole story:\nMy grandparents live in another country than me and my parents do, but they have an bank account here. Most of the time when I have birthday or get my school report etc. my grandpa (R.I.P.) said on the phone, that my father (his son) should take some money from said bank account and give me and my siblings some, since he is not there to give us a present or something. My father always didn't do that, but his siblings, also living in the same country as me and my parents, most likely did. I can't tell for sure, but I expect them to do so.\n\nNow my grandpa died and the money he owns got split among my grandma and my father and his siblings. I am now in university and living on my own and the rent in the city I study is pretty high. The students loan covers it and I got a little bit money left, but still. A couple of months ago my grandma told my father to take some money from said bank account and pay one month of my rent. And my father didn't.\n\nWhat makes me angry is, that a cousin of mine got a considerable amount of money from my grandparents every month, just because my aunt whined about how expensive the university of said cousin is. And I still didn't got the money I was promised by my grandpa since middle school.\n\nAlso there is to ad that my grandma is either greedy or she just don't like me and my siblings, since she does not like my mother either. But not my grandpa he cared a lot for all of us. \n\nDon't get me wrong I am not doing bad, the money my parents make and I get in student loans is enough and it covers everything.\n\nAITA for internally insisting on the money I was promised by my grandparents?

      "description": "Let me give you context and then the incident.\n\nMy friend and I were bridesmaids in another friend's wedding. Besides their family, it was the first time I met my friends' other friends. The wedding took about a year to plan with lots of various parties along the way. We all got along fine until the actual wedding, where a groomsman was a total asshole to me (although, not to my friend... yet). He mocked my laugh when we were all chatting and drinking at the reception. He mocked me again when I cried as the bride and groom left.\n\nSo, I pretty much hated the guy after that.\n\nThat brings me to now. The couple just got back from their honeymoon and about half the wedding party (including the groomsman, my friend, and me) had another party. He was being a bit of an ass but was otherwise fine until the end of the night.\n\nWe were all leaving and doing the typical goodbyes/hugs and when the groomsman got to my friend, he didn't hug her, and the following exchange happens:\n\nGroomsman: Bye \\[wrong name\\]\n\nBride: Her name is \\[friend\\]\n\nG: Oh! Your other fat friend.\n\nWe all just stood in awkward/stunned silence. My friend kind of stumbled away, about to cry. First, we all knew each other by now, he knew her name, and we've all NEVER joked like this before. Second, my friend has serious health issues affecting her weight and it's an extremely sensitive topic. On top of that, she also has brain damage from the radiation treatment of childhood cancer. I'm extremely protective of her.\n\nMe: What did you just say?\n\nG: Her... other fat friend?\n\nMe: Did you seriously just say that? Is that supposed to be a joke? How fucking dare you. You don't know her like that. You apparently didn't even know her name. GO FUCK YOURSELF!\n\nI stormed off and took my friend with me. She thanked me in the car going home because she could not handle that confrontation. So far I've received a lot of various texts about it - the groom just said, \"that's the way \\[groomsman\\] is.\" The bride thinks I'm an asshole for cursing at him and, again, \"thats just the way he is.\" (btw the bride knows all of our friend's triggers and was even her disability advocate in college!) ironically, the groomsman's girlfriend thinks he went too far and shouldn't have said what he said. the groomsman himself is pissed I yelled at him, doesn't think his joke is a big deal because \"we're all fat,\" so he won't apologize.\n\nATIA?? my bride friend's reaction hurts the worst. I know I shouldn't have done it at her party, but the dude fucking deserved it.",

      "description": "This happened last night. Both my friend and I are college students. We decided to go out for a couple of beers, and since it was only a couple of beers, my friend decided to take his car, and pick me up along the way.\n\nWe got to the bars, and there wasnât a lot of parking available. I saw one spot kind of in a corner, but my friend said that itâll just be easier to park across the street in a Taco Bell parking lot. I agreed, jokingly saying that it was a perfect situation to pick up some Taco Bell afterwards.\n\nWe were at the bars for a couple of hours, and after coming out, noticed that the car was towed. We went into Taco Bell to check, and we were told that the parking lot was a private property, and we were taking up space of Taco Bell customers, so they had the car towed.\n\nThey gave us a number to call, and soon a towing company rep showed up. He said that the charge for the tow was $250, which was ridiculous.\n\nAfter a lot of haggling, and threats to call the police, we cut a deal at $150, and got the car.\n\nOn the way back, my friend asked me to pay half of the towing price. I refused, saying that\n\nA. It was his car, and his responsibility to park it properly, and I should not be held liable for anything. If it was a speeding ticket, he would be paying for it, and I donât see a much of a difference here.\n\nB. I told him to park at a different spot, but I also jokingly agreed to park at Taco Bell, but it really should not matter, since, once again, it was his decision to take the car, it is his property, and he should be responsible.\n\nI really think that if this situation was reversed, he would have said the same thing.\n\nHe got really silent after all this, didnât speak a lot, and while dropping me off just said âA friend in need is a friend indeedâ.\n\nThat really hurt me. I really do value our friendship, and would hate to see it go down for like $75. I would gladly call him, apologize, and pay him right away if I was the asshole in this situation, but I donât know if I was. Reddit, the judgement is in your hands.",

There's drama when family members come over for one goddamn day, let alone two weeks left alone with each other.   \n\\-I'm kinda... worried about a friend and stuff. We chat everyday, and he's an internet friend, but he isn't exactly in the greatest place. I know its stupid, but I'm scared something might happen and I won't know. \n\n\\- I'm trans and whatever. I really want to just... kinda hurry up and get around to changing my name, all that stuf, and moving out. If I'm lucky, I might be able to start that sorta thing by March. But then going on this trip will obiviously fuck that up, and if my family finds out, i dunno./  \n\\-And the stupidest reason. I'll miss my friends and my dog. idk. I know its only two weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut yeah. What do you guys think? In all honesty, I'm probably just gonna end up going anyway, and probably enjoying it if just a little.

      "description": "This happened years ago, but the incident kinda left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended) so figured I'd see reddit's take on it, especially with a lot of people talking about \"toxic masculinity\" standards.\n\nSo, straight male here. Back in college I used to go to a lot of parties. I was somewhat of an awkward kid, never really had much success on the hookup/relationship department (except VERY scarcely and rarely I think I had one sex partner) but I had my share of friends, and at these parties I would mostly just end up floating around and mingling with my liquid courage and meeting new people, or just acting goofy and embarrassing myself (in a funny way, not one that would alienate people).\n\nSo once upon a time, at one of these parties, after I've had my share of liquid courage, I decide to step outside for some fresh air and I see this girl I know, with her friend that she introduces me to, I'll call her Sarah. She doesn't even go to school there, just up visiting. So I sit on the doorstep and start chatting her up, other girl goes back inside and leaves us alone. Like I said I've had my fix of alcohol and she may have too for all I know, as we make small talk and joke about random things eventually something leads to us moving closer and leaning in to each other, and making out. Or just pecking. Or maybe both, it happens several times, some initiated by her. After some time, we go back inside and I don't see her at all for the rest of the night. I start to suspect maybe she's avoiding me for some reason but who cares, doesn't really faze me.\n\nNext morning I decide to add Sarah on social media just because. I add her, she asks \"do I know you\".\n\nI remind her who I was and reference something we joked about. She then responds \"to be honest I thought you were gay. Turns out you're just a creep.\"\n\nYou can probably imagine how I feel from that response, but I decide to show some class and say. \"Well I'm sorry that you feel that way and for the misunderstanding. I'm most certainly not a creep. Nice meeting you, have a good day\".\n\nShe then responds \"yes you are a creep. Have a nice life.\"\n\nAnd that's that. So, reddit, AITA? Did I do something wrong here?",

      "description": "So this happened a few weeks back. \n\nWe have this giant building on my campus where most of the student come to spend their time between classes. There are several floors, and the main floor filled with tables and desk which allowed the students to eat and study. Usually, this place is packed. On this day, I was roaming the area, trying to find a place to seat. My girlfriend was coming so a bigger table was my main objective. I circled around the seating areas and saw a person packing up so I waited beside the table. I'm not the most talkative person so I didn't ask if he was leaving (it was obvious from his actions). A few seconds later, this other guy (B) came up and asked the person packing if he was leaving. I did notice B before when I was looking for a spot but he was standing a little bit away from where we were now and not really moving. So the guy who was packing said he was and B waited for him to leave. I said to B that I was waiting for this table and that he should look for a different one. Here's the conversation that ensued. \n\nB: \"Did you ask for the table?\"\n\nMe: \"No, but I'm standing here waiting for him to leave.\"\n\nGuy packing: \"B did ask first.\"\n\nMe: \"Why would asking be allowed to take something I was waiting for.\" \n\nB: \"See, he said this table should be mine.\"\n\nLike a parking spot in a parking lot, the empty one goes to person who gets there first. I wasn't just going to give up this table. \n\nGuy packing: \"You guys can share the table.\"\n\nMe: \"I have a friend coming and I'm not obligated to share this table.\"\n\nB: \"No I asked first and you didn't, go find another one.\"\n\nI clearly wasn't going to let this guy take the table and after a few minutes of talking, B stormed off angrily and I took the seat.\n\nSo AITA? Lesson also learned on communicating first.",

We look alike, our brains are wired in the same way, we've had a lot of the same problems in our lives. \n\nTo put it simply, he's basically me if he was raised in the 1940s with the threat of a belt hanging over him for 18 years. He's been through a lot, and it sort of broke him down. I'm not justifying his opinions, he's openly set out to provoke my parents, who are proud LGBT supporters, talking about \"the gays\" and stuff. He's pretty casually cruel as well, according to my dad he's never once acknowledged his accomplishments in life. \n\nThat's obviously not good, but he's been supportive of me, pretty much only me.

I had a thorough talk with him and assured him that I had no hard feelings and the split was not his fault, it was just my self discovery.\n\nWe were able to be friends until the summer, where I found out he had been spreading rumors, making sexual comments, calling me an asshole for breaking up with him, etc. I decided to cut him off and basically ghosted him. I feel bad for ghosting him, but at the time we didnât talk much anyways and I was very scared of confrontation and arguments.\n\nHe still talks to a few of my friends about me to this day. None of it is negative anymore though, just things like he wishes he could be my friend again or that he doesnât think heâs over me. Because of how long we have been broken up compared to how long we were dating, it makes me uncomfortable that he might not be over me.\n\nHe and some of his friends have recently been saying to my friends that I have no reason to not talk to him anymore, and that his rude comments came from âa place of angerâ that he is no longer experiencing.\n\nMy question is, AITA for not wanting to be friends or for feeling uncomfortable?",

      "description": "Hear me out here.\n\nSo, for context, I'm 17, and live with my grandmother (whose 77) and my family that used to live in Jersey. (Brother, sister in law, and 2 nieces.) I see my Mother occasionally on weekends and some weekdays. (My legal guardian is my grandma, my mom used to be a bad alcoholic, been sober for years.)\n\nSo, this happened yesterday. My mother told my grandma the day prior that she'd be at her house at 12, so grandma could call then. We tried up to 12:30, where me and grandma laughed it off, thinking she was just late as usual. We were right. \n\nAt 1:00, my mom called. I gave the phone to grandma, and about 5 minutes later, she comes to my door crying. Apparently, grandma joked with ma about how she was late, and ma took offense to it, and they got into a fight.\n\nAbout a half hour later, I called my mom, and here's where I messed up.\n\nThis is 100% of what happened in the call.\n\nMe: Mom, what did you say.\n\nMom: I said fine and hung up. (My guess is she was being sarcastic and said what she said at the end, grandma told me what she said to her later.)\n\nMe: Everyday since thanksgiving, you've been acting more like (insert name of sister in law both me and grandma absolutely hate.)\n\nMom: HOW DARE YOU, (I couldn't make out the rest, since she was screaming.\n\nMe: I'm just tired of seeing my goddamned grandmother cry! \n\nThats when she hung up.\n\nNow me and grandma are sad as shit, and my sister in law and older niece hate us. ( from stuff that happened on thanksgiving) Mom usually calls a few times daily, and she hasn't called since. \n\nAITA? And if so, how should I apologise? She won't pick up, and my sister won't drive us to where she lives.",

      "description": "Using a throwaway for obv reasons  \n\n\nOkay, so earlier this year, there was this old homeless guy who was well known in the community. He hangs around, chats up people, occasionally others will give him food. Stuff like that. People even let their kids and pets play around with him. Some of them even buy him some food. I don't really understand, because he could just get a job, but whatever. Not my problem.  \n\n\nAnyways, this guy just up and dies, so everyone's pretty upset, despite not even knowing him that well. Hell, even some of my friends and teachers are upset, and they're the guys saying that you should be successful in life, so that's kind of annoying and hypocritical. Everyone's making a big deal out of it, and some kids decide to make a \"memorial\" consisting of a picture, rocks, and flowers in the courtyard of my high school.  \n\n\nI eat lunch in the courtyard, and I don't want to go and look at some dead guy's face everytime I eat. The cameras in the courtyard are only pointed towards the two doors, and not towards where the memorial is, so when lunch is over, and everyone's rushing out, I kick the picture and step on it. I made sure to wear my dad's boots when I did, because broken glass hurts like a bitch. Some students are really upset, and so is the gardening and recycling clubs, but in my honest opinion,  leaving that picture out there is not environmentally healthy either. ",

      "description": "So, about 4 weeks ago my now ex girlfriend and I broke up. It wasn't messy but we both agreed we weren't right for each other. \n\nThe entire time we were dating she said she was on the pill. \n\nNow about 2 weeks ago she told me she was pregnant. And that she must've forgotten the pill once or it was during a cross over period of when she got back on the pill. I'm not really sure how it works, but I went to the doctors with her and we were told she was roughly 8 weeks.  \nWe both sat down, spoke about it and agreed that termination was the best option as neither of us were ready for a child and it would be raised in a broken house to start with. \n\nAnyway this past week I've seen Snapchats of her drinking. I messaged her and said she shouldn't be drinking while pregnant. \nShe replied with \"why? We're getting rid of it anyway\". \n\nI said it doesn't matter, it's still our child and whilst you're pregnant you still shouldn't be drinking. \nThis didn't sit well with her. She pulled the \"well you're not my boyfriend\" card. \n\nAm I the asshole here? Does it really not matter? Or should I still be pissed.",

      "description": "Throwaway, because my wife knows my reddit account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me start off by saying I love my wife. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. She also loves surprises. The problem is that she has the patience of a small child on a sugar high. She will go through any lengths necessary to find her gift. If there is a holiday or her birthday coming up she will start insistently asking me what her gift is, if I can give her any hints, etc: This is fine to me. I simply respond, \"You'll see...\" and that's that. The issue is that she will ceaselessly attempt to find her gift, and I am no match for her detective skills. I have tried every hiding spot in the house, but she finds them all. Even the garden shed is no match for her. So next I tried leaving her gifts under the seat in my car. It took her less than 2 days to find it. No joke, I once buried a gift out of frustration (but the dog dug it up, so not really her fault). Not even digital gifts are safe. I bought tickets, and she found the email receipt on my phone. She gets so giddy whenever she finds my new hiding spot. It's like she is on a scavenger hunt, but I am tired of playing this game. I am out of places to hide stuff. I wish I could just bring home a gift a week before her birthday and remain confident that she will not see it until her actual birthday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, we had an argument about it that got fairly heated. I told her that I am simply going to give her the gift and not try to hide it anymore. She countered that I was taking away the best part of the gift giving process simply because I was really bad at hiding stuff. She seemed really upset, but at the same time I am mentally exhausted from trying to outsmart my overly curious wife. So, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So this is about a co-worker of mine. I believe she and I are pretty close as we sometimes spend time together outside of work and I genuinely enjoy her company to the point where I get thrilled to work a job that I hate when I see that I have a shift with her. I've always had a hard time engaging in conversations and just generally making friends so I really treasure our relationship. We also share a lot of interests and hobbies.\n\nAnyways, on to the situation, about a year ago on a particularly easy-going day at work me and he got into a long conversation about ways to show how your affection and shit like that. She said that because she has a hard time expressing her emotions she loves showing affection through birthday presents. Now my family barely even celebrated me and my siblings birthdays as I grew up. So I told her how I didn't care that much about presents(this matters later).\n\nFast forward a few months and her birthday were coming up, originally I wasn't planning on doing anything special for her until I recalled our aforementioned conversation. I really wanted to show her that I appreciated our friendship so I decided to really put some time into a nice present. She and I both love the bands Radiohead and Neutral Milk Hotel so I decided to make her an LP cover mixing two of their album covers into one I also went and bought the two actual LP's so I could put them into the custom LP cover. I was pretty satisfied with it and was pretty nervous about giving it to her which was weird because of how comfortable I usually am around her. Anyways, the fateful day arrived and I gave it to her. She got really happy and decided to thank me every day for a month. She does stupid shit like this which is a trait of her that I adore.\n\nA couple of months later and my birthday arrived, now normally I wouldn't care about this day but I couldn't help but long for the present I thought she'd give me. So when she texted me happy birthday I straight up asked her what she got me (which in hindsight was probably pretty narcissistic) and she said: \"nothing because you said you didn't care about presents\". I got pretty furious and we got into a bad argument.\n\nAfter this whole situation, our dynamic has gotten strained with like this distant awkwardness and I fucking hate it but I feel like I was in the right to be mad at her? I talked with my brother about the whole thing and he said that I was an asshole for expecting something even though I said that I didn't care about presents and that just because I did something nice to her doesn't mean she has to do it back. \n\nSo am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

After a number of beers, I was standing off to the side looking into the crowd aimlessly until I saw a girl that I based on her figure, I assumed she was pregnant. The last thing I remember of the evening was pointing with my cup and asking myself, \"is that girl pregnant?\".\n\nHow it went down.\nAt this point, I must have blacked out because I do not remember anything. My friends give different avenues of the story but both avenues lead to the same ending.\n\nAvenue 1 = I had walked up the girl and directly asked her if she was pregnant in front of her friends.\nAvenue 2 = I approached everyone else at the party to inquire of her condition.\n\n(Knowing myself and how I was back then, I am inclined to go with Door #2.) \n\nThe ending.\n\nAccording to my friends, the girl found out about the question, broke down crying, and ran out of the house. Four of her friends who were talking with four boys, saw her and ran to help her, thus simultaneously cock-blocking four guys at once. One of my friends said he never saw anything like before or since. He STILL shares this story.\n\nSo, AITA for having good intentions regaeidjg determining if a woman was pregnant and drinking alcohol?",

      "description": "So sorry for the long post!\n\n**Me**: 26 years old, working full-time to put myself through school, in school almost full-time. I work 12-hour shifts, and on my days off I typically study for 5-9 hours. The only time I have an actual day off to myself comes once a year around my universityâs holiday break. I take my studies very seriously and always have to do homework or study even when I take a vacation. Iâve always been independent and take pride in the fact that I donât need to lean on my family members emotionally or financially, but I have as much trouble as the next person balancing work, school, family, my health, and finances, and I feel like Iâm always under an abnormal amount of stress. I drive a super stylinâ 2003 minivan that I never drive for over an hour because I feel itâs unsafe (relevant later).\n\n**My sister**: mid 30s, been married to husband for several years, expecting her first child. Kate (name changed) has always been an emotionally needy person (not a criticism, just the truth). She lived with my parents until her mid 20s, and when she eventually moved out, she chose an apartment 2 blocks from my parents house and still slept most nights at my parents house. About a year ago her and her husband relocated to a town about 45 mins-1 hour away from where the rest of my family lives for his job. I donât mean to downplay her career at all, but she is a fine arts major; her job can be stressful, but not like the stress I experience at my job, where I see people die regularly. Now that she is having her baby, sheâs leaving her job to stay at home for an indefinite amount of time. Her + her hubby will be able to live comfortably on just his income.\n\n**Current situation**: Kate has asked me repeatedly when I can come to her house to hang out, make dinner, etc. Even before she was pregnant, if her husband would leave town for business, she will ask one of us to drive out and stay overnight with her. The last time he left town, she asked me to come stay with her for 5 straight days to âhelp her with the house.â Iâve told her each time that 1) I am very busy and my life is very stressful right now, and 2) I donât think my car can physically make that drive and Iâm not willing to test that theory. I asked her if she would like to come stay with me, but she refused and said âthere isnât a place for me thereâ (there is). She tends to take me not visiting her very personally, and has said things like âI wish you cared enough to visitâ and âyou could at least callâ (she answers her phone about 20% of the time, and doesnât text back). To be fair, I donât visit her often. In the year that sheâs lived there, Iâve visited her only twice. But I also havenât visited my parents house in almost a year and I live 10 minutes from there.\n\nThings came to a head this week when she was talking about her post-birth plans. Her husband will be with her for the 1st week, then my mom will be looking after her the 2nd week. Kate expects me and my other sister (who works full-time with 2 kids under age 3) to drive to her house and look after her during her 3rd week post-birth. When I told her that I wasn't sure if I could help, she got offended and her feelings were obviously hurt. Honestly, at this point Iâve graduated from being mildly irritated to totally furious. I think Kate is being completely unreasonable. I know that she is not a very independent person, but in my opinion she chose to move away from all of us and should have expected less familial interaction. She is 100% insensitive to the fact that my car cannot drive that far and has said that I could just borrow a car, as if thatâs the easiest thing in the world. Not to mention the fact that she has a husband to look after her--like, she seriously canât last 8 hours on her own until he gets home from work? Iâve also just started an especially stressful semester and literally burst into tears in a coffeeshop the other day because I feel so overwhelmed right now.\n\nI get that Iâm biased, but I genuinely need to know--AITA for not wanting to help my pregnant sister? How much help do new moms need? Should I be more attentive and sensitive to her needs? Thanks!\n\n**TLDR**: Pregnant sister expects me to look after her after she gives birth, but I feel she is asking for too much considering my current situation. Is she asking for too much, or AITA?",

      "description": "My partner and I have been together for about 5 years and over the last 3 he has slowly stopped talking to all his friends in favor of being alone. No falling outs, just not keeping in touch. I think it stems mostly from a complete lack of motivation to talk to people.\n\n Anyway, Iâve always been something of a social butterfly, and I have a group of 4 friends Iâve been hanging out with for close to a decade. Heâs recently started wanting to tag along with me and my fiends, which I loved at first! He wants to get out more! But I am missing having my time with my friends, his presence throws the vibe off a bit because he doesnât know everyone as well as we know each other. \n\n\nSo I shared this with him and told him I donât want him to stop coming to our hangouts, I just want it to be an âevery now and thenâ thing. I told him he should try to reconnect with his old friends, and he kind of sighed âmaybe yeah..â \n\n\nBut now he just doesnât ask to come to our hangouts and doesnât talk to anyone. I feel like I put him back to square one. I want him to make friends and be more social, I just want him to make his own friends and his own plans. I donât want him to just latch onto mine.",

I wasn't even really thinking about it when this poured out of my mouth because it's not a secret that I'm closer with Random Fake Name than I am with my brother, but he was pretty hurt by it and a bunch of my friends are saying that I'm immature for wanting to pick Random Fake Name over my brother.",

      "description": "So, I've recently moved back to my hometown after dropping out of college. I was pretty embarrassed so I didn't really tell anybody that I was moving back (it has been about a month now.) \n\nSo anyway, there are definitely a few people that I've been meaning to hang out with, but haven't been able to work up the courage in fear of being perceived as a loser/failure etc. There's this one girl I know mostly from the internet really but we went to high school together and I've talked to her at the local bars around here for example. We were never really that close just DM'd a few times. I knew she still lived around our hometown (and she is single) so I wanted to surprise her in a funny way letting her know that I was back and maybe we can hangout or whatever. This is where I may have crossed the line?\n\nHer dad was the coach of the boys' lacrosse team when I was in high school so I was honestly probably closer to him than her, but regardless I was able to find their address from searching his name online. On Valentine's Day I went over to the house intending on just handing it directly to her but no one was home. I was already freaked out and anxious from the whole thing and I kept second guessing myself but I didn't want to give up. I also didn't want to leave the stuff in the rain so I tried the doors/windows just to leave it in a dry spot. The window was open so I just placed it down inside on top of an end table. I bought the most traditional fucking gift I possibly could have so I don't know how it could be perceived differently, I just got flowers and a small box of chocolates, and a small card that was supposed to be ironically funny (it was just like a get well soon card) that I wrote \"I'm Back!\" on the inside. I was planning on messaging her saying it was me at like 6, figured she would be back from work by then. \n\nFast forward a little bit that day, watching her instagram story she was NOT amused and definitely a little freaked out from what I could tell. I honestly just thought it would be funny but now I am afraid to tell her it was me, does that make me an asshole? I just want this whole thing to disappear.",

      "description": "I really feel like I was justified in this, but I don't often confront people and often just stay quiet, so I have some uneasiness that I approached this situation wrong.\n\nThere's a guy I see sometimes at the gym who is always on his phone, whether he's working out or in the locker room. He usually has his headphones on and is loudly talking into the mic. Whatever, it's the gym. That genuinely doesn't bother me.\n\nHowever, today I walked into the locker room after my workout and this guy is FaceTiming some girl walking around the locker room aimlessly and talking to her. I didn't think much of it initially, but I had to get up right next to him to use the scale like I always do because he was leaning on the wall right next to it. I definitely got his attention a bit, and I could've sworn (not sure) that he tilted the phone towards me to show the girl how close I was to him. That's when I started to think that regardless of whether he did this, it's absurd for him to be using FaceTime in the locker room. There's a dude but-ass naked showering 15 feet away from him.\n\nI felt like I should say something, and it got much more tense than I expected it to:\n\n\"Come on dude, you're in the locker room. Don't use FaceTime in here.\"\n\nHe got really pissed and stared at me for a few seconds.\n\n\"You talk to me like this!\" (he is foreign, he said this a few times over and over) \n\n\"This is a locker room, people are changing here, put your camera away.\"\n\nHe was kind of rambling but I remember: \"Get your ugly ass out of here, no one wants to see that anyway\"\n\n\"Don't care, put your camera away.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just locked my locker and walked into the sauna as I told him the last time. I was pretty stern and honestly I was kind of a dick about it which felt appropriate at the time, but it just doesn't feel right for some reason. I could hear him leaving pretty soon after that. He was extremely angry and I felt like he was going to hit me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Side note: this is long as hell because I needed to give as much as info as possible. Also, he's now 19 and I'm 17 (I know we're pretty young but yeah)\n\nI and my ex met through a video game during the new year 2017. We started to chat a bit and he soon invited me to his discord chat. I made new friends there (I'm still friends with those friends though) and we were getting along well. A year and a half passed and during that time we were in touch actively. He was dating someone at the moment and I was a bit jealous to be honest, even though we had never met. I knew what he looked like and I knew where he lived, we snapped each other occasionally, and face timed each other a few times. \n\nWe started dating in May 2018. The first month was like I was wearing heart-shaped glasses, but in the back of my mind, I kind of knew it wasn't gonna work. I knew we had it coming at some point and I was correct. He started to seem distant and absent and didn't treat me with such tenderness as he used to. I didn't mind it that much as I thought he's probably busy with school work. And one day I woke up and saw a few new messages. They were from him. He said he's not feeling us anymore and asked if we can just be close friends. I was a bit shocked at first but accepted it quickly. To be honest, I really always knew we weren't gonna work. He told me that he will still be there for me since he knew I was going through a hard time. (I have been having mental health issues since early 2017, but at the time I was doing the worst I had been doing so far). At first, it was okay, I was doing well and I didn't put my mind into it but then he started to tell in discord about a girl he met in college. He told me she was the cutest ever and everything. I encouraged him to talk to her but at the same time, I felt so weird having him talk about a new girl literally like six days after he broke up with me. \n\nEven if I knew we weren't going to work, I felt like some kind of a worn-out toy that had just been replaced. I knew he develops feelings fast but I was still starting to question our relationship even more. Was it all ever serious for him? It was for me since I rarely like someone who likes me back and he was one of them, and now it seemed like he didn't like me that much after all. I felt pretty betrayed, but I kept going for him since he didn't realize that I was doing badly and I didn't want to ruin his joy. I mean he got new friends in college, apparently, a new girlfriend (after 2 weeks breaking up with me) and I didn't want to ruin take the joy from him by whining. \n\nHowever, the next thing I realized is that he didn't talk to me anymore. At all. I tried to talk to him because I felt like he didn't want to be my friend anymore and I felt like we were drifting apart. He never answered my messages so I gave up. Even if I didn't want to lose him, I was tired of trying to keep in touch with someone who didn't talk to me anymore. I was still in the chat but it was exhausting. You see, I was going through the hardest time with my mental health issues (That were the most severe atm) and I was trying to deal with the breakup. I tried to navigate my feelings on something else, I worked out and drew and it did help not gonna lie. \n\nHowever, at some point, I couldn't take it anymore. Seeing him talking only and every day about her new girlfriend. Like honestly, all the time. We hadn't shared a word for weeks at this point, and I was about to lose my mind not knowing what to do. While trying to focus on y studies and having this all in my mind, I was having a hard time. Like probably hardest than I can remember. I made the decision to leave him for good. I uninstalled discord, unfollowed him anywhere I could, and made sure I didn't have to see him anymore. I only talk to the friends I made in discord. He didn't seem to care since I didn't hear from him for 5 months.\n\nALRIGHT now to the real deal. I received a message from him last night. He said he misses me and wants to be friends with me again. I said that even if I have forgiven him, I'm emotionally unable to be in touch with him anymore. I explained that even if he doesn't understand what he did wrong, I know that I don't hold any grudges and he doesn't have to be mad at himself but I cannot be friends with him anymore. It took me long not to think about him every day, 24/7 and now that I have gone through it, I really want to close that chapter of my life for good. \n\nHe called me selfish for not even trying to be friends with him? I tried to explain that after all that I just can't and he said I'm a selfish bitch.\n\nAITA? I personally think no but oh well, you tell me",

      "description": "Never used Reddit before, so sorry if I fuck up. Read about this community and figure'd it'd be interesting.\n\nSo, at my school, I get on with the majority of people. I don't really care what they're like otherwise, as long as they're fine with me. But there's someone - we'll call them Alex - who's just so *annoying*.\n\nI started talking to them when I got sat next to them in Maths, and they were fine at first. A little bit shy, but I didn't really think anything of it.  Eventually, a few weeks passed, and we started talking a little more on Snapchat (nothing big, just kind of commenting on eachother's stories or whatever bullshit). \n\nBut then, one day, they come into class with visible and fresh cuts in a short sleeved T-shirt. It's moderate weather here. You would be fine in a long sleeved shirt or a jumper. I don't comment on it, because it's not my job, I don't want to be a therapist, I barely know this person and I kind of feel weird about overly emotional stuff like this. It also kind of annoys me, if I'm being honest. Seems like a desperate bid for attention. I act like I don't see the cuts and act normally with them. They keep looking at them, but again, I act like I have absolutely no idea! Can't see shit!\n\nA week later, when things are somewhat normal again, they message me on Snapchat. It says \"hey, can I talk to you about something?\" or something to that effect. This person does have friends, by the way. There is no reason they should choose me as their confidant. I barely know this person.\n\nSo I just say \"I guess?\". They then proceed to tell me about how saaaad they are recently, making it seem so poetic and tragic. It's like some shitty essay. I get it probably sucks, but get a therapist! Talk to a teacher! I have to bite the urge to just call them a pathetic, attention seeking fuck. I just reply with something along the lines of \"you probably have depression, go get some help or something. I can't do shit all.\". They just respond with all the reasons they feel like they can't do that (too embarrassed, feel hopeless, I think there was more but I don't really remember). I then point out that they told me, who is basically a stranger to them, so why not someone else? They say that they feel they can \"trust me\", for some reason. I just tell them I cannot do anything. It's left alone. I was pretty blunt, honestly.\n\nIt's left alone. Then, a few days later, they message me AGAIN asking to talk to me about something?!?! Like I didn't make it clear enough?! I  tell them I would rather not do that as I don't really know them and am busy. They just say it's fine and that they appreciate me listening to them before. I talk to other people in that lesson now. They're just...Too draining. \n\n",

      "description": "My friend, Josh, started talking to this girl, Anna, recently. I dislike Anna because of a lot of reasons â Anna used to be best friends with another one of my close friends, Sarah. Sarah cut off Anna eventually because she had a boyfriend and introduced Anna to him as friends, and they started hanging out behind her back and lying to her and ended up getting together after Sarah and her bf broke up. The year after, Anna did this SAME exact thing with another one of my friends, who like she to give people chances and for close to her somehow. Same story, she lied to her behind her back and talked to her bf. Anna also cheated on her last boyfriend with a guy who had been in a relationship for over a year, and although itâs both of their faults, Anna never told her bf when they broke up, but the other guy told his gf. \n\nJosh isnât aware of Annaâs history, and Josh and I arenât too close. Weâre more like acquanitices, however, I really like Josh as a person and heâs a pretty chill and nice guy. I can easily see Anna fucking him over, especially since Joshâs last relationship was toxic and heâs still somewhat vulnerable.\n\nWIBTA if I told Josh about Annaâs past? I think he should just know how sheâs lied to her best friends and ruined a few relationships, in addition to cheating on her boyfriend. He can do whatever he wants with the info, Iâm not gonna try to convince him to break it off with her, but if I started talking to a guy, Id wanna know if he had a bad history and messed up a lot of people. Iâm not sure if itâs my business still or not, but I just donât want Josh to get hurt. Also, Iâm 100% sure Josh doesnât know because heâs not in my immediate circle of friends and people in outside groups dont really know about Anna. ",

She is still bi. I don't think her history matters in her identity. \n\nOne day, she was complaining that her family was homophobic. I offered sympathy and supported her. She didn't thank me for my sympathy and just said she was sad that she could never come out to her family. \n\nMe: I guess good thing you have a fiance? Not a fiancee?\n\nI then shared a story of having to lie to my family about my first relationship because they would react negatively if I came out to them.\n\nShe responded that only having been with dudes didn't make her any less bi and ignored what I said about my family because she wanted to complain about how she worried that, if she ever had kids and if those kids ever ended up being anything but straight, her family wouldn't accept them. \n\nI think she was hurt because she thought I was erasing her sexuality.

He stated he would and fast forward 2 months later he still owes Chad the money and we have yet to see it. He is now claiming he never made this agreement yet chatlogs say otherwise.\n\nHere are the chat logs (backed up by screenshots, there was also another observer in the group chat who will corroborate.):\n\nChad:\n    âIF YOU PAY ME $15 PAYPALâ\n    âI WILL HOST ITâ\n    â24/7â\n\nHumphrey:\n    âOkayâ\n\nDylan:\n    âHumphrey you owe me $15â\n\nHumphrey:\n    âJust get a fucking serverâ\n\nHe is claiming he used \"Okay\" as an adverb and not an exclamation.

      "description": "Hi all. As well as this being an AITA, I also wonder if I was too sensitive or weak in this situation.\n\nA day ago, my sister and I were talking while she put on her makeup, and she talked about how she felt her nose was too wide and hated it. I told her that it's a perfectly fine nose, and that I couldn't see the wideness she was talking about.\n\nShe nodded and replied \"no offence, but if I had your nose, I'd get surgery. JK\". I laughed with her, but internally I'm thinking \"ouch\".\n\nLater on, I checked out my nose in the mirror and saw how ridiculously upturned it is, and I just get that sinking sensation in my stomach. Before I know it, I'm googling upturned noses and all the results are surgical fixes or even worse, pigs. My best friend spent the night trying to tell me my nose is fine.\n\nI tried to bring it up with my mum that I'm not comfortable with these comments, and she replied I'm being too sensitive and that all siblings talk like that to each other.\n\nFrom my point of view, I found it pretty hurtful because I was bullied heavily for my appearance, and it's a pretty sore spot for me. I have anxiety, so I end up getting intrusive thoughts about my appearance frequently, and pointing out my nose is very upturned has agitated that pretty badly.\n\nFrom my sister's point of view, she pointed out she said \"JK\" after the comment, so I should have realised she was making a joke. She said I was laughing too, so she didn't think it was that big of a deal. My mum feels I'm too sensitive to these kind of comments and that I read into it too much.\n\nWhat do you guys think? AITA for taking the comment to heart?",

It was weird but I forgot about it until at the end of class she mentioned it again. My thoughts started swirling around Hannibal Lecter. \n\nThe thing is that isn't just one misguided and weird person. A lot of the class were speaking about my skin.

The guy is head over heels in love with her, and she could honestly care less. She says she loves him, but does not see a forever with him. She is hung up on one of our other mutual friends and we will call him Max. Well my friends has had feelings for max for 3 years, and she has expressed them to her. He says heâs scared to do anything about his feelings towards her and doesnât want to mess up the friend group. So he had been in a relationship the last year and completely disappeared. My friend was hurt but moved on to her current boyfriend. Well max has reappeared because his relationship failed. Now my friend is in her relationship but thinks of max all the time. Iâve told her she either needs to end it with her current, or forget about max and move on. She talks about Max NON STOP. Even in front of her boyfriend!!! Mad and my friend were fuck buddies like 6 times and her current boyfriend knows about it, so you can see he gets irritated when she talks so highly of him. Well my friend cheated on her boyfriend with Max two weeks ago. She told me when we were all drunk at a bar and her boyfriend was outside with the rest of the group. So I sat awkwardly with the group all night trying not to say anything to him about it because she promised to tell him the next day. She did tell him, and she told him that she doesnât not see a real future with him but likes what they have now. He is okay with it because he thinks he can change her mind. She says she feels awful and regrets it so much. But I get a text today saying âhey Iâm meeting max for some drinks tonight. Anyone wanna join?â So I responded in the group chat saying âare you a fucking idiot?â And everyone was like â oh my god why are you being so rude?â Eventfully we moved to a private chat where I asked why she would even contact max again, at least this soon, after she just told her boyfriend she wonât hang with Max again. \nAITA for calling her out? Her boyfriend is my friend too and I know he doesnât know sheâs meeting with him. Iâm friends with all 3 people and itâs so hard for me not to lose my shit on them all. \n\n\nTLDR; my friend cheated on her boyfriend and he forgave her, then a week later starts hanging out with the guy she cheated on her boyfriend with.

      "description": "So theres not too much to say, I guess I'm more curious in others opinions on this.  I am an approx 22.5 year old man, I recently snagged a really really good job.  I work as a corporate level administrator in the trucking industry.  It's been a pretty sweet gig so far and have no complaints as of yet (2 months in). I would also like to preface the following with saying that I work with a very diverse staff of coworkers who are all as professional as they can be, rarely is it that someone cant pull their own weight. \n\nAbout a week ago I was walking through the parking lot to my car after the end of the day, and I was looking at the sunset through the chain link fence.  As my eyes darted around i happened to notice a pink metal plate bolted onto the fence, I thought to myself \"woah, what's that and how did i not notice it before?\" So i started reading it and I was immediately greeted with slight disappointment.  Basically, it read as follows \"FEMALE EMPLOYEE PARKING SPACE ONLY!\" with a large symbol in the middle of the sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  \n\nNow, let me clarify I am not \"Irate\" or \"fuming\" about it, but I dont really buy into the whole chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld *fedora intensifies*.  I even asked my fiance when I got home, just to get a female insight on it.  She said she thought it was stupid.  I guess I'm just coming from the territory of you can show that your a diverse company dedicated to equality, without making tedious or unimportant decisions like special parking.  Just my two cents on it though. ",

      "description": "My dad gave me his car to drive for awhile. I want to purchase that car from him at a retail price. He needs 6000 for a loan, but retail value for the car is 4500. At most, it was around 6000 for a really low mileage excellent car. It's not excellent, but it has 60k miles for a 2006 which is pretty low. \n\n  \nHe wants 6,000 and I agree, but only in words until I got a real estimate. The loan writer said I was getting a bad deal, and he wouldn't write it for 6,000 since it retailed at 4,500. I offer 5,000 to my dad instead - he basically goes ballistic. He begins to bring up cars I had driven in college from him, and how I owed him for that still, and that I owed him value of the car that I had driven over the past year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat might be fair, but there was no expectation of this when I started driving it. I was between jobs, and needed something. Now I've fallen in love with the car. I can't really afford much as it is, and spending 1500 over retail scared me. I've actually put a few oil changes in, had it serviced, and detailed thoroughly. Not a lot of money, but 600 at least over the last year.   \n\n\nIn the end he's agreed to 5000, but has continued to guilt me about the cars in the past, and the value lost from me driving it (&gt;5000 miles).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not paying 6000?",

At that youth group, a guy that Hannah sat with had a drink, and Hannah took a sip of it. \n\nApparently, this guy was somebody who Jen and Hannah both liked. Hannah goes up to her and goes âdonât do thatâ (supposedly as a joke) but Hannah took it the wrong way because she thinks Jen hates her all the time (I donât know if she does or not...) \n\nHannah starts to cry and walks into the bathroom to cool down, Red walks in and the following conversation ensues:\n\nRed: âyou good?â\n\nHannah: âdonât talk to meâ\n\nRed: âalright, be like thatâ *slams door* \n\n(note, I only learned about the last sentence of the conversation after Hannah told me, Red tried to lie about it to make her sound better)\n\nRed starts to talk shit about Hannah behind her back, and I go to my first period (with Hannah)\n\nI talk to Hannah about it, and she tells me about the real conversation she had. She also said she was sad because she canât tell Red anything without her telling it to Jen.\n\nI talk to Red about it at lunch, and she not only admits to lying, but keeps to her story that Hannahâs annoying because she abruptly stops talking to her to talk to this other girl (that Hannah wants to go out with)\n\nI try to tell her that Hannahâs just nervous because she likes her and she wants to spend time with her.\n\nShe said, and I quote: âshe can fuck off if she wants to, I donât care, sheâs a bitch anywaysâ\n\nI put my hand down, got off the stool I was on (we were on a high table with stools) and said she was the one acting like a bitch. Then walked away. \n\nNote: Im really close with Hannah, and I hated to see her talk down to her, I may have overreacted a little bit but I donât think I was in the wrong.\n\nSorry about the first post, I wrote it pretty fast, this one has a lot more context.",

      "description": "TLDR\nDog is 14 slightly deaf, has cataracts and occasional joint pain. I have been forced to be her primary caregiver now that I live with my mom again.\n\n10 years ago my mom got a four year old black lab mix for my sister who was 16.\nTwo years later my sister moved out and mom kept her dog. \n\nMom worked and lived alone. Unfortunately Dog was not sufficiently socialized or housebroken. \nMom kept her in a crate from 11pm to 5am when she would put her out back for an hour before work. Then back in the crate from 6am to 5:30pm when she would get home, feed her and put her out again until dark, between 7pm and 9pm depending on the season. \n\nShe barked at everything but never bit and she would jump on everyone and try and lay on you. Her nails were never trimmed consistently so the jumping was problematic.\n\nMy sister moved back home a couple of times over the years and so the dog got out of her crate and outside more often but never trained or socialized. She's had accidents at least once a months for years. My mom and sister also struggled to keep her free of fleas so her skin wasn't very healthy.\n\nI moved back home recently and my sister doesn't live here right now. \nI noticed she had issues getting up in the mornings, her hind legs would tremble and she would limp, whine or even yelp after putting weight them.\nI took the crate away and put it in storage. She sleeps on a comforter with a potty pad over it.\nShe's on medication for her joint pain now and itâs helped immensely, as has keeping her out of the crate and getting her more exercise. \n\nHer skin is healed completely and she no longer has fleas or ear mites.\nShe cannot hear very well and she has cataracts. She is having more and more accidents and has to wear diapers when not outside. \n\nI haven't trimmed her nails yet because I've never trimmed any animals nails before and I'm scared I'll hurt her.\n\nI love her but it feels so selfish to let her linger without dignity and in pain\nMom won't take her to the vet because she thinks they will put her down and then my sister will blame my mom.\n\nSome mornings I wish she had died in her sleep and I hate myself for thinking it.\nThanks for reading.\n",

      "description": "Alright this is my first post on reddit, but I would really like to know if I am in the wrong in this situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis situation happened two years ago on my birthday. I was opening presents from family and most were things I enjoy or asked for. Then there were things that I got that I didn't like so much. Those were from my grandparents. I have four sets of grandparents, and I have had a lot of arguments with all of them because they are generally stuck in the mud types of people. For example, the grandparents that live close to me and where actually at the party (because they lived close enough) gave me a cook book for kids and a book called something like H*ow to be a Good Teenage Girl*. To me these presents were a bit insulting, but I wasn't going to make a scene or anything so I just say thank you and move on. They have always been fine with this. My other grandparents however, don't live close and are even more out of touch with me. They will also often waste their money on presents that don't suite me at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo these grandparents gave me some travel bag with a gaudy design on it and a card they bought that explains the bag is $60. I say thank you out loud but they obviously wouldn't hear since they are at their home that is hours away from me. About a week passes and my mom comes to me saying I should text my grandparents thanking them for the present they gave me. I look at her puzzled because that is something my family has never done for anyone, and the present they gave me seemed to have zero thought into it. My mom tells me that they have been nagging her on her phone saying that I should be more grateful and have more manners and should text them thank you. She normally will do this her self but this time they were ordering that I give the thank you because I was a teenager and could do things on my own and it would be more sincere and meaningful coming from the source. I didn't want to but I did. I simply texted my grandma saying \"thank you for the bag I love it.\" and then I go on with my day. That was apparently wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom woke up to an extremely long text saying that I was being so incredibly rude. They said things like my thank you didn't seem sincere, that I should have done the thank you sooner, and I should have sent the thank you to both of them. This annoyed me even more, but this time I just ignored it and so did my mom. This entire dilemma happened on Christmas too with both me and my sister apparently being mean granddaughters because we didn't want to send them a thank you text especially because we knew they would just continue to complain about how our thank you wasn't sincere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I actually just rude for not wanting to give my grandparents a thank you text? Or am I in the right in this situation because they shouldn't be asking for a thank you. Or are we both in the wrong? I would like to see this from your guys perspective.",

He's in the army, he then went away with work for 6 weeks. Came back this week and got in touch with my bestie to see if he could go see the kids.\n\nSo I had originally said I was fine with him seeing the kids etc. Because I'm a grown ass woman and they are kids and punishing them cause he's the captain of asshattery is a childish thing to do... This weekend the time has actually come. He's taken her, her partner (with whom I'm also very close) and their smallest bambino out for tea. To a place I sometimes take them.\n\nLike I was kind of okay with him going to see the kids at their house. But this place has a huge play area so the small feral thing won't be where he is. Like the kid will be off playing in the play area so basically he's just out for dinner with my two closest friends. And suddenly with the force of a tsunami I am NOT okay with him doing that. Like want to cry/scream, jaw clenching hands shaking not okay.\n\nAnd I really want to be okay with it. Because I'm a grown up, and I feel like I should be okay with it. But Idk it's like I'm worried they'll prefer hanging around with him than me.\n\nSo am I the asshole for changing my mind? ",

      "description": "My ex and I met a year ago, and he was my dream guy. We had the same interests and values, and we were super open with each other and always made sure to communicate, which is something I care about a lot in a relationship. All throughout the relationship, he told me he was agnostic, which I am too. \n\nLast week, out of the blue, he tells me he's a Christian. He said a month ago he spoke to God, which made him believe in the Bible and want to live a sinless life (no cursing, no drinking, no premarital sex, etc.). This also meant he had to one day marry a Christian woman. He wanted to be with me still, but he was also hoping that I'd follow his example and turn to God as well.\n\nThat's where the problem liee: I've never been a believer, I've tried multiple times but didn't think it was for me, and I don't think I should fundamentally change who I am as a person just to be with him. On top of that, I was very upset that he didn't mention the fact that he was considering making this transition, since this affects our relationship significantly. So even though I still love him very much, I decided to break up. \n\nA week later, and now I'm regretting it. Was I being too harsh and inconsiderate? Did I disrespect his religion? I thought the break up was because he wasn't being honest with me and now I'm not so sure anymore. ",

      "description": "TLDR at bottom. \n\n\nFeeling gaslit, hoping Iâm not the asshole but I sure feel like one now. \n\nThe father of my kids and I separated 6 months ago. Legal process has not been started yet, but we have been acting separated with joint custody. Kids are 2 and 4 years old. I keep them for 10 days at a time and then he has the kids for that amount of time - this works around his work schedule. We still live together but when my ex is home I spend most days at friends or families homes. \n\nSo on my exes days with the kids now, I am going away to a yoga and meditation retreat for 5 days. He asked if Iâll be Face Timing every day for the kids. I said no. 1, we will be in a rural area with little to no cell service, 2, Iâve reached the data cap on my phone, and 3, I just spent 10 stressful days with them carting them around visiting family for the holidays and I could really use a break.\n\nHe called me an asshole. Then he got his parents involved and they canât believe how cold hearted I am being and how I have the audacity to go on this retreat in the first place because âwhat do I need to meditate on?, whatâs more important than spending time during New Years with my kids and ex?â\n\nEx is demanding I take photos to prove where Iâm going, and I refused. His parents got it in his head Iâm lying and am probably going to spend a week with a new lover (I donât have a lover.)\n\n2nd point. We have had a joint credit card for the duration of our relationship. I feel Iâm entitled to half of the points on it, and discovered I can use the points to book a very very cheap round trip flight to Europe. Iâd have accommodations and food provided the whole time through my girl friends family/friends she has in Europe. I have been wanting to do a girls trip for many years, but have never had the funds and then young kids took my time priority. Iâm planning this trip during a time my ex has the kids, and with my own earned money plus credit card points. \n\nMy ex, and his overly involved family, are calling me the asshole. Saying I have my priorities screwed up. Saying how the points arenât mine, never were. They should be only used to take the kids on a Disneyland trip, which has never been discussed prior. Exes dad says heâs glad my ex is rid of me because I am just a spendthrift with no concern for paying off our debts (mortgage, vehicle, and credit card) and that I need to grow up and get my head out of my ass and realize I can travel when Iâm retired and thereâs no need to travel in my 20âs - itâs ridiculous and childish and shows Iâm an unloving mother. My exes mom says she canât believe I would do this, and sheâs very taken aback and surprised I would even think about a trip when my kids are this age. \n\nMy ex has been blowing up my phone all day with claims of me being a cold hearted bitch whoâs just trying to ruin him, and how any cent of money I earn needs to be divided with him and go towards making debt payments. My ex earns about 100k a year, while I have only started making an income after being a stay home mom for 4 years. I sell art online and do commission sewing work. I now make about $4-500 a month which we previously agreed was my spending money for myself, and that this amount would be taken off of alimony payments. \n\nWith having 3 people calling me an asshole over wanting to travel and take a retreat, my head is spinning and Iâm feeling gaslighted. Am I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTLDR: I want to take a yoga retreat for New Years, and later in 2019 take a girls trip to Europe that would be extremely affordable with credit card points, and knowing people in Europe who will provide food and lodging. My ex and his family think Iâm the asshole for having messed up priorities and claim Iâm abandoning my kids (2 and 4 years old) even though my trips fall during time my ex is with the kids. They donât understand why I donât want to FaceTime my kids every day during my retreat, and say I should be putting every cent I earn into paying off debt instead of gallivanting across the world pretending to be a single unattached lady. My ex says the credit card points arenât mine to use because Iâve been unemployed for 4 years so all money spent earning points was his money.  ",

She's a small but energetic terrier puppy of 5 months old. She's not yet well trained, we've only had her since Xmas. \n\nMy dog is always happy to see my family, and often jumps up on them. I try to combat this with swats on the butt as I take her away from the person. \n\nThe whole time I've been here has been a big discussion about training my pup which I wasn't interested in having. I wasn't going to shut them down, but wouldnt trust their advice on the matter. \n\nAnyway, the dog did the jumping thing on my aunt and I immediately ran forward to grab her away, and my mom was suggesting I take the dog to my sister's room, which I agreed was a good idea. Before I could cross the small living room to my aunt and the dog, she had my dog pinned town by her neck. Shebwas fighting and whining. When I tried to take her, hands on my dog, she still wasn't letting her go. I had to pull her away from her. \n\nI cant say anything, because with my family I'm the guilty party in any situation, but I am very upset by her manhandling my dog like that. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? And any tips to show a strong willed dog that you are the alpha of the pack would be greatly appreciated.",

      "description": "For some background, I am Korean, and both my boyfriend and his friend are white. \n\nMy current boyfriend just finished his masters, and is about to live independently for the first time. As he just finished university, funds are quite low and arranged to move out with a classmate of his who got a job in the same company. \n\nAs both of their work schedules are quite busy, they are looking for a place that has quick and easy public transport to/from work and is not too expensive. My boyfriend also hoping to find a place close to where I live (I still live with my parents since I am still studying) so that it will be easy for us to see each other. \n\nI suggested that my boyfriend look for a place in the suburb I currently live in or surrounding suburbs. I thought this was a good idea as it is about 20 min to work and is far away enough from the CBD so rent is relatively cheap. It is also close enough to their work so if they needed to catch a cab to work it wouldnât break the bank. We also have 4 shopping centres within 15 min walk and is a very safe neighbourhood with mostly families living in the area.  Basically a pretty ideal place for them to live. \n\nHowever his friend has vetoed this entire area as it is well known that there is a high Asian population. I got offended, and said I found that quite offensive and was pretty racist. He said he âwouldnât fit inâ, and it would âlook weird walking around as the only white guy within 10kmâ. Literally his only quarrel with this place is that there are too many Asian people. \n\nSo we had an argument about whether or not that was racist, and now my boyfriend is mad at me and defending him. My boyfriend thinks itâs fair for his friend to not want to live in a certain area. And I agree with him, but I think if the ONLY reason is that there are too many Asian people then that makes him a racist. \n\nSo tell me reddit, AITA? ",

Im INCREDIBLY lucky and forever thankful that my parents help support my studies and my dreams and I love and care for them very much. \n\nI have a part time position as a groundskeeper at my mothers place of work which she got me one summer I was struggling to find a job (yet another reason I love her). I love being there and I have a great relationship with everybody there so if I have some free time Iâll go do some work for the weekends to make some money. \n\nItâs spring break and it has been a HELL of a semester. All I wanted to do when I got home was relax. I sit down for about 5 minutes when I get a call from my mother asking if Iâd be willing to work over the week. I politely told her I was really trying to have some me time and would rather not this week when she said âhold on let me put âmy bossâ on the phoneâ. She then puts me on speakerphone with my boss who goes into great detail on how much work needed to be done and what a help it would be if I went. I. Was. LIVID. I hardly said anything, to which they both laughed off and said âoh heâs angry!â. Not wanting to seem like an ass I just agreed t everything and when I got off the phone I lost my shit. I was so angry and frustrated that she would put me in that sort of position. It was awkward and uncomfortable. My father heard all of this and immediately took my side, texting her telling her she was in the wrong. She tried to call me all day and I didnât pick up. I ended up calling my boss back and explaining why I was angry and that I would work one day and get all the important stuff done, which he thankfully understood and accepted. Once I cooled down enough and my mother cane home I calmly but coldly told her how I felt, and she seemed to understand but also seemed upset. \n\nSo AITA for being mad about being put in that position?

      "title": "AITA for planning on not paying rent to my roommates for April?",
      "description": "I'm getting married in May and will be moving out shortly on April 12.\n\nI moved in 3 years ago with my two original roommates J &amp; P.\n\nP is the oldest and handles the bills (all accounts are in his name) and J is his brother. Because they are brothers, I feel I am nothing but a glorified guest having no say in anything that happens in the house.\n\nWhen I moved in 3 years ago, rent was $600 excluding utilities. I moved in the beginning of the second week of August. When I moved in, I had to pay my portion of the house deposit along with a portion of one month's rent security deposit plus the two weeks of the month I was going to be there. This totaled up to roughly $500 before utilities.\n\nLong story short, my roommates ended up bringing in another friend to room with them (without my say behind my back), with the landlord increasing rent to $800/month to accommodate the extra person and work being done to the house. We will call this roommate N. N moved in the first week of January 2017. J &amp; P decided not to make him have to pay a portion of the deposit, month's rent deposit or even make him pay for the three weeks he stayed before the next billing period.\n\nJ moved out 2.5 months before the lease was officially supposed to end because he was getting married in May as he got a new apartment. He asked myself and roommates if it was okay if he skipped rent. He offered to pay his portion, but my roommates decided that as a wedding \"gift\" they wouldn't make him pay. They agreed it was okay even against what I wanted. Mind you: N makes roughly $18/hour from cooping with a mechanical engineering firm, P making $70k per year as a Mechanical Engineer. At the time I was making $10/hour barely scraping by. I ended up paying the extra money that my roommate skipped out on.\n\nTwo roommates replaced J a few months later, getting the same treatment N got not having to pay any portion of rent for the month or any deposit. *Side note: Only one of the two is actually on the lease, something the agreement forbids.* While I have appreciated the rent being cheaper because of having more roommates, I feel even more excluded as they're all very good friends with each other. When I brought up the conversation with P about me moving out on the 12 of April, he said he wanted me to pay a full month's rent for April and said \"to be honest, I guess I could float you, but I feel you should really pay for May too.\" I reminded him of the verbal agreement I made with them about me being able to skip out like J did, although he claims he never remembers that conversation.  \nI am silently deciding to not pay rent for April. I don't mind paying utilities for the month of March as that is stuff I used, but I feel like I shouldn't pay rent for April whatsoever after the slack they cut their friends. It's not like they'll be out any more money than I was when J left early. Maybe IATA, but that's up to you, what do you think?",

      "description": "My ex and I have been separated/divorced for just over a year now. Our daughter is 6 and our son is 3. We have shared custody (I get the kids from Saturday to Tuesday, they stay with her Tuesday-Saturday) but I have expressed to her that I think she should either take the kids more often or at least spend more time with our daughter. I admit that I didnât do a lot of the kid stuff before and itâs been hard figuring out how to shop for their clothes and do the school activities. My ex stayed home with the kids since we had our first so she took over most of this stuff while I worked. But now sheâs working again and doesnât want to take the kids an extra day. I completely understand that she has to work sometimes but I think it would be in our daughters best interest if she spent more time with her. I think I can connect well with my son and can usually guess what clothes/toys/games he will like and we have a great time. Itâs more challenging with a girl as I donât have the same experience like with my son and I think itâs resonable for my ex to take over some things like doing stuff together on the weekends and talking to her about girl things. Since sheâs getting older it seems like it would benefit her more to spend more time with her mom. When I ask my ex if she would her or both the kids for just an extra day she gets super irritated with me. I donât want to have a bad relationship with her and of course I love my kids and Iâm just trying my best here.",

      "description": "So I work in a retail/pharmacy chain which I will refrain from naming. I am a supervisor... essentially for the retail side of things. (A step below assistant manager let's say) It's actually kind of unclear if I have any authority over RX employees, so I mostly just play nice and help as needed/avoid trying to tell them to do anything.\n\nThis incident in particular happened a few years ago, right when I was still sort of new to my position. My job even before I got promoted required a lot of running around, stocking shelves, helping customers find things, resolving issues at the cash registers (this place really prides itself on excellent customer service).\n\nOne day I'm going around on a particularly busy day. I think I was juggling 2 customers at once and had just heard my name called on the intercom for something up front. I had just spotted and grabbed an item I was looking for for 1 of my customers when one of the RX employees also in the back room calls my name. I'm a little annoyed but I try my best to answer politely.\n\nShe is back there looking for some sort of supplies for the pharmacy, and to this day I still don't know what she even wanted. She pointed to  the paper she had in her hand and asked me if I knew where \"this\" is. It was a series of numbers and letters, presumably an identification for the item she needed. \n\nI told her \"no, I don't know where it is.\" She responds by asking me to find it for her. Not \"help me look for it\" but \"do it for me.\" Up until that point all she was doing was staring off into space on front of the shelves and not even so much as lifting a finger to look through boxes to find the item.\n\nAt this point I'm annoyed that I've kept other people waiting, tell her I'm still confused as to what it is she was looking for (she didn'teven seem to know either), and that I was kind of busy as it was. I leave the back room to carry out the task at hand. She makes a face at me and makes her way to the back door as well, going so far as to overtake me and beat me to the door. Whatever I tell myself, everything is peachy after that for me right? Nope...\n\nAbout an hour later the manager pulls me aside in the back room. The conversation, or rather scolding, went something like this.\n\n\"Listen (my name) I'm only gonna say this once. When one of the girls in the pharmacy asks you for help, you help them. I don't care how busy you think you are.\"\n\nHe then walked away and left me there feeling dumbfounded. He made it clear by his tone that he didn't care what I had to say about the situation. I wasn't going to push it because I had anxiety about loosing my job at that point. To this day that situation still bothers me. I feel as if he was treating me unfairly and that the woman had played up what happened to make me out to be the asshole. I swear on my life that what I've told is the most accurate representation of what happened... so really, am I the asshole here?",

      "title": "AITA for hating my autistic sister-in-law?",
      "description": "(Cross-posted from r/relationships)\n\nSome background: my partner (43F) and I (34F) have an excellent, mutually supportive relationship. Her parents are great as well, and have really embraced me as family, which is nice as I'm estranged from my homophobic, controlling parents. Partner and I have been together for four years. We have an adorable five month old baby. Life is pretty damn great.\n\nThe only black spot in our relationship is her sister, my sister in law (40F). I simply hate her. I find her so detestable that it is difficult for me to make eye contact and smile when I see her.\n\nTO be entirely fair to SIL, I can be a grumpy introvert who takes a while to warm up to people. She is high-functioning ASD, what used to be called Asperger's, and isn't good at reading social cues - so she steps over my boundaries without meaning to.\n\nBut here are the things I hate about her:\n\n\\- She is completely dependent on her parents: she lived with them a year ago until they bought her a house and moved her into it. She is 40 years old. She calls her mother at least twice a day, for an hour each time, because she can't stand being alone. They drive her everywhere and go to all of her appointments with her etc. She gets a small disability allowance, and apart from that they pay all her bills. This is reasonable - after all, she has a disability - but she is SO RUDE to them. She treats them like crap and just takes for granted everything they do for her. For me, coming from parents who never nurtured or cared for me, it is really frustrating to see her not appreciate any of the many, many things they do for her.\n\n\\- She completely lacks self-awareness. She thinks she is really calm and chill and self-aware. SHE'S NOT. She's anxious AF and makes everyone else around her jumpy with her annoying behaviour.\n\nCase in point: We went out for lunch today for my partner's birthday; me, my partner, our baby, my MIL and FIL and SIL.  It was a pretty fancy schmancy restaurant, which she doesn't cope well with anyway - she gets loud, makes stupid jokes and does her nervous hysterical cackle at the drop of a hat. However, today she decided she didn't like anything on the menu and sulked. My partner asked her not to make alterations (because in the past she's been really rude to waiters, to the point of making a childish face when she doesn't like what they offer). When my partner requested this, she burst into tears and ran off to the toilet. When she came back she sulked and refused to talk to the waiter, meaning that my MIL had to order for her. She ended up getting an alteration anyway. \n\nArgh. There are a million other things that I could list that irritate me about her, but the TL;DR is that she's rude, ungrateful, and lacks self-awareness.\n\nSo, Reddit: Am i the asshole? Should I be more considerate of her limitations and more understanding of her disability?\n\n&amp;#x200B; I saw SIL today and managed to have a pleasant conversation with her! It turns out sheâs not too bad one-on-one, which I never realised because Iâd always avoided her. Thanks Reddit! It helped to consider some of your suggestions, especially the ones about lowering expectations. ",

I donât know her super well personally, but itâs always been a friend of a friend type thing.  Iâve heard plenty of stories where she was involved, itâs a small town and stuff like that gets around.  \n\nSheâs a party girl.  Not just alcohol and weed either, but some hard drugs.  Sheâs also been in so many fights Iâve lost track of the stories.  She has a police record as well.  My ex can date whoever he wants, more power to him if thatâs what heâs into these days, but I donât want someone like that around my children. \n\nI talked to my ex about my concerns and that I would that when he has our kids she not be around them.  Heâs refusing my request saying sheâs an important part of his life (after dating like 3 months) and itâs unreasonable for me to expect him not to see her every other week.  I told him that I would be willing to take them for a night or two during his time if he really canât be without her, but he refused that too.  \n\nIâm not trying to police his life, I just feel like I should feel safe leaving my children with him.

      "description": "We are in our early 20s (20-21). \n\nMy boyfriend works night shift, from 10pm - 3am. Because of this, Iâve had to poorly adjust my schedule to accomodate and spend enough time with him. \n\nTonight, we made plans hours and hours in advance that he would come to my place after work, sleep over, and then go with me tomorrow to pick up his late Christmas gift to me which has been put off for almost a month now due to extenuating circumstances. \n\nAround 12am he sends me a message saying his friends parents are out of town and wants to do acid, but wants my bf to trip sit him. Bf said he would do it for 1-2 hours, making the approx time of his arrival to mine 5:30am. He also specified that he might just crash at his friends house instead if heâs too tired to drive to mine. \n\nI was really annoyed with this, because for one we made plans first and I feel like heâs backing out, I also feel like heâs prioritising his friends want to do acid over things that need to be done. \n\nI donât like that I feel that Iâm competing with his friend doing acid. I also stated I donât want to wait up 5 hours for him only for him to say âhey too tired, gonna crash hereâ effectively fucking up my sleeping pattern more than it already has been since heâs started night shift.\n\nNormally I am very accommodating and generous with him. He has always been âindecisiveâ and often does things like this where plans are made and something else comes up. He claims itâs a character flaw whereas I believe he is just chronically lazy and has his priorities in the wrong place. \n\nI also donât like that heâs put me in a position where if I get upset or say no to him seeing his friend I will seem like a party pooper or a nag. I basically lose either way. \n\nI feel pretty sad now side I was looking forward to seeing him, but now I donât want to anymore. \n\nAITA? \n\nTl;dr - made plans with bf, bf tries going back on them to help his friend do acid and expects me to mess up my sleep cycle even more to accomodate.

      "description": "Three-ish years ago I got pregnant due to BC failure, but and we decided to keep the baby. However, husband basically stopped doing any childcare a few months into her life. In addition, despite knowing how hard childcare is to get into, he was somehow surprised that I ended up having to stay at home. He made up an impossible budget and wouldn't give me access to a shared bank account so I had to use up my savings for basics like food and diapers.\n\n \n\n I finally got a job a some months ago. I'm hourly but work full-time, I commute 3 hours total a day, do all daycare drop offs and pickups, doctor's appointments, housework, shopping, etc. He barely comes home, let alone do anything around the house (when daughter looks at pictures on my phone, she doesn't even know who he is). If daughter is sick or her daycare is closed, he refuses to take off, so I use up my paid days quickly and usually end up not getting paid a couple days/month. His only contribution is paying for rent/utilities and some living expenses.\n\n \n\nWe agreed that I would save up to move out. I told him it might take a while because I had to replace some things around the house he refused to pay for, and I wanted to save up quite a bit. I will have full custody, and I have my doubts I will see CS from him. I also don't have much of a support network here so I want to save up as much money as possible as a buffer. I'm not sure when I will be able to move out but I'm hoping to be out in 6, maybe 8 months maximum. I also asked if he wanted me to pay some rent and he said no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI replaced my broken computer last month (used, for quite cheap) and when he saw it, he snidely said he \\*thought\\* I was supposed to be saving (I was), but obviously I wasn't since I had money for a new computer. He said it was strange that a family with two working adults didn't split expenses and demanded I pay right there. I told him that families with two working adults also split household/childcare duties, and since that wasn't the case, I wasn't going to pay any until he stepped it up. He did not, so I have not paid any rent to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to pay?",

Miranda asked permission before starting to see Dane. I was apprehensive but had no reason to say no. They were basically fwb until he started to feel all the feels. He wouldn't talk to me too much about it. Which was fine and better off really. \n\nThings got a little weird after Miranda had made a joke and Dane took it too seriously. She decided to call it quits and he was pissed. She stated her feelings had fizzled out. He confided in me and I felt for him. They ended up sleepong together again the day after. He took it as they were working things out and she just thought it was a fuck. She assumed he knew this. \n\nNye comes along and Miranda meets some dude and makes out with him continuously for hours then proceeds to take him home and sleeps with him. At this point I'm mad. I dont think Dane deserves this. He asked me if she was ghosting him and I said that she got really drunk. I felt as though it wasn't my secret to tell him. I did tell her that she needed to come clean. Am I the asshole for not telling him?  \n\nHe thinks so, he found out. Called me a lying two faced cunt and said our friendship was over. He's been one of my bestfriends for years and I'm truly hurt. I didn't know what I should do because she's also one of my best friends. She did fuck up hardcore though. I guess I'm just lost in this mess. \n\nTLDR: Best friend cheated on other best friend and I didnt say anything feeling as though it wasn't my secret to tell.",

I had enough of my teams shit, flipped him off and nearly left, saying that I'm not pay off the team. \n\nSo I'm at Uni and I recently went to a competition with my fencing team (I'm an epeeist for those who are wondering) and I wasn't fencing because I'm unranked and the captain understandably picked the higher ranking teammates for the tougher competition. I understand all that and actually agree with my Captain's choice.\n\nWhat I don't agree with is feeling left out and treated like an inconvenience. \nLike when I asked a question about something I would have no knowledge of, my teammate responded with \"please keep your comments to yourself\" I don't respond or argue because frankly I just bottled it up. Not healthy, but I wasn't in the mood\n\nBack at the recent competition, one of my teamates asked for something on the top of the bleachers. As teammate from the foil squad threw It down to us, I saw it wasn't going to make. almost would, but off by a bit. so I reached out and caught it. The teamate that asked for object then freaked out like \"why!? I ASKED FOR IT, NOT YOU, WHY THE FUCK DID YOU GRAB IT. \"  \n\nI had enough of this shit and have only been part of the team for 2 (two) semesters. So I responded by yelling \"WHY WHAT?!\" as we were both getting in each other's faces.  Capt sees this and tries to minimize the conflict. (FYI, Capt is only person who I feel treats me like a teammate) I walk away, fuming. Capt says something about talking with the team to resolve issue... something like that. I tell them something like \"it's fine, have fun with YOUR team\" before flipping teammate (not Capt) with both fingers. \n\nI have no regrets, and am refusing to elaborate how I feel towards my team TO my team. \n\nI have no idea what I did to piss off my teammates, but I don't give a shit. But I have one question. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hey guys, and this is a tough one for me as everything is still very fresh and painful. \nSo for some context: I am a 28\nyo large and tall woman, have been in what I assumed to be a serious relationship with the 35 yo man for the past year.\nMy ex has been obese most of his life. When we met (online), and added each other on Facebook, I looked through his photos (obvs) and noticed an obese man standing next to his mother who I assumed to be his older brother/cousin.\nImagine my shock when N. told me it was actually him! Apparently by the age of 21 he got so morbidly obese that his condition became life-threatening and he got a gastric bypass. Now he is super-skinny as he eats a tiny amount of food (less than a handful or smth). \n\nWhen it was the first time we were about to have sex he refused to take his clothes off, and I reassured him that I could handle whatever he would throw at me. Eventually he undressed and I realised why he was so nervous - after the surgery he was left with loads of loose skin that he didn't have the money to remove. There was so much extra skin around his waist that it completely covered his genitals. Since I was deeply infatuated with him, I did not think twice. If you want a man, you accept all his flaws, at least physical.\n\nSorry for the long intro, down to the story: we had been having problems for the past few months in our bedroom. As in, he hasn't attempted to touch me for two months straight. Eventually I got really frustrated and self-concious so I ranted on r/sex. Folks gave me some decent advice and I decided to talk to him about it.\n\nWell, the convo didn't go as I planned. Eventually N said that two months ago he met this fit sexy 19 yo at the bar, and she hit on him and he had to say that he was taken, and she seemed to be very upset. And this incident made him think about our relationship. According to him, despite shedding over 200 lb of weight, he still had \"a fat man's mentality\" and \"settled for a big girl because of his lack of self-confidence\". To that I started crying histerically. He then said that our relationship can be saved if I \"make a concious decision to beat myself into shape\" as he realised (after a year of sleeping with me) that he is not sexually inclined (sic) towards a woman with cellulitis. \n\n I was at loss for words. As an overweight (but not anywhere near obese) woman I am constantly on guard, I'm eating healthy and have an active lifestyle. N., on the other hand, lost weight surgically and retained all of his unhealthy habits (he eats only unhealthy foods, hates greens and holds any healthy options in uttermost contempt) but since he's eating micro amounts he doesn't gain any weight. \n\nI replied that I am constantly dieting but no matter how much I do I will never become a skinny petite 19 yo he met at a pub.\nTo that he replied sceptically that all I have to do is to eat tiny amount of food just like him! It's so easy to lose weight if you eat as little as him!\n\nNow, guys, this blew my head off. I yelled at him: If if it were so easy to eat tiny amounts why were you so morbidly obese by the age of 21 that your life was in danger? \nAnd also something like: how dare you give reccomendations to me, a woman who is super-concious of what she eats being a man who has never done anything to lose weight, acquired zero healthy habits, whose weight loss was achieved only by a surgeon's scalpel?\n\nOf course he took offence and stormed out of the house. He has been with his mother for the past few days, and there are dozens of angry texts on my phone from his mum and sister. They are calling me names and saying that N is depressed because of me, and that I will most certainly burn in hell. At the beginning I felt justified and self-righteous but now I'm feeling assholy. I fell really low but I could have fallen lower, I could have told him something about his loose skin but thank God I did not.\n\nGuys am I trully an asshole? Sorry for the long and incoherent read. I'm a bit of a mess!\n\nTLDR Previously obese boyfriend with gastric bypass breaks up with me on the grounds of my weight; I call him out as a person who has never done anything to lose weight apart from a surgery.",

      "description": "I don't know why I feel like this. It feels stupid of me ... but here goes.\n\nI met someone months ago ans we've hit it off pretty well. We'd crack jokes, help each other in serious problems and talk everyday. We've gotten close to the point that I might have even had a crush on her.\n\nThat admiring dies down on my chest later, anyway. Her ex comes on and tries to apologise to her. She panics and all her other friends call the guy names, one of them being \"self-entitled.\"\n\n... Now this is the part where suddenly, I get sad. And I couldn't quite place it. I have no idea what happened between her and her ex, and I should probably respect that as I don't have a place to judge.\n\n*Self-entitled.*\n\nI guess I felt that my own friend was also self-entitled ... and for some reason that made me upset. I really don't know why. But it's like my gut was telling me something was very, very wrong here, yet I didn't know what it was.\n\nI always recalled my friend calling herself \"a good person.\" And I believed in that, and it's probably true. But then whenever there's other drama going on, she runs away from it. When it's her turn to cry, someone has to go to her, or else she'll feel invalidated. She has anxiety, so that's something to understand on her part. It's a reason why we have a rule not to call her dirty names, even if it's a joke, because she's that sensitive. She gets jealous of me sometimes, when I'm not around her and hanging out with other people, instead.\n\nThough my feelings didn't stop. I couldn't shake it, something just seemed off. I talked to my friend how I felt about her as light as possible, and she took it as a personal attack. She said never to call her self-entitled because she was just taking care of her mental health. But why does it feel so ... cowardly to me? Maybe I idealized her too much in my head. I must have thought she was better than that. She said I shouldn't be all hopeful because other people can be bad too, and instead care for my own friends. But I do. I really do. I love my friends and I do everything for them, from drawing art, throwing them celebrations when they don't expect it and listening to their problems. That doesn't mean I should stop liking people in general, too. Is it truly wrong to see good things in people, sometimes?\n\nAm I an asshole?",

I said I'm not sure and she asks that if I slept with someone meanwhile and I said honestly yes. To which she seems upset and decides if I really see a thing b/w us, I should visit her and that she feels bit hurt (she drank and vomited that night) that I couldn't wait to fuck someone else. Also says that we both will not see anyone else while we are dating.\n\nI tell her, I want to give the thing between us a chance and so I visit her city on new years. New years eve she ask me to tell about that other girl and I tell her about another girl as well (I had been with two others). And she suddenly is upset that she is angry with herself for letting me visit her and that I was maybe never interested in her. We hardly talked for 2 hours and then she says if I know someone in the city so that we can part our ways. I get very emotional at this point and was crying in a restaurant for an hour. She also a bit. She says that she can see that I am not interested in her that much and she already loves me ..and this thing is gonna break her. Also, that me being with these two girls makes her insecure as she feels I am not getting all what I want from her. She also tells me that usually if her date said this thing to her,she would have asked him to leave her car.\n\nThings get better after this. We spend the night together. While parting ways we had the \"talk\" again and I tell her that I am bit afraid of how fast she is going and how she talks about getting destroyed and feeling hurt. To which she again gets upset that I am trying to distance myself from her and saying such things right before I depart.\n\nIn the past she had suicidal thoughts or tried one I am not sure.\n\nTL;DR: Am I the asshole for seeing other girls while not having the \"talk\" ?",

      "description": "Before I begin with the reason as to why, here's some context: we live in a twin room. This means that our beds are in the same area in the same room, facing each other in an L shape. We are both female.\n\nYesterday, my roommate and her female friend were preparing to go for a party in our room. I had been feeling sick for a few days and opted to go to bed a bit early, immediately after they left. My roommate was aware that I had been running a fever.\n\nThen, in the middle of the night (around 2am) I am abruptly awaken by the feeling of someone who had just taken a seat on my bed (and my feet). This obviously shocks me and when I open my eyes all I see is a large shadow on my bed due to the darkness, which freaks me out. I immediately ask who the hell he is and he says that he's with my roommate and didn't know I was there. I tell him that he gave me a huge scare and he offers to hug me, which I refuse. At this point I'm already angry. \n\nIn the meanwhile, my roommate is in our bathroom clearing vomit from her clothes and her afformentioned friend is in her bed. Eventually, the male guest gets into bed with her friend, saying he wants to sleep, but starts kissing her. My roommate is just sitting at her desk staring at her phone. I get irritated by the lip smacking and go to the kitchen to grab a glass of water and cool off. At this point I am seriously considering yelling at all of them to get out.\n\nWhen I get back to my room and contemplate telling them off by staring In their direction, my roommate seems to get the hint and convinces the male guest to leave. I'm somewhat relieved, but at this point can't sleep, so I use my phone for about half am hour. During this time her friend falls asleep and starts snoring loudly. Then, she and the male guest return and start searching for something. I am really pissed. It's the next morning now and there's still vomit in my bathroom.\n\nI would not have minded her having guests if she had informed me beforehand, and if they would not invade my space in the room. Also, maybe I'm a bit traditional, but I'm really not interested in her or her friend's sexual activities, and don't think it's acceptable for her to bring over sexual partners since our beds are literally facing each other. She also managed to choose the worst possible day to do this, while I am still sick and in need of rest. I am thinking of confronting her and telling her not to bring anymore overnight guests, but I don't know if I'm overreacting.",

      "description": "My parents have had this dog for the past couple years and in the last year they have really let the dog go. I have told them repeatedly that they are in need to take care of her and take her on walks as well as monitoring her eating. She isn't a heavy set dog and has gained so much weight due to them never taking her out on walks and letting her eat as much as she wants. My frustration really comes from their unwillingness to take the time and go on walks and say that they cannot afford someone to come and walk their dog. I see them buy other things that seem more frivolous to me, (they just bought a carpet, an Alexa..etc.) When telling them that they should either get rid of their dog or start taking care of her they told me it was not my place to tell them how to take care of her.

      "description": "About two years ago I had a nice business idea with a friend (both of us are students) and after some beers we were drunk enough to try to get it started. It worked out quite well and last week we decided to accept a bigger company's offer after some negotiation and sell (both of us want to complete our studies and aren't ready to lead an actual company yet). Both of us got \\~700'000$ (each) out of this. \n\nWhen I told my other friends (mostly students as well) last week, they asked if I was going to party on Wednesday (20.3.) and I said sure. I mean just made more money as a student than I ever hoped to earn in a year, so I was quite fucking happy.  \n\nAt the club, a friend asked if I would buy a few bottles (wodka) - namely 5-6 bottles. I offered that I could buy some food or 2 bottles, but I didn't want to throw out \\~250$ just like that. We always split bottles and shot plates and paid individually for cocktails and food, and I don't see a reason to change that. Someone else then called me greedy and selfish (other friends agreed more or less, except for one who took my side). AITA?",

      "description": "Don't think I've made a post before, hi Reddit :)\ntldr at the bottom.\n\nI'm (25) a LSA (Learning Support Assistant) in a school, the money is terrible but I really enjoy helping children learn. Honestly I've had a lot of jobs in the past and this is the only one I feel like I'm making a difference in.\n\nMy SO (36) gets into this heated discussion with me every now and then; your job doesn't make enough money. \n\nI could train for a year to become a teacher. It's the obvious path to more money for me and stay inside the thing. But teachers have to work waaaaay more. It's unreasonable how much they have to work and it's not like they're paid a fortune. I've been in lots of jobs from farming to the tech industry; coding and testing. Nothing has given me the satisfaction I get from watching people learn with my help.\n\nI have a mild general anxiety disorder and have suffered from heavy depression in the past. Keeping my workload low has really been helping me find a balance in my life. I don't care about money, I don't have a car, rent is (just) affordable, I'm happy to live like this... That said, I'm not paying a mortgage.\n\nHer argument is that I'm unable to save up a reasonable sum of money for emergencys, or just life in general. She thinks it isn't enough for me to live off of and I'm not thinking enough about my future. I'm not really sure she's wrong tbh. But I'm happy with how things currently are, I don't want to push myself harder, possibly becoming overworked, for money I don't care about.\n\nAITA? I really don't know.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read!\n\nTLDR: My job makes me little money but I'm happy with that, SO would like me to look for higher paid work.\n\nP.S: I love by SO with all my heart, she has become my fiancee as of last year.",

      "description": "Some context,\n\n I was hired by NGO as an intern with the understanding that once the internship period ends (3 months) that I would be given a new contract to sign with a fixed position and an increased salary rather than the internship 'allowance' which was provided. \n\nMy contract expires this week and I had yet to hear from any member of management as to specifics or details so last week I decided to pose the question myself and asked to negotiate on the terms of my new contract (that was the past Friday). I was told by my manager that they would like to keep me on and that they would like to give me a confirmation of full time employment under the same contract terms as my internship, this would also mean that I make the exact same amount only as an actual salary instead of an allowance (just different terms but basically the same thing minus some tax stuff). I pretty much said that I signed on with the expectation of an increase in salary and new terms such as overtime pay (seeing as i got none and there's an unending crop field of the stuff - I'm talking late hours and even weekends at times). \n\nMy manager says that they wouldn't be providing me any increase in salary, but if I signed on, then they could review an increase at the end of the business year (August for them). I said it wasn't what I was expecting and I needed to think about it. \n\nPersonally, I think I've already mentally checked out but they have this big upcoming project they're working on and they rely on me for a bunch of stuff that other's can't really do (not propping myself up, just stating that the others don't know how to or are very basic with this set of tasks). I feel like I'd be throwing the rest of the team under the bus but I don't think it's worth me being undervalued and pretty much cheated.\n\nI've told them that I don't plan on signing a new contract with them and am intent on leaving this week but they would like me to stay on for another month to hand over duties. I told them that's not really my issue and that all my work is available on my desktop PC. My contract does have a month's notice, but that's only for resigning/termination of the contract during the period, not expiration (I've triple checked).   \n\n\nSo yeah, AITA for leaving on the day it expires?

      "description": "So my roommate got a new dog about 2 months ago (let's call my roommate Sara), and the dog still hasn't been potty trained. Her and her boyfriend (let's call him Jesse) have been letting her roam the house during the day when they're both gone, with the expectation that the dog will use the doggie door to go potty (they were keeping her in their bathroom when they were away, but Jesse said he doesn't like smelling poop in his bathroom and suggesting letting her out when they leave). Well, that hasn't been happening. The dog has been shitting in the house pretty much every single day since they got her. A few days ago, while getting ready for work in the morning, I was making my lunch and started smelling dog shit. I look over and sure enough, the dog left a big ol' pile right in the kitchen (it's a pomeranian so they're not very big, but still). In a furious mood, I sent my roommate an angry text message. Here's the full text of my message:\n\n\"Ok, im gonna be an asshole for a minute. You really need to do a better job pottytraining her. Its really frustrating having to wake up and see/smell dog shit every single day. Not only that but its kind of inconsiderate to your roommates\"\n\nHer response was not very positive. One, she said something along the lines of \"I am aware of the issue but If no one wants to offer any suggestions, I don't want to hear it\". And two, she tried to deflect blame to her boyfriend, saying \"It's his dog too! He was the one who wanted to let her out when we're gone!\" I have since sent Jesse a message explaining that I don't think the dog should roam the house while they're away, and he was pretty reasonable and agreed. I suggested leaving the dog in the backyard when it's a nice day.\n\nSo... I'm not being an asshole, right? It's not unreasonable to not want to see and smell dog shit every damn day?",

With me having been a real asshole during our fight I didn't dare to push back though and agreed.\n\nAs far as I know he used it twice already, sucking off a guy or getting sucked off. I don't know and don't really care about the details. He was very active on some apps while I was more reluctant. Yesterday I finally did it, I met a guy and had semi sex with him. It was a guy he was interested in. He showed him to me and told me he wanted a threesome the day before.\n\nSince I regard honesty as very important I told him I met the guy. Now he is very angry because I \"stole the guy away\" and had sex with \"the only guy he was really into\" (he already met others and is chatting with many more!). He says he feels unattractive, like I always want to compete with him, that I beat him, blah, blah. He is a very attractive man, but so am I and I use that without holding back.\n\nAm I not allowed to have sex with anyone he considers attractive? I believe his biggest issue is his continuous lack of self esteem, which I can't really help him with. Telling him how great he is does not work. He ignores his success with guys, focusing on mine.

He believes it is totally fine to remain âgood friendsâ with your âfriendsâ youâve fucked. Even when your partner is not comfortable with it. I believe your past is your past, and all past flings and exes should be that. \n\nHe knows I am not comfortable with that and a while ago he finally agreed in the scenario if one of those âfriendsâ of his came to town, thereâs no way theyâd be staying at our place. Also that I can only control myself and I donât have to have anything to do with them, but I cannot stop who he is âfriendsâ with. \n\nHe plans to do a road trip with his brother in the summer. Because it was driving me crazy, I asked him if there was anyway he planned on going to that state one of these âfriendsâ are in and if so, would he try and stay with them. The answer is yes. Even though I expressed Iâm not comfortable with it and he knows I would be 1000 miles away (if I cannot afford to go on this trip and cannot be there) angry and pissed at him. Note this âfriendâ is married and the brother would be staying as well in the scenario. \n\nMy bf likes to turn it on me and say it is a trust issue and that I do not trust him. Ultimately he is saying it shows I do not trust him not to cheat on me. I do trust that he wonât cheat on me, but it seems crazy to that he does not care Iâm not comfortable with it and will deliberately do it knowing that. \n\nAlso in the conversation, he then graciously added he will not get married until he puts me through a âtestâ and see how I react in this scenario or when he hangs out with one of these âfriendsâ by his choice. He says he needs to see how I will react because he is âafraidâ of what I will do and I might do something âdangerousâ. \n\nAm I the asshole for not being comfortable and okay with this?

      "description": "So I recently got into an overseas university, and since attending my mental health has pretty much tanked. As such, my grades are absolutely dismal right now and it's not really helping my mental state. I've recently started antidepressants and while they help, they kinda fuck with me in other ways. On top of that, due to issues getting my prescription abroad, I had to stop taking them for a short period which fucked me over further. \n\nMy Mandarin professor is the sweetest lady ever. I seriously love her. Thing is, I knew that she was so kind that if I told her about my mental health issues, she would do her best to accommodate for me. So I told her, and she did. I'm so grateful for this, but I feel like I'm taking advantage of her kindness. I knew that she would help me, and I kinda feel like I'm using that as an excuse to slack off more. This past week has been really difficult with me not having my meds, and I haven't made it to a single lecture. She told me today that she's been really worried, so I told her about the situation and she told me just to rest up and that she understands. She also asked if I wanted to talk to the on-campus counselor, but in the past I haven't found them to be useful and prefer speaking to my regular therapist. I feel like I ought to take her up on the offer though, since my professor seems really concerned and I feel like speaking with the counselor would put her at ease. Again, I'm really grateful that she's so kind, but I can't help but feel like I'm taking advantage of that kindness. So, AITA? And any suggestions for how to deal with this situation? ",

      "description": "Obligatory, sorry for likely mistakes, English is not my first language. \n\nQuite a soft AITA compared to the nasty stuff you see here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in 2016, I was an exchange student in Poland living with other exchange students (Erasmus+ for my fellow Europeans here. It was my birthday so we threw quite a big party, lots of people, booze, beer pong you name it. \n\nWhen we were out of booze, some of my flatmates suggested I could go to the liquor store 10 meters away from the flat to resupply. I was a bit taken aback by the request and calmly said I was reluctant (money wasn't and issue)\n\n They asked me why I didn't like this idea and I explained them: In the place i've been raised and in all the birthday parties I have attended (mines or friends), the person whose birthday it was didn't have to spend a single Euro on anything because it was entirely up to the guests to buy everything. (In a house party setting, if I was celebrating in a bar, I would pay for my own drinks unless a friend offered to pay me one.)\n\nThey basically told me, since they bought me the presents, I could at least contribute to the party in some way. I was flabbergasted by such an argument , thinking it was super rude to phrase it that way.\n\n There was a bit back and forth but since it was my birthday I didn't wanna make a fuss about it and act entitled so I just went to buy the beers (and it was freaking cheap anyway). I spent a wonderful night, got shitfaced, and got really nice presents from my friends so everything went well and all was forgotten quite fast. \n\nI wasn't sure if it was a cultural thing because one my fellow French flatmates agreed with the fact that you should also buy supplies on your own bday. Maybe it was the exchange student setting where even though it's  bday party, we organize it as a regular one anyway so everybody contributes, I dunno. Maybe you guys have the answer!\n\nSo, should I have been reluctant to buy booze on my own birthday party ? Did that make me TA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "AITA for leaving her on read? This is long\n\nAight so me and this girl have been friends since freshman year, and weâre seniors now. Sheâs extremely manipulative and gets mad at me for everything I donât do that she expects me to do. For example, a while ago I was walking down the hall with a friend and me and him were gonna be late for gym. She sees me and I just look at her and smile and she stops and says âwowwww okâ. She expected me to stop and go give her a hug and talk to her for a bit. I donât get why she gets mad at everything i donât do that she expects me to always do. And mind you Iâm such a push over when it comes to her and I never open my mouth bc she talks to her friends about things. \n\nOk so last night she sent me a video of her showing me how wet she was. Mind you the last time she talked to me she was mad at me. \n\n-she was mad at me bc when they went in the senior trip, and I didnât, I asked her if it was even fun, and she left me on open and I sent âwhy are you leaving me on read tho?â. Bc I just asked a simple question. She then responded the next day with â cuz youâre annoying and only worried about trip over how fun my snaps lookâ. I just asked if she had fun and she got mad because I didnât comment on how good she looked. She doesnât look god and I donât know why I should bring myself to lie just so she wonât get mad. \n\n\nSorry this is long. \n\nBut after I just opened the video and didnât find a reason to respond since I was in no way turned on and upset that she only wants to talk bc shes horny. And she got upset and then I proceeded to tell her that I have no obligation to respond to your sexual videos or pictures, just because you send something doesnât mean I have to send something back or say how hot you look or some shit. I donât do that fake turned on shit, if Iâm not turned on I do not sext, its that simple. I told her she shouldnât only be texting me when sheâs horny thatâs not what Iâm here for. And she goes to say that I never text her. I told her texting isnât a one way thing and I didnât want to text you especially after how you treated me last time we talked. \n\nSo AITA for not responding to her lewd sexual video after her treating me like Iâm her personal self confidence booster and a little puppy to her? And also for not wanting to be sexual or sext or anything ",

      "title": "AITA for potentially ruining my relationship with my brother by choosing to live in a dorm",
      "description": "So, some back story here. Iâm a first year college student and had already been staying in the dorm for my first semester. Unfortunately me being dumb went to a concert and took something I shouldnât have which nearly killed me and left me in a coma for few days. So I had to medically withdrawal and move back home.\n\nThe experience alone was enough to scare the shit out of me and now Iâm more careful than ever, so much so that I stopped drinking completely. Anyways I planned to move back once spring started because itâs about an 25-30 min commute to my college (plus I was on a full ride so free housing!) I discussed this with my mother who was reluctant but agreed given Iâd come home on the weekends and visit. \n\nNow my brother and I have aways had rocky relationship we would sometimes go months with out talking. We were fine up until he found out I reapplied to live back in the dorms. He immediately exploded on me saying I hadnât earned anyoneâs trust back from what happen with my accident and that I was to blame for nearly breaking him up with his gf (her family is quite conservative and once they heard about what happen to me it painted a bad picture on him) however I donât feel bad as she made SEVERAL inappropriate jokes about me during the ordeal, for instance after recovering  I went out to eat barbecue and she joked âvegetables donât eat meatâ (I was induced into a coma). I was taken back but didnât bring up to my brother cause I knew he would side with her since they have the same âhumorâ.  Heâs also in a pretty big organization and went on to say how embarrassing it would be if they found out what happen to me. Which I donât understand because I wouldnât have given two shits what other people think had it been the other way around. He claims Iâm being selfish and inconsiderate, leaving me with an ultimatum to choose to dorm of lose him as a brother forever. \n\nHereâs the thing. We go to the same college and while he excels in his studies and commutes, I donât. I need the extra help and the resources my school provides, so living on campus is a much better option, he doesnât understand and expects me to commute as well. and honestly I enjoy being independent. Growing up I felt like everyoneâs punching bag. I was always in trouble and getting beat and it only got worse after my father passed. My family was stressed and sometimes it was taken out on me. I still have verbal fights with time every so often so Iâm trying  desperately trying to stay out of the house so that we donât fight and maintain a good relationship . But my brother just sees this as an opportunity for me to go back to the dorm and party it up. I understand the worry and pain i caused them with my accident, and I love them very much. I do value the relationship with my brother and I care for him but I feel like living away from home is my best option, so AITA?\n",

      "description": "TL;DR I asked my parents for an instrument for years but I get rejected for years and instead buys something more expensive and ignores my wants.\n\n\nIt happened around a couple months ago and I found this subreddit today. \n\nEver since the 8th or 9th grade, I've always wanted to have an instrument (piano/keyboard, guitar, or bass guitar). I really wanted one as an outlet for my mental health because I was getting tired of using my phone and social media as one. Every month, I keep asking for it and they always say \"Oh we don't have enough money. We'll get you one soon.\" I was understanding every time. Overtime I grew impatient. I asked them a hair more \"aggressively\" but still politely. It's the same damn excuse I hear every fucking time. What's worse is that they buy expensive shit over the years (a new house, a new TV, rent a truck, a shit ton of stones for a walkway, expensive shoes, etc). I was getting a little bit angry but I don't want to cause any more trouble between them and I(coincidently, me and my parents started fighting since 8th grade) . \n\n\nNow let's get to a couple months ago. I was just in my room being depressed and on YouTube(again, I have nothing else to do) and I heard that they called me outside to get something. When I went outside, my dad bought a fuckton of stuff. I have no idea where he even bought them from. He bought a old antique clock, a bunch of electric candles with a candle holder, a semi new printer, a shit ton of coffee mugs, a bunch of alcohol, an a couple new dressers. Pretty fucking expensive, right? When I looked at them, I was furious. Very furious but I didn't make an outburst, just quietly moved the stuff from the car into the house. I glared at them which they said \"What's wrong with you?\" I didn't reply. They proceeded to yell at me and demanded that I help set up the printer (lol). After I was done, I marched into my room and didn't come out for like 12 hours and ignored their calls for me. Reason I'm asking if I'm the asshole is because my extended family members commented that I'm an ungrateful child and should always respect my parents and I've told an internet stranger this story and said I'm kinda dickish for yelling at them and been told to be more paitient or try harder to get a job.\n\n\nBefore you answer I'll tell you some quick facts about me;\n1. I am 16 and a junior in highschool\n2. I can't get a job yet because I don't have a reliable transportation and every job I've applied haven't called me back yet.\n3. We're not poor but sometimes it gets tough around here. \n\nIf you want to ask me questions or you're suspicious about me or my story, I'll happily respond to you. It's 3 am here so I'm sorry for my poor grammar and rambling. I'm kinda tired.",

      "description": "This was over a year and a half ago, and tonight my buddies and I are drinking and discussing old relationships/tinder dates. I met a girl over tinder, we exchanged numbers, chatted for a few days and agreed to meet for drinks at a bar. I got to the bar and ordered 9 or 10 shots before she got there to loosen up a bit (I tend to say inappropriate things on dates when Iâm sober due to being nervous). This was around 7PM and she arrived around 8:30...in a wheelchair. Now, I want to be very clear here - nowhere in the Chat, in the tinder pictures, in our text messages was it even IMPLIED, let alone stated, that she was in a wheelchair. I feel like I was catfished, except I wasnât as she looked exactly like she did in her pictures, just wheelchair bound. She was a really nice girl, we hit it off, but I donât want to string her along at all because I wouldnât be able to be with her long term (I do a TON of traveling, both US and abroad, and our lives wouldnât be compatible). I also realized that this would always be in the back of my mind if I were to date her - that her physical limitations would cause me to feel some sort of resent towards her altering my lifestyle. I mean hell, we were watching a Bama game at the bar and I felt extremely awkward after I blurted our âRoll Tideâ, something completely innocent because I was afraid that it unknowingly offended her - it stayed in the back of my mind the entire date. Eventually I mentioned to her that I had a great time, but had church early in the morning and had to head home. I bent down and gave her a kiss but didnât imply anything about meeting her again or continuing correspondence. She texted me over the next couple days (I didnât respond as I didnât want to lead her on), and on the last day she went on a huge rant calling me all sorts of names...so I think I dodged a bullet there.",

Everyone in this gas station knows me and my order, I have shown my ID there on multiple occasions to the point were no one cards me anymore. Besides this one lady we'll call her Sarah. She has been there two year and I've had multiple interactions with her most of them being unpleasant. So I know she knows who I am and who old I am.\n\nIt's my turn to check out so I ask for $5 on my pump and a 85c black &amp; mild, she ask for an ID, which unfortunately today I did not have tody do to only have a paper ID at the moment. I tell her it's fine and I will just take the gas and the slushie.\n\nAfter my transaction with her I walk around to the other cashier (which is one of the coolest people there, he has even given/let me use a lighter before) and ask for the black &amp; mild which he agrees to and proceeds to cash me out. Sarah comes over and starts yelling at the both of us, telling me how I had no right to go to her coworker after she had just denied me. I try to explain that I'm 21 years old and how her and this man had seen my ID before, how neither of us had done anything wrong, and how she had no right to yell at either of us.\n\nShe was not having it so I grabbed my cigar apologized to the guy that sold it to me for any trouble I may have caused, to which he tell me he could lose his job. I went to pump my gas, at which point another customer comes to me and explains that she is like this with everyone and how he avoids this gas station at all cost because (and I quote) \"she's always on some bullshit\". I thank him and drive home to get my ID.\n\nUpon returning to the store to show her my ID to make sure the guy wasn't fired. She tell me she can't accept a paper ID, which I know is a lie not only because one of the acceptable forms of identification she listed was a government issued ID and my paper ID came from the BMV. But also because multiple speedways in my area including that one has accepted paper IDs from me before.\n\nI explained that to her and she tells me that they don't accept paper IDs or expired IDs (which is funny cause the card ID I had a couple weeks ago expired in March and she personal accepted it). She continued to yell and tell me she found not accept it and she was just going her job.\n\nAt this point I was tired of talking and ask for a complaint form. Which she at first told me was on the rack with the applications, They weren't. I tell her they aren't there and she proceeds to snap more telling me she only doing her job and that she would write down her name, her job title, and the number for me.\n\nI get home to call and instead of customer service she gave me the number to the store help services for store experiencing problems. I had to wait on hold for 30-45 mins to get the actual number, then had to wait on hold for another 45-60 mins before getting a person that could take down my complaint.\n\nTL;DR. Got carded asked another cashier for my contraband, got yelled at. Produced an ID, got yelled at and lied to. Got feed up, reported employee. Am I The Asshole here?",

      "description": "This girl, we'll call her Ruby is my classmate and a girl i knew since childhood. My mom was friends with her mom and me and Ruby got along pretty well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up i realised that her mom didn't like me. She always had something bad to say about me, criticize my behavior, my clothes, everything i said or did. She always compared me to her daughter and brag about everything Ruby did. Everytime I was at their house visiting Ruby she'd always try to make me feel bad about myself. I ignored her because I cared about Ruby. I remember one times Ruby told me how her mother is always telling her to be better than me and how she hoped she could become me. I don't remember what I told her but her mom tried to make her daughter do everything I did but better. I started playing violin and two weeks later Ruby did too. I said once that I wanna go to med school and the next day Ruby wanted to become a doctor too.\n\nI started noticing that she is harsh with her daughter. I don't wanna say she's abusive but from my perspective she seems like that. Ruby is allowed to only wear clothes that her mother picks, read books that her mother picks, and all day long she has to study. (at least that's what Ruby told me). I don't know how to put this into words but I can see that Ruby is not acting the way she wants and she's very insecure. At first I tried comforting her and helping her but I grew tired of her mother and the way Ruby became.\n\nNow we are in the same highschool and in the same class and Ruby's mother tries to make me look bad in front of my mom everytime she can.\n\nOne day mom came home very mad because she met Ruby's mother and she tried to tell her every single thing i did in school that seemed bad exaggerating everything. I don't skip school without a good reason but that woman told mom that I always skip classes and I have only bad grades and comparing me to her daughter and saying that Ruby is such a good child.\n\nMom is no longer friends with Ruby's mother because everytime they saw each other my mom didn't feel comfortable talking to her. My mom said that Ruby's mother always had an \"I'm so much better that you\" attitude and she grew tired of it (just the way I did).\n\nBecause we are in the same class Ruby tries to talk to me and to spend time with me but I don't feel comfortable doing that anymore so I started avoiding her. I always responded politely to her but I tried to let her understand I don't wanna talk to her or hang out with her but she doesn't get it. I started running away from her everytime I saw her and when Ruby wanted to go with me to the subway station I'd always make excuses so I don't have to spend time with her. I kinda feel bad about this but I don't feel comfortable spending time with her anymore but I also feel like an asshole for doing this.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for avoiding Ruby?",

      "description": "Hi well this is a long story. So I have a family, I have seven brothers and sisters. To say itâs dysfuncfional or has had problems over the years is a little bit of ah understatement. \n\nItâs always been about the women of the family too. The sister in laws, my sisters etc. \n\nI feel like everyone is kind of isolated, everyone has had fights over the years, and no one wants to start anything. \n\nSo apparently my sisters knew it was my nieceâs 16th birthday party. They got two cakes (but not for her), and didnât even acknowledge her birthday really. (She was forced to be there also). \n\nBasically my sisters are a lot younger than me and my brothers. The two youngest ones (in their mid 20s) I assumed would be more mature. \n\nFor those who are confused, my family is kind of dysfunctional. My sister in law who is the nieces mom, practically did so much for my younger sisters in their lives, and the fact that they made a family gathering on her birthday and donât even acknowledge it. I just didnât know what to say. (I got her money btw) for a present. \n\nI just made a scene honestly. I was so angry. I just said it was fucking bullshit and what kind of shit is this. I never act like that ever. Everyone was so surprised. I just said they needed to grow the fuck up (in front of my elderly religious parents) and I left. \n\nI could tell my SIL and brother were upset and uncomfortable that no one acknowledged her birthday. \n\nfucking arranging a family gathering and donât acknoledge it was their nieces birthday what the fuck ",

      "description": "Alright so a little bit of a backstory here. Coming from an Asian background, my father always was a strict individual. He is also known to have a short temper, having random outburst over the littlest things you can imagine.(One incident that I will never forget is he had a mental breakdown when I made a small mistake at a Supermarket self-checkout).\n\nWhen I was 12, he decided to bring me to Australia to live with him. (I'm originally from Taiwan, and for the most part lived with my Mum's side of the family)\n\nSo growing up, I had to endure his mental outbursts and verbal abuses. This has affected me in many ways, most notability my self esteem. I've no longer trust my gut, I've become soft spoken (every time when I try to voice an opinion, he shuts it down and accuses me of talking back to him) I'm just like a different person than I was before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward 15 years, I'm finally getting married to the love of my life. A lot has happened since, but here's an overview.\n\n\\- I didn't have the best high school/college/university life. I was a shut in, suffering from depression etc etc\n\n\\- At one point after getting my degree, I was struggling to find a job that is relevant to what I was studying\n\n\\- I decided to work several jobs concurrently in the meantime.\n\n\\- I moved out of the house after having a heated argument with my father. I was 23 when this happened.\n\nAfter moving out I changed my mobile number and cut out contact with my father. I've told myself that I no longer want anything to do with him. It was a struggle at first trying to make ends meet but I managed and was lucky enough to meet my lovely fiance who supports me like no one else.\n\nNow back to the present, I'm finally getting married and I've sent invitations to my mum and friends. Mum told me that she will let Dad know but I was adamant not to invite him.\n\nToday, I received a call from my dad for the first time in 5 years, congratulating me whilst asking me about the invitation of the wedding. The moment I hear his voice, a chain of emotions starts to overwhelm me. Tears rapidly dropped and I can feel a mixture of hate and resentment. I know the sacrifices hes done for me in the past, but I just can't get over the emotional abuse and depression that were caused by him.\n\nI hung up the phone without replying to him, I also blocked his number. Mum called me after saying that Dad is tearing up and really wants to be part of the wedding. I straight up said no, saying that I've put up enough of his abusive nature, he will not be invited and is not welcomed. I also gave my mum an ultimatum, if she was to bring my dad to the wedding, she will be kicked out and that is will be the last of our relationship.\n\nObviously I'm filled with rage right now and I'm trying to think rationally.\n\nSo redditors, AITA here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I (24 F) live with my boyfriend (24 M) in an 800 square foot one bedroom apartment. The apartment has a kitchen/living room (one big studio space), a bedroom, and one bathroom. We live in a city that's about 5 hours away from our families, high school friends, and college friends, so when we have visitors, they tend to stay awhile (2-3 full days). \n\nWe've had some different group of friends come over a few times since we've moved in, and each time someone comes, it gives me a headache (figuratively) and I dread hosting them beforehand and can't wait until they leave. Sharing such a SMALL space with more people besides us is really annoying to me because they are sprawled out on the floor along with all of their stuff. In addition, there is only one bathroom, so each person who spends the night adds another person on to the list of the people who have to use the same bathroom.\n\nMy personality is very type A, so that's why having people over gets under my skin. I don't like the thought of my space being made dirty, and having other people use my toilet, sink, and shower makes me feel uncomfortable. It's also such a small apt, that basically no one has any privacy and everyone is sitting on top of each other practically.\n\nI told my boyfriend that having people over is unenjoyable for me and I don't like having to host people in the small space since they tend to stay a while (since they have to drive far, which is understandable). He said he feels bad because he doesn't want to discourage friends from visiting and he doesn't want to ask them to get a hotel since we're all recent grads and we don't all have a lot of money. He was worried I will never want to have friends over in the future. I told him things would be different if we lived in a house which had more space for everyone and I wouldn't have to share a bathroom with people. We don't currently have short term plans to move into a bigger space, so I don't have a concrete date to give you.\n\nA few more things to note: this isn't just me complaining about his friends. I dread my own friends coming over too. However, his friends are currently over this weekend, and one of them drank too much and threw up a bunch in the bathroom and another one spent a long time in the bathroom pooping and then DIDN'T wash his hand afterwards. These uncleanly things have disgusted me honestly.\n\nAITA for telling him I don't want to host people in our apt (except family) anymore until we live in a bigger space with more bedrooms and bathrooms?\n\nThanks for your opinions!",

      "description": "First, sorry for formatting cuz mobile.\n\nSo 4 months ago my (M23) 18 year old sister up and moved out with about 6-7 hours notice, to another state, with her ex who she âstill lovesâ that caused our family hell when they dated previously.\n\nBackground: this kid is a bottom of the barrel human, barely graduated high school, no college, no job (aside from being a sound cloud rapper). My sister was phenomenal at academics, star soccer player, pretty hard worker usually. When they dated he was verbally abusive, constantly fighting with her and my mom became the mediator in the relationship. She didnât want to forbid them from dating because she knew it would happen in secret then, which it turns out she was exactly right. Their fights occurred in high school to the point the principal called my mom to come down, and the outside of school fights (all verbal) escalated to the point we went to court for a restraining order. Apparently we didnât have a concrete enough case but they gave us an order of no communication. Which was when the secret dating began, without us knowing. This lasted about a year until 4 months ago she said they had still been talking and she was moving away with him.\n\nIt should be noted that he is bankrolling the entire thing because her food server job sure canât afford an apartment, utilities, phones, food, 2 pets, and her expensive clothing habits. I am big into the type of music he âmakesâ and I have never heard his name aside from small shows at small venues, he has no real footing in the industry. He frequently posts online videos of him smoking weed with stacks of money, so we have reason to believe he has an âalternateâ source of income.\n\nMy family has been in ruins my mom and grandparents especially. She has always treated them poorly as well. Had no problem arguing yelling and generally being a nasty person to them if they didnât say things she liked.\nWhen this all happened I was furious because I couldnât stand to see my mom seemingly fall into depression. My sister has been back home on a few occasions because, shocker, heâs still a verbally abusive child who likes to argue. Granted she is a confrontational person as well. They just donât go together.\n\nThere is no reasoning with her no matter how nicely you try to talk or how factual you are, if you arenât saying what she wants to hear it becomes an argument where she never accepts she is wrong.\n\nAfter a few trips home each one left my mom worse than before. I finally got fed up and told her I didnât want to see or hear from her again unless she was in jail or a hospital. I havenât spoke to her except for if my parents get worried they havenât heard from her so I step in and do the bare minimum to see whatâs going on.\n\nI want the best but history with this kid does not bode well for her and Iâm sick of trying to reason with her while she acts like sheâs a smarter adult than the rest of us, trying to make it seem like weâre wrong for being opposed to the situation.\n\nSo guys Am I The Asshole?\n",

When she goes out to keroke with her friends, I force myself to fall asleep early because I know she's bringing over her friend to fuck. If I don't fall asleep fast enough, I'm lucky to have headphones. I'm just tired of waking up, walking out into the living room (she sleeps in the living room because we live in a two bedroom apartment and me and my brother have the two bedrooms) and seeing him in my mom's bed next to her and then five minutes after I get back in my room and hear her start moaning, and she's not quiet about it. My 11 year old brother is up too and I know he can hear it as well because he can't shut his door because he hides things from my mom. I can't wait until I get the fuck out of here but I still have to wait another one to two years.",

      "description": "Sorry if this is long, but it's weighing in my mind a lot. The last paragraph is the main point, but the paragraphs before are some background information that lead up to these events. \n\nI have this friend, who was at one point my best friend. Let's call him Larry. I met him when I was with my ex boyfriend (which he knew about) and we grew close over a span of two years. Larry assured me he didn't like me when my boyfriend (Let's call him Duke) at the time would joke about having to watch out for him, and I trusted him. Eventually Duke and I broke up for uni, and weeks go by and Larry tells me that he has actually really liked me for a long time. This was a shock to me and I felt betrayed because I defended him in arguments with Duke saying that he did not like me, Larry knowing this. Now, Larry struggles with his mental health, and would easily spiral into a depression if he felt rejected, so I didn't know how to outright reject him. I told him that I wasn't ready to date anyone new and wanted to enjoy being single because I hadn't been for 3 years. This seemed to do, but he immediately started getting very jealous of my best friend from primary school (who is a male and we shall call him Rango) and would make me feel guilty because of the idea I would prefer my best friend from primary school over him- even though I never outright said it.\n\nA few days later, my mum kicked me out of the house, so not having anywhere else to stay, I stayed at Rango's house for 3 days. During this time I told him about my Larry and that I didn't want to stay at his (he was offering) because I didn't want that awkward situation. So Rango messaged him asking him to not try anything if I were to stay at his, because he wanted me to go to a friend's house who would take care of me instead of someone who had ulterior motives. This upset Larry, who then said I couldn't stay at his anymore and didn't speak to me for a while other than to complain. \n\nWeeks go by and Larry tells me he no longer just likes me, and loves me instead. I figured I couldn't let this go on anymore and told him that I was sorry but I didn't and couldn't see him the same way. He seemed to accept this, but days later he left me a goodbye message, alluding to suicide and lost contact for over 8 hours. I was freaking out, calling everyone we knew to see if they had spoken since. No one had. Eventually he comes back online and confirms he was going to kill himself but ended up not being able to. I ask why he wanted to do it, and he said it was because he couldn't handle the fact that I did not love him back, and that he was in love with me. I broke down and felt awful for weeks. After talking to some friends, they assured me it wasn't my fault and that he would just have to learn to accept my decision. \n\nAfter months of him switching from being really affectionate towards me, and then to saying that we're not even close friends and that I'm a nobody- saying he loved me, and then he was over me, and loved me again - I learned to not care about what he said or his feelings. I've been speaking to a guy for a few months now (Lets call him Bono), and we've gone on quite a few dates - we've really hit it off. I didn't tell Larry about this (or many of my other friends, although a few of them have met him) because I knew he wouldn't react well and I just wanted to enjoy what I had. Obviously, Bono and I spent Valentine's Day together, and Larry joked about it being weird to hang with a male friend on vday, so I thought it was okay to tell him. I figured it would be best if I told him now instead of lying and having to reveal later that I was dating Bono. I was wrong. He immediately flipped to depressed and then accused me of lying to him and withholding information (I didn't lie but I didn't tell him about Bono because I thought he would act like this). Larry then posted on his snapchat story that he felt good until he had a \"depressing revelation\" and kept posting about how much he was drinking. This ended up really upsetting me because I felt really guilty. The next day he was guilt tripping me saying things like \"guy you're seeing &gt; me\" and asking me uncomfortable questions like \"what is it about him that you like that I don't have? How is he better than me? If it weren't for him would we be a thing?\" and other stuff. Eventually all he said was that his heart really hurt thinking about how I'm with someone and that he feels pathetic etc. I get annoyed at this, but leave it anyway. Yesterday Larry sent me pictures of myself and told me he was deleting them because it hurt to look at them and made him really sad. He then sent a long paragraph saying how it hurt his heart whenever he saw me, how he can't bare it any longer, and that things between us kept changing. I reached my limit and sent paragraphs back saying how frustrated I was at the situation and that I can't keep placing him above my happiness, telling him he was overreacting and how much he upset me, saying that even Duke, who was my boyfriend for over 2 years, wouldn't have reacted this badly. It felt good saying what I needed to (something I've never been able to do with him before) and I feel like I can no longer be friends with Larry because it's gotten to the point where its dragging me down too much, and I hate feeling powerless with my own life. AITA for seeing someone, months after I rejected my friend after he confessed he was in love with me?\n\nTL;DR: My friend tells me he's in love with me after I rejected him and said the fact I didn't love him back almost turned him to suicide. Months later I start dating someone and he flips out, guilt tripping me for a few days until I have enough and clap back with my thoughts on how he is being an ass. AITA?",

      "description": "A little back story. Sorry, you're only going to get my half of the story but I'll try to give her a fair shake.\n\nA few years ago she moved in with me and the agreement was that she would pay 200/month rent. She was in school and working a high number of hours for having a part-time job. So, to alleviate her burdens I offered to stop charging rent so she could work less and have more time for school and me. Well, she stopped paying and I was ok with that because it was my plan. Then when she was in between school quarters she took vacations that I couldn't go on because my job had become demanding of my time and that irritated me a lot because even though I couldn't go she went anyways. Well, after she finished school she had saved enough to pay off her car. Which I was proud of her for doing it's a good thing to do even if it was at my expense a little I didn't mind but I didn't like that she had taken vacations without me. Then she went to Japan for a month and was doing woofing and staying with a friend there to save money blah blah but again I couldn't go with her because I didn't have that kind of money. While her trip wasn't that expensive I still look at it as a betrayal because she could only afford to do these things because I was absorbing all the cost of living for us both. Well, she finally gets her dream job because school is done and I'm still doing skilled labor and she goes traveling for work. I ended up buying a house after she left because I found a place that was cheaper than the apartment we had been living in (it was a dump apartment too this house is way better). Then one day I go visit her and lay down the law now: when you're home rent is half my mortgage but when you're gone you can pay 200 bucks a month to maintain the address for tax purposes and to help me out a little bit financially and to improve our home. I thought this was fair. Anyways time goes by everything is working well enough she goes on a big vacation to the UK and I can't go because I can't afford it. Then she comes back home for a while and didn't do so great on having steady work so she accumulated some credit card debts and then she got another travel job. I prorated her final month of living-at-home rent to help her out and away she goes. Then the following month, this month, there's no rent money in my account. I text her and it starts this big fight about how I'm this that and the other and I accuse her of being disrespectful and dismissive of me and she says she doesn't have any money because she used it all on her credit card and at this point I'm done with it she had breached my trust by thinking she could just ignore the rent and not even think to talk to me about it. So I told her I'd hold onto her things until she comes to get them unless she wants me to mail them to her and that was that she doesn't live with me anymore. \n\nHer final defense was that she thought I would be understanding and let her get caught up on everything before I started charging rent again. But, she never talked to me about that and to me that was just her trying to make me feel like a rotten person for standing up for myself. She also brought up how it was \"only 3 days into the month\" but.. I pay my bills on time because if I don't there's consequences to that choice and since she told me she spent all her money on the credit card I think she chose to not pay me. Which if she had just talked to me about it I like to think I would've been understanding but right now I don't know if I would've been.",

I assume it's a well known fact that a lot of Jewish people have curly, unruly hair. It made no sense to me how describe my hair by my ethnicity could be offensive, so I just kept being like, \"well, how is it bad?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I know it's not as defined of a category but at least among the communities I have lived in, in the past, it was great  way to describe what is happening on top of my head.

Now technically everyone is since we play Jackbox games a lot, but by \"on his phone\" I mean like social media and distracted by other things.  He was posting random selfies of himself on Snapchat while we were playing. When we play games that don't require phones, he's still on his phone.  Even sometimes when we all have dinner if it's late, he's on his phone while we're all chatting.\n\nNow, I don't really mind it when someone else is hosting, but if I'm hosting and he's on his phone, it hurts a little because it comes across like he's bored, and I feel that's a failure on my part as the person trying to make sure everyone is having fun.  I'm pretty close to him to, which makes it hurt just a little bit more.\n\nI know he does have fun, as he's told me, and I genuinely don't think he realizes how it comes across, and it  So, WIBTA if I asked him to try and not be on his phone when he's at get togethers at my house?

      "description": "Usual situation applies - I don't think I'm being an asshole here, but someone else does so I'm turning to the internet for a verdict. \n\nI have been friends with Simon for a decade. We went to university together and are part of a group who meet once or twice a year for a weekend somewhere and we often congregate for weddings/life events and whatnot. \n\nSimon got married last year. His wife is lovely and we get on well. However, since they were engaged, Simon gets his wife involved in everything. She comes to every group event, every weekend away. No one else brings their significant others. \n\nRecently I was going through a tough time with my family, at work, and had a friend diagnosed with terminal cancer. I called Simon for advice and support (he is a doctor) and halfway through the call his wife chimed in with her own advice. Simon had put me on speakerphone and I had no idea. I barely know her and she stated asking me questions about my friend's diagnosis and treatment. I felt uncomfortable knowing she had been listening to me at one of my lowest ever points. Everytime I've called him since, Simon has put me on speakerphone. \n\nRecently we've been trying to organise another event. No one has invited their partners, but Simon has already said his wife is coming. I'd really like for us to have one event this year without partners, but I know this would upset Simon. I also want to ask him not to put me on speakerphone when discussing personal stuff. \n\nMy friend thinks I am a dick for suggesting this, that she's his wife and he has every right to include her the way he wants to do in his life. She also thinks that because I am a woman that it is unrealistic of me to expect my friendship  with Simon to stay the same now he is married and that I should be welcoming his wife into phonecalls and all events with open arms. \n\nSo WIBTA for suggesting one meetup per year without partners and to not put me on speakerphone, knowing it would probably upset him?\n",

I should also mention that unless my Uncle had wanted to show his brother this monitor they had at their house,  they were away to see my other cousin give birth to their first grandchild, my cousin could have died from the said shock as she was there to feed their dogs. It would also help with my situation regarding my baby brother. (He's an A grade dick and asshole, won't go into detail, but I just dislike living with him) I can also stay near my grandparents as my grandfather had recently went to the hospital due to a near stroke incident and I do not want to be too far away from them.\n\nThough I started thinking about how my mother and step-father have been pushing me to live with them ever since I turned 18 and am soon going to college. As of late, I have either said I'm good or just flat out ignored whatever they were saying in regards to living with them. \n\nI'm mostly thinking of myself here as my step-father REALLY creeps me out. He always wants to see me when him and my mother would come and visit. He would constantly text me just to get me out of my room. Hell there were times where he would message me on FB at 2 in the morning! He happens to drink and considering I look like my mother, I am afraid something would happen. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I went to live with my cousin instead of them?",

      "description": "So it was a destination wedding, his brothers in fact, and weâre both a part of the wedding. He was stressing a bit about the hotel (the place him and his girlfriend booked ended up being around 400$ for the weekend) and I had my place booked as well. My family has a time share type of thing, they have points that have been saved up and needed to be used so she booked the place with points as a gift for me. It would end up being 25$ a night for âfees/parking/Etc.â(they have to get some money somehow right). So 75$ for the 3 nights of course I was happy. \n\nNow our families are close so my mom asked what my friend was doing and just suggested that we book the room for two beds and just save some money for all of us by staying together. Have them pay the fees and they get the hotel for 75$ instead of 400$+ and I would get the weekend for free basically. I agreed and it sounded like a good plan. Everyone agreed.\n\nNow let me preface this by saying I was pretty broke at the time so this was all working out pretty great. But the closer the weekend got he started asking if we split the price of the hotel, drive (about a 5 hour drive) basically the cost of the trip split between us. So for a while I was under the impression that my family booking the hotel (a really nice hotel) and in turn saving them 300$+ was my way of paying for my part of the trip. Because before this I was just going to have the room for myself for 75$ and they were paying a lot more. We got into an argument about it a bit but the situation was dropped and we all had a pretty great weekend. I ended up giving him 25$ for gas but that was about it(25$ from each of us pretty much covered the gas for the trip). \n\nAITA for saying no Iâm not paying for the hotel? \n\nPS    This happened over a year ago and weâre still best friends and will probably always be, I only recently discovered this subreddit and I truly felt like I might be an asshole in this situation.

      "description": "I'm in my mid 20s, a student at university and married to a non-student (aka my husband has good income, money is not the issue when it comes to getting a dog).\n\nWe are an international couple. Our families live approx. 5000 miles/8000km away from each other. For now we live in my home country for at least the next 3 years. We don't intend to stay here though and I could imagine very well to spend a few years in his home country or maybe a country we both never lived in before. We both love to travel and are not bound to a country in our minds.\n\nI have the urge to get a dog since I moved out of my parents home (9 years ago). I grew up with dogs and I know about the work involved, but also about the love I can share with them. I look through shelter websites regularly but I never dare to actually make a move. I'm scared of being irresponsible, for I know that a dog in my care possibly has to endure getting shipped by air cargo. Possibly multiple times during their lifetime.\n\nAITA for still wanting a dog?",

      "description": "I(20M) live with my dad (61) and stepmom (40). My dad doesn't have a steady income and gets paid per job. My stepmom meanwhile is on disability and therefore gets a fixed income from social security. I am a student working part time, and I plan to pay off a truck I am buying from a friend. I started making payments in December, and told him I would finish in March.\n\nLast night my stepmom asked me if she could borrow my car because my dad would working late. I (reluctantly) said yes after she said she would be gone for just over an hour. She was gone until close to 11:30. She left around 7.\nAn hour after she got home, she came back into my room, and asked me if she could borrow $40 because her friend was at the casino and she wanted to go. I said sure, but all I have is a hundred dollar bill, and to just bring me the $60 in change back because it's the last of my money until I get paid and give me the other $40 when she had it. She hadn't asked me to borrow my car, I assumed my dad had come home sooner than expected and she was taking his van. Later I find out she took my car. I let it go because she has always been good about asking to borrow it and I let her borrow it earlier.\n\nThis morning, I get up and find out that she didn't come last night and slept at her friends house with my car because she didn't want to get pulled over (I have a headlight out). So my dad takes me to get my car, turns out now it has a flat tire. Not only that, but I also learned she disregarded what I said about the $60 and spent the entire $100. I was pissed about the money, but I didn't have class today so I wasn't super upset about the tire.. I just bought the tire a year and a half ago and I knew the warranty was still good, so I took it to the shop I got it from, told him what happened, and he said he would take care of it. I thought everything was done.\n\nThen he called me saying she must've hit a pothole last night because she dented the rim and broke the seal on the tire, and that the warranty isn't going to cover it. He said he could fix it and give me a break on the tire but, best case scenario, I'm looking at minimum $200. I then told my dad all of this and he said I should just not fix it since I'm going to be getting rid of the car in two weeks and it would be a waste of my money. But I'm not just getting rid of it I'm giving it to my mother since she needs a vehicle.\n\nSo, a long story, and probably more than I needed share, but my question is: Would I be the asshole for asking my stepmom to pay for the repairs since she caused them? If I dish out $200 to fix this thing, then I won't be able to keep my word and give my friend my truck payment for this month. At the same time, I refuse to screw my mom over in this situation and make it her problem. I also know 100% that my father is going to argue that my stepmom shouldn't have to pay for the repairs because I can't be absolutely certain that she is the one who dented my rim, and it wasn't me.",

I was genuinely excited for him, asked him to tell me about her, etc. Then, I volunteered to not visit him, because like, from an outsider perspective, that would seem weird, and I wanted to respect that boundary, you know what I mean? But then my best friend told me that we couldnât even spend time together when weâre both in our hometown, because that would make his girlfriend uncomfortable. I said âokâ and that was it, we havenât talked since, even though I have since reached out to ask how heâs doing. \n\nAITA for being upset heâs willing to not be my friend anymore?

      "description": "So, my friend (let's call him Bob) was obsessing over this girl Alice for like ages. In high school, they'd hang out all the time and he'd like randomly walk to her house to hang out with her. The thing is he's really bad at starting any type of relationship so he kind of gets stuck in the weird limbo where it seems like they're dating but it's unclear.\n\nMy other friend (let's call him Eve. He's a guy but I like cryptographic names lol) and I both mutually agreed that we should try to convince him to talk to her about it and maybe ask her out in some way. During one of our hangouts, we sat in my Boi Eves car and we spent about thirty minutes convincing Bob this would be good for him so he could get some closure and if she wasn't into him, he could just move on with his life.\n\nThe issue is that I hang out with Bob a lot so I was also fairly close with Alice too.\n\nSo, Eve starts driving me and Bob to meet up with Alice (Eve and I were just going to stay in the car and we would just drop Bob off). Bob for some reason starts calling Alice and they're talking about how they need to meet up and talk. But, while they were talking on the phone, Alice texts me telling me that she didn't like Bob in that way and that she just wants to be friends.\n\nWe were about forty seconds away from the meet up point at this moment in time, and in my head, I just decided not to tell Bob this information and instead told Alice to go meet up with him and tell him yourself. That as a guy, you get a better sense of closure if you get that sort of information from the girl herself.\n\nAnd I honestly believe that. I think that there's value in hearing from the girl herself. Plus, I think every guy will benefit from putting himself out there and taking a chance with a girl.\n\nHowever, I told Eve what happened immediately after Bob left to talk to Alice and he immediately disapproved. Then, within a couple of days my whole friend group found out what I had done and almost all the guys who heard it thought that i was in the wrong.\n\nThe issues that they had with my decision was that my decision was in a way choosing for Bob. If I had told Bob, then he could've still gone out and tried asking her out and he would've still gotten the benefit of putting himself out there. But because I took action I take away this decision. \n\nFurthermore, they argued that as a friend, I have a duty to stop my friend from embarrassing himself if I can.\n\nThe problem I have with these arguments is that Bob making a decision after he knows that Alice doesn't like him is not nearly the same thing as making the decision without the information. And his decision to ask her out without the information is more important than his decision with the information because Bob wouldn't ask her out if he had it.\n\nIn some sense, by telling him, I'm forcing him into a position in which he wouldn't ask her out and by not telling him, I'm forcing him into a position in which he would ask her out. So either way, I'm still forcing a decision, so it's not unreasonable for me to pick the choice I think he would appreciate the most.\n\nAs for their second point, in my head, the value of hearing from the girl herself outweighed the negative repurcussions of asking her out. And that's not an unreasonable thing to assume especially given forty seconds to make my decision.\n\nInterestingly all the girls I've asked agreed with me and all the guys I've asked say I fucked up.\n\nSo what do you think? Am I the asshole?\n\nAlso, I just realized that the only cryptographic name that would work for me is Mallory as I literally dropped a message from Alice to Bob.",

      "description": "I (29F) and my boyfriend (32M) have been together for almost three years. When we met, I had a travel credit card that I did a lot of research for and get pretty good rewards. I try to put everything I can on this card and I always pay it off at the end of the month. I'm careful about keeping track of spending and I have never paid any interest on it and it was the only credit card I used regularly. \n\nI tried to get my boyfriend to get a rewards credit card, but he is not interested. He's not the greatest about paying things off on-time/in-full and is ok with paying interest occasionally (which defeats the purpose of a rewards card). No judgement here, it's just not for him.\n\nAs a result, I usually pay for everything, to get as many points as possible, and then I send him Venmo (payment app) requests every few weeks. We usually split everything 50/50.\n\nRecently, there was a great promotion for an airline credit card for an airline that I use a lot. And it came at a perfect time because we were planning a big move and would easily meet the spending requirements for the rewards - 40,000 airline points and a companion pass where he can fly with me for free each time I fly! - I travel a bit more than him for work. So I opened the card and paid for everything just like I usually would. We met the spending requirement pretty easily and got the companion pass (he is, of course, my companion for the year). Well yesterday he said that he should get half of the airline points too. I'm a little torn about this one. I feel like this is my reward for staying on top of everything with my card (paying for everything upfront, keeping track of spending, keeping track of and requesting money from my boyfriend, etc.). I asked if he thought he should get half of my cash back on the original card that I have, and he said yes.\n\nHe says things like \"it's free money!\" But I don't feel the same. I work for those rewards and am very diligent about spending and paying things off. It's also a pain sometimes to request the money from him and remind him when he isn't on top of sending the money over to me. If he were to get a credit card with points, I would be happy to split purchases with him so he could get rewards too, but it isn't worth the hassle to him.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to share?

      "description": "I work in a large office where we are constantly talking on the phone to clients and attorneys and allegedly focusing on important tasks. A new woman started recently and she likes to keep her phone in her pocket playing adult soft rock radio at a low level. Itâs just loud enough to make out what sound it is and I doubt anyone on the other end of the phone could hear it, but itâs really distracting. No one else seems to mind though. I mentioned it to her before that there was music coming from her phone because I thought it was an accident but she just laughed it off. I now realize itâs not an accident and she does it all the time. Am I being a party pooper or is it weird for her to be playing music in the workplace? I just donât see any need for it at all. We donât have radios or any sound in the office normally other than ourselves talking on the phone for business.",

      "title": "AITA for making a boxing trainee angry by correcting her moves but she thought I was grilling her?",
      "description": "I help out as a trainer in my father's boxing gym. Each  trainer is assigned a number of trainees ranging from 3 to 5 in a  training session. For this session, I had to take care of  four women trainees. I would like to mention that these are all  amateur trainees; most are to here for fitness, not to learn boxing.\n\nFrom the beginning, two of the trainees were talking pretty much non-stop with each other. I did not have a problem with it; we also don't have the rule of 'no talking' during training. The  only problem would be if another trainee complains to us about someone  talking too much, in which case, I guess we'd have to take action. But such was not the case, there was no one who complained.\n\nAfter the first hour of workout, I transitioned into heavy bag workout. In a bag work, as a trainer, I have to do two things -  hold the bag and tell the moves to be executed by the trainee, and count the timing. Usually, each move is done for 10 counts.\n\nDuring this period, one of the women who was talking was not doing the moves correctly. This is a common thing - for many trainees, the trainers don't force them to get every move right because  we know that it is not the main concern. But sometimes, out of instinct, we would try to fix the posture or show how to do a move correctly. So, I tried to correct her - she was doing a hook wrong. It went well. (I would also like to say that she was still talking with her friend) And then, her turn comes again and I had her do some punches. I counted to 10, but as it sometimes happen, she missed  her 10th count. So, I told her that she still has one count of moves left to do. This is something that happens often - both trainees and trainers can miss their counts.\n\nHowever, she suddenly became angry at me, and said something along the lines of  'I come here to relax and talk with my friend. Stop grilling me, and I  don't care about the techniques or doing them properly'.\n\nI  was shocked. As a non-confrontational person, I told her that I didn't have a problem with her talking to her friend and that I wasn't trying to grill her. At that point, we still had plenty of time left and there were others waiting so I didn't want to dwell on the matter. The rest of the session went awkwardly but by the end, she was  back to normal and I pretended like everything was okay. I meant to talk  to her by the end just to clarify myself but I didn't end up doing it.\n\nThis whole thing is still in my mind. I've seen that woman and her friend  come to train before; they're generally nice people. Something just went wrong today and I guess ruined her time? I don't feel like I was being an asshole cos correcting moves and keeping count correctly was just part of my duty and I was doing my job. But beyond that duty is some gray area where I'm supposed to satisfy a customer where I guess I messed up?",

      "title": "AITA for ignoring my friend after her comment about my dead uncle?",
      "description": "Alright, the title looks like Iâm innocent, and no.\nThe day when XXXTentacion died, there was a period of time when I thought it was fake news. It was very early in the day and some places were saying it was false and I just figured he got shot but he was okay. \nHe wasnât, no disrespect. \nHe had been a meme within me and my friend after we listened to one of his songs a while back. From what she said about him to me, it looked like she didnât care about him as well. Now, we also make jokes about dead/recently deceased people. Not classy, I know, but we donât do it to be mean. \nMy uncle passed away from cancer early 2018. His death was a shock to the family as heâd only been in the hospital for about two weeks before he died and no one told us exactly what it was. My dad was extremely distraught, as that was his only brother. He takes out his emotions on me and my mom (nothing physical, just anger over small things and extreme judgment). So, for me and my mom, grieving for my uncle was only made worse by my dadâs mood swings, which I tried to take for my mom. \nMy depression had taken a toll again and overall life was very hard. \nMy friend knew this, as she was closest to me. \nSo, back to the day XXXTentacion died. During that period of time when I was pretty sure he was okay, my friend posted a Snapchat story that had a screenshot of this news article about him getting shot. I saw this while getting on my phone to avoid crying as my family and I were talking about my uncle. I slid up on my friendâs story saying: âyikes XXXTentadead.â It wasnât even funny, but I thought she thought it was a meme. \nShe responded with: âThatâs fucked up man, itâs like me making fun of your fucking dead uncle. Not funny.â \nI was a bit taken aback, and just responded saying that it was my bad. But I didnât see how an artist she didnât know getting shot was like my uncle dying. It was much more personal for me and all that. She mocked my joke saying my uncleâs name with âdeadâ mixed in somewhere. I just said okay and havenât talked to her. \nI realize I shouldnât have said the joke, but I also thought she would be okay with it, as weâd made jokes about dead people and rappers before. I know itâs not good to do so, and so fully admit that I really shouldnât have said anything. \nI also donât think she should have brought up my uncle knowing that my family still wasnât okay. \nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "2 of us were supposed to write a 10 page paper on Tesla and it's influence. I take my work very seriously but this person had told me she's good at writing therefore I obliged to be her project partner. \n\nTurns out she never wants to meet up and wants to do everyone on doc. I'm not cool with it but I comply. She finishes her part previous night (it was due today). I looked over it 1 hour before it's due and her whole part was sub-par quality which was a C grade work, not an A grade.\n\nI re-edit 4 pages of her part to make it sound like my parts. I was having a bad day and seeing this BS quality work pushed me to casually text her \"Your part has so many errors. I need to fix all of this.\"\n\n To which she replied \"no I'm positive there's so dramatic errors. Don't edit my parts.\" \n\nWe meet up in class and show her the history of edits. She gets pissed off and says \"sure. Whatever. Submit it\". I sent her a text saying I don't want interpersonal conflict and that our parts weren't matching. I told her It's her fault for not wanting to meet up and have subpar quality work therefore i just had to take action cause I care about an A. Does giving her a piece of my head make me an asshole?\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA For still hating my parents for kicking me out when I was 18?",
      "description": "TLDR Below\n\nSo, I'm 23 now but this happened when I was 18 just 3 months after I graduated highschool, and I still think about this a lot. \n\nLittle back story: My parents were very verbally abusive to me growing up. They would just yell so loud at me constantly for even the smallest mistakes I made, did I get a B- in English? Well then you're getting an hour long yell session from Dad about how much of a loser I was. Were you 20 minutes late past your bed time? Another hour long yell session from your dad about being \"disrespectful\" to your family. \n\nSo to the incident, I had just graduated highschool and had just finished a little summer job at the pool and I was straight unemployed. If you had asked me at the time what my plans were for post graduation I woulda said \"Fuck if I know\", to be honest I had no ambition at that time. So anyways, one night my Dad and sisters were talking about that modern silent movie \"The Artist\" and my youngest sister, who was maybe 13 at the time, said \"It was so dumb how it was silent!\" Now my sister has always been a very pretentious smarter than thou kinda lady. She's the kinda person when you ask them about something as classic as Lord of the Rings she would still smugly look at you and say \"Oh wow, you like that shitty movie?\" Usually I just bite my tongue and don't say anything. But that time I said something like \"You do realise that's the entire point of the film right?\" Very dickishly and she runs off crying to her room. (Later I would find out my sister has some very serious mental health issues that stems from my parents doing the same shit to her, I know this because one time I went to therapy with her and found out)\n\nFast forward 2 hours later, my parents call me to the kitchen table and said something like \n\n\"You know your made your little sister cry right? You're a real asshole\"\n\nMe being a smug teenager say something like \n\n\"Ehh I've been called worse\" \n\nThen my dad says \"Well we're going to have to ask you to leave, you have till Friday to leave\" \n\nI say \"Okay sounds good\" super smug like again and go to my room. I ended up having to beg my buddy's dad to let me stay with him which I did rent free, Russell if you're reading this you're a fucking saint, for a few months till I found a place with my friends. \n\nSince then me and my parents do kinda stay in touch, I never talk to my Dad unless I have to. I didn't even tell him goodbye when I left to move 1800 miles away. But I still talk to my Mom regularly and we even have matching tattoos. My dad has apologized for the shitty way he treated me when I was a kid so there's that. But still, to this day I feel a lot of hate towards them, I hate them because I feel like they robbed me of having an enjoyable childhood that I could look back on with joy, now I avoid anything that reminds me of being a kid because everytime I do I just think about my dad yelling at me. I avoid my mom's calls and texts like the plague because it reminds me  Fuck, I had to move 1800 miles away from my home town and friends just to escape it. I hate them because I feel like they stole my chance of having a normal loving relationship with an awesome family, not even my sisters and me are close because of our upbringing. I hate them because of the mental health issues I have to deal with daily because of what they did to me. Idk, am I the asshole for still feeling this way? AITA for denying then a relationship with their adult child and treating them poorly even though they have genuinely tried to patch things up? Should I just forgive them or what? \n\nTLDR: AITA the asshole for not forgiving my parents for kicking me out when I was 18 and being verbally abusive to me and my sisters growing up?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So  some context. I'm the oldest out of 4 sisters. I'm a male 26. However  its my Full sister (23) and Half sister (19) the other two are not an  issue. For years I have always been isolated with my family because my  Step father basically made me feel unloved and unwanted through abuse in  my own home for years. But my little sisters got all of it new tvs,  computers, phones whatever they said they got. Me? Nothing. I get some  games but I didn't get a new TV till I had to tell my Grandpa (Truest  father figure) how bs it was they have giant flat screens and I had a tv  I had sense I was 10 hell they even had there own A/C Vents I had to  use a damn walmart fan to stay cool in the summer.\n\nThey're  spoiled/loved and most of my family did play favoritism mostly with  them which they do too this day (I have many examples to give). I don't  pretend I was a saint as a kid but even if I do nothing anything wrong I  would get yelled at by my full blood sister, insulted, feeling  unwanted. Honestly I sometimes hate her. Like I want to have a  relationship with her I do, but for so long I don't even think she  understood what I went thought, not completely. The only time I ever get  I love you from my full sister is just a text message or just a  facebook post during events (Birthdays, sad posts etc). I honestly can't  remember a time where she said it to my face.\n\nLast  year my uncle passed and I saw how my real fathers siblings basically  never spoke or even care for each other. It broke me and I confronted  her saying I don't want that for us. I don't remember 100% what she said  but it was very much ignored and not care for. Recently I've kinda  \"snapped\" My mom is getting a divorce from my asshole step father so she  moved in with me and has been playing good mom (which is just her  saying how much she loves me) when honestly from her it's just a word.  She did nothing to protect me or get me out of that house and saw how I  was treated and did nothing for me when she was completely able too.  Telling her how pissed off and hurt I've been for most of my life seeing  how they got to eat gold while I ate shit or they I had to basically  deal with mental, emotional and some physical abuse from my step dad  while they had the fucking red carpet. They get away with murder but god  forbid I raise my voice I get fucking punished. How she admits she knew  how I felt and just thought \"I thought it would of changed\" pretty sure  after idk the first 10 years nothing did should of been your first  indicator. She gets I'm hurting but I'm not better. I wanted a family  for so long and too have my sisters the only siblings I have in my life  to basically make me feel I don't matter to them all these years, its to  much and too just have some kind of affection that is real alot too ask for? \n\nReddit what do I do? Would I be a asshole for telling how I feel?",

      "description": "It started back about a year and a half ago when I got together with this girl Iâm gonna call Anna. Things started out great and we were super in love with each other, but as the relationship went on her love for me turned into what Iâd almost call obsession. Anna began to become very controlling of me and wanted me to be with her nearly every second I could. \n\nShe had unrealistically high standards set when it came to spending time with her, and if I couldnât fulfill them sheâd threaten to breakup with me. I of course wanted to keep her so I tried my best to make her happy. I spent all of my free time in school with her (which involved eating lunch with her, walking her to every single class, sitting on the bus with her, ect.) and spent at least three times a week with her outside of school. Anna eventually cut me off from all of my friends and soon enough my only focus was her. I was really trying my best to put in the effort and commit to her like she wanted. \n\nDespite this it still wasnât enough. If I ever flaked on plans, which wasnât often at all, sheâd freak out and guilt trip me a hella lot for it. This even involved last minute events that were completely out of my control. On top of that, if I ever said no to plans because I had to study or catch up on homework, sheâd make it seem like I was in the wrong or it was my fault. I had grades to keep up with, and though I tried to make her my top priority sometimes it didnât work out that way.\n\nEventually she broke up with me because âshe didnât feel the same anymore.â When I asked her why, she responded something about there being âa lot of distance in the relationshipâ and how it made her âunfeelingâ towards me. She pretty much then told me how our breakup was completely my fault because I didnât spend enough time with her or put in the effort. I was super heartbroken and felt so guilty about it.\n\nAITA for not spending enough time with her? ",

      "title": "AITA For asking my dad's girlfriend to take down our wedding photos from her website/social media?",
      "description": "Background: My mom passed away 5 years ago. It was extremely hard on the family...to no surprise probably hit my dad the hardest. He spent the next couple years depressed. Then he met a woman, let's call her Sally. Sally is an interesting character. She's had two prior marriages which both ended in unfortunate circumstances (both husbands are deceased from natural causes). She tends to be very controlling, manipulative, and is overly sensitive. Me and my two siblings have given her a chance, but it gets harder each time one of these incidents comes up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe situation: My wife and I got married this past year. We had a month of coordinator and a photographer. Sally was there with my dad, obviously. She helped us out with a few things here and there, mostly suggestions. My wife essentially planned the whole wedding otherwise. Anyway, afterwards, Sally asks us if she can use our wedding photos for own event planning business she was starting. No problem, we said, thinking she would use pictures of our wedding that included the stuff she loaned us or made suggestions on.\n\nWell, she put up pictures of virtually everything other than what she worked on. This was on a website, her facebook, and instagram. We didn't really know the extent of it because we didn't really look...but hashtags like #weddingcoordinator were used in each picture. Our actual wedding coordinator apparently found this, and made her OWN post using a picture of me and my wife from the wedding and slamming Sally. She did not mention Sally by name nor me and my wife, but the post was scathing and detailed how stealing someone's work was not okay and it was \"filthy\". Basically, she thought Sally was claiming to coordinate our wedding when she hadn't.\n\nMy wife and I were floored by this and we e-mailed our coordinator that it was unprofessional and she needed to take the post down. She did within minutes and apologized. Why she didn't e-mail or call us first I don't know. She claims she enraged that we knew about this (we didn't) and that she worked hard for our wedding (she didn't). \n\nAfter this, we get on the phone with my dad and Sally. After a lot of humming and hawing, Sally appeared to agree to take down the pictures. My dad got defensive of her and suggested that she did more for our wedding than our actual coordinator. Sally also told us she never once claimed to have coordinated our wedding. I could tell Sally did not like the idea of taking the photos down, and when we said goodbye she gave us a quiet \"bye\" like she was upset.  Later that night I told my dad that our actual coordinator took down the post, and he asked if that meant Sally could keep the pictures up. I said no, they need to be taken down. It's been over 24 hours and they're still up. My dad says he wants to talk to me at lunch tomorrow.\n\nAITA? I can't be...right?",

      "description": "So, I've been friends with this guy for about 11 years. That's over half of our lives, and I'd say 9 of those years were great fun and I loved having him around.\n\nNow onto the reason for this post, over the last 2 or 3 years he's been going through stuff, parent troubles, money troubles, the works. And I've always stood by him,  he knows I'm always there for him and there to talk and hangout when ever he needs me. However, he never really takes me up on that, I cannot really fault him for that, but that also isn't the issue.\n\nBecause of the personal reasons states above he became less available to hang out with and do things, I understood this as it's perfectly natural that he would need time for himself. I feel I've been respecting that, but I have been at University so I'm no longer living within walking distance so our ability to hangout had decreased violently.\n\nBut my main problem is, I have started having my own problems, money related and mental health (Really bad anxiety) which I've been dealing with I feel fairly well. But I think my biggest problem right now is this friendship with him, I'm worried about him almost 24/7 which just adds to my anxiety. On top of him not showing up to things he'd be there for, just in general not talking to me, I'm sort of realising that this friendship might not be best for either of us.\n\nSo what I want to know is: If I ended this friendship, in the name of restoring out mental health (I feel like I've been putting a lot of pressure on him).

      "description": "At the time this happened I worked as a music journalist. On a weekly basis, I wrote the local music column (pretty good pay for the work involved tbh), gig reviews which featured in he national supplements of the weekly paper (Â£25 a pop) &amp; freelance pieces as and when I produced them (pay varied).\n\nI'd email my editor once a week telling him what was on and he'd tell me what to cover. One benefit of this was if there was a gig I *wanted* to go to it would be one of the gigs I'd cover. This was great as I'd get a free ticket plus one and get paid Â£25 on top of that to write a short review.\n\nThe downside was it often meant covering artists I didn't like (who I'd always review objectively!) Once you factored in travel time, the 3-4 hours there, then writing &amp; proofing the review it could take 5-6 hours total. Meaning I would be earning significantly less than minimum wage. I was cool with this though, as the free tickets to gigs I wanted to go more than balanced that out.\n\nA local hero who had become hugely successful was playing a hometown show so obviously this was a gig needing covered. I wasn't really a fan, nor was anyone I knew, so I was flying solo at a gig I didn't want to be at.\n \nThe way it usually worked is you wouldn't have a 'ticket' but would be added to the guest list. So I went to the box office, gave my name and waited for my pass.  I was then told there was a minimum Â£10 donation to charity for everyone on the guest list.\n\nNow there's nothing wrong with this. The majority of guest list, particularly at this hometown gig, would have been friends, family and hangers on, so not entirely unreasonable, however two things.\n\nFirstly, I'm not a friend, family member or hanger on, I was a professional there to do a job.  Secondly I only had 5 quid with me (to buy a drink with...I deliberately only ever took a fiver when I was reviewing as I didn't want to blow most of my pay chugging diet coke and red bull.)\n\nI was a bit annoyed as I'd be parched during the gig but I handed over the five pounds anyway, only to get a bollocking from the box office attendant. When I explained that not only was it all I had, I was there for work not pleasure, that now I couldn't even get a water, I would much rather be at home on the sofa spending time with my girlfriend and that even if I had the full Â£10 that would be 40% of my pay for the evening she still have me grief.\n\nAfter a brief argument, which involved her guilt tripping me for not giving to charity and me asking if she was donating 40% of her evening's wages to charity, I eventually went in.\n\nFor what it's worth it was a surprisingly good show and I gave it a very good review.\n\nSo...am I the asshole for not donating the full amount to charity, or am I actually halfway decent for giving the only money I had on me to the charity box?",

      "description": "One of my good friends from high school recently reached out to me for money. He told me he needs to pay $300 to his mom every month and he wasnât going to be able to come up with the money in time. (There deal was he pays $300 and she pays for school). \n\nMy friend and I havenât spoken in months before this. Our mutual friend and I hang out all the time despite the distance between us. We were a trio in high school and the loanee has been drifting apart since we all went our own ways since graduation. \n\nI went full on into owning a business while they went to school. I make a good living and they know that. I donât believe in loans. I would rather either give the money with no return or someone earning it. My friend has worked many fast food jobs for as long as I can remember. I know he makes enough  to pay his mom and probably didnât manage his finances enough this month. He was saying that he was planning on using his tax return to pay her but it hadnât come in yet. He promised the minute it came in heâd pay me back. I interpreted that as âI over spent this month because I was expecting my return but it never happened so now Iâm screwedâ. \n\nI didnât want to ârewardâ poor money management skills so I offered him a job. \n\nItâs was really simple stuff and I offered to pay him directly at the end of the week so he can pay his mom. I was 100% going to be overpaying but I wanted to give him a chance. \n\nI also gave him the option that if he came up with $150 Iâd match the rest and he wouldnât owe me anything.  \n\nHe told me that I wasnât \tbeing a good friend. That I was trying to âmake a lesson out of himâ. That he came to me in his time of need and Iâm just trying to get him to work for me. I was offering $300 to be a glorified receptionist cause we are entering a busy period in my business. I was really frustrated that he felt that way. \n\nI told our mutual friend and he brought up that he probably asked me because it was less embarrassing than asking his new friends he made in school. I just felt used, like I was a bank account for one of my good friends. I just feel like his pride wonât allow him to tell his mom he fucked up. They arenât a family in rough financial times, I know sheâd understand. \n\nAITA here? Him and his girlfriend seem to think so. My girlfriends neutral cause she thinks I should consider our past and understand. I just feel like weâve been drifting apart and the first time weâve talked in months is about a loan. I donât want to track down the money and get it back. Should I just give it to him? Just feels like thereâs a price tag on our friendship now. ",

      "description": "I still love her but I am incredibly lonely, bored and depressed because the only thing she ever wants to do is see a movie, or take a nap.   She gets home from work everyday, goes upstairs and goes to bed leaving me to make sure our son does his homework, practices drums, and cook dinner\n\nEvery weekend, either I fix breakfast or we go out.  We come back and she runs upstairs to sleep the rest of the afternoon away.  I usually have to rush home from work even though they expect us to work 50-60 hours a week because sheâs asleep and not paying any attention to our mildly autistic son.\n\nShe was diagnosed bipolar 2 shortly after he was born 11 years ago.  She takes a mood stabilizer and trazadone every night to âhelp her sleep.â  Im pretty sure thatâs part of it, but I canât talk to her about it without her getting super defensive and shutting down on me.  Even before the medication, she always needed a lot of sleep.\n\nShe does work a full time job and makes very good money.  Her job is very stressful which probably contributes to her being exhausted all the time.  She is a loving mother and does have a good relationship with our son.  She has been sick with some cold for like the last 2 weeks, but the sleeping all the time thing is constant.\n\nToday was the last straw.  She called in to work because she wanted to sleep in and our son didnât have school.  She woke up, got Starbucks for him, and sat on the couch all day playing on her phone while he played Fortnite literally all day.  I asked her to take him to the trampoline park so he could get some exercise.  Get a text while Iâm at work that sheâs tired and taking a nap and can I take him when I get home?  I needed to stay late because Iâm super behind at work but she was already fast asleep and not answering by the time I got it.\n\nI tried talking to her about it but she doesnât think itâs a problem.  I let her know Iâm sick of being alone all the time and I needed more out of the relationship.  I said I wanted to give her a chance to work on things.  Her response was, âthis is bullshit.  Youâre probably seeing someone else.â  I have cheated before but Iâm not now.  \n\nAITA for wanting to throw in the towel?  ",

      "description": "Title is basically the TL;DR. \nWe've been dating for about two years now, we're doing long distance so it has its challenges but we're making it work. In the past two months or so, she's been in this malaise. She cries a lot, she's constantly putting herself down, she frequently doubts herself and constantly states that she's tired and has no energy. She says this feeling has come around the same time every year, and eventually goes away. \nIve done my usual ways of helping, generally talking, being patient and waiting it out. Recently though it's gotten too much, there are brief moments, days, where she feels fine, she laughs and smiles. But overall it's difficult, and so I have suggested seeing a professional. At first it was only a suggestion and I dropped the topic. Today I finally put my foot down and am making her see someone. She has scheduled an appointment for the 19th, but constantly worries about it. She says  various things such as \"it's not going to help\" \"I'm fine it's a big deal over nothing\" \"I'm going to feel fake or I feel like I'll just be saying things to get a diagnosis\" or even \"I can't talk to them they're a stranger it's impossible and it's not going to do anything they're going to tell me that I'm wasting their time.\" We had a pretty heated discussion about it where I at first tried to systematically dismantle the arguements, I eventually lost my patience, and started talking about how I can't do this forever. She finally agreed to go and to tell them how she feels. I feel awful for having to say that and pressuring her to go in the first place,  but she's felt that way for a while now. So am I overreacting? AITA? (I'm paying for the visit by the way, as money was a previous concern)",

      "description": "This happened about a couple years ago when we were around 14 and I've changed any names included.\n\nSo, the guy in question I'm calling Jake. He was a super quiet and nerdy guy, the type who wanted to be a librarian as a job, and while he definitely wasn't popular he had a small group of close friends. I sat beside him in a couple classes due to our second names and he was a really nice guy who was actually really funny.\n\nDuring lunch one day he was hanging out outside with a large group. They were messing about and another guy ended up falling on him and licking his face on accident (I have no clue how as I wasn't there). Anyway, from that the 'ship' was immediately born. Everyone was joking that the two were together and by the end of the day like 40 people were in on the joke. Someone created a ship name for them (it was 2016) and people wrote it on their files and never left them alone about it.\n\nJake was obviously made really uncomfortable about it, but the other guy found it kinda funny, so the joke kept on going. Everyday people (including me) would ask Jake about his 'relationship' and he would tell us to stop but in a joking way, so it continued. After a couple months the joke died off, but Jake had already become more reserved, but no one really noticed due to how quiet he already was. After a few weeks he stopped coming to school. His close friends were taken out of class a couple times but didn't tell us why. He deleted all his social media and just fell off the face of the earth. I heard from one of his friends that he developed social anxiety and doesn't like to leave his house anymore and is now homeschooled.\n\nHe had some underlining issues before this but I think this is what set him over the edge and I can't reach out to him because he deleted everything. It only dawned on me recently what happened and the part I might have played in this. AITA or do you guys think there could have been another reason for him dropping out?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: A classmate developed social anxiety and dropped out of school possibly because of a joke that went too far that I was a part of.",

      "description": "My family have a tradition where we go on a family holiday (6-8 people) to celebrate milestone birthdays, and this year it's my 30th and my Mum's 60th in the same month. As soon as we started planning last year my  fiancÃ© and I said we wouldn't be able to afford an expensive holiday because we're saving for our wedding next year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took on planning the trip. Eventually everyone agreed on Morocco, instead of any of the countries my fiancÃ© and I suggested which are close and cheap. Morocco seemed like an ok option because although the flights are expensive the daily expenses are quite low. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI put together a trip within our budget, using trains to get around the country, but my Mum said that they wanted to have a private tour with a driver and a tour guide. I've spent three months speaking to about nine different travel agents and private tour companies and can't find anyone who can get us what my Mum wants for under $6.5-7k per person for a two week holiday. This is 2 or 3 times the budget that my fiance and I can afford.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've spoken privately to my Mum three times about our concerns about the cost of the trip and been told they don't want to compromise on the private guide, the driver, or the destination. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday I got my schedule for my upcoming semester at uni and found that I actually have exams right in the time we had planned to be in Morocco. I told everyone that we won't be able to go when we planned (during our birthdays), and also told the group chat for the first time that we have concerns about the cost of the trip. We still want to go on the trip, we just can't afford the trip everyone else wants, and we can't go at that time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow everyone's really annoyed with me and no one's talking to me. (To clarify - we haven't booked or paid anything.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know Mum's probably really hurt because this is something that she has been looking forward to for years, and it's celebrating her birthday too, but we're not saying that we don't want to go or we won't be going or even that they can't go without us - just that we need to compromise on the cost of the trip and find another set of dates!  I'm sure she's also thinking that the timing of finding out about the exams is very convenient, but I honestly couldn't have had the information before now, and I've already looked at changing units and can't make it work - the only thing I could do would be to skip a semester, which I don't want to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can also understand people being annoyed that I have been in charge of planning the trip and now I'm the one saying it won't work for us, but I've only been able to work to the requirements put out there by other people. I've also asked for suggestions and checked with companies suggested by everyone else, and even asked Mum to ask her friend who's a local tour guide in Morocco to put together an itinerary, but it hasn't come to anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I planned a holiday for the family to celebrate a pair of milestone birthdays but won't be able to go on the trip without compromises from other family members that they're not willing to make. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Throwaway because this is potentially really identifying.)",

      "description": "So my school is considered kind of a sports powerhouse, ranking at least top 15 in every sport (football, soccer, track, swimming, golf, baseball, basketball, wrestling). A decent amount of people get recruited and/or get scholarships every year. The two in question here is Jack, let's call him, who got a full ride to Oklahoma for football, and me, a recruited swimmer for Emory.\n\nSo, recently, a whole thing happened, and Jack was caught with weed in his locker. It was a big thing, and he ended up getting rescinded. \n\nSome of my friends asked my opinion of this, since I'm also recruited, although I didn't get a scholarship. Personally, I think he got what was coming. He always goes out, parties, drinks, and does weed pretty often. All this is common knowledge. All of this is also against the rules, but none of the students really cared.\n\nPersonally, I don't think a guy who goes out, parties all the time, and does a bunch of unhealthy shit (for being a teenager), he doesn't deserve a scholarship. That's what I told them. They all said I was being harsh. But I don't think it is. There are rules against weed, there are rules against drinking. He broke them. Those are the consequences.\n\nSo, am I the ashsole for this opinion?",

I told him he could help me since we still have 3 hours. He said \"I'm about to go to bed. I still have Migrain.\" I didn't buy this since i myself have had Migrain since i was little and i know it doesn't last all day.

All by herself. She said of course and was excited.\n\nSo at the beginning of this week she tells me she is pregnant. Sweet. Right.\n\nOn thrusday I work from 330am until 5pm then jump in my car and drive 23 hours straight. \n\nI dont expect much from her given that she has morning sickness and normal pregnancy issues.  I get home home exhausted but willing to watch the kids I mean they r old enough it isnt much to ask. Plus it is almost dinner time. \nShe then gathers up her purse and claims she needs to get some craft crap for our daughter. Then tells me to make dinner. At this point I take stock of the apartment and clothes are everywhere. My son's room has a pile of clean clothes on the floor, she left them. The dishes haven't been done. Basically it is not a shit show but it is working on it. \n\nI said screw it made dinner and did the dishes. (Still haven't slept yet) she gets home and I let her have it. She claims I am being an ass cause I am gone. I called her a name that I regret, but she could have just moved with me to my job.

      "title": "AITA for cutting ties with a friend that asked me out?",
      "description": "A few months ago, I (F16) became friends with a guy at my school. Iâll call him A. I go to an all-girls school but A has been questioning his gender for some time now, and prefers male pronouns. A also has a pretty obvious crush on me that became apparent fairly quickly- he would stare at me in class, come back with me to my form room, all the typical stuff. He didnât outwardly say so, but he was very open about it within his friendship group and the news got back to me- gossip spreads. I decided not to bring the topic up to him, and to let him surrender that information to me when he wanted to. But he progressively got harder to be around- our conversations disintegrated into an overwhelmingly depressive miasma and he got more and more clingy. I couldnât get away from him, as heâd follow me everywhere. We went on a walk, and after about 6 hours I said that I was tired and that I wanted to go home. He said that heâd come too and followed me back, staying at my house for another 2 hours before I surreptitiously text my mum to drive him home. \n\nI realised we had nearly nothing in common and I honestly just wanted to break off contact with him. I couldnât deal with the topic of conversation because I have diagnosed severe anxiety and experience strong suicidal thoughts, so every time we spoke about stuff in that ballpark it would bring it to the surface and put me in a vulnerable position for a good few hours. I tried to be a good friend but I felt no connection. It was difficult to empathise with his emotional state when I felt so awful myself. I could not expend that emotional energy. To be concise: it was exhausting.\n\nSo A eventually asks me out, and I tell him that I cannot reciprocate. I felt incredibly uncomfortable but also numb- I just couldnât connect with him and I felt so bored and dry throughout the rest of the day. He, again, came back to my house afterwards. Iâm not sure what I should have done, but in the next few days I blanked him completely at school. He messaged me a few times, saying things like âplease stop ignoring me, itâs exhausting trying to speak to you. What have I done wrong? Have I ruined everything?â I tried to damage control by saying Iâd speak to him the next week, and that I was just in a bad place and needed some time, but I continued to ignore him. He would come into my form room to sit and stare at me- i could feel his presence like daggers in my back. I want to keep avoiding him. I want to relinquish our friendship. I began ignoring his text messages- i feel I owe him an explanation but I just donât want to interact with him. Iâve lost friends like this before. I feel like Iâm in a perpetual state of isolating myself and that soon I will be completely on my own. \n\nAnyway. A has a new crush. He learnt on me heavily for emotional support before. I think I was bad for him- he went through some rough things, and his family situation was one wherein his parents were both away from home for long stretches of time, not to mention his gender dysphoria. I was never a good friend to him. Am I the asshole for cutting him out of my life and refusing to explain why?  Sorry for the verbal vomit.",

      "description": "Growing up a lot of my older brother's friends became my friends, since they were more family friends, I consider a few of them my brothers from another mother. The friend in question got me my first job, was always there to help us out of a jam, but most importantly he was my brother's best friend for many years. They would get into tiffs, as many best friends are apt to, but typically would resolve their issues. That is until my brother got addicted to opiates, and since then there has been festering resentment on both sides. \n\nWhat it boiled down to was that my brother was living with this friend and their family rent free while he was unemployed, and is still unemployed. This friend talked to another mutual friend, the guy who sold my brother opiates, about my brother's addiction. This sparked an intervention of sorts, and nothing has been the same since. My brother developed a sense of paranoia after that, and more issues regarding their relationship followed.\n\nI accepted their falling out, and tried my best to get them to reconcile, but it seemed both of them decided there was too much bad blood between them. I'm not one to take sides, but when my brother found out I was still talking to this friend he sent me a novel essentially telling me why I should not trust him. To be honest, I couldn't comprehend most of it, as it seemed like paranoid ranting. I'm biased in that I know addiction well, and I can see that it might be that he's just trying to defend his own addiction. \n\nThe thing is, my brother has since gotten into an outpatient program. He goes to a clinic to get methadone, and seems to realize he has a problem, which is leaps and bounds above where he's been at since this all started. Still he maintains this friend is an enemy, and I shouldn't talk to him.\n\nThis is not someone I hang out with everyday, or even talk to all that much, but I'm not ready to cut him off just because him and my brother fell out, especially considering the circumstances. \n\nAITA? Does this mean I'm not loyal to my brother? ",

      "description": "Heres the story, my girlfriend does this thing where she'll say she doesnt want to go if I ask her to go somewhere with me,especially if it involves my friends. So I asked her to go to an event a week prior, she says no. I ask her again two days before the event, no again.  I ask her the morning of, shockingly, she says no. So I get ready to leave, I'm dressed basically with a foot out the door. She comes down and says \"oh I've decided I will come with you.\" Mind you, this is at noon and I'm supposed to meet my friends in like 15 min. She says she has to shower and get dressed so itll be an hour before shes ready. I tell her I was ready to leave and that I'm annoyed that she just decided to come. She goes on this spiel about how she doesnt know If shes going to want to do things until right before because she doesnt know about her mood. I tell her the show ends at 3 and I'm already late to meet people. She tears off about how I'm putting my friends before her and she thought I'd be happy she decided to come. We argued and she told me to just go on my own but she was very angry and still brings it up. Saying \"I let you go to that thing on your own why do you need to go to this too.\" \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole here? \n\nTL;DR: Asked girlfriend if she wanted to go to event multiple times,  she said no, then wanted to go with me last minute and I called her inconsiderate. \n\n",

      "description": "So last night we were streaming us playing fighting games. She kept doing other stuff like texting on her phone or vaping on the loading screens. She got really angry that I would start attacking if the match started because she wasn't ready. She said a real gamer would wait for the other person to be ready. My side is that you should do that stuff in the character select screen and such before the match starts and be ready. It isn't like I can't start the match without her, when the match says fight it is time to fight and not my fault you aren't paying attention or doing something else.\n\nPlus I feel that people aren't watching for her to text on her phone and us to stand there while the match has started and not doing anything. If it were just us two alone I see that as an asshole boyfriend movie but as a gamer I would start whooping on anything else the same way if they weren't paying attention.She wanted to stream to so its not like it was me forcing her to play these games. These weren't emergency text and could wait a couple minutes for the 3 round bout to be over. \n\nI mainly just posted this to show her the thread after lol I'll apologize if you take her side.",

She also brought her son (Sean) over but the dad is not in the picture at all. Apparently she got fanatical about Buddhism and lived in the middle of nowhere so my mom decided to have Sean checked out by her doctor. The doctor said that Sean displays many symptoms of Marfan syndrome and he seriously needs to be checked out. I thought it is an extremely seriously issue and Sean needs to be tested right away and Cathy needs to know. However, she refuses to let Cathy or Sean know. She argues that they have no heath insurance and no money so even if she tried to let Cathy know, she wouldnât have the vast amount of money to treat Sean anyway and they donât need the extra stress right now.\n\nI tried to tell her that itâs morally wrong to keep this from Cathy but she wouldnât do it so I left it at that. I told this to my friends and they are telling me that I should surpass my mother and just tell Cathy anyway. This is going to sound cold but I donât think itâs my responsibility and I do have agree that if they have no money or health insurance, telling them wouldnât do anything either way.

      "description": "  \n\nMy GF and I have been dating for almost a year now and tings have been going great, we've talked about getting married in passing and I'm pretty sure that I'll propose to her at some point in the future. We're also on the same page about having kids, both of us are pretty sure we don't want them and because of this, we've been using BC. \n\nWhen we first started dating, we used condoms and after a while, she got on the pill. Towards the end of last year, she got an IUD, which started coming out a few weeks later which made her have to get another one about a month ago. Both experiences for her were discomforting, but it appears that weâre out of the woods and the second one is in place better.\n\nAll of this brings us to the conversation that we had a few days ago, I was talking to her on the phone on my way back from the gym and she asks \"In 10 years when I'd have to replace my IUD, would you get a vasectomy instead of me getting another IUD?\". \n\nI didn't really give her answer, my argument was that that decision would be at least 8 years from now and that telling her âYesâ now, would make me a liar if I said âNoâ when it came time to do it. I'm not opposed to getting a vasectomy, Iâve read into it some but I don't want to think about that until that decision gets a lot closer. After that, she sounded upset and I felt that the only possible answer would have been âYesâ if only not to make her feel bad. Sheâs not mad at me now, however, if that makes a difference.\n\nSo, AITA for not agreeing with my girlfriend that I should get a vasectomy, 10 years from now? ",

I had not texted her during work because, well, frankly Iâm busy doing work lol. My managers donât like seeing my phone out, and she doesnât expect me to text her while at work.

I told my gf that this was happening and after that I didnât text her until I left the house which was about 2.5 hours after. Note she had also not texted me. She had fallen asleep by the time I had reached out to her.\n\nThis morning she was livid, telling me that she is not my #1 priority, and that the evidence shows from one night of me not texting her while at a friends house.\n\nI explained to her that while she is my #1 priority, my friends also deserve my full attention when I am with them. I am not going to be texting her 24/7, it is simply not possible, and I am not capable of having a text conversation and a real one with friends while maintaining my focus.

I wanted to go see one of my best friends in Tampa, Fl (35 minutes from where I live). I wanted to be the least inconvenience as possible, so if I were to get a ride I wanted to be where people were going to be anyways. I got some friends who wanted to see her to take me up, hang out, and drop me off for a few days, and My sister, who said she would be in Tampa anyways, agreed to pick me up on her way back home. I confirmed multiple times and would have planned another week if she could not. But she said it was fine and everything was set. I've been up for three days, and the day before she was supposed to get me our cousin gets in an accident and doesnt want to see my sister, so she decides to cancel everything and doesnt want to get me. I know I have other ways down, but I feel, personally, betrayed and highly annoyed that she can just brush me off like that. But the thing is, if shes not going to be up, should she feel obligated to get me?\n\nI know I should be driving at my age, but I never needed to, so I wanted this to work for everyone, not just me. \n\nBut I just need to know if im being a prick for still expecting her to drive 30 minutes to not leave me in Tampa with a 70$ Lyft Bill.\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He needs money, an advisor, and was attracted to my 15+ years of business experience and history of building 7-figure businesses. I agree, and fund the company.\n\n2016\nBest friend agreed to have 10 products by end of year. He produces maybe 2 products, but they are just white label (someone elseâs product, our brand label). He adds our products to Amazon, sales start coming in. I build us a website, which he begged for then hated once finished.\n\n2017\nBest friend hires web developer, micro manages him on a tiny budget, developer quits / gets fired (canât recall which). He hires a 2nd web developer, who over promises and under delivers. I introduce best friend to another friend of mine who is a web developer. Best friend once again micro manages, I take control and proceed to finish new site. Best friend is again not happy with results. I have same web dev friend start managing Google Adwords, best friend accuses me of nepotism. Best friend develops 3 more products.\n\nBest friend falls on hard times financially, I offer him a salary, he refuses. Accuses me of hiding/stealing money, is proven wrong once he sees the money was spent on Google AdWords. During next two weeks I hear about best friend defaming me to mutual social circle, claiming he deserves a salary and that I wonât give it to him. He asks for salary again over dinner. We were not yet profitable, but 2-4 months from being in the black. Iâm fed up with the slander, so I recant my original salary offer unless he cures the slander. He doesnât.\n\n2018\nBest friend âchecks outâ of our business, cites not wanting to be partners with me as his primary reason. Best friend begins taking 50% of income as dividend payments, in the form of cash at the bank teller window, without my consent. I withdraw my original principal, to make myself whole. I find that I cannot withdraw a matching amount to best friend because he took 50% of income, but did not deduct expenses. I am stuck with expenses.\n\nTime goes by, best friend continues to take income but not pay expenses, sticking me with them. I drain account with electronic transfer with note âcash reserve for expenses.â Best friend calls me, states he needs money for food and rent, allows me to communicate we need it for expenses. I put money back so he can withdraw, he does. \n\nWeeks go by, best friend removes my access from Amazon account and Facebook account. I notice and suspend his access from anything I could think of. Amazon account had control of 6-figures of inventory. He diverts Amazon account proceeds to his personal checking account, sends âmy halfâ to it so I can withdraw. I engage a mediation firm instead of filing a lawsuit. Best friend attends, signs agreement to send my half.\n\n2019\nâMy halfâ stops coming in. Best friend owes me thousands in personal expenses, thousands he overpaid himself in 2018, and everything he has not paid me. I contact best friend and we agree that he will send me âmy halfâ of the remaining inventory. He never sends it. Total damages thus far $20k + 50% of remaining inventory.\n\nNow\nMy emails go unanswered. My payments have stopped coming, proceeds continue to go to his personal checking account, he refuses to pay our CPA thousands owed to them for tax prep.\n\nAITA for suing him and possibly also pursuing him criminally after all of this? He built the company, handled sales, customer support, etc then once successful claimed he âmade a bad dealâ and squashed my investment. He wonât let me buy him out, he wonât buy me out, and he wonât agree to sell to a third party and split the proceeds. He just wants to kill the company and leave a scorched earth.",

      "title": "AITA for telling my spouse that girls belong in the GIRL Scouts and boys belong in the BOY Scouts?",
      "description": "M(49)  military veteran reared in the south asked my spouse F(35) reared in upstate NY her thoughts on the recent ruling that girls could participate in the boy scouts.  For clarification purposes,  she was in the girl scouts.  I was not in the boy scouts. I tried to explain to her last night after hearing the news of girls being allowed in the boy scouts that I no longer feel comfortable encouraging our young son to participate in the boy scouts now that girls are allowed in the boy scouts. It seems like common sense to me. Girls go in the girl scouts,  boys go in the boy scouts... hence the name GIRL scouts and BOY scouts.  Her explanation was that she quit the girl scouts because they didn't do cool stuff like the boy scouts and she feels as if girls should be allowed into the boy scouts.  I explained to her that the coolness factor she spoke of was merely her perception as a bit of a tomboy as a youngster. In addition, while yes it is pretty cool to become an eagle scout, this coolness factor needed to be addressed in the higher management of the girl scouts and not just solved by blurring lines and pushing the girls that want to do cooler stuff  into an organization that is already taxed by other recent changes and guidelines that are due to affect boy scout membership in a not so positive light. She assures me that my thinking is outdated and antiquated and that boys these days don't care if girls are in the girl scouts. I, on the other hand,  view it as a matter of principle. I love my spouse dearly and am trying hard to understand her point of view simply because we she be a united front, but I just am having an extremely difficult time getting past this very basic premise. I would truly appreciate views from males and females of all ages with or without  experience in the girl and boys scouts and will take all opinions under advisement, because as of the time of this posting, I'm still salty about our difference of opinion. I'm feeling like a bit of a fossil over here. ",

      "title": "AITA For Being Frustrated With my SO Over Lack of Sleep?",
      "description": "Long story short, I work a job with regular hours and my SO works a job with rotating shifts. Sometimes they get off work at 7am, 7pm, 11pm, etc. This is only an issue because we live together. I wake up at 6am every day for work, so it's important that I go to bed early and get quality sleep. Most of the time it's great, but sometimes our differing schedules make life hard.\n\nThe issues tend to arise when my SO gets home after 11pm. We're happy to see each other of course, but then I try to sleep ASAP. This usually means I stay up later than I should, but I typically don't mind.\n\nMy SO gets restless and has nights where they squirm a lot. Most recently, this happened around 4am and I wasn't able to go back to sleep. Needless to say, I was frustrated that I had to look forward to spending a whole day at work while exhausted.  Equally frustrating is the fact that I know my SO can sleep as long as they want after I leave. What makes it worse in my mind is that my SO chalks it up to me just being a light sleeper.\n\nNow, I am not mad about the behavior. Everyone has restless nights. However, my SO seemed surprised that I was so frustrated about being kept awake before I had to go to work. They issued a half-hearted apology, but I still feel like they don't get it. This just makes me wonder, AITA for being frustrated?",

      "title": "AITA for asking a customer to order online because we can't understand her over the phone?",
      "description": "(IDK if it's against the rules but technically my manager did this, not me. So the question is am I the asshole for thinking he's in the right, but that's a little wordy for a title)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I work at a fast-casual restaurant chain and we have a frequent \"problem\" customer named Mary\\*. Most of us have a story about her being rude/yelling/threatening us. She likes to do the 'talk to the manager' thing, even to the actual managers, so she's always contacting corporate somehow and complaining about things like mistakes in her order. Our chain takes 'the customer is always right' as basically our bible so no one has ever said a negative word to her or had an attitude or anything (they'd be fired without a second thought, it's happened before). Mary also happens to be Indian, and while I've always been able to understand her face-to-face with a little effort, it's apparently more difficult on the phone when you can't also read lips and anticipate what she's going to say. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy manager, Isaac\\*, who is new to the store, took a phone call from her and asked her to order online because he was having a hard time understanding what she was saying (I don't know the exact words used, obviously if he had an attitude about it he's TA, but from my perspective he's a really nice, earnest guy). She was offended by this, and there was a further misunderstanding where she said \"I'm never coming back, (something else I forget)\" and Isaac said \"Good-\" and before he could finish trying to respond to the second thing she said, she interrupted, thinking he was addressing her 'never coming back' (I wish). She started screaming, demanding his full name, manager, etc, the usual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently she also contacted corporate and HR and is filing a formal discrimination complaint against him, plus she's threatening to actually sue. Technically we're supposed to try to direct customers to do online orders anyway since we have bare minimum staff and don't have the time to constantly be on the phone punching in people's credit card numbers longhand- but we're supposed to take it if they insist. Plus, what was he even supposed to do? Pretend he could understand her and give her the wrong order and let her unleash the beast again? HOWEVER I do understand her perspective and would probably also be upset if I felt like I was missing out on something other people could do because of something I can't control, like my country of origin. Especially if I went to the trouble of learning an entire second language only to be basically told that I shouldn't have bothered because it isn't good enough to be understood. Still, I can't help but feel like she's punching down and with her past history of berating us, I see her as being in the wrong here- but I'm biased, so that's why I'm asking. \n\nAm I the asshole for thinking Mary is overreacting and Isaac is in the right?\n\n\\*names slightly changed since it feels unprofessional to not do that",

      "description": "Some backstory.\n\nI've been friends with this person (let's call him Jim) since we were kids and he comes from a very wealthy family, he's not a douche about it either, Jim has always been a meek person.\n\nAbout 6 years ago, he met this girl (let's call her Evil Bitch, EB for short) We were shocked at first that he was dating this girl, Jim isn't the best looking guy, he would agree with that, she would be a solid 10/10 if it wasn't for her shit personality.\n\nEverybody in our friend group saw through her immediately \"She's only with him for his money\" but he seemed happy, so we were happy for him, at first she seemed nice, charming,smart and genuinely into Jim, so I felt I was wrong about her intentions and felt bad about judging her so quickly.\n\n2 years go by and they're happily married. That's when everything changed, almost in an instant she was mean, she would talk down to you, belittle you, make fun of you constantly, make fun of Jim behind his back, she said to one of our friends \"Jim has a little dick\" We were shocked, this seemed so unlike her.\n\nJim also changed, he was meek but once he got out of his shell, he was one the funniest people I've ever known. Not anymore, he seem depressed, lonely. We tried talking to him about EB, maybe she wasn't the one for him, but he wouldn't listen \"She's great\" \"She's the best thing to ever happen to me\" etc.\n\nThe last 4 years has been this, and recently he found out she has been cheating on him SINCE THEY GOT TOGETHER! apparently he walked in on them, she admitted to cheating this whole time, she said she won't stop and for him to just deal with it. WTF!?!?!\n\nI almost couldn't believe it when he told us. We tried to get him to divorce her ass, but he wouldn't and for 2 weeks we tried to convince him, I was pissed at her for cheating and pissed at him for not leaving.\n\nUntil one day after talking to him I snapped. He said something about him feeling better about this whole situation.\n\nI said \"Why don't you stop being a fucking loser and just divorce this WHORE!, the fuck is wrong with you!?!? You're being PATHETIC! why won't you get it through your thick skull that she is only with you for your money and NOTHING ELSE!\"\n\nI went on a little longer but I won't type the rest. He left without saying a word. I tried being to \"supportive friend\" I handled it with kid gloves at first but I couldn't any longer. He NEEDED to hear this. Half of our friend group said he needed tough love and the other half said I went too far.\n\nNow I want all of you to give your opinion. AITA?\n\nTLDR: Friend won't divorce his wife after she cheated, and I went on a rant and proceeded to call him a loser and pathetic.",

      "description": "About a year ago, I stopped responding to a former friend of mine.\n\nWe had been friends for about 4 or 5 months and one of the first friends I made moving to a new city. We hung out pretty frequently and we would go out for drinks on the occasion. For a little bit, I considered him a really good friend.\n\nThings started to turn when he started drinking though. When he started drinking, he wouldn't stop. And then, he would start verbally insulting my friends and me and getting a little belligerent. He never became physically abusive, but he would have a bad attitude and start making inappropriate comments or jokes.\n\nAt first it wasn't a big deal because we didn't drink often, and I figured that it would change. But it didn't. Some of the insults became worse too, and he would make me feel depressed or anxious because of the things he would say. My friends didn't like it either, and we eventually wanted to distance ourselves from him.\n\nOn top of that, too, my girlfriend really didn't like him either. She read the things he would text me and told me to stop responding to him. And the more I thought about it, I agreed with her. I didn't think he was a good influence in my life.\n\nSo I stopped responding to him, and he quickly realized what was going on. He went on apologizing and saying he had quit drinking and was a changed person. I didn't believe it though. He would sometimes message me over different forms of social media and make comments that were derogatory and insulting, and then next day apologize for the comments.\n\nDespite all this, I feel bad because I think he really does need help and I think he needs emotional support. But, I don't think I have the time or the patience to deal with it.\n\nAm I the asshole for not replying back?",

      "title": "AITA For lying that I am \"playing it by ear\" when asked by a date for what I am looking for (e.g. a hookup, long-term, etc)?",
      "description": "First, let me preface this question by saying my dating situation. I am 20 years old, but I am very career focused and mostly work and go to school at the same time. This has lead to dates around my age saying I'm too career focused and serious, and when I try to date older women (around 22-25 years old), they get hung up over the age as a number and say I am too young for them. So, the point is I don't get many opportunities to go on dates or get a lot of matches on dating apps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to the question. Almost always I ask first what they are looking for (i.e. a hookup or a long-term, or play by ear), and all have said the \"play it by ear\" option. The truth is, I almost always only want a hook-up (as I am very busy this time of year), but none of them want it/want to see where things go. It may just be my college but there are very few hookup-only people in the area. So, I say I also want to \"play it by ear\", and then see how long I need to go till I have sex with them. In a way I am indeed playing it by ear as sometimes it takes like 2 months of talking and dates before anything happens. If I don't see anything happening initially or I got what I wanted, I usually say I am too busy or something came up, and then cease communication. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is a moral question for me because I see it with pros and cons in terms of ethics:\n\nPros: 1. I am sorta justified by the lack of availability, so I cant be picky or completely honest or I'll have nothing. To me this is morally OK as I do believe humans are self-serving so I am just doing what my ancestors and all humans today do.\n\n2. I am kinda playing it by ear by waiting that long to do anything, and at that point I may have developed feelings and something may have occurred or we already saw nothing was happening, and hence we actually played it by ear.\n\n3. I'm not being manipulative or forcing a decision on their part, and so the decision to lie and the consequences are uniquely mine (i.e. I am not waiting long enough for them to develop feelings long term, and if it gets that long I usually pull out to not have that happen. Its more of a risk for me if I develop feelings)\n\nCons: 1. Lying. Never good really.\n\n2. I'm sorta lowering their guard and creating false trust that I may be a potential partner or friend when I just want to have sex.\n\n3. I may accidentally conjure self-judgement in their mind if say they want to be friends and I say no, they may feel like they did something wrong for me to be so busy I cant have friends, which to them would not make sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?",

      "description": "Backstory: Iâm 24 yr old male taking care of my grandma because Iâm all the family she has. My tiny, innocent grandmother (92yr) has been taken advantage of by people on the internet many times. One of the worst and consequently final straws was about 2 years ago, when I gave her $500 to help pay for her utilities and a few other necessities for a couple months. Within a week it was gone and sent to âsome nice Nigerian investors.â We never saw it again, and she had to live in a motel for a few weeks until I could figure out something else. \n\nThe reason she is so gullible on the internet is because she retired way to early. Now unfortunately sheâs got nothing left &amp; has severe scoliosis which she canât afford treatment for. All of these scams she falls for is cause she desperate for hope.. hope that her life will get back to how it was when she was working insurance making 6 figures. \n\nEver since the scam where she threw away $500 she has been pretty good. \nI explained as calmly, politely and sternly as I could. Unfortunately though it looks like it happened again. This time though itâs been about 20-30 years in the making. Apparently she purchased around \n2 million Vietnamese dollars from some people on the internet. She thought that it would grow in value.. but also that each Vietnamese dollar was worth 3 u.s dollars. I honestly donât know how she ever thought that made sense... \nbut oh well. She kept pleading with me to take her to the bank to cash in âour million dollar ticket.â Honestly though I have no idea how to even exchange currency or where exactly to do it. So instead I showed her on my phone the current exchange rate.. big mistake. Iâve never seen my tiny, innocent Grandma act so distraught. She started to break down and cry, even getting upset at me a for breaking the news to her. \n\nIâm back home now, and I feel pretty bad. I canât help but think there was a better way for me to handle this. She has said things that make my heart ache for her, like âI wish life could just be overâ and other really depressing things. Maybe I should have let her continue to have that hope that thereâs a better future on the horizon. Sheâs in so much pain, I know the only thing keeping her going is some sort of improvement in her life, and thatâs why she is so desperate for these monetary miracles to happen. ",

Oh yeah, there was another one too: Do you actually masturbate or is it a joke?\" She then texted me at 6:02 am she texts me \"Sorry for those please just answer them though I gotta get the stuff.\" Then at 7:50 am she texts me \"I'm bored, My sister is taking too long.\" Then the last texts I received until I woke up and texted her back was \"Nevermind don't answer those forget about it I figured it out so its fine.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I wake up to these texts and are bewildered by all these very weird texts, but me, being a Freshmen thinking I might get some ass, I question why she wants that info and she said: \"I can't because last time I got in trouble.\" She then said, \"I can't tell you because last time my sister over-reacted and my whole family hated me and they made me sit there kneeling on my knees pleading for three hours and I could barely stand I had to crawl around for like 4 day.\" I brushed it off as her not telling me the real reason, so I go ahead and tell her and she says \"Meh\". We continue to talk normally for the rest of the day and most of the days following.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany days after this she starts to bring up if I have sexual fantasies and what are they. Another very confusing/private question. I just ignore it and she doesn't try to pry and keep asking if I do; until the next day which she keeps prying and I say \"These are completely uncomfortable topics and I am not willing to answer.\" and she gets pretty mad, calling me a liar and other not very nice names. People might wonder why I haven't blocked her yet, but again I thought I might be getting some ass. She then gets very nosy and keeps asking once again and I threaten to block her, so I do and I thought that was the end of it. Multiple days later, after winter break, she starts texting me on a number I have not blocked and keeps asking about it. So I almost instantly block her number. Later that week during school I see her crying and all the private info during that conversation got leaked, so I started to tell people what she had asked and everything she had done and once again today I saw her crying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for making her cry after I didn't give her private info?  \n",

      "description": "So for a bit of backstory, I have a friend, let's call her D, who I have known since high school. We used to be quite close but haven't really spoke recently due to D making some extremely rude comments to both my girlfriend and sister (We're all from the same hometown) around 6 months ago.\n\nAnyway Me and D go to the same university and when we were friends I introduced her to my housemates who she is now friends with. D decided to have a last minute party last saturday which my house was invited to. I against my better judgement decided to let go of the past and attend.\n\nOn Saturday morning one housemate posted on our group chat that he was going to the shops to buy D's birthday present, which I thought nothing of. I was out of town on Saturday morning but arrived back on Saturday evening. When I arrived back the housemate said he'd gotten a card for D from the house, which they had all signed and to sign it too.\n\nAnyway the party was a bit of a disaster, with D making numerous snide comments about my girlfriend which very nearly made me leave.\n\nAnyway the next day my housemate messaged the group chat asking for $30 each for D's present and card. I was quite shocked and messaged back refusing to pay, given that at no point had I agreed to a joint present ( I don't even know what he bought) and that as a broke college student I would not have agreed to spend that much. If me and D were getting along i probably would just let it slide but no way was I paying $30 on a present for her. His argument was that I signed the card and didn't say anything on the group beforehand when he said he was getting D's present.\n\nSo Reddit AITA for refusing to pay?",

      "description": "I got a text message this morning from a number I did not recognize, and it was letting me know that they had a missed call from me. He said he was an internet sales manager at a Hyundai dealership in a town three hours away. When I checked my call log on my phone, I hadnât made a call since yesterday. When I explained that to this guy, he said this:\n\nâOk well thank you for responding. Names (edited). If you happen to be in the market, or know anyone who is, for a vehicle send them my way. If they purchase I'll pay you 500$â.\n\nI immediately figured this was a sales tactic, and told them off politely by saying that it was a greasy tactic, and that they would definitely not be getting my business, even if I was in the market. \n\nThey responded with this: \n\nâLol are you serious? You called me? No sales tactic just taking advantage of a missed call by youâ\n\nAnd then:\n\nâAs you can see you dialed me. If I had the technical know how how to forge screen shots like that I wouldnt be selling cars lol. â\n\nHe also texted a screenshot of his missed called and my number is at the top of the list, among other numbers from the day before. \n\nI donât know how often phone glitches happen...but it seems fishy to me. \n\nAITA?",

If he didn't pull the \"you watch me play single player the whole time\" thing, he would get really mad and upset any time I beat him. He would rage about how his controller was broken, how my character was OP, how his half of the screen was glitching, etc. Even when I would let him switch controllers, characters, maps, even letting him be player one, if I still beat him, it was anyone's fault but his. Then he would say it was a stupid game and he didn't wanna play it anymore. \n\n\nOf course, as he got older he stopped doing that, but at the time as a kid, I really did not look forward to gaming with him.

      "description": "Okay, so for our final project for our Music class, we have to do a production of a musical. We were given at least 2 or 3 months for preparation (basically perform songs from the musical until it lasts around 50 minutes) but for the first 3 weeks we bullshitted the practices until our Music teacher got mad at us. We only practiced one song for 3 weeks (it was performed by the whole class) so we wasted so much time on the vocals until I told them to get their shit together and practice the choreography already.\n\nFrom there, it started to get better until this Monday, they didn't want to sing the class song (the one we practiced for 3 weeks) because \"they didn't know how to sing it.\" We practiced vocals for at least 2 weeks. Now, our performance is on Friday, which is in 2-3 days, and we still don't have a choreo for the last song. We keep on practicing \"vocals\" (we've been practicing just that for a week) and we don't have a choreo for it yet. The lead singers are so god awful because they aren't taking it seriously. I'm part of the main cast, and honestly, it feels like I'm the only one who's exerting effort. \n\nA lot of the main cast and the ensemble are just on their phones, not participating until you shout or get mad at them, but when you do get mad at them, they get mad at YOU. I got so stressed and shouted at them, saying things like \"What do you guys even want to happen?\" and \"Why the fuck isn't everyone cooperating?\" and \"At this rate, we won't even produce a good show.\"\n\nOne of my classmates got mad at me and told me I was being \"too negative\" because I kept on getting mad at them, but honestly, we don't have a song finished yet and it's our ending song and it's on Friday. But now, my class is turning on me and started to talk behind my back for being \"too controlling\" or being \"too pessimistic.\" When I direct (I shouldn't even direct, we just don't have a leader because no one wants to step up), they don't listen to me and just make fun of what I'm saying. At this point, I'm not even sure if I'm the bad guy or if I'm being too controlling. I shout at them because it's the only way of getting something done, because they won't listen to you if you speak in a normal voice.\n\nThey spread shit about me being an asshole, and I just want to know if it's an ass move to shout at them in this situation.",

      "description": "Ok, so context: As of writing this, I am currently attending the Bon Jovi Experience with my mum in a relatively popular pub (at the halfway break right now) and she went to the toilet for a bit, leaving her coat on the seat. I instinctively pull the chair towards me so that it and the coat are in contact with my leg so that I'll immediately know if they are moved.\n\nThe woman standing directly next to us looked at me, noticing this action and gave me a kind of forced smile, but I feel like I may have offended her and made it seems that I think she's a potential thief. This, however, is a natural reaction for me since I have been suffering from anxiety for at least 5 years, which is why I'm not here (or anywhere) without someone I trust (the other being that she was the one who wanted to see them)\n\nAITA for jumping to conclusions and being overly cautious even though this stranger has given me no reason to be labelled a thief?",

      "description": "My husband and I have been married for almost a year. We both have friends of both genders and we don't share all the same friends. I trust him and we have no major problems in our relationship. The other day, we were watching a video on his phone and he got a facebook friend request from a girl (I'll call her Sally) who I happen to know. \n\nBefore I met my husband 5 years ago, the guy I was engaged to before him cheated on me--WITH SALLY. I know it wasn't just her fault, since it takes two to tango, but she knew of me and knew full well that we were engaged and carried on a months-long fling with him anyway. Apparently now, Sally tangentially works with my husband--i.e. he works at a place, and she works security at that place, so they work at the same place but are not co-workers. \n\nSo, I told him what happened with Sally in the past (since he knows I was engaged before I met him and that it ended due to cheating) and asked him to delete the friend request and stay away from her. I've never asked a partner to do anything like that before, because normally I don't care who he is friends with, but now I'm concerned. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for wearing the American flag?",
      "description": "Background info: I am in high school and on the swim team. On days of home meets, we have a theme that we dress up for. Todayâs was America.\n\nFor this theme, I brought the flag I normally hang in my room and wore it as a cape. Now I understand that flag code says not to wear it as clothing etc. but as we know, flag code is not actual law and enforcing it would be a violation of the 1st amendment.\n\nBefore the meet started, my coach let us know that multiple teachers emailed him complaining about the incident, and that next time we should be more careful with this kind of stuff because of its controversy. However, none of them addressed my teammate who wore a MAGA hat, which is arguably more controversial. Especially in the student body.\n\nMy engineering teacher, who served in the U.S armed forces and saw combat, was completely fine with it and actually gave me advice on how I should wear it. \n\nMy classmates and students in the hall thought it was pretty cool and patriotic. I did get the occasional âyou know the flag code says...â, however in a joking manner.\n\nIâm not sure how my other teachers felt as they didnât comment on it, but my science teacher, on the other hand, reacted in the exact opposite way from my engineering teacher. She yelled at me about how I was âbeing extremely disrespectful towards the flagâ and followed me around class, pointing at me whenever the flag was âabout to touch the floor.â \n\nI personally think the other teachers were overreacting. I did not do anything to blatantly insult the flag, still took care of it and made sure it never touched the ground, etc. Because my robotics teacher has the strongest connection with the flag and was still cool with it, I think the other teachers shouldnât feel as strongly about what is, at the end of the day, a piece of cloth and at most a symbol. I donât think I should have my 1st amendment rights silenced because I honored the flag in a different way than normal.\n\nWho is right in this situation?",

      "title": "AITA for asking for 20 mil gil in FFXIV",
      "description": "This is kind of my first actual post so forgive me if the formatting is bad or long, thank you\n\nBackstory: My friend and I have been playing since 2.1 and made a Free Company (Guild for those who don't play Ffxiv). I was the resident crafter and I guess the money maker in the FC. The majority of the FC consisted of just about a light party's worth of people (4 or 5) our IRL friends mostly. I was a generous dude giving a few thousand or mil gil to  them when  they needed it since they didn't wanna level crafting, I didn't really care and still don't since it was forever ago. \nFast forward to Stormblood, the current expansion. We wanna to save our money for a shirogane house when they were released. They saved a bit but I was the majority of the money. We met another group, similar size and play times. Overall awesome dudes. We decided to merge our Free Companies into one so we could A.) Finally make a static, and B.) Merge our saved up money and buy the best mansion for sale. We would enjoy 6 to 9 months worth of playing together before we all mostly went offline for awhile due to content dry spell. During that time I stayed online a bit to craft and garden and such.\nDuring this time, my friend and I who founded the original FC went thru a huge fight. The fight was serious enough to break the entirety of our friendship making our side of the group a little wack. Without going into too much detail he just showed how shitty a person and friend he was. I kicked him from the FC without a second thought. This person has mooched off me for most of my life in game and out and I didn't want another second with to go by with him. Also informed our side of the group since the others went afk and couldn't really reach them. \nMy computer would later get fried and I was offline for a bit myself, about 2 months. After I returned I saw they returned and they also had inherited the FC Leader rank since it transfer after 35 days of being offline. It was tossed around a lot, no one seemed to care. After I return I inform them about what happened. Later they would reinvite my friend and put us in special powerless ranks till this was sorted out. I told them that this wasn't negotiable and that he was not allowed back. They didn't care about what I said and believed this was a load of needless drama. I stated my side and he stated his but they got two different stories. I told them simply I can't be with him any longer and also informed them he was even planning to keep the FC in it's entirety since they were offline for a long time. Which is true but from what I gather he had stated other things. I've invested a decent deal of no life time into the house and the money I spent on the house (20 mil). Basically the entire half of my groups payment for the house. I told them there isn't a middle ground, I can't be with him another second and don't plan on talking to him again. The current FC Leader and I fought over several things and was closer to my now ex friend. I told him since I spent a lot and crafted a lot for the house I felt it was fair to be reimbursed 20 mil which is still less than what I put in since I was the only crafter I did a lot for the house. He agreed and gave me 6 mil at the time and asked if I'd give them a couple days to sell things, I agreed. I also asked for several items I had in the house storage, they agreed to this also. \nFast forward to present, I never received a dime since the first payment and never got my items since I was kicked. I asked again and was told I was being an entitled asshole who is \"barking up the wrong tree for fake pixelmoney\" this was the last message I received about this matter.\n\nAm I the asshole despite them agreeing to it prior and even giving me, essentially, a down payment?",

      "description": "This happened yesterday. \n\nI was outside after finding out I had failed a test (by *0.7 %* btw, fucking organic chem!!). I was pretty frustrated and disappointed. Basically not in a good mood. \n\nA man approached us, he was in a wheelchair and was using crutches to propel himself. There was a slight incline, but he seemed to be fine, so we just continued bitching to each other. \n\nAs he passed us, he said \"thanks for the help, guys\", in a really obnoxious tone. \n\nSo I turned around and said \"you didn't ask, we aren't mind readers\" in an equally obnoxious tone. \n\nWhen I turned back around to my friends, they looked horrified. They said I was really rude. My tone was rude, and I do feel bad about that. \n\nI stand by what I said, though. I wish I had said it differently, but I think it's pretty rude to assume people didn't help you out of malice, and to try to make them feel bad about it. I don't view differently abled people as broken. I never assume they need help unless they're obviously struggling, and I always ask first. \n\nIf someone asks me for help, regardless of their ability, I'll help if I can. \n\nI do understand his frustration, too. But if he was struggling, he should have asked instead of being a dick. \n\nFor context, I also have a minor disability, and a mood disorder. I know how frustrating it can be, but I also know that people won't know I need help unless I ask them.",

      "description": "Some background info: Iâm 18 in HS so I still live with my parents. Most repeating noises bug me, but Iâve had tinnitus for a long time, Iâm used to ignoring sounds even though they irritate me. I just donât like having to deal with them if they can go away. \nââ\nMy older brother used to be in his room(directly adjacent to mine) all the time on his laptop. Some months ago he moved a computer outside of his room into the living room, so now heâs constantly on the computer there. The ceiling fan in that room when turned on to any setting other than the lowest one(which is still rather powerful) makes a loud constant ticking noise that can be heard around the entire house. It does this because years ago he kicked a soccer ball at it and my parents never bothered to get it fixed.\n\nIt pissed me off especially since it was on constantly for hours on end. Iâd usually be in my room with earbuds in for all those hours. This made my ears ache and the ringing in my ears worse, so I started to turn the fan off(itâs not even hot upstairs and he would have on a comforter when sitting at the computer so I never understood?) so I wouldnât have to block it out with music through my earbuds. My brother would always immediately turn the fan back on. I finally brought the issue up with my parents, but they never did anything until I non-stop complained about it for weeks. Bratty of me, I know. Finally my dad told my brother to keep it on the lowest setting so it wouldnât tick and also because he didnât understand why my brother had it on while also wearing a blanket.\n\nFast forward to now itâs winter and freezing everywhere in the house, especially my room which is the coldest. My brother still has the fan on and on top of that even moved a sitting fan in there as well which, as those fans do, has a constant âstatic noiseâ for the lack of a better term. Once again the sound really annoys me. I brought it up my mom today because I had a minor freak out when I noticed my brother had a space heater(really loud too, I can hear it in my room)turned on along with the fans. \n\nShe got angry at me and said that when my dad gets home weâll all have a talk about this. I have a feeling Iâm not going to win this argument, and while I feel justified in my anger and my position, and friends agree with me, I donât know if Iâm being a dick about this. Iâm just tired of my ears constantly hurting when the solution wonât harm anyone or cause any problems. \n\nSorry for the awkward story telling, I have a hard time to putting all my thoughts into words.

      "description": "So my gf really wanted to see this popular band and their tickets are really expensive and hard to get (Iâm talking thousands in resale if you grabbed floor seat tickets).\n\nTheir tickets went on sale today and she was at work so she couldnât access a computer. She never asked me to grab the tickets for her when it went on sale btw, so I texted her and asked if she wanted me to buy tickets for her. She said that I should try to grab tickets and resell them if she ended up not being able to afford them. I know reselling it wonât be a problem so I went ahead with the plan.\n\nI was able to hop on and grab the tickets within thirty minutes and I got floor seating!! Again, itâs rare to get floor seating at this bandâs concert. I texted my gf and showed her that I got floor seating to the concert (I was only able to grab one ticket because there werenât any two seats next to each other). After the service charge and everything, the ticket came out to $300. She was super excited but after seeing the price, she said she couldnât afford it. We arenât at the point in our relationship to give each other such expensive presents yet (only been dating for a month) so I let her know Iâd be selling it. I posted on a couple FB groups hours later and immediately got responses and offers at least double the amount I original paid for (highest offer I got was $1,100). I didnât confirm anything with any buyers yet because I was still waiting to see if I could get higher offers.\n\nCouple hours later, my gf texts me and says she wants the ticket now because she realized itâs a once in a lifetime opportunity to get such close tickets. The thing is, I was already super stoked about making a profit off of these and she had already told me that she didnât want the ticket at first. WIBTA if I resell them to her for a higher price?",

      "description": "This happened a five hours ago and it's been playing on my mind so I thought I'd post here to see your thoughts and perhaps to ease my conscience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt around 7pm, when it starts becoming dark, my girlfriend and I heard and spotted a ginger kitten constantly meowing on a footpath next to a road. It was probably no older than 1 month old. She has a soft spot for all animals and asks if we can try to pick it up to take it to a safer location. She knows that we cannot take it home as our landlord doesn't allow pets in the house. I tell her that it's probably a stray kitten and its momma cat will find it soon. I reluctantly agree knowing that the kitten will just run away at the sight of us.\n\nAlong the footpath is a grassy area with bushes and flax which the kitten is moving along. As it sees us, it tries to stay within the bushes away from us. After about 30-40 minutes, we manage to lure it out by dangling a long flax leaf in front it. However, it would run back into the bushes whenever we try to pet it. My girlfriend begins calling SPCA, an animal control organisation that looks after strays and abandoned pets. The office phone number was closed so we were redirected to an emergency line. While this is happening, there is a family going for a night stroll across the road. There are no children in the group.\n\nWe are finally connected to a SPCA rep. While we were waiting, the kitten was slowly inching towards the road. I think nothing of it as it would always seem alerted whenever cars would drive past and avoided the road. I look away for a few seconds to see what my girlfriend is doing. When I look back at the kitten, it is now ON THE CENTER OF THE ROAD with car approaching at around 50km/h which is the normal speed limit and about 10 meters away. I get worried as fuck and the following thoughts cross through my head:\n\n1. This kitten needs to scramble across the road or its gonna get wrecked.\n2. If it doesn't move, maybe I should run towards it and scare it to make it move.\n3. Surely, the approaching car will stop for this poor kitten.\n4. Maybe I should try to wave the car down to a stop.\n\nI DID NOT REACT AT ALL.\n\nThe kitten is struck by the car. My girlfriend and I look on in horror. She tells that SPCA rep what was happening. The kitten was lying on the road and I could see it breathing heavily. And within a few more seconds, another car passes by and strikes the kitten again which put it out of its suffering.\n\nThe family from across the road look on in confusion wondering what the hell just happened. My girlfriend is expectantly shocked, almost to the point of tears. There are a few more cars which pass and drive over the poor kitten, to avoid running over it. I ran to my car, which is about 20 meters away, to search for a plastic bag or something to move the kitten off the road. I found an empty jumper lead sleeve and use it as a glove to pick up the dead kitten and move it to the grass behind the bush, out of sight from any children which walk this path in the morning. My girlfriend instructs the SPCA rep of the location of the body so they can claim it in case it was somebody's pet.\n\nThe drive home is almost silent. My girlfriend appears to be stunned and processing what just happened. I reason to myself and think that the kitten will most likely end of euthanised had it been caught alive by SPCA and thinking nothing more of it.\n\nWhen I get home, I cannot get the thought out of my head. I could have saved the kitten, but I didn't react. \n\nWhy didn't I react?\n\nWas it because I didn't want to look like an idiot in front of the family or the people in the car?\n\nWas it because I didn't care enough for the kitten?\n\nThe situation could be much different had I reacted.\n\nThe incident is still playing through my head. I don't know if I'll be able to sleep tonight with a guilty conscience.\n\nAITA for not reacting at all?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for trying to get my wife to confront my sister-in-laws manipulative behavior?",
      "description": "First I am sorry for the length of this post.\n\nI am a 30 y/o male and my wife is 28 y/o. We have been together for almost 10 years now, 5 of them which we have been married for. A little background about me. I have been a work in progress coming from an abusive family (father's side) with heavy drug issues. I use to have severe anxiety and emotional issues and got tired of living a scared life so I started to take back some control of myself. I went to therapy for 6 years, recently graduated and got my bachelors after my GED and just got accepted into grad school. My wife is everything I would want in a wife and mother for possible children in the future. \n\nHer sister has never liked me, just plain. She is someone who has caused her family a lot of financial harm, racking up tens of thousands in clothing/credit bills that they have paid for her. Recently she, for the second time and without anyone's knowledge, was married to a guy she met in college in order to help get him a passport (non-American citizen). She was out on a business trip, which she does frequently, and left her with him and he ended up sexually assaulting her (under 13). I have noticed that my sister-in-law has been using gas-lighting like behavior that makes me feel like I am going crazy. My wife does not like conflict but recognizes what her sister is \"doing behind the veil\" as she puts it, but does not know how to confront or deal with it. For example, college talks for the niece recently came up between the four of us (wife, sister-in-law, niece and I) and my wife asked what she was thinking of doing. The niece said her desired field in IT possibly, and my sister-in-law immediately chimed in with a thinly veiled acerbic tone of \"Oh, you can be just like your uncle\" - dead silence for a few moments until my wife attempted to make it into a nice comment. For a little background, I was at a small party where we all were and I remember one of my sister-in-law's friends come up and start speaking to me about my job being \"low-tier IT\" with a lot of assumptions. I've never spoken with this person before. I had to explain to him that I was a database manager at a big company and he had heard this stuff from the sister-in-law, so naturally I attribute the silence to some behind the scenes talks. Since then I have noticed that the sister-in-law's friends have been very awkward towards us any time we are at joint gatherings. On a few occasions within the last year our niece has hugged my sister-in-laws friends but did not hug either my wife or I. She still seems to enjoy our company and speak to us but it is very strange. \n\nOutside of the sister-in-laws circle we have a very healthy social life with and appreciate our people. Though my wife has had her own observations that have bothered her for the last year, but hasn't done anything about it because she doesn't know what to do. Am I the asshole for trying to have her do/say anything about it? I feel crazy and am doubting myself.\n",

      "description": "I have had a cat that spends 1/3-1/2 of his time outdoors for the past 8 years. Last year , new neighbors moved in across the street. They have been feeding our cat, causing him not to return home for food often. When I found out they were feeding him, I found out that they had been calling him by another name and that they thought he was stray. I assumed that they would stop feeding him now that they knew that he wasnât stray and was being fed well already. I asked them to stop feeding him and they said they would but today they told me that they were still giving him food and their excuse is that they need to put food outside to feed another cat (which Iâm fairly certain has a family). My cat has gained 6 pounds in the past few months and I want them to stop because I feel like theyâre stealing my cat from me. They still refer to our cat by the name they called him by (despite knowing fully thatâs not his actual name) when they are talking to me and my 15 yo son told them to stop feeding our cat again. They truly love animals (they have several cats and a dog) but I just wish my cat would be home with me more often. Am I being petty?",

      "description": "First ever post on Reddit here we go\n\n\nSo about two weeks ago, I went on a ski trip to New Hampshire with my school (it's was amazing btw), but because I was sharing a room with three other friends, one being my best friend, who we will call Katie. There was obviously going to be arguments and problems since we were all tired and in one small room.\n\n\nNow a little bit about the friend she wanted to talk to.\n\n\n\nAnother one of our best friends who wasn't on the trip, who we will call Jay, was keeping in touch with us and calling after our skiing sessions. \n\n\n\nAround New Years-ish time though, Katie began becoming paranoid that he was picking me over her (complete and utter bullshit) and has made it clear in the past that she wanted to go through my conversations with him. \n\n\n\nSo we were in the middle of getting ready to go ski and our conversation went something like this:\n\n\n\n\nMe: Hey I'm going to call Jay later if that's okay\n\n\nK: Okay, I wanna talk to him too\n\n\nMe: Yeah, yeah, I'll put him on speaker when I call him.\n\n\nK: No, I want to call him privately.\n\n\nAt this point, alarm bells were going off in my head because I've had bad experiences with people looking through my phone, breaking my trust. Now, I have nothing on this phone to hide from her, but it's a private conversation and I'd like that to be respected. \n\n\nSo I say, \n\n\nMe: What? No, if you want to call him, you can call him on your phone.\n\n\nBy this point she starts going sour, telling me I'm a bitch and that I'm hiding things from her. I'm not hiding anything from her, but I also don't trust her completely, since she has made it clear she WOULD look through my phone and that she has crap-talked me in the past \n\n\n(you know, just things like agreeing with people when they say my hobby of drawing is stupid and I'm not good at it when she tells me I am; may seem childish to get upset over but it hurt a lot at the time since I have quite low self esteem)\n\n\n\nI'm also quite annoyed by this point, wondering why she can't accept that I won't let her call privately from my phone. \n\n\nBut afterwards, I started thinking about whether I AM out of order for that. I asked Jay if I was and he said no but I can't shake the feeling that I am and I need some unbiased opinions here. \n\n\n\nThe actual situation is fine now and we're still friends, it's just something I'd like to get off my chest.",

      "description": "Background: my wife and I have been together for 25 years, since we were freshmen in High School.  Through the course of our relationship, she has not placed a high value on being on time - in other words, she is habitually late. On the other hand, I'm likely a little too obsessed with being on time.  We have a very distinct and clear understanding about being on time: she knows I really want to be on time, while I know it's not a huge priority for her. \n\nRecently, we've had a streak of being late to events with our friends, due to her not getting ready on time.  My reactions vary from minor annoyance to verbally complaining about her tardiness.  2 weekends ago, we were quite late to an event, and I expressed my frustration about it on the car ride there. \n\nThis past weekend, we had an event on Saturday night, and on Saturay morning she asked me what time I wanted to leave.  My verbatim response was \"Can we not be late?\"  She then stated that she felt like she was being attacked, and that I was too often critical of her.  She then suggested that I should not mention her tardiness, even indirectly, or else I was being an asshole. I argued that I was just trying to communicate my priorities. \n\nWe agreed to post this here to help us get neutral perspective on our actions. \n\nAITA for asking to not be late?  Is expressing my desire for promptness too critical of her?  Should I rightfully expect a defensive response if I ask to be on time?\n\nThank you for helping us both gain insight! ",

      "description": "Backstory: \nIâve been married to my husband for 7 yrs. We have 3 girls, ages 10, 6, 4.\nWe are really close with his side of the family, aside from his dad and step mom. The only time we ever see them is at a family function, and then the only interactions they have with our kids is trying to pin our kids down and take all of this pictures with them like they are SO CLOSE, I guess for appearances. Our younger kids ask us at each event who these people even are. It annoys me because despite my husband and I trying to have them involved with their grandkids, they arenât. Theyâve told us verbatim that they just donât want to deal with kids at this point in their life (they told us this 3 yrs ago). As in, they donât want to take them to do anything, they donât want them over at their house, they arenât interested in coming over to visit at our place, and they damn sure do not want to ever babysit - donât ask. And by that, they mean OUR children, because they have been heavily involved with her grandchildren (all BOYS) and still are, which is what has sparked me to say âfuck themâ this Christmas. \nThis year in Oct. our youngest turned 4. The entire family got together, minus DHâs dad and step mom, to celebrate. Turns out they had drove to AZ for vacation for his step momâs birthday without saying a word to anyone, and on the drive back, stopped at my DHâs uncleâs house in TX and bought a 2016 model vehicle from him for HER grandson; cost ~10k. \nDHâs Aunt and Uncle stopped by DHâs dad and step momâs house a few days later and found this out. DHâs Aunt and Uncle mention to them it had been our daughterâs birthday, and were they going to go by to see her or anything...???\nNOPE. They said forgot, and didnât have plans to come by.\nThe family gets together 3 weeks later to celebrate DHâs 2 cousinâs birthdays, and DHâs dad and step mom are there - and still donât acknowledge our daughterâs birthday at that point. \nTheyâd been reminded IN PERSON, they just donât care. Now, Iâm not mad that there isnât a gift. Iâm mad that they say they donât want anything to do with kids, but they are really involved with her grandkids, even buying a several thousand dollar car for the oldest, but canât bother to even tell our child âHappy Birthdayâ.\n\nHereâs where the potential assholery on my part comes into play:\n\nFor Christmas, weâre just getting the men gift cards. They are all notorious for being hard to buy for. For his dad, though, instead of the usual gift card, I suggested to my husband we should just get his dad a decent polo in green (his fav color). Itâd save us money, and he isnât exactly on my ânice listâ this year - so not forgo a gift completely, just not as nice of one.  To be honest though, I really feel like giving them the consideration they gave our child - NONE. \nFor the women, I decided that I would crochet some really nice &amp; intricate infinity scarves with this gorgeous wool. Each one takes me about 12 hrs to complete (so an entire day), and are worth about $70. After the way his step mom and dad have treated my children, I refuse to put that much of my time into a scarf for his step mom - I can just buy her a scarf from Walmart. \nIâve also more or less put my husband on notice that if they try to pin our kids down for pictures and our kids donât want to take pictures with them (as has been the case EVERY year), that Iâll be telling my kids itâs ok if they donât want to and that theyâre free to go play. I wonât make my kids go through that for people who donât care about them.\nMy husband has cautioned me and says that if Iâm going to make scarves for all of the other women, I should probably do one for his step mom or it will be obvious - and that if I tell them off about the picture issue, well, I could just end up looking like a giant asshole between the scarf, shirt, and picture issue.\n\nWhat do you think reddit...? \n\nAITA for refusing to put that much effort into a gift or for giving a less expensive gift to people who have treated my children like they have? AITA for not making my kids take pictures with them if they donât want to? ",

      "description": "So I'm actually an MtF trans woman (assigned male at birth). I started transitioning about 1.5 years ago and my marriage to my wife since then has been unbelievably rocky. She's not exactly supportive and has turned our kids (11 and 8) against me by calling me a freak of nature, etc. We're still married but I'm not sure why anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to request divorce this year, and hopefully be able to make a clean break before the end of the year. However, my biggest dilemma right now is what to do with my life after this. I really want to move far away. I mean REALLY far away like to Australia or NZ (we're in Georgia, USA). Part of the reason is selfish. I want to be far away from my soon to be ex-wife and my kids. I know that sounds horrible but the longer I spend near them the longer I hate myself and feel like the ugly \"dad-turned-woman\" that everyone here sees me as (there's an ongoing joke that I'm basically Chandler's dad from Friends). So, yeah. Being near them makes me feel unbelievably gender dysphoric and all I want is a fresh start in a new place where I can start my real life anew. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I gone through with this? I know my wife would get full custody anyways given how conservative and backwards our legal system is towards trans women. I make good money and I would definitely make sure my kids are getting enough money for everything. I'm not trying to skimp on that. However, WIBTA if I just sort of left? I feel that all of them would be a lot happier (including me) if we just cut our ties and went our own ways. I'm sure my wife would remarry to the kind of man she always wanted and maybe I'd get a chance to feel like a real woman in a new country. ",

      "description": " \n\nThis weekend was my aunt's wedding, and I REALLY did not want to go, as the venue was more than two hours away, I barely knew her at all, and I needed to concentrate on studying for my finals. So I pretended I went and lied about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: Right after I was born, my parents were in a situation where they could not take care of me. It would only be for five months, and afterwards, our family was going to go to a different country to live there for good. So for those five months, I was placed at the care of my grandparents. They loved me and took really good care of me. I still cherish a photo of my younger looking grandparents smiling their face off while holding me, a tiny baby swaddled up Korean-style in white blankets. But because they're, well, grandparents and haven't been parenting for a while now, much less taking care of a newborn, they asked for help to my aunt. She came daily to take care of me, eventually just staying with my grandparents to take care of me even at nights. She took care of all the hard work of keeping a newborn alive, and my grandparents started to call her my second mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter five months were up, we left the country and I never saw my aunt again. I heard her voice when we were calling once or twice when I was young, and I remember how loving her voice was. But I do not really have any personal relationship with her. Many years later, I returned to Korea for university, and a couple of weeks ago, she sent my parents a wedding invitation. Since my parents are not in the country, they sent the invitation to me, telling me that I should go. However, I did not want to go at all, because I barely knew who she was, I was anxious about being in a wedding where I did not know anyone, it was far away, and I had to study for my two final exams on Monday. When I told my parents that I didn't want to go, they started to scold me and tried to shame me into going, saying how my aunt took care of me when I was a baby. Knowing that I couldn't convince them, I said fine, but I had no intention of going.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKorean weddings are really big and really short, lasting for about thirty minutes and ending well within an hour. There is no afterparty, no greeting the bride or groom, and the only way they can know you came is through looking at the picture taken with guests at the end of the ceremony. So I sent the money my parents told me to give her through the bank account listed in the invitation (common wedding practice), I searched for pictures of the wedding hall, and also looked at their wedding photos afterwards. I called my parents to let them know I gave her the money, the wedding hall was beautiful, how her dress looked, and how I didn't stay long because I had to study. They were happy, my aunt didn't notice, I was happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I didn't go to my aunt's wedding this weekend, even though she took care of infant me for five months. I lied about going, everyone happy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Ok, so this situation is extremely complicated and I made a throw away just in case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my step sister decided to come out to everyone as trans. Now, while in most situations I believe this kind of moment needs to be taken serious and that you really need to be caring when dealing with people. Here's the thing though, my step-sister is lying. How do I know this? Well, this just so happens to have come after my cousin came out as trans a week ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week my cousin decided to come out to everyone and tell them of her trans status. At this point it was pretty much all but stated. She had been dealing with this for years and it had obviously taken its toll on her. But she decided that she needed to be true to herself and come out and we all supported her. This is where my step-sister Sarah comes in. Sarah has always been the \"pay attention to me\" kind of girl. For the past week she has been complaining about how much attention my cousin is getting. Saying she \"doesn't deserve it\". She has bitched and moaned about how much more she is deserving of their applause than my cousin. Well, last night she changed her tune and is claiming she's a trans man.\n\nShe's lying. How do i know you may ask? Because this exact thing has happened before. \n\nBack when she was in high school her best friend came out as gay. She was the \"leader\" of the group and when her friend all of the sudden got more attention than her she bitched and moaned. Then, a week later she \"got the courage\" to come out too. She then proceeded to \"date\" a girl for 4 months (the girl she was dating was the high school \"lesbian\". When I say that I mean that Sarah found the most popular \"out\" girl to date for the image.). This did not last though as she was found making out with a guy at a party then proceeded to taunt the girl she was dating saying she was pretending this whole time.\n\nSo, now we come to last night. Sarah decided to make a video she then posted to facebook and insta of her \"coming out\".  She then sent it to everyone who was at my cousins coming out (except for my cousin and her dad). In came the flood of \"we love you no matter what\" messages. Well, I decided to join them, in my own way. I told her how much I love that she's lying again for attention and that she's only doing this to steal attention away from my cousin (who didn't even know she was doing this). I then called her out for pretending to be gay previously. I ended by telling her how awful she was and that I hope this backfired like her lesbian stunt did.\n\nWell, now she's making my life hell. She has proceeded to cry on social media for the past 24 hours. She has tried to get my mom to cut me out of her life and is telling all of my friends how \"trans phobic\" i am. I talked with my cousin after she  saw the video and she doesn't buy it either (as does most of my family). Yet, they tell me I was wrong for calling her out like that and that it should have been left private. Honestly though, I don't think so. Sarah hurt the girl she \"dated\" with her last stunt and I'm honestly worried she'll do something again. SO that's why I called her out. Was I wrong though? Should I not have done this and i'm only an asshole?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend(22) recently got made at me(22) for watching a show on Netflix without her. A little background here; we both live at our respected parental units home as we are recent grads, she lives and hour away,we both enjoy watching tv shows a lot, but she has a tough time grasping overarching themes and some subtle signs in shows. So she loves so ask questions in the middle of shows, which I do not mind at all, especially if Iâve seen it before. However, I noticed that while weâre watching the show she tends not to pay attention. Either going on her phone, playing on her switch, or just straight up sleeping in the middle of our show. Itâs not like weâre binging either, we may watch 2 or 3 episodes of a show in a given night and after the first Iâm begging her to pay attention. I constantly say her name and asked if she caught what just happened. Most of the time she doesnât catch what happened or understands not because sheâs not smart but because sheâs simply paying attention to something else. So Iâve begun to watch ahead for some of the shows I truly enjoy. Because we donât live together itâs hard to see each other on the weekday with work and logistics. So she comes over on random Wednesday and be pissed that I watched 2 or 3 episodes ahead of her. I never explicitly told her Iâd wait, she just kinda assumes Iâll wait. I donât mind watching it over again w her at all either. It helps me answer her questions better and allows me to catch anything I may have missed. The only thing I can think about doing is inform her each and every time I watch and episode of something weâve seen together. ",

      "description": "âªAn ex recently got back in touch with me years after ghosting me, by writing a really sweet and sentimental message. I was really glad to catch up and overwhelmed with joy to hear that everything is going really well for him - heâs an interesting person and was very sweet to me in a tough and lonely time for both of us. Iâm now happily married to my soulmate, living overseas, and my ex has also got a partner, so I thought in the spirit of reconnecting, it would be cool to invite him and his girlfriend to a celebration weâre having when we return to my home country for the summer (as me and my husband are both quite relaxed and honest about our pasts), but then this morning he asked me over facebook to help make sure he made it to NA tomorrow by asking him for a picture at a specific time.\n\nI went cold when I read the message - Iâve been absolutely put through the ringer with exes who have been drug addicts, compulsive liars, and recovering addicts, and after years of being lonely, Iâm finally happy. I was 100% honest with him and said Iâm cool with having long  chats on the phone about philosophy and politics, but that I donât have the emotional wherewithal to help anybody get away from the soul-sucking void of addiction, as it took me years to get back to feeling somewhat normal, and Iâm just coming out of a hugely depressive few months myself. I feel terribly guilty for saying no, but I suggested he get a good sponsor who can help him, and to tell his girlfriend about whatâs going on so that she can help. \n\nIâve been feeling sick about it all day so I just need to know from people who are impartial - AITA for saying no to somebody trying to reach out for help to kick drugs? Should I have said yes to sending a simple text just to help get the process started for him, or is it better that I stuck to my guns and said he canât rely on me for anything beyond occasionally sending dank memes? This shit has spun me out.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years . We have been living together for a year and a half. I make almost double what she does and she was living with her parents before so when she moved in we made the agreement that I would pay $900 in rent and she would only pay $500 but that she would do all of the cooking since she enjoyed it. I do other chores in the house but she has done all the cooking- she makes breakfast, packs lunch and cooked dinner She never complained about it \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever around 2 months ago she decided to go vegetarian for ethical/environmental/health reasons. She completely changed her cooking and stopped cooking meat entirely. I just find this so annoying since I enjoyed her cooking before and I'm a meat person. If I ask her to make something she used to make she'll say \"I can make it myself\" which is annoying because we had an agreement. I've talked to her about this but she thinks there's nothing wrong with what she's cooking and she makes sure it's tastes good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm strongly considering asking her to pay $700 for her rent  since I kinda feel cheated out of the deal we've made but I'm debating whether this would be a dick move.

      "title": "AITA For ending my 11 year old friendship with my best friend 2 weeks after her wedding?",
      "description": "Context: My friend had gotten engaged in May this year and had asked me to be her maid of honor. I had said yes, thinking that it wouldn't go through (she had been engaged at least 3-4 times before and had never really gone anywhere). I told her to be careful and alert me ahead of the time since she wanted an late October wedding and I had college and could only move by bus.\n\nAbout mid-September, things started to go wrong.\n\nI had to ask a month before the color of the dress I needed for the event. My friend (Let's call her Ex) wanted a lilac dress. Lilac - a *spring* color -  in fall? I told her it would be hard, but I would do my best. Looked for a week, couldn't find one, so I found a purple one that wouldn't stand out too much.\n\nThe week after, my family was planning to go to our state fair that weekend, since it would be the last days. The day before our trip, I got a message from Ex saying *\"We'll pick you and Lis* (my sister) *up at 6:30 tomorrow.\"* \n\nI didn't remember planning anything with her that day, so I texted her what that was about. Apparently it was her bridal shower that she had been planing for months. This was the first time I had heard of it. I even double-checked a list of wedding-related things I had kept in case I had actually forgotten. I Hadn't.\n\nI told her I had had plans for tomorrow and had to figure out how my family and I would do. While trying to reorganize our schedules, Ex texted Lis that I was *abandoning her!* Had to explain that I was still going despite the sudden announcement, but my sister was going to stay home to finish a college paper due that Tuesday.  My friend was insistent that my sister go as well. It took me 8 minutes of explaining and re-explaining why Lis would not go until she finally gave up.  I went with her the following day for the bridal shower, which was just a meal at a restaurant with Ex, Ex's grandmother, and an Aunt of Ex's I had never heard of before. Ex ecstatically gave me a bracelet for being her maid of honor, they talked about how happy we were that she was getting married and how good her fiancee was (I had never meet the man, only talked to him for 10 minutes) . Overall it was an awkward and stressing affair.\n\n3 days before the wedding, I got a message telling me the wedding venue was changed. This was an issue since I was gong by bus. I called her to try to find an alternate route. Ex found that the shortest route would require a 2 hour bus ride and a 25 minute car ride. There were 2 main issues with that. One: there was no one who could pick me up from the bus stop and Two: I would have to skip one of my classes to even make it there on time, making me miss vital information on one of my projects for finals. I was already going to miss half my class to make it to the original venue (1 hour 20 by bus, 15 min walking), I could not risk going on the new route - I was on academic thin ice (as in I could be kicked out of the college for a year if I failed). I scrambled to find a ride, to no avail.\n\nFearing her reaction, I cautiously sent Ex a message that I could not attend her wedding and that I hoped that their would not be any hard feelings.\n\nI got a response a day later. Ex asked for the bracelet she had given me just 10 days prior. She followed that up with: \"*There will be hard feelings btw\"*\n\nThat hit me pretty hard. After bending over backwards to do what I could for her wedding (and having 2 episodes I can only describe as akin to a panic attack) I had failed her. My best friend.\n\nI talked to my parents, my 2 siblings and my counselor about the situation in hopes of some comfort and all my family told me the same thing: if Ex was being so self-centered as to not understand why I had to do what I did, it was time to reevaluate the relationship. And I did so for two weeks. After those two weeks, I sent Ex a message that our one-sided friendship was over and to not contact me again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Friend was getting married, asked me to find a spring dress mid-autumn, invited me and my sister to her bridal shower last minute and guilt triped me into going and tried to do the same to my sister, changed the venue and got mad when I told her I couldn't go and asked for the bracelet she gave me for being her maid of honor. Realized she was being selfish and that our relationship was one-sided and ended it 2 weeks after she got married.",

      "description": "Iâll start from the beginning. Weâll call him Noah. So, N and I have been in the same choir for half a year. Because weâve had hours upon hours to be around each other, weâd become close friends. \n\nThen, about a month ago, Noah texts me, saying something along the lines of âThank you for being such a good friend to me, donât let anyone change who you are, goodbye.â As it would any friend, this message extremely worried me. Long story short, I called the police, they went to his house, and found he had taken a bunch of pills. They took him to the hospital and saved his life.\n\nNow, about a week or two ago, Noah asks me out, and I say yes. Truth be told, I had started to like him about a month before the incident. We start dating, and all is going well. Until he texts me that this girl he knew (weâll call her Nadine) texted him that if he didnât date her, she was going to kill herself. To me, this sounded like obvious manipulation. Iâm still not sure whether he actually didnât see it, or just didnât care, but Noah (after relating to me what had happened) asked me if we could go on a break (so he could date her). He also says that he likes her. Slightly annoyed, I said, in *the* most passive aggressive tone, âsureâ.\n\nFast forward to last Thursday. Itâs the night of our concert, so, instead of going home for the day like usual at 3:30, we stay to prepare for the concert at 7:00. Other than the choir Noah and I are in, there are two other choirs, and weâll all perform together for the concert. In one of the choirs is a guy I also like. Weâll call him Sean. Note that Sean and Noah are friends. \n\nOur choir director orders a pizza to arrive at 5:30. At 5:00, we finish practice/preparation, and have a bit of free time. The cafeteria is full, so Sean, Noah, and a few of our other friends go sit at one of the outside tables. I had forgotten my jacket (note that *everyone* else is wearing a jacket), and it was really cold, so I was freezing. After sitting there shivering for a minute or two, Sean takes off his jacket and offers it to me. \n\nNoah says âIf you put that on, weâre done.â\n\nSo I put it on!\n\nWhat do you guys think? AITA?\n\nTldr; Friend tries to kill himself, we start dating, he wants to take a break to date a different girl who threatened to kill herself if he didnât date her. Him, a different guy, and I are outside and Iâm freezing, so the different guy offers me his jacket. Then he says if I put on other guyâs jacket, âweâre done,â so I put it on.",

      "description": "Married 17 years now, two kids, both teenagers - always busy.  From time to time I'll go into, say, a Starbucks, and see somebody just sitting in the corner reading a book and think, \"man, to have that kind of free time - to be able to just sit in a coffee shop and read a book without worrying about rushing off to somewhere else.\"  Well, after nearly two decades, I actually got President's Day off of work, but the wife and kids didn't.  She had to work, the kids had school, and I suddenly had this vision of dropping the kids off at school, driving to a Starbucks, and reading a book just like all those carefree people I always see.  Maybe just for a day, but at least it would be a day of no stress for once.  Well, she found out I had the day off.  All of a sudden it was, \"Oh, that's perfect - both pets need to go to the vet, and my car needs to go to the mechanic, and you can pick up some prescriptions and get groceries and pick the kids up from school and take them to their activities and we can have lunch together!\"  I think she read the look on my face and she said, \"well, what else are you going to do all day?\"  I told her I had originally planned to relax and decompress and she said, \"you do that every weekend!\" (I don't)  She says if I do all this stuff on my one day off that I've ever had since I got married, we'll have more free time on the weekend to do stuff together as a family.  So here I am, feeling guilty on the one hand because she's right - in five years, both kids will be off at college and I'm sure I'll miss them.  On the other hand, we're ALWAYS doing things together and I've been rushing for more than a third of my life.  I would really like a day just to not be in a hurry for once.",

      "description": "So this happened a few years ago in tenth grade, I'm a sophomore in college now, but it's always been in my head because it really ruined my longest friendship, and I keep switching sides on whether or not I'm the asshole. So this kid, Jon let's call him, was the same age as me, same male gender, and we had been friends since I moved schools in the 3rd grade. He's over one night on a weekend and we were having a good time as usual, and I show him a video I saw earlier that I thought was HILARIOUS. It was that grapefruit-job tutorial video that was pretty viral on you-tube, which I'll link at the bottom of this post. Now I still think this video is amazing and yea maybe it's a little nsfw but it's no big deal I think. Anyways, with him and I in my room (we were not alone in the house my parents and siblings were downstairs), I show him the video on my laptop. I am dying from laughter and, from what I could tell, so was Jon! As soon as the video gets past the \"GWORSCH GWORSCH GWORSCH\" part, he leaves the room, comes back, and we start talking about other stuff, except now he is totally expressionless. He's hardly talking and definitely not laughing. I asked him what's wrong and he just said that he was leaving. A few minutes of awkward silence after his mom comes and picks him up just like that. I thought it was weird but I pretty much forgot about it. About a week later (we went to different high schools so I hadn't had a chance to see him again), my mom calls me to her room and when I see her face she is completely livid. She starts shouting and yelling at how I'm a terrible friend and that I've changed and all this crazy stuff that I was completely clueless to. She then tells me that Jon told his mom that I showed him porn. I was MORTIFIED at this because my fairly strict parents were, to say the least, not very approving of anything remotely sex related. Tears and arguments later, I show her the video, and her exact reaction was \"Oh, that's what it was? Oh okay.\"  And boom that was that. For whatever reason, probably because it was raunchily comedic rather than actually sexual, the video didn't set off the whole \"THIS IS SEX\" trigger that would have led to her berating me for living a bad lifestyle, but that's besides the point.  I felt betrayed by my friend, and we didn't contact each other for a few weeks. Finally, I text him and his responses are all at most two-words until he plain stops responding. Aaaand that was that. In the past few years we've seen each other every now and then since we're in similar communities and we don't greet each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I never apologized for showing him that video because I didn't feel I needed to. After it was too late to apologize though, I did begin to feel bad. I mean, a kid in tenth grade is totally in his right to feel uncomfortable and leave! It was probably an asshole thing to show him an explicit video when, looking back at it, I had never shown him anything like that before. But still, to tell his mom and, as a result, my mom that I showed him porn? First off, it just was not porn. Second, isn't there a code in high school that clearly states you should keep those talks secret from parents anyways? And third, it made feel like I was some pervert or sex offender for showing someone \"porn,\" which is a real crappy and demeaning feeling. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? Should I have at least apologized to save the really long term and close friendship?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYoutube link to video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKnLz9OhnLw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKnLz9OhnLw) ",

      "description": "Hi guys.\n\nFor context:\n\nMy family has a timeshare, and for a long time we went on an almost yearly basis. Due to a bunch of reasons, we haven't gone in a few years.\n\nAlso, I recently started a business and I'm in the middle of shipping 400 orders. I should be done this week but it could also easily spill over into next week.\n\nAnyway:\n\nThis morning my cousin contacted me and said she wants to go on a trip next week. I told her that the last minute timing might make things difficult, but I'd go - it's been a while and she has had a hard year so far, so I figured I'd make it work.\n\nI tell I'll try to talk my mom into it, and the conversation ends.\n\nWell, later, when my mom wakes up, before I can her she gets a call from my grandmother telling her about the trip. During the call, she mentioned that my cousin's best friend is going.\n\nI have awful anxiety so around people I'm not related to I usually can't relax. My cousin also very specifically didn't tell me about this, despite the fact she mentioned the other people she was asking.\n\nSo between all the work I'm in the middle of doing, plus the fact I wasn't going to actually enjoy myself, I texted my cousin and let her know I didn't think I'd be going.\n\nI did lead it off with \"you didn't tell me Karen was going\", and it may have sounded more accusatory than I meant to. I simply meant to tell her what new information made me reconsider going.\n\nAnyway, I told my mom (who planned on not going either) and she told me I was being an asshole and should have lied and just said I couldn't go. While they have been true, I've always tried to be as honest as I can with people specifically *because* my mother lies a lot and I have complicit in her lies many times in the past.\n\nI've already apologized to my cousin, in case I did upset her, so this is a purely academic question.\n\nSo, reddit - am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Obligatory TL:DR at the bottom\n\nSo, I'm currently in my third year of uni, and I graduate (hopefully!) at the beginning of July. Naturally, questions about the ceremony are beginning to arise in my family, and last night my mum told me that my dad has to be present when I graduate. \n\nI am very against this. Mainly bc he left our family around 5 years ago, when my mum finally threw him out after over 20 years of emotional, financial and (occasional) physical abuse.\n\nFurthermore, he's an alcoholic. I do *not* want him present at my graduation, considering that he has never been present at any other event in my life. He's never been to a parent's evening, or a school play, he even forgot my 18th birthday. I do not see why he is now entitled to come to my graduation. I have worked extremely hard to get to this point and I don't think he deserves to be there. He is still in my life, yes (against my wishes), as my mum still allows him to visit our house, even though when he is here he never says more than hello or goodbye to me. Personally, I feel like if he wanted so badly to be at my graduation, he should have acted like a father in the first place. He does not deserve now to suddenly turn up and pretend he has anything to do with my success, that is all down to my mum bringing me up alone (even though he was in the house he never even changed a nappy let alone cared for me) and myself. \n\nI expressed such thoughts to my mother last night and her reaction was less than ideal. She told me that I'm being selfish and cruel and that he's still my dad no matter what he did and he should be able to go. She says he'll pay for his own ticket (my uni only gives you 2 free tickets, and those will be for my mum and my bf), but I still don't particularly want him there. She says if I don't let him I'll regret it. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\nTL:DR - My dad wants to come to my graduation ceremony despite the fact he's never been present at any other event in my life, and was emotionally and physically abusive to my mother - I said no and now my mum hates me for it.

      "title": "AITA for asking my SO/fiancee to make our roommate move out?",
      "description": "This is a long story. Thanks in advance for reading!\n\nBackstory: my SO (31F) and I (28M) started dating when I was living in my own place. At the time, she lived at home with her mom and her mom's best friend who is a 60+ year old man. Her mom passed away suddenly less than a year after we started dating and I moved in with her for emotional support and to help sort out the estate. This was over 3 years ago and we are now engaged.\n\nAt the time I moved in, the understanding was that we would get the estate figured out and then sell the house to get our own place. Her roommate wasn't paying her mom rent at the time she passed away, and it certainly didn't seem fair to demand it immediately following the upheaval caused by her death. He was basically a model roommate and most of the house's decorations were his. He cleaned regularly despite having a full-time job, and purchased communal groceries. I hardly knew my SO's mom at the time she passed, so I was happy to have her mom's best friend there to console my SO as a sort of \"uncle\". This was about 3.5 years ago.\n\nIt took almost a year to settle the estate, and my SO would constantly stress out about how much the mortgage payments were since her mom had been making more than both of us combined. We let our roommate know that we were starting to look at houses and he began to pack and consolidate his things. We work together and our office had massive layoffs which impacted me, so we couldn't continue thinking about taking out a brand new mortgage even after the estate had been sorted. I told her that we needed to start charging our roommate rent since the agreement for him to live here for free was made by her mother, not her or I, and our income was insufficient -- even the bank said so. She reluctantly agreed and he started paying fair rent, but stopped cleaning the house (except for his own messes) and started buying his own groceries. With the additional rental income it became easier for us to manage the existing mortgage, so we started trying to make the house our own instead of getting it ready to sell. This was about two years ago.\n\nOur roommate has since retired and spends most of his time in his room, and I only see him about once a day. I'll hear my SO complain about him leaving coffee grounds on the counter, or letting the dog come upstairs (she pees on the carpet every chance she gets), or cluttering up the fridge. Over time, my subtle hints that maybe we should persuade him to leave started to be met with resistance. It was less \"let's see what his plans are\" and more \"I'm not going to have that conversation with him and you need to make up for the difference in rent\". I stopped pushing the issue and figured that after we were engaged he would get the message and see himself out. We've been engaged for over a year now and he has shown no signs of leaving, and has even started accruing knick-knacks/antiques again after selling or packing most of his stuff when we were still looking to move.\n\nThe other day I cracked -- I slipped down the stairs when our cat ran between my legs as I was going to feed him, causing me to slide into the dog gate, injuring me and requiring us to buy a new gate. In my mind, I slipped because our roommate has been contributing to my cat's bad meal time behavior by allowing him to steal food from the dog (he tried to emphasize several times that it was just a little, and continued to mention it looking for some kind of approval from me, which I was not giving because I'm trying to train this cat), and I slammed into the gate which was only there because he lets the dog come upstairs and doesn't watch her so she ruins the carpet. Obviously this isn't entirely logical, but at that moment I lost my temper and everything I had been internalizing came out at once and I felt like a crazy person.\n\nThis led to a surprisingly productive conversation regarding my feelings that I could not control for some of these issues we commonly quarrel over because they were in some way related to our roommate -- things like housecleaning, our sex life (his room shares a wall), and pet training. I explained that I want to know what our life would be like if just the two of us were responsible for everything that occurs under our roof, while at the same time saying that I obviously don't blame our roommate for all of our problems and don't expect him moving out to solve everything either. I assume he doesn't want to leave or he would have already, and she doesn't *really* want him to leave, but I do. She agreed that I had made plenty of concessions over the course of our relationship and that she would talk to him by the end of the month.\n\nNow that she's agreed to talk to him, I feel like an asshole. I don't know for sure whether I'll be able to train the pets without his interference, or if our sex lives will dramatically improve -- I just don't see any other way of finding out with him still living here. I know that I'm putting us at a financial disadvantage (we both make more now so it's nothing we can't handle, but $ is $) based only on my desire to be truly alone with my future wife. I don't feel like it's my place to broach the subject to him since he was invited by my SO's mother, and my SO lived with him for years before I moved in...so I put the burden on her despite her not being the one who wants him to leave.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for asking my SO/fiancee to make our roommate move out?",

I did my best to make this text as correct as possible, sorry if there's some mistakes.\n\nSo basically, I live in the countryside and my internet is terrible. If anyone in my family is watching a video or going on any website, it is nearly impossible to play any online video game. This bad connection already have been a source of arguments in our family.\n\nSince the internet is that bad, we had to settle a planning for who and when can use the connection. Basically, some evenings my brother can use it all, some evenings it's me.\n\nMy brother and I both love competitive FPS and spend a lot of time playing on our computers. We play different games though. Most of the time we can play at the same time without any problems.\n\nHowever my brother also spend a lot of time on YouTube. Not for watching stuff he's interested in, but rather to have something moving on his screen while he's chatting on his phone. The thing is, it's impossible for me to play or do anything on the internet when he does that.\n\nNow I'd love to just turn off my computer and go out when stuff like this happens. But the nearest city is about 20 minutes by car from my house and I pay for the gas myself. Most of my friends are in another city for their studies. Internet is basically my only mean to \"see\" my friends. \n\nI also love the games I play and want to get better at those. I play a lot of Overwatch, so I joined a team, play tournaments and I have a coach. I really want to turn the time I put into this game into something serious. \n\nBut I can't put as much effort into the game as I'd like to because sometimes the internet is being used by someone else. And it really bothers me when it's stuff like YouTube just to spend time.\n\nMoreover, since we have this \"connection planning\", the only evenings I can play on are the one when I have to train with my Overwatch team. So whenever one of my friends asks to play with me, it's either \"I can't I have to play with my team\" or \"I can't my brother is using the internet\".\n\nIt really bugs me to think that I'm unable to play with people I like or do stuff I'm into because of something as stupid as YouTube videos. \nWhenever I bring up the issue in my family, it either gets ignored or ends up in a violent argument.\nI talked about this to my mom and she says that I shouldn't judge what my brother is doing on the internet.\n\nAITA ?\n ",

I didnât want to inconvenience my friends by asking them for a ride. \n\nUltimately I just thought itâd make the most sense if he picked me up since his place isnât far from my place. So I ask and he says âno, Iâm not picking you up every timeâ. I review my options and decide to ask a friend. Luckily she has errands to do around 5:30pm and tells me she can give me a ride so it isnât a total inconvenience for her. So I tell Door that I got a ride and the date is on. \n\nItâs just before 5:30pm and Door texts me saying heâs at the restaurant but my ride isnât here. I call and she says sheâs in traffic but almost at my house. I tell Door that sheâs in traffic and I should be at the restaurant in 7-10 minutes. Door tells me not to bother going and says heâs just gonna go home. He said we can go out another time but we havenât talked since. \n\nAITA for doing this? The majority of my friends think HE is the asshole, not me. But I personally feel like I am. Some friends say we both are. Am I being too hard on myself or are my friends not being hard enough? Maybe I should have sucked it up and taken the bus? Idk, what do yâall think? ",

      "description": "I was typing this up but it became a giant wall of text. So long story short, I was interested in a girl, she wasnât interested in me. Then she became interested in me but I was turned off by her. This went back and forth a few times. During all this time, about a year total, she would not stop talking about guys and having sex with them. She was even gleeful in talking about it. Not even 6 months into the friendship I made it clear that I didnât want to hear about it. She kept talking about all these guys. It was to where she would talk about nothing else. I went on for vacation for a week, she didnât want to hear about the vacation, only about some new dude sheâs sleeping with. I had family in the path of a hurricane, ignores my talking and talks about guys. \n\nI called her up about a month ago and asked her to stop, completely stop. All she did was make excuses for why she just talks about guys only. \n\nThe next day I asked a mutual friend to intervene, she told her to lay off the talk about guys or I would be lost as a friend. Again, many excuses were made for why this was a necessary topic. \n\nA week after all of this, she has gone back to nothing but talking about guys. I blocked her on all social media and on the work IM program. \n\nAm I the asshole? I felt I laid out the expectations for a friendship. I felt that it was one way, only her topics were talked about. I feel bad, sheâs the only person Iâve had to block like this. The topic of guys constantly was stressing me out, affecting my work, sleep, home life. ",

Iâm approaching 27, and fairly sure heâs going to propose on my birthday. Having said that, Iâm not 100% sure, and havenât mentioned anything to anyone in case Iâm wrong.

Tbh Iâm really getting tired of it, especially because Iâm running out of responses. My sister has made several jokey comments about this since Iâve come home for Christmas (a week) and tonight I snapped. Told her it wasnât her business, she needs to stop asking me and I donât want any more jokes. It was too harsh to be fair, but Iâm losing the plot with what to say to these comments at this point. My partner never gets this type of question which is also driving me mad. Anyway - AITA? ",

I went to a different college -- the Tabbycats -- and while I care about the school itself, could not care less about sports.  We also live about 1 hour away from my school and 4 from his.  We decided to take our 2 year old son to a women's basketball game last weekend where the two teams were playing.  For the 2 weeks leading up to the game, whenever he was asked who he was going to cheer for, he said the Tabbycats.  Every. Single. Time.  The day of the game comes and my husband brings my son downstairs in a Bluebirds shirt.  I thought this was kind of sad since my son had never wavered on who he wanted to cheer for, so I changed him into a Tabbycats shirt and my husband got really upset.  He thinks that he's got an uphill battle in terms of indoctrinating him since we live so close to my school and since I don't care about sports.  Sports is something he bonded over with his dad and wants to do that with our son.  I think it's important to let our son make his own choices but again, he's just 2 (and will likely change his allegiance in the future) so the whole thing seems a bit overblown and silly IMO.

      "description": "There isnât much of a simple way to put this. Iâm 16, so I still live at home, and my parents are still together. Even though she pisses me off sometimes, I adore my mom. My father on the other hand... he is a very complicated man, to say the least.\n\nHe grew up in a rough household. His dad was abusive, and his mother supposedly tried to force her religion on him. I canât imagine growing up in a household where you arenât accepted for who you are- I am, for the most parts, the child my family wanted me to be. Of course they always preach about accepting your child no matter what, however I imagine that if I approached them saying I believed in God that theyâd disown me or something. Maybe not my mom, but my dad would. I understand why, to an extent. But heâs the type to constantly talk down on Christianity and conservative-minded folk, simply for their beliefs, saying that itâs wrong. Iâve never liked that. I understand the extremists of those sides can be bad, but really, are there any nontoxic extremist types? It just bothers me. Heâd rather just talk you down and tell you that youâre wrong than have a civil discussion and try to understand your point of view.\n\nHe was in the military after he graduated high school, but it was not for him. I donât know what all happened to him when he was in the Navy, but whatever mental issues he had prior, they got worse. I was born right before he quit, so I donât know what he was like beforehand. I do know he had attempted suicide during his service, but (obviously) failed. I donât want to ask him about it. Iâve always been curious, but too scared. Iâll probably never ask. Heâs very easily triggered (I hate that word and its connotation nowadays but thatâs what it is), and I wouldnât want to make things any worse. All I know is that it didnât work out well for him.\n\nMy mother once described it as he likes to think heâs very empathetic, and he can be, but not always when it matters. Many of my early childhood memories are of him being angry with me. I remember when I was four, we were supposed to be leaving to go somewhere, but we werenât really on any tight schedule. I couldnât find my shoes. He got extremely mad, and long story short, ended up kicking a hole in a cabinet. Our old house was full of dents and cracks and holes from where he had kicked or hit things when he was angry. He never directly hit my brother or me, but we were always scared he would. Another time, I told him I had brushed my teeth, but I guess I hadnât done a very good job of it. He accused me of lying about it, and I was to be punished. He took me to field hockey practice an hour or so early and made me run laps around the field. Now I wasnât a very athletic child. I enjoyed hockey but even in elementary school we played on the full sized field and as a chubby, out of shape eight year old, it was a lot of work. I think I had to run five laps. Which doesnât sound that bad, but like I said, chubby eight year old with short legs. Itâs a lot of running. I was having trouble breathing through the sobs (he was yelling at me too) and trying to ask for water through the blubbering. But he refused to give it to me until I was done with my laps. Itâs one of my most traumatizing childhood memories.\n\nBasically he has anger issues stemming from his PTSD. He canât keep a stable job. I remember he was always in and out of different kitchens (he went to culinary school when I was little) until he developed carpal tunnel, and since then, heâs just been trying to figure something out. He recently started college again, and itâs nothing too fancy, just a local university. But he thinks heâs hot shit for it. Iâm proud of him and all, but he wants to teach at a local college thatâs within the top 5 public schools in the country. I think heâs shooting a little high. Heâs always been very egotistical. I guess you could consider it a god complex. He thinks his beliefs are superior to everyone elseâs and that heâs always right- no matter what. Itâs a lot of little things he does that really irk and upset me, but I know Iâm sensitive. He talks about philosophy and a lot of other things we donât care to hear so much about, and I feel really bad for not caring, but it simply just doesnât interest me. He definitely thinks heâs extremely intellectual, but honestly, I think heâs just pretty average. And thereâs nothing wrong with that. His ego just bothers me.\n\nThe reason I want to hate him is because Iâm fairly certain heâs ruined my life. I know, Iâm just an unstable teenager, of course Iâm saying that. But I donât think Iâd be so depressed if it werenât for him. Maybe I would, because who in this generation isnât depressed, honestly? But Iâm most definitely not okay, and I can easily attribute most of it to him. Heâs scared me and scarred me so many times over. He says things that really hurt, but then claim he doesnât remember saying that and making me seem crazy. Heâll fuss at me for interrupting him even if he wasnât speaking, and then cut me off in the middle of a sentence. He constantly makes me feel like less of a person, and I donât know where the line is drawn between his own mental issues and just being an asshole. Itâs hard to see. \n\nThe reason Iâm making this post is because of a pizza. Heâs a vegetarian and we went out to my motherâs birthday lunch today with our family. All of our food was pretty screwed up, but they were doing their best to fix it and took quite a lot off our tab. Our waitress looked like she was about to cry the whole time- I felt so bad for her. But my family didnât really care. The food was still pretty good and they were handling it well, so we were having a good time. My dad ordered a personal pizza, and there was a pepperoni on it. He immediately got really upset and started yelling and swearing- and itâs just embarrassing at this point. Iâve been really sick for months and didnât even want to come, and Iâve had a looot of other things going on. And that just made me wish I had stayed home. I know he canât control his temper but it just.. I donât know. You get tired of it after a while. You just want it to stop.\n\nI canât hate my own father for his mental issues, but I just donât know whatâs what anymore. And itâs caused me so much hurt and so much pain. And my other family too. I canât imagine what my mom or my brother feel. I want to cut myself off from him once Iâve moved out but I wouldnât want to cut off my mother too. I very much enjoy the rest of my family. But Iâm tired of the hurt. Since I was about 12 Iâve been on a serious mental roller coaster. I think right now Iâm at the lowest Iâve ever been. Lots of self harm and suicidal thoughts/(pathetic) attempts. Iâve just now started to (sort of) get help. But I just donât know how to feel about my father. Thereâs so much more to this that I just couldnât type. I feel like an asshole for disliking him. But Iâm hurting too. Heâs not the only one.\n\nTL;DR - My father has a plethora of mental problems, and itâs wreaked havoc on my own life. As much as I want to hate him, I donât know where the line is between his mental issues and him being an asshole. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to dislike him?",

      "description": "I live together with my fiancÃ© (Chiquita) and my 2 older brothers (Eldest: Steve Second Eldest:John) live together with Steve's fiancÃ©(Jessica). Christmas time comes around and me and my Chiquita are pretty low on funds and also very recently found out that we have a baby on the way. I did let both of my brothers know about the baby and so we really only bought a couple gifts to hand out during Xmas.\n\nThe only gifts we really bought, even though the family is pretty big, was for my mom and my two brothers. Steve did at one point ask me what I myself wanted for Christmas and I did mention a couple things. The gifts we bought were nothing extravagant and we had left them at the house on Christmas Day, so we did not have them during the passing out of the gifts. I did receive a gift from Steve signed from both him and his fiancÃ© , it was definitely a bit more than I had spent on mine. I thanked them quite a bit and also used the gathering of the family to announce our child to my family. I even sent them a text thanking them for the gift they gave me. (some kitchen appliance) \n\nCouple days later John and I are hanging out and he says that it was inconsiderate of me to get only him and my other brother gifts knowing that there are 3 people in the household? I asked if he was serious because I do not think that gifts should be expected seemed a bit entitled to expect. He said yes and that he agreed with her and that if in the future if I was going to only get them a gift that I shouldn't even bother. I said that seemed kind of rude and even if I didn't get her a gift, I would hope that he appreciates my present to him. He said that it's rude and that in the future he would just not accept the gift if that was the case. Another thing I forgot to mention is that my family even has a secret Santa event every year and I did not participate for the same reasons, so it's not like she didn't receive any gifts at all. I don't know, seems a bit entitled to me but what do you guys think?\n\nTLDR: Gave my 2 brothers a gift, but not the fiancÃ© they live with and they think it is inconsiderate.",

      "description": "I'm really torn on submitting my application. My whole deal is kind of a long story but essentially; I am currently 6 months post grad from nursing school. I've been significantly depressed for a multitude of reasons including &amp; not limited to: failing my first NCLEX attempt (have yet to retake), being broken up with, feeling extremely aimless, uninspired, unfulfilled, and just generally lost about the current direction of my life. I have always been cursed with indecisiveness and complicity. \n\nI currently have a job offer at a unit I've worked at as a tech for over a year now, and while they are very dedicated employees &amp; have been nothing but nice to me, I just can't see myself working there forever. I've realized I'm not passionate about the work I would be doing there.I tried looking for opportunities but was continually discouraged when looking through job listings &amp; found nothing available interested me. So I decided to just accept a full time position where I currently was, just to pass the time. This was ages ago, I've had anxiety about taking my boards another time so I've rescheduled it multiple times now - I will be taking them very soon, willing I feel truly ready. My current unit has kept my job offer open to me &amp; I will be able to start as soon as I've passed. They have been so understanding, I almost don't understand why they'd be willing to wait for me like this.\n\nFast forward to yesterday - my best friend in the whole world is graduating from nursing school in a few short weeks and has been hesitant to apply, but finally did, and heard back from this really awesome unit. She's a naturally nervous person, so for her to hear back was a really big deal. The thing about her &amp; I - we're best friends for a reason. Our interests, motivators, challenges, etc. are nearly identical. I love her to death and she is my number one source of support. We have had very similar journeys. I am really interested in the position that she applied for too and the idea of getting to work there (especially with her!) would be an actual dream come true. But I can't help but feel it's an asshole move for me to apply for this job, when A) I don't know how many positions are available B) I haven't told her I want to apply C) I wouldn't have known the position was open if she hadn't told me.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't think I'll be able to \"steal\" this from her, I in no way think I'm better than her. But if I were to be offered an interview, i have to consider the possibility I get a position and she doesn't. She would never ever forgive me. But I am at a point in my life where I am so miserable and I cry everyday because I have no idea what the hell I'm doing &amp; if I even have a future. This is the first time in months I've felt motivated to actually do something to change my life and not just settle for what was already laid out for me. I just don't know if it's the right thing to do though, no matter how I feel, I don't want to risk our friendship &amp; I have a gut feeling this is pushing it. I'm seriously so torn.",

      "description": "Backstory: Cockfighting is (unfortunately) still legal in Mexico. I am very against the sport, as I view it as barbaric and cruel. My grandparents own a condo in the country and invited me down for spring break. They wanted to show us the local culture in the town they are in, and took us to a ranch that raised fighting cocks. I initially did not want to go in, but I also did not want to disappoint my grandparents. They are almost 90, and we don't know how long they have left. I begrudgingly went in and pretended everything was fine. It started out innocently enough, with the rancher letting us hold the roosters. Then, I got more and more uncomfortable. He put the roosters in a cockfighting ring and had my brother and I stand on opposite sides and release the fighting cocks to simulate a match. I found out that usually, a cockfight results in both animals dying, but for this demonstration, the rancher put \"gloves\" on them so neither would get hurt (still barbaric in my opinion, though). After a couple minutes of watching them attack each other, he gathered them up and put them back in their cages. \n\nI was pretty disgusted by the spectacle but figured no harm was done and we left. Then, I found out that my mom and grandpa filmed me doing this. I found a video of me looking pretty uncomfortable holding a rooster obviously meant for cockfighting. When I got back to the condo, I quickly deleted anything that had me in it. When my mom and brother found out about this, they were pissed. Evidently, they are not as against the sport as I am. I had deleted the video of my brother participating because it had me in it as well. It was the only video that actually showed the roosters fighting. However, I did not delete the other pictures of him and my mom holding the animals, only the ones with me. They said that I should have asked before doing this, but I held firm that I didn't care if they allowed me to or not. I did not want a photo of myself doing something that I have a huge ethical issue with, even if it was legal and only done to make my grandparents happy. \n\n\nWas I in the wrong for deleting these without asking first? I don't regret it, as I don't want anyone getting the idea that cockfighting is something I support. Should I have kept the video if my brother wanted me to?\n\n\nAlso, how should I approach my grandparents about this? They have footage of me as well, which I would like them to delete, but I don't want to hurt their feelings or act less grateful for how inviting me. \n",

      "description": "My sister  has always been a generally miserable human being and verbally abusive.  For about a year, during my senior year of college, my sister moved to a spot in the city fairly close to me and the two of us became really good friends and spent a lot of time together.  That changed over the past six months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe goes below the belt during arguments.  I do not argue that way and prefer to keep arguments about the subject at hand.  Several months ago, we got into an argument about something stupid which devolved into her making below the belt comments and making fun of me for struggling with my mental health for the past few months.  When I called her out, she said I did the same thing which I most certainly don't do and anybody I know will say that would be very unlike me to do so.   She didn't see anything wrong with what she did and I told her that if she didn't see why this was an issue I was going to cut her out of my life.  We eventually made up but I told her that this was not a healthy way to handle confrontation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a few months.  She's struggling financially and texts me to ask for $30 because she ran out of medication and needed to borrow some money to pick it up.  I didn't think anything of it and lent it to her.  Less than a week later my mom emailed me to ask if I wanted to meet her after work to go to the holiday market downtown and asked if I wanted her to invite my sister.  I said no problem, but my mom changed her mind and said that my sister hadn't been feeling well because she hadn't taken her medication in three days so my mom had just lent her money for it.  I got upset because she clearly had lied to me. I messaged her and asked what happened.  She lied again.  I told her I didn't like being lied to and she COMPLETELY lost her shit.  Started saying I was a piece of shit, a joke, and a crappy person for questioning her.  Went on a full verbally abusive tirade about how I'm a terrible person and should be ashamed of myself.  She admitted that she lied because she needed the money for food and was embarrassed to ask.  I replied that she should never be embarrassed to be struggling and if she asked for money for food I wouldn't have batted an eye.  I lent my best friend money countless times throughout undergrad when she didn't have enough to feed herself and I would never judge someone for struggling.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe continued to tell me I should be ashamed, that I'm a dumb bitch and to not fucking test her, that she hopes if she kills herself that I hate myself for the rest of my life, yada yada yada.  Doesn't really bother me when she says this stuff anymore because that's who she is and I literally don't care about her opinion (except for the suicide part, when I told her I was going to send the police to her apartment to check on her).  I wasn't responding aggressively because I have no desire to stoop to her level but I basically decided at that moment that I needed to cut her out of my life.  She's my ONLY source of interpersonal drama and I'm already dealing with my own stuff.  I haven't spoken to her since before christmas and christmas was suuuuuper awkward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is my mom is on my back about making up with her.  She thinks I'm being some dramatic child and an asshole for not talking to my sister and basically told me I have to make up with her by the time family vacation rolls around.  I even said I wouldn't mind staying behind on vacation while the three of them go. It doesn't sound appealing to spend a week with my immediate family since we had never been close and hadn't been on vacation together since I was 16 (almost 7 years ago).  My dad has no idea that I don't plan on going because he and my sister also don't get along and I don't want to start unnecessary drama between the two of them by telling him about the fight.  So the vacation thing for all four of us probably isn't happening because of me and they might be canceling the vacation.  Am I the asshole for ruining it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I have never been close with him and neither has my mother.

I am planning to try and call one more time tomorrow if I don't get a call back tonight.\n\nI feel weird about all this, almost all my family is estranged so things like phone calls on birthdays for someone I have never been close with don't make sense to me. \nMy mom still seems irritated with me though and I'm wondering if my grandparents are as well. \nAm I the asshole for not calling on his birthday/feeling weird about it at all?

      "description": "Me and my best mate have a great relationship and he loves to call me to check in and see how Iâm going or to share something he had recently learned. I usually enjoy the calls and appreciate him wanting to talk. \n\nHowever this can get a bit annoying when he calls me pretty early in the morning. I go to bed around 12-1 for work reasons (freelance stuff) and wake up at 8.05 for work reasons (day job) and if I donât get at least 7-8 hours sleep I know the next day is going to suck.\n\nThis morning he calls at 7am and wakes me up so for the first time ever I donât answer his morning call because I assume itâll once again be something that really doesnât need to be woken up for. After it rings out I just go back to sleep and wait for my alarms to sort me out at 8am. After I get up i see he has texted me something about new information he has about creatine (something we were talking about the night before). So the following messages went something like this.\n\nMe : Bro stop calling me before 8\nHim : You lil bitch\nMe : I will never answer before 8 anymore\n\nHe then gets pretty pissed off and calls me an unreliable friend and that he would pick up anytime no matter what. His response was dry and sarcastic so I could tell he was pretty pissed off. \n\nStanding by what I said I then responded by telling him I use to answer morning calls but they always werenât urgent or could have been communicated via text or at least a call after Iâd woken up. I then compared him to the boy who cried wolf in the way that if all your morning calls were unimportant Iâd assume that when you finally actually needed help Iâd assume the call was once again unimportant.\n\nHe hasnât replied which usually means heâs offended.  This happened just after I woke up so I wasnât exactly in a pearly mood but I stand by what I said. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: best mate keeps calling me early in the morning about things that arenât urgent, I told him I wouldnât answer those calls anymore",

They are ages 26 and 29, three years apart.\n\nHowever, I canât depend on my limited family to deal with the crippling isolation after work. My wife and I were not social in the sense that I do not have a strong network to *jump back into things*. In any case at my age, the dating world has changed a lot compared to when I met my ex-wife. It seems that you have a couple of sites that are appropriate for your maturity that lead to date after date of noncommittal garbage. After several months of dating people my age to no avail, I signed up for a sugar daddy dating service. \n\nFor someone my age, I take great care of myself and go to the gym regularly. I was able to start a relationship with a 19-year-old that seems to have come from a rough background. I am a little worried about some of the shadier people from her past. But who am I to say anything? I have two kids. I care for her deeply and provide for her needs as she does for me. We have had this arrangement for about half a year and things have gotten more serious, we have started talking about marriage. I canât help but feel guilty when I hear her talk about how she sees a future with me. \n\nWhen she talks about marriage, my mind always goes back to thinking about how we met on a sugar daddy dating service and the rigid gender role implications. Iâve made a spreadsheet and if I work for an extra half decade or so, I could realistically maintain the relationship until I die. I just donât have the self-control to tell her I have no interest in that level of commitment again. Partially, I am worried that she would not get along with the small remaining family that I have left. \n\nEssentially, I am dating a younger girl as I am approaching retirement. She wants to get married. I plan on continuing this relationship for as long as possible with the intent of never getting married. I do not plan on communicating this to her. Love, dating and relationships seem to be morally ambiguous, am I an asshole for treating my girlfriend the same way people my age have treated me in the dating world?",

      "description": "My (24M) fiancÃ©e (23F) and I are getting married. We have been dating for over 6 years and are having a short engagement period. This means we don't have much time to find vendors and plan/coordinate the wedding.\n\nWe were recently looking for food vendors when my Mother brought up that a friend of my parents made barbecue and had won some awards at the local cook off competitions. We were told that they would give us a good deal and that we could have good barbecue for cheap, but when the quote arrived it was 25$ per person. This seemed a little steep for the budget my fiancÃ©e and I had set for ourselves. We thanked them for their time and moved on. \n\nWe ended up finding a coworkers aunt who had done quinceaÃ±eras and a few small weddings for around 7$ a plate. We thought to ourselves this food would be either really cheap and not of good quality or perhaps the perfect choice for us. We sampled the food the lady was offering for the wedding and decided that it wasn't amazing but it was good enough especially for it only being 7$ a plate. \n\nFast forward to a few hours ago and I get another message from the previous vendor who offered us at 25$ per person. He states that the quote they sent us was an error and he meant 10$ per plate as he was a family friend and would love to help us. When I heard that I got excited because for just 3$ more we would be able to get food that was \"amazing\" and had won awards locally, but when I told my wife to be she was not happy at all stating that she was done with the food planning and didn't want to think about it anymore. Note, we haven't put down a deposit for the food yet so nothing was set in stone, but she didn't seem to care about, what I thought was, a potentially great deal. She stated that how much better can the barbecue even be (the cheaper place was also doing barbecue) and at our current guest count an increase of 3$ more was an extra 500$. She thought that I was just trying to appease my mother by switching to her friend instead of sticking with that we had originally planned. I just thought the price/quality ratio was more in our favor and was upset she didn't even want to consider it. I understand she is getting stressed and I also understand that having to go back to something she considered checked off the list is not ideal but should she outright dismiss it? I'm not sure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for getting upset she doesn't want to change vendors?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust as some additional information the delivery and serving fee were included in the price of the per plate price listed above. I also will admit that there is a little bit of tension between my mother and my fiancÃ©e mostly due to my mother getting upset we weren't considering some of her friends for vendors ( some other people were a little too pricey ) and believing I am just letting her decide everything (which isn't the case).",

      "description": "My sister and her husband moved to SC from CA in 2012ish. From what we know, he left CA to get away from his family and my sister wanted to come back home. Our mom was gracious enough to allow them to live in one of her properties for less than $800/month and has \"borrowed\" at least $5000 from our mom. They have always been tight and irresponsible with money. They have a 9 month old baby and when they have to work night shifts, my brother or mom is always available to watch him.\n\nMy sister is an EMS tech and he works at a gas station. Neither have degrees and both forget that the cost of living in CA is different than in SC. The help they have now will be gone if they decide to move and/ or come back. His parents have somehow convinced him that because paychecks are higher on the west coast, they will be okay but forget that the COL is higher as well. They struggle to pay rent and to keep up with what they have now.\n\nWe understand that her husband's family wants to be close to their son and grandson but they have been looking to live about an hour away from his parents. \n\nOriginally, my sister said he can move back and she'll just see their son in the summer but all of a sudden she is okay with going\n\nDoes that make me/ us the asshole or just selfish for not wanting them to make an irresponsible decision?",

      "description": "First of all, english is not my first language so please read patiently and forgive my mistakes.\n\nNow, a bit of context: I'm in college and my classmate is one of those who are pretty bad at almost every subject, makes jokes about failing everything all the time and answers almost everything with \"I don't know.\". So, my physics teacher tell us we are going to do a project on pairs at the lab. We couldn't choose our partner, unfortunately, and that classmate (I'll call her N) ended up being my partner. I already knew things would go terrible because we had a chemistry lab project before and her partner (who is the smartest and most hardworking girl in my class ironically) had to do it all on her own because N didn't know how to do anything but since I had no \"good excuse\" to change partners they wouldn't let me and I didn't want to start a drama since, before working with her, I thought she was very nice.\nThe lab part was \"easy\" but very very tiring and boring. It was basically observing a pendulum and counting in how many seconds it made 10 oscillations in different scenarios. No big deal if we didn't have to do that more than a 100 times, literally. So that means I had to focus on the pendulum more than a 1000 oscillations counting one by one without mentioning the times we had to restart because of something. It was 6 hours of counting, 3 hours each day. So yeah, not hard of course but, at least for me, exhausting. And I did it all. Changing the balls and other stuff we used, counting everything, making all the maths and writing, using and organizing all the data. Everytime I told her to do something N said she didn't know how to do it and even if she finally tried something she would do it so wrong that I ended up doing it again because we were losing a lot of time.\nNow that that part is done, the real project begins. We have to use all the data to make a report and that's what's going to be marked and if we fail we'll fail the subject even if we have a 10 on the exam. We started yesterday and I can't believe it but she is even worse at making this report than doing the lab work. Whenever I'm not writing I have to read what she is doing because she is either coping from my teachers guide or writing things that makes no sense and repeating herself. So, I write my part and rewrite hers almost entirely. I talked to my other classmates about it and they told me it'd be better if I do the project on my own but N feels bad for not helping on the lab and is constantly asking me to do it together or give her something to do but I'm 99.99% sure that I'll have to redo whatever she does at this point. I only give her credit for doing a couple of drawings (which are a few sticks and the ball and naming the parts) and a graph (she only had to write the data on an app that did the graph automatically). It's nice she did it but considering everything I'm doing, I still feel like it's not enough.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I told her to just stop helping me? How can I explain her the situation without hurting her feelings too much?\n\nBtw, no, I can't change partners. Every group has different data from the experiment and all the lab work is done. And we have another project several weeks from now and she would still be my partner for that as well\n\nThanks for reading",

      "description": "A few months ago, I was camping with some friends. The four of us were chatting and I was making coffee and generally just doing everything for the group. \n\nThe conversation went into a place where we spoke about money. Someone was saying that they wouldn't be able to afford a drug addiction. I then said something like \"well I guess I could but that would be dangerous. I could definitely have one for a while\". I was conveying that it would be a bad thing for me. \n\nFor context, everyone in the group has jobs and makes money. I have a job that makes substantially more money (software). Their jobs are absolutely fine but I just make more because it's software and I've worked really hard to get there. No one is proud of me ever because it's more than them. I can deal with that. I generally am generous with my money for friends and as of the conversation I'm literally making/providing things for these people for free. \n\nAfter my comment, my boyfriend said something like \"it must be nice to be able to afford that\" and all three roared with laughter. I felt super hurt immediately, especially as I'm giving everyone things. I tried to recover by clarifying but everyone was laughing so hard still. \n\nI moved off to the side and felt hurt. Later on I told my boyfriend that was he said hurt me, and I reiterated that I already feel guilty for having more money so this didn't help. He was somewhat apologetic. He essentially was just sorry I reacted. He didn't mean it, etc.\n\nMonths later, a couple nights ago, I'm on the path to giving away more things to the same group of people. I mentioned in passing about the time in the summer and how again I'm giving things away and I hope that it's appreciated. \n\nMy boyfriend then becomes really hurt. I'm really confused. I ask him what's going on and what happened to cause his sudden hurt. It's because I have mentioned this event and I'm now holding it over him. I try to gently explain that yes I still think about it and it hurt me a lot. He tells me that he is hurt more that I'm bringing it up. I'm bringing it up because it was relevant to the thing I was doing, and yes I'm still a bit hurt by it. I tell him that I didn't like that comment he made way back when. I wasn't trying to start a fight or anything. I think it's within my right to express how I feel. \n\nAt this point I'm very confused. It seems that I can't express how I was hurt by his comment without him being more hurt that I'm talking about it. He then angrily/sarcastically apologized saying \"I'm sorry that something I said affected you when it shouldn't have and that your reaction wasn't what I expected\". I was pretty upset about that, but I didn't see any way to help the situation so I just said \"okay\" and vowed never to express how I feel again. \n\nTldr am I the asshole for expressing how I felt hurt towards the person who did the hurting (unintentional but still hurt), which then made them feel somehow worse?",

We have 2 dogs and a lizard (In my opinion the lizard is important). \n\nNow to the meat and potatoes. My sister has a dog named Oscar. We got him last summer. When my sister wanted a dog my parents said sure and she got a dog in a matter of days without doing any research whatsoever. She promised to care for it and refused to, doing so means I have to do most of the work. No one else in the family wanted another dog except her. The dog is barely housebroken and has knocked me down multiple times. Her solution...  put him in his crate only making him more crazy. He attacks me and everyone in my family  (Including her) and she thinks heâs (In her words, not mine) adorable!\n\nLast year I wanted a pet lizard. Iâve been doing research for months on the this species of lizard, even memorizing its scientific name. When I asked my parents explaining everything and telling them what Iâve been doing they told me I had to do more chores and get better grades. I became a A student (Somehow) and did the dishes cleaned all the rooms in the house and walked the other dog (Who is very well behaved) and my sisterâs dog. I received Ringo in a 2 months. [Hereâs ](https://imgur.com/gallery/p5luq1N) a shit quality picture.\n\nMy sisters dog urinates and defecates a lot in the house do to her refusal to walk him or even take him outside. Whenever I try to motivate her to take him outside she bursts into tears and says Iâm calling her fat getting me in trouble.\n\nItâs frustrating and annoying. I tell my parents about the issue and they agree with me however  they refuse to do anything about it. I donât like making her cry and every time she does it makes me feel horrible about my self. \n\nSo Reddit AITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for leaving kitchen supplies in my dorm and asking my roommates for the money?",
      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom\n\nSo I lived in a four person apartment this past fall semester (two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom).  Before school started I made a google doc to sort out who would buy what so everyone would pay around the same cost.  I ended up buying the majority of the kitchen supplies; you know, a decent nonstick pot/pan set, a colander, silverware, cooking utensils, etc. \n\nMy roommate Miranda didn't really respect my space but I put up with it.  Pretty early on into the semester my roommate's boyfriend named Tom moved into our room.  She told me that the first time they had sex was in my bed, but not to worry because they did it on top of my covers.  I ended up moving into my boyfriend's room because it was too much to bear (plus Tom snored).  My boyfriend lived in a single room, so I kept most of my things at my apartment.  After my moving, I found Miranda sleeping in my bed multiple times after coming back to the room to get some of my things.  Some of my things went missing mysteriously.  I was just really annoyed at this point and was happy to not be living there.\n\nI knew at the beginning of the semester that I was applying to go abroad this spring semester and was accepted a little bit before our Thanksgiving break.  When we came back, I texted everyone that I was going to be packing up everything they didn't want, and that they should sort through the things I bought because I would sell it back to them.  The price before taxes was $149, but since everything was used (predominantly by Miranda) I would take 20% off (which I thought was fair).\n\nFast forwarding to the end of finals, I reminded everyone again but never heard back.  One of the girls in the other room was moving out.  The plan was that Tom would move into my room, and the boyfriend (Matt) of the girl in the other room (Stacey)  would move in as well.  Stacey mentioned she was thinking about buying a new set of pots and pans, but never gave me a definitive answer.\n\nMy brother came to help me pack everything up.  He noticed that all of the kitchen utensils were dirty and a lot of the pots and pans were scratched (since they're nonstick, they were kind of ruined).  I thought it was unfair that they left everything in the condition they were in.  We were pressed for time because we had to fly back home, and also felt it wasn't fair we had to clean kitchen utensils I barely even used.  I texted Miranda and she seemed okay with me leaving everything.  I then texted Matt, Stacey, and Tom in a group chat saying I would leave everything expecting them to venmo me back by the start of this semester.  I thought I would be doing them a favor by saving them a trip to the store to buy everything again.  I also thought that I would be giving them the best price considering the fact that I tried to buy the cheapest appliances I could find in Bed Bath and Beyond, and I would be selling it to them at a discount.  I was additionally under the impression that we were going to room together again our junior year next year (which is still the plan to my knowledge), so by selling it to them we wouldn't have two of everything.  Apparently I was really wrong to put my faith in these people.\n\nTwo days before the semester I texted everyone another reminder.  Miranda even said that they'd be splitting the cost of everything.  A day into the semester Stacey said that Matt bought a new pot/pan set and that they just wanted to give everything back to my boyfriend saying, \"You kinda did just leave it here when we said we were gonna get other shit, so your boyfriend can just get it back to you.\"  I then tried to explain that no one communicated their plans to me, so I left everything in good faith to try to save them an extra expense and trip.\n\nMiranda then said that they tried to make it clear to me that they wanted me to take my things and that they found brand new appliances for way cheaper than I was selling it back to them for.  At this point I told them I would be open to negotiating a fair price so I wouldn't have to involve my boyfriend.  They told me they didn't want two of everything and to tell my boyfriend to take it all.  I listed out everything he would take, and then Miranda said it would be helpful to keep the silverware (Oneida 20 piece set for $35 originally) and these bamboo cooking utensils ($10 from walmart).  I asked them to get back to me in a week.  When I didn't hear back I reached out two weeks later to confirm what my boyfriend would take.  He ended up taking everything but those two items for me.\n\nSo everything I left totaled to $43 but I asked the four of them for $7.50 each. They also said that the \"set wasn't complete\" and that there were mismatching spoons/knives/forks (probably due to the fact that they brought a few of their own and some silverware from frat houses ended up in our apartment).  They then said that they found cheaper silverware for $18 and that I should've made the price I was asking for clear before they decided to keep the silverware because \"it's ridiculous to pay that much for used and incomplete sets\".  I said I felt disrespected because nothing was clear to me and this is becoming a hassle for my boyfriend.  They said it was my fault for leaving my property in the apartment.  Stacey said that Matt would bring the remaining things up to my boyfriend.  Tom said he would even personally pay to ship it to me (pay for shipping *and* new silverware?) and to stop making a big deal.\n\nMatt never did.  So when my boyfriend went to pick everything up a week later, they said it was still dirty and to come back another day.  So they are continuing to use my things even though they have all brand new appliances which confuses me.  My boyfriend is going back tomorrow, and I hope that for all of the trouble they at least give me matching silverware because Bed Bath and Beyond (and Oneida!) definitely don't sell mismatching sets of silverware.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for asking for this money back?  Were my intentions unclear?  Did I make a big deal out of everything? Were my roommates clearer than I interpreted?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I did not return for spring semester and left my kitchen appliances in my apartment thinking I would be saving my roommates money and time.  I thought they would pay me back the discounted rate but they ended up buying all new appliances and made my boyfriend take numerous trips to the apartment to pick everything up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I'm at my sister's house for a few weeks. My sister is a single mom to two kids and there are always visitors or other family/friends coming and going. It's a kind of like a revolving door around here. I noticed that she can't really handle all of the cleaning as the house is quite large and there are always people around so we discussed and she told me to hire a cleaning service. No problem.\nI got a few recommendations, narrowed down the choice to a single company, and called them up. Now, we have a lot of expensive items in the house, family heirlooms and jointly owned property, but also personal effects. So, when the man on the phone asked if there were any specific instructions for him to include on the work order, I gave him a list of our instructions and then told him to add that we have many cameras inside the house for security reasons.\nHe was pissed - offended that I would even insinuate that anyone in his company would steal... I wasn't expecting that reaction but basically told him that it's not outside the realm of possibility so I'd like him to include it or I'll hire a different company. My sister told me I was a dick and could have handled it better but generally agreed with my feelings. What do you think? ",

      "description": "This will still be super long, I tried to stick to the most important parts butttt....\n\nLong story short, a coworker and very good friend of mine for several years got divorced several years ago. He always had a hard time with his money and started getting mixed up with some bad girlfriends. Nothing too bad at first, just very unhealthy relationships such as he would chase after girls for months at a time while the girl bounced between him and their baby daddy. \n\nThis goes on for over a year, all the while I stay as supportive as possible while also trying to be a bro and tell him to stop falling for these chicks. His money situation starts getting worse and worse. Hes months behind on bills but would spend his tax return on a 50\" TV because \"he needed a new one\". Whatever, I can deal with this I just tell him I think hes an idiot. \n\nNow hes with a girl who he moves her and her two kids in. She has a drug history. She relapsed and moves in and out for about a year. It gets to the point where he is paying all of her bills and living expenses. Long story short again, he calls me one night after being bailed out of jail. His story is that he went to his girlfriends \"aunt\"s house to get her some cold medicine, went in the wrong house on accident, they called the cops and he got pulled over later and arrested because he met the description. Now I read the police report because I didnt believe him. \n\nHe went to a known drug house, he did go into the wrong address and almost got shot, got arrested on a felony drug charge, and then lied about it. He also had a large amount of cash on him. He was asked to resign from his job while under investigation. We all knew he wouldn't get his job back. After reading the report and talking to the city manager, he also lied to her about the story. \n\nI should mention, we both work in public safety and I had recently gotten my dream, full time job. After all of this went down, I immediately cut him off. I did not want to be involved in this in any way. I didnt want to risk my job or the way people view me by this, especially on probation. I think I am the asshole for straight cutting him out of my life without warning, but between a fulltime job, fulltime school and the positive people in my life, I felt like I had to. After years of him not taking my advice or listening to me, I couldn't handle the stress of listening to him talk about his money and girlfriend situation 4 times a week whenever I saw him. \n\nAfter about 4 months of no interaction with him, I finally broke down and apologized. I told him I was sorry for ignoring him but I had to focus on myself. What made me feel like less of an asshole was his response. He said stuff along the lines of \"shows you who is really your friend\" and \"I needed you to back me so I could get my job back\". Like sorry man, I had your back through the tough times and YOU never listened, it was always about you. I cant put my career at risk for literally LYING about your past. ",

This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. \n\nRecently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and weâd already done our grocery shopping. My wife said sheâd figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that sheâs gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong. \n\nThe next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said âoh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons.â Then she showed a few to me. \n\nThey were those âEarn 0.07$ a gallonâ receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. \n\nI was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didnât use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. \n\nIâm so disgusted guys. I canât believe she did this. I donât even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says Iâm an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead.

      "description": "So some back round info, I am a 15 year old boy and every Sunday Me and the rest of my family goes to Sunday dinner at my grandma's house. I commonly bring my Nintendo switch because I usually prefer video games over socialization with my family. I had spent the entirety of 2017 working and saving to finally get a Nintendo switch with MY own money, so I was proud and protective over it, I would still offer to let my sister or any of my cousins use it but anyone too young or I didn't trust would get shut down. There were about 10 people in total at dinner but only a few are important to this story.\n\nIt being Superbowl Sunday it was pretty hectic with half of the adults watching the game to, well, watch football, and the other half were only paying attention to the score in hope that they could make a quick buck off of the Super bowl pole. We begin to pack up around half way through the last quarter and I'm called into the kitchen to help with dishes. I come back to my baby brother ( 2 and a half years old) on the floor with my Nintendo switch aggressively mashing buttons. Everyone in the living room was watching him pretty much breaking my $300 system as he waves it around like a piece of paper. They're all laughing about it thinking it so funny that he was trying play. Out of instinct I run over and grab it out of his hands, he cries of coarse and almost everyone yells at me and looks at me with the devils stare.\n \" Oh come on he wasn't hurting anything\" \n I am now getting scolded by my mother because I \" Need to learn to share better\"\n\n:BTW I help the most out all of me and my siblings and have no problem sharing anything to anyone as long as I get it back in the same working condition.\n\nAt this point we are both pretty much yelling at the top of our lungs to just get a word out in this stupid to begin with argument. The only only person who understood me was my grandma, she saw my side and how hard I worked,( I would always come to her house after work and pay her a visit) \nThe argument ended with both of us so aggravated with each other that I ended up staying at my grandma's house for the night and the rest of my family went home. My grandma doesn't live far from my school so i plan on walking in the morning. Turns out he badly cracked the right Joycon ( if you don't know what that is look it up) and it needs to be replaced, so I will either have to convince my suborn mom that I don't need to share my $300 gaming system with a destructive 2 year old and she should pay for what she let him do or will have to come up with another $40 to get a working right red joycon.\n\nI'm currently in my grandma's spare bedroom writing this for you, the people of Reddit to decide. Am I The Asshole?\n\nTL;DR Baby brother breaks my Nintendo switch and my mom thinks i'm the asshole for not letting him use it when this exact situation proves why i don't want him to use it.",

      "description": "Breaking out the throw away for this one. \n\n\nLife happened and we were forced to move. Luckily, I had family willing to help. I buckled down and had a job in the new area immediately. It's part time, barely above minimum wage, but it's enough to pay the bills. That's the short of it, really. We moved, I put on my big girl panties and got work. That was three months ago. \n\n\nIn that time my husband hasn't found a job, but he says he'd rather finish his degree than work. I get it, I support it, he makes money doing that. It would fulfill my need for financial stability, while fulfilling his desire to get his degree. Because it'll make him happy, and help me not stress about money, I 100% support the choice. \n\n\n*But*, he hasn't even enrolled in an local colleges. He hasn't started the process of transferring credits. He hasn't ordered his official transcripts for his own record. \n\n\nNow, get does stay at home with our toddler. That a tough job, I get it. Kids can be frustrating and keep you busy, I'm not depreciating the effort he gives to this family. She's starting preschool soon, soon he won't *have* to watch her all day, and at this rate he won't be able to start until the winter semester. (She starts preschool in April, so spring semester won't happen, and that's ok. He won't be able to for summer because he'll be transferring his credits and everything then. Fall semester won't happen because it'll take a month or so after he's enrolled for his financial aid stuff to go through.) \n\n\nI would personally have no issues with him being a SAHD if I made the money to support us. But I don't. \n\n\nI don't know, it just irritates me that he says there is no time to try, but he somehow always finds time for YouTube or Reddit. 50% chance he'll find this. \n\n\nI even made all the calls for him, found the right numbers and names for him, all he had to do was enroll for one college, then call the other and initiate the credit transfer, so that he'll be a \"student\" and ready to take classes as soon as our kid gets into preschool. That's maybe an hour to an hour and a half out of his day. He doesn't have time for that, but has time for hour long YouTube videos? \n\n\nI don't know. Am I the asshole for being mad? This is literally the only thing we argue about. Financial struggles are the largest cause of my anxiety, he knows this. I'm just asking for help. He used to do online classes, and I support that, I support if he goes in for classes. School used to be the most important thing to him, and I support his choices, except when they weigh us down.\n\n\n\nI want him to be happy, but not at the expense of my mental health. I get, like, $200 a week, guys. $300 if I've gotten decent hours. I live in a larger city, rent is $1500 for a studio apartment. I haven't been able to afford even a haircut because all my money goes to bills. \n\n\nWhat happened to my husband? What happened to his drive? Am I the asshole? Am I asking too much? I'm asking here because I need to know if I'm being unfair, and some advice (whether I'm the asshole or not) that isn't just \"leave him\". ",

      "description": "So the story is, I live in student housing with about 10 other people. The thing I would be ratting out the roommate for is that the landlord doesnât know he lives there. There are two landlords; a mother and a daughter. The mother knows and the daughter doesnât, and sheâs batshit.\n\nRecently, the roommate has been refusing to let the heat be on. My house has been cold for weeks and Iâm sick, and not getting any better. He doesnât care. In my perspective, I am uncomfortable living in this house because of his refusal to let the heat be on. He doesnât care. He removed the batteries from the thermostat so that nobody could use it.\n\nNow, the other roommates donât care that the heat is off. So Iâm on my own in this. I tried to compromise and ask that the heat be set to 65, a very negligible temperature and itâs just comfortable enough that I donât have to blast a space heater in my room all the time and raise the bill even more. He wonât compromise. Heâs simply telling me to wear a sweater. The temp goes down to 60 or lower at night.\n\nSo this thought of ratting out the roommate is a hypothetical. I havenât done it yet, but Iâm thinking about doing it so that I can be comfortable living here again. Without any moral guidance, I would stand by my actions but I would receive backlash from my other roommates because no one would want me to do this. Also, the person heâs splitting the rent with in his room would also most likely be kicked out. Heâs fully supported by his parents so Iâm not worried about him. If I donât do this, I will continue to be regularly confrontational with him and be even more of an asshole to him, and honestly I donât want to put either one of us or the other roommates through that. The alternative is just to be cold when Iâm out of my room. So I donât want to be out of my room.\n\nAlso if I do this, I might be able to go about it in a way that they canât prove that Iâm responsible, if I can collude with the younger landlord to âcatchâ him, which would be shady on my part in my efforts not to seem responsible for my own actions. It would also be in the best interests of my shady ass landlord who doesnât know he lives here. Should I be honest at my own expense?\n\nI would be screwing people over for my own benefit, so AITA?",

      "description": "Me (25F) and this guy (26F) have been good friends since some 10 years. And it has been a while since i have been noticing how self obsessed he is. Like the time we met, he kept showing me old videos of him and his friends dancing to some 1D and type songs. Then i didnt really notice it tbh. I was bored but maybe i wasnt showing it much. \n\nWhenever we talk, somehow the conversation just becomes about him. Like i could be sharing something about me and he would turn the conversation to himself within the same context. He also shares multiple pictures of himself, cant blame him here because it was my duty to ask him to stop or just say that i am bored. \n\nHe also spends a lot of time going through his old pics, i never understood why. He would send me his old pics (i stopped entertaining him then and would just comment something unrelated to his looks) \n\nSo we were chatting in the afternoon and he kept doing that thing he does where the conversation shifts to himself and i lost my patience so i stopped responding. And then when i opened the chat at night i see he had sent some old video that he already posted on insta and the conversation went something like this; \n\nH: the view was nice and look at my poses lol\nM: you are unbelievable\nH: ð¤£ð¤£\nM: i mean you are unbelievably self obsessed \nH: what? Maybe i am because it makes me happy\nM: humble yourself, child. (I was trying to lighten the mood here) Also that thing you said about it making you happy makes no sense.\nH: i am humble\nM: ???? Really? A humble person thinks more about other people than themselves \nH: but.. wait.. maybe i need to think this over\n\nI feel bad but i also feel maybe as a friend i need to tell him about his ways because I sincerely believe in self-growth. We are adults after all and need to care less about superficial stuff like how one looks and more about character. \n",

      "description": "My husband (late 30s) has a younger sister (mid 30s) that he has had a strained relationship with the past 10 years or so.  I wonât go into the why but they only text each other 2 or 3 times a year and they havenât seen each other in over a year.  I havenât spoken to her in 10 years and she has never met our kids.  The sister and her family live 10 minutes away.\n\nWhen we went to my ILs for Christmas (separate from the sister) we saw that my husband had a gift from her.  No gifts for me or my kids, just my husband.  She hasnât gotten him a Christmas gift in years.  My husband is Asian and his family is into the Chinese Zodiac/animal signs.  My husbandâs animal is a rooster.  He opens the gift and itâs a Hei Hei the chicken toy from Moana.  Okayâ¦\n\nThe chicken has a little button on his wing so my husband pushes it and the most obnoxious, loud Hei Hei scream comes out of the chicken.  If you have kids, you know how much parents HATE loud, obnoxious toys.  I think it was a bitchy, passive aggressive move by his sister because she has kids too and she has to know how annoying it is.  Google âScreaming Hei Hei Plushâ if youâre curious.\n\nI shoot him a death glare that basically says âWTF was your sister thinking?â  I could tell he felt the same way but at that point my kids were going absolutely bananas over it as they both love Moana.  They kept pushing the button over and over and all of my ILs thought it was hilarious.  We ended up taking the stupid thing home and I shoved it in the closet under our stairs once the kids were asleep.  I know the local Target carries it because we saw it there a week or two later and thatâs probably where his sister bought it.\n\nI casually asked DH what he wanted to do with it and he said to leave it where it is for now and maybe weâll give it away as a gift (yeah right) or let the kids play with it occasionally.  Heâs very wishy washy when it comes to making firm decisions, especially when itâs something he doesnât deem as really important so I wasnât surprised at this reaction.  I said âOr maybe we could return it to Target.â  He said âmaybeâ and he sort of shrugged it off.  He rarely goes into the closet and the chicken is inside a box as well.  I doubt heâll notice that the chicken is even gone if I do return it.  He might even forget about it at some point if it just disappears.\n\nLike I said above, I feel like this was a passive aggressive gift.  I donât see it as an olive branch considering their current relationship, or lack thereof, hasnât changed.  She didnât reach out before or after Christmas if her intent was to patch things up.  I fear my husband will drag his feet and Iâll never get rid of this thing and itâll just haunt my closet for the next decade.  Or worse, I worry that my kids will spot it and start playing with it 24/7.\n\nWIBTA if I returned the gift without asking?",

      "description": "Last year in November about a month into things we had an argument and didnât speak for a few days and apparently during those two days she sent nudes to and arranged to sleep with a friend sheâd known a while and also flirted with another guy as well, as far as Iâm aware she didnât go through with it as we patched things up a few days after the argument as she wanted to see me for my birthday the next week. Fast forward to this week, things arenât going well between us again as we are constantly arguing and I find out through a friend that sheâs planning on seeing the guy this weekend that she planned to sleep with in her words to for a âre-scheduleâ of what they were going to do in November which was apparently the cinema but has been changed to just hanging out at his...\n\nyesterday a friend sent me screenshots of some of the messages between my girlfriends friend  and her that she got sent at the time which is how I found out about it all. After a huge argument about it all which pretty much ended things entirely I feel like an asshole because she apparently never intended to go through with sleeping with him and we both said some pretty harsh things in the argument that followed.\n\n",

      "description": " \n\nSo.. My parents make fun of me about almost anything they can. \"You're too skinny\", \"You're so pale\", \"What? You're up before 11 AM? Cleaned your room? Who are you and what did you do to our daughter?\", and always just laughing. I know most of those aren't bad and I should just ignore them. But those aren't all the things they say, just the ones that come to my mind right now. And hearing all that and more almost every day just.. Isn't fun. I'm already super insecure and not feeling well mentally. (So overly dramatic, but english isn't my first language. Plus can't say I have any specific mental illness since I haven't been diagnosed with anything, so that's the best way I can think of saying that) Also, they say those things to relatives and their friends. Escpecially if I have failed at something or done something embarassing.\n\nBut the worst one to me is when I tried to tell them about the panick attacks I kept having for no reason or the smallest reasons possible (and still do, just not as often). They started making jokes about it before I could even finish and started laughing. I walked off to my room and I heard my mom say \"What? You can't get mad over that, we're just kidding!\". Later they both apologized. My mom's apology went like this,  word for word: \"Sorry, we forgot how sensitive you are\". I did just forgive them and tried to move on, but just get it out of my head.\n\nAm I just overly sensitive like they always say and an asshole?",

Also letting \"only one more person\" join after saying NO MORE PEOPLE can come leads to people saying \"you already let one more person join just make it only two\" and so on... both girls who asked me to invite this one girl got a \"no\" and although they didn't response aggressively I can tell they are pissed at me.

      "description": "I was at Costco with my SO the other day, and as is Costco tradition the lineups were long. Probably 10 or so people waiting at each till, but the lines were moving so it was probably only a 10 minute wait. \n\nMy SO decided to go stand in line by herself, asking me to go grab the last few items by myself, and then bring the cart up when I was done. It didn't click with me at the time what her plan was, I figured that she just needed to run to the bathroom or something.\n\nSo I get to the tills, and I see her way up at the front, 2 back from the front of the line. She motioned for me to come up and join her, but I didn't feel comfortable bringing in my fully loaded shopping cart in front of the other 8-10 people, so I took a spot at the back of the line.\n\nWhen we got out of the store, she was pretty livid  with me. Basically we were doing a \"quick\" Costco run, making a simple dinner and then she had plans to go out with her friends in a few hours. Her argument revolved around me wasting her time by not bumping into the line beside her and making her late for her night out. It wasn't a special event or anything, just a normal girl's night, so what's the big deal if she's 5-10 minutes late? Funilly enough, this devolved into a big fight about how her time is valuable, and I'm more than welcome to waste my own time but not hers, which ended with me leaving before dinner, giving her a full hour of free time that wasn't in her original plan.\n\nI'm of the idea that it would have been rude to bring in a full shopping cart in front of all those people - I would be pissed if someone did that to me. I do see her point that she was feeling pressed for time, but is 10 minutes worth that? \n\nYou tell me Reddit, am I the asshole here?",

I wanted to shoot my shot and I figured even if he has a girlfriend or something I still need to make friends since I'm in my first year. \n\nA few hours later I get a text from an unknown number:\n\n*\"aha subtle ;)\"*\n\nI was hyped so I responded \n\n*\"srry lol im not a very subtle person ;) \"*\n\n*\"what's ur name?\"* \n\nthen instead of telling me his name he said \n\n*\"you should have just given me your dorm room number ;)\"*\n\nI don't know whether it just escalated too quickly or if it was because he didn't just tell me his name but I got a little scared. I sent another somewhat neutral lol funny text and he responded nicely but still didn't tell me his name. I just got really bad vibes because for whatever reason he wasn't telling me his name and I started to wonder if someone else picked up the note or what. I lead him on by leaving my number so I feel like I shouldn't judge him for a flirtatious response. I kind of ghosted him and haven't said anything back. Him being so direct, being a bit older, and beating around the bush about his name just made me kinda scared. Am I an asshole for feeling creeped out and not wanting to text him back? Is he just being funny and flirty and I'm jumping to conclusions? Am I the asshole for leading him on then ghosting him? I feel really bad and I probably shouldn't have shot the shot if I wasn't ready for a bullet I guess. \n\nTLDR: Gave a guy my number and he texted me *\"you should have just given me your dorm room number ;)\"* and didn't tell me his name. I wasn't ready for such a direct flirt and got bad vibes so I ghosted him... AITA?",

      "description": "Let me start off by saying I am a security guard and lately Iâve been working weird hours. Mondayâs noon to midnight, Wednesdayâs midnight to eight am, and Saturdayâs midnight to noon. My wifeâs grandmother got really bad a couple days after Thanksgiving falling and hurting herself and basically immobilized. She was then taken to the hospital. With this schedule I was able to go visit her three times over three weeks each being a Sunday. Since I work nights a couple days it made it very hard to go since the hospital is over an hour away. Anyway last week I switched shifts to go to my wifeâs graduation from college with her masters on Friday night. Then that Saturday morning at ten we got the call her grandmother passed away. It was to be expected but inside Iâm hurt and I feel my wife is too. She hasnât cried or showed much emotion the past two days. She started a new job today one Iâm joining her at next month. She doesnât handle change or stress easily and these are two major events back to back. So I called my boss today told her the viewing and funeral is Thursday and Friday this week. I asked for Saturday off and I told my boss that I couldnât really switch anyone since the times of the viewing and the time of the funeral wouldnât work with my twelve hour schedules. So Iâm losing 12 hours of pay. Iâm fine with it we havenât grieved and I think her, her parents, and her grandfather will need any help they can have. My wife isnât thrilled with me taking the day off and losing the pay. I honestly think she is going to need me. Sheâs worried about money which I understand but I know her and Iâm genuinely worried about her. I feel bad for abandoning work but I really think I should be home for my family. ",

      "description": "A few years ago, my sister-in-law committed suicide in a drug-fueled depression. Her husband, my husband's brother, was understandably devastated, but completely collapsed. For three months he completely neglected his five-year-old daughter, our niece. Since we lived in a different state, we were not made privy to the situation until we received a call from Child Services. We were told, essentially, come get the child or she goes into foster care. (that's the tl;dr version, but you get the gist.)  The other relatives who lived near them were unable to care for the child as they had recent drug arrests.  \n\n  \n\nMy husband and I have no children, and we knew it was going to be a major change to our lives. I quit my job to take care of her full time and discovered that, at the age of five, she did not know her alphabet or how to count to five. She and I worked the entire summer learning these things, among others. I tried to make it as fun for her as possible so that she wouldn't feel like anything was a chore. We also had to begin discipline with her, as she had always got her way and never had to do anything she didn't want to, including getting up from watching TV to go to the bathroom. We persevered and she made incredible strides.  She missed her parents horribly, of course, but despite having custody, we would encourage her to call her father every day to help him with his recovery.\n\n  \n\nSix months later, the day before Thanksgiving, he called us from a grocery store parking lot and told us he had driven to our state, that he was homeless, and he couldn't handle not being near her any longer. It was then I found out that as a condition of being granted custody of her, so that we could actually take care of her legally, my husband allowed my brother-in-law to keep all of the social security money for her mother's death. I had to suck it all up and shut up.  \n\n  \n\nOver the last few years, he has improved, but he does not pay for anything towards her care, is allowed to take her twice a week, and has never said thank you. He has never offered to do anything other than purchase four bottles of wine in the last three years. To be fair, however, my niece is ecstatic that he is in her life, as she should be. However, every time she comes home, she's a bear as he sets no boundaries and allows her to do whatever she wants. In short, we have to deprogram her after every visit, resetting routine and disciplining to understand responsibility and expectation.  \n\n  \n\nI want him to go away. Far away. He is constantly undermining us, even though he isn't self-aware enough to notice. For awhile, I had fantasized about calling the Social Security Administration to report his fraud. But honestly, it would cause more trouble and complexity in our lives than what we already have as my husband is adamant this be allowed to proceed.  \n\n  \n\nI admit that the money is a very small reason about this post. It's tight most months, but we make it work and make sure she has everything she needs, and a few things she wants. But it's the struggle with him to be on board with our plans for her. We want her to be successful, independent, thoughtful, and educated. He cares about none of that as long as he spends time with her. I know him being here helps her continued healing from losing her mother. I already know her father is TA, but AITA for wishing he'd just go away?",

      "description": "So a few years ago I was renting this place with this dude and we were on a lease. When the lease was nearing it's end he just peaced out. We're talking took most of everything leaving only the last bit of his half of rent and a few things he said in a note he didn't want to bring with him.\n\nThing with where I live is that if you don't discard of things on your own when you move out the landlord can pay to have someone remove the stuff. We're talking cases of dudes having $250 taken off their deposit just for some dude to take 3 milk crates of things to the dump. It's a rip off. I texted and emailed him for 2 weeks asking to pick these things up or take them to the dump but he never responded.\n\nSo I took most of his things to the dump but he also had around 60 video games for PS4. So I figured I'd sell them. There is a local game store where they buy used games and they gave me $600 for all of his games.\n\nWell cut to last week and I was at a party he was at and we were polite. He then asks how the move out was and I said good, and naturally he asked what I did with his stuff. He got mad when he found out I sold his games but I told him that I tried to get him to grab these things but he never reached out.\n\nHe's now calling me an asshole and asking me to pay him back. I checked and legally there's nothing there but now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for doing this.",

      "description": "My friend actually told me about this subreddit when I was asking her this question, so thatâs how I discovered reddit and this subreddit. Anyway...\n\nSo my sister, Iâll call her E, is super embarrassing and basically does little things, not intentionally, to piss me off. Sheâs just really stupid. Iâd baked cookies the night before for me and my friends, because Iâd planned for my friends to come over that day. And the morning after I made the cookies, me and E got into this argument because she didnât go to the store the day before like Iâd asked her to. And then my boyfriend started telling me how I was overreacting and being more angry than I should, do then I turned on him and we started arguing. \n\nWhile we were busy doing that, E had found my cookies and started feeding them to some ducks outside. (We live by a small pond so ducks will come by occasionally) I didnât notice her take the cookies, but my boyfriend told me she did by the time it was too late, and my cookies were all broken up on the ground. I was really pissed about this, and this was the final straw for me. \n\nIt was only about 10 in the morning and sheâd already pissed me off so much. So then I told her she could help me make new cookies. I asked her to go in the hall closet to get me something, and while she was in there, I locked her in. I was able to convince her that the lock had slipped and then jammed so I wasnât able to open the door. \n\nSheâd fallen asleep in there because it was completely silent by the time my friends had come over. E is so embarrassing in front of my friends anyway. Sheâs just so weird and childish, and they think so too. My friends didnât even know I have a sister because theyâd never met her before and Iâd never told them about her. This was their first time at my house with E there. \n\nAnd so when E woke up and asked if Iâd found a way to unlock the door, I told my friends that she mustâve been a crazy intruder whoâd snuck into my house at some point. One of my brave friends grabbed a knife and swung the door open. She didnât hurt E, but instead let her explain. E had heard what Iâd said about her being some random stranger, and was upset when she realized I locked her in there on purpose. She yelled at me and accused me of being ashamed to be her sister. \n\nOkay first of all, E didnât go to the store like Iâd asked. She had one damn job. Secondly, she took the cookies Iâd worked hard baking the night before and fed them to the ducks, and then sheâs also just super embarrassing and wouldâve annoyed me and my friends had I not locked her in the closet. So AITA, or is E just making a big fuss over this?",

I'm a teenager and I know that I don't know what's best for me and I love her but she's kinda strict and easily gets hurt feelings.\n\nToday she had taken me to a  games and hobbies store so I can spend some of my money on Vanguard cards with my girlfriend. \n\nSo I was sorting the cards I had gotten on the floor of the living room in alphabetical order into card books while listening to a Reddit YouTuber and my mother came up to me and said \"this is so Candice\"(our fat beagle). \n\nI put up a finger and say \"give me a second this story seems to be wrapping up.\"which it had seemed to be, but every time the post seemed to come to an end there was more text. \n\nAfter about 2-3 minutes of it droning on I realised it wasn't stopping anytime soon so I paused it and looked up. The photo Mom had wanted to show me was simply a dog with their face pushed against someone's leg titled \"pizza, I like pizza!\" \n\nNow I didn't find this particularly funny so I tried to force a small smile and give that exhale that means 'i find it funny but not enough to laugh' to try to make her happy. That did not work\n\nShe didn't see the smile and began to rant about 'see this is why I feel like a burden when I talk to you!' (an issue we had in the past, which is why I tried to react to the post, even if I didn't find it funny) and started talking about all the stuff she's done for me today, with taking me to the store, allowing my GF to come over and taking my GF home. \n\nI tried to explain but she was convinced that she knows psychology enough after one semester of it that she knows why I act like I do. Then after that she turns to yell at my brother for stuff. \n\nThe only thing I really feel in the wrong about is getting her mad because she wouldn't yell at him if I had just forced a laugh.

      "description": "A little background first: I'm currently a senior at a 4 year university in America. All of my friends I would have been comfortable sharing an apartment with graduated last year so I was forced to spin the wheel on random \"matched\" roommates at an off campus apartment complex. I thought it didn't be too bad, everyone has their own rooms and I had to share a bathroom with one person. Two of my roommates are amazing people and now are friends of mine, we haven't argued once and I would room with them again if I had to spend another year here. The problem lies with my other (now ex) roomate. I'll call him Dan for anonymity's sake. \n\nVery early on we realized something was \"off\" about Dan, he never looked us in our eyes and wouldn't reply when we spoke to him. This didnt bother any of us because a quiet roommate who keeps to himself isn't really an issue, we weren't going to force him to be our friend. We soon learned he has aspergers through an email sent to us by the leasing office in early September, he apparently hadn't spoken to his parents in a month and they were worried he was still alive and well (he was).\n\nNow the problem with Dan started the second time I had my girlfriend over. He started yelling at me without warning that he didn't want to hear us having sex in my room. I told him I would play music or something and try to keep quiet but he just told me to never have a girl over ever again. Because my girlfriend has to commute to school and lives with her parents my place is the only option we basically just ignored his complaints and attempted to be silent/ do it when he was gone. That was until this past weekend. Dan apparently heard us (in the middle of the afternoon) and cut me off between our bathroom and my bedroom where my girlfriend was and attempted to fight me. I ended up talking him down from being physical but not before he threatened to \"cut my head off and castrate (my) girlfriend.\" My roommate's heard all of this and we filed a police report asking for a restraining order and just yesterday we got it filled and he is in the process of being evicted. I feel kind of bad because its only one week until finals and he has nowhere to go but I definitely feel much more safe in my apartment. AITA for not waiting or for ignoring his complaints considering he's not completely normal?\n\nTl;dr: My ex-roomate threatened to kill me and my girlfriend for having sex in my own room. I got him evicted right before finals because of it.",

      "description": "My local Home Depot fixed and updated their parking lot a few months ago. Part of the work they did was rearranging the handicap spaces, making them more conveniently located. In every single new handicap spot there is a 7 foot pole with a \"reserved parking\" sign, in addition to the painted symbol in the space ([pics here](https://imgur.com/gallery/VEjUIPd)). \n\nThe old spots look as if there was a clear, albeit very poor, attempt to grind off the old painted symbol. With the old spots they also left the old hatched space to give people room to get out of their cars, rather than redraw new lines. Because of this, I believe that shoppers often mistake the old spots for current handicap spaces and as a result the old spots are usually open.\n\nGiven all the information above, I normally park in the old handicap spaces because they're open, close to the door, and I am 100% certain that they're not meant to be current spaces.\n\nYou can probably see where this is going. I was at the store yesterday. Walking back to my car in the old handicap spot - obviously not being handicapped - a guy across the aisle says something to the effect of \"Try parking in a normal spot next time, a-hole.\" I've noticed someone staring one other time too. FWIW, the new spaces have never been full when I've parked there, so I've never denied an actual disabled person closeness to the door. AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for canceling a New Year's Eve event?",
      "description": "In the past few years I (m) have always gone to an event a friend (f) of mine organized on New Year's Eve. She's my best friend and we literally know each other since birth, even if we can't remember.  \nThis year I asked her again - about a week prior to the event - if there would be the usual party in an old school cellar/shooting range where we meet for drinks and to watch the fireworks at midnight. Only this time she told me that she and her sister wanted to meet up with some friends of theirs. She asked me to come along but also proposed that we should have me as the host for the party since I would always come to theirs and that way it would be fair. Since she was right on that department I accepted and asked who these friends were, if I knew them and how many there would be (the last question is important for later).  \n\n\nFrom that point onward everything went south.  \n\n\n(We live in a rural part of Germany, are in our early twenties and every conversation with her happened per *not-so* instant messenger.)  \nAt first she refused to tell me any details about her friends but I assume she just didn't think it would be a big deal for me. In later texts she revealed to me that I would know only one of them and that the other 3 would be strangers.  \nOK, cool cool cool cool cool cool cool. I'm always up for meeting new people and having them in my house late at night under heavy alcohol influence while in possession of explosives and all christmas decorations still being up and waiting to be smashed to pieces...  \nI told her it would be crowded with 7 people, but that we'll make it work somehow.  \n\n\nI said I'd do it and she promised me that they are all nice people so what could go wrong (also that part about the christmas decorations will play a crucial part later in the story).  \n\n\nFast forward three days: Haven't heard about any further plans being made or me being involved into anything at all regarding the party *at my place*.  \nI decided to ask what type of drinks I should get and what we would eat. If our moms would make salads or whatever. Just to get back to that topic.  \n\n\n&gt;\"*We'll see. We haven't planned anything yet =)*\"  \n\n\nKeep in mind that it's Wednesday evening at that point and I only had 3 days left to go shopping for groceries.  \n\n\nFast forward another two days: I got sick of her not telling me anything and bought what I thought was generally expected to be there: Soft drinks, potato chips, vodka, JÃ¤germeister, beer and something to mix the vodka with.  \nI messaged her telling her that I bought all this stuff but also that my mom had set up some rules we had to follow, yadayadayada and if she and her friends had decided on what we would eat. She only jokingly mentioned that we could just order pizza and that we would probably starve because it would not arrive. So again, no information given.  \nShe also told me that we could drive to town later tomorrow to buy everything we need but that I had to wait for her since she was gonna get a new haircut first and it would take three hours (I really don't get how female haircuts work).  \nNo biggie, I was going to sleep until noon anyway.  \nAs I woke up (this noon, as promised) I asked if I could come pick her up at around 4pm to buy everything we needed for the party. She told me that she would need to help her mom cook first and that she would tell me when she was ready.  \nAt this point I was sick of her shit. I knew how this would end. I would be ready to go by 4pm and wait for her to text me, only for her to cancel the shopping at around 7pm. No, I wouldn't have that (again) and I told her that I would not wait for two hours for her to finish doing whatever she was going to do.  \nI assume she immediately went into full-conflict mode but managed to calm back down in time. She texted me - in a normal \"tone\" - that it would be best if we both go shopping on our own so we wouldn't have to wait for each other.  \n\n\nWell okay, but please tell me already: What. Are. We. Gonna. Eat?  \n\n\nAbout an hour later she was ready for the coup de grÃ¢ce and delivered it like it was a normal thing to say:\n\n&gt;  \n\"Well we rethought everything and don't want to be such a bother to your mom, so we just decided to go to \\[loud and crowded restaurant\\] instead.\"  \n\n\nGreat. Just great. Thanks for thinking about my mom, you're a saint.  \n\n\nMe to her: \"You can't be serious right now. I bought all this stuff and got the house ready for you to cancel everything? What am I going to tell my parents? 'Thanks for setting everything up and buying all that shit but the party is cancelled'??\"\n\n  \nAt that point I was furious. Not only did **she** decide that **I** would host the party, she also didn't involve me into **any** planning at all and then she cancelled it literally two days prior to New Year's Eve?  \n\n\nNow she entered her \"victim mode\".  \n\n\n&gt;\"*But I thought you didn't get anything yet. We would have had to talk about what we needed anyway, so we wouldn't end up having bought too much.*\"\n\n  \nThat was the point where I would have screamed into her face that I had been trying to plan all of this **for a whole week.**  \nI told her - again - what I had already bought and that nobody here would drink this stuff and it would just go bad. Not a big deal for her problem solving skills though: just mix everything and drink it prior to going to the restaurant.  \nYea right, we just drink alcohol planned for 7 people for a whole night in 5 Minutes. But wait, it gets better.  \n\n\nMy mom comes in and askes why I'm so furious. I explain to her the whole situation and she decides to call my friend's mother, since they are also very close. After ten minutes she tells me that my friend's mother had just decided that we would have the party at my place again, but with 8 guests. Remember the christmas decorations, including a whole tree? 7 people would have been crowded already. 9 people would have been three to many.  \n\n\nSo - still furious about the whole situation - I told her that I was done and I would cancel the event and wouldn't come to the restaurant with her and her friends either. There were going to be way to many people of which I would've known only 4, **myself included**, that got invited to a party I didn't want to host and I got literally **zero** information about up until this evening.  \n\n\nAll she replied was that she didn't get why I cancelled it, I **could have told her earlier so she could plan ahead**, that I had *no problem* with 7 people, why 9 would be such a big deal and that I should be more spontaneous and flexible.  \nShe also mentioned that I could have invited some friends of mine so that there were more people that I knew but at that point I think she didn't even process what she wrote because again:  \n\n\n7 people are already too many. I told you! Multiple times!!  \n\n\nThen she just told me she was sick of arguing and didn't text back.  \n\n\nI think she doesn't even get the irony behind her last texts. To me it was obvious that she was trying to salvage things because she is used to me doing whatever she want's (**had** a crush on her for a long time) but since I'm over her I won't deal with her shit anymore.  \nSo, am I the asshole for canceling the party and not coming to the shitty restaurant with her?",

      "description": "My SIL is having a hard time getting pregnant. It's been a year since she started trying and she has become angry and bitter that she isn't pregnant. \n\nShe openly admits to hating pregnant women now bc she isnt pregnant. \n\nSIL never liked my sister very much, but liked her even less when sister got pregnant. Now when my sister comes to visit my parents (SIL and my brother live with my parents) SIL avoids seeing her and goes to the basement in her room and cries. \n\nThings SIL has done to make baby talk uncomfortable:\n* tells my mom to not leave baby stuff where she can see it.\n* tells my mom she cant make baby blankets in the living room,  since seeing them upsets her.\n* closes the door to the spare bedroom bc she doesnt want to see the baby stuff in it. \n* is mean when she gets a baby shower invite or someone she knows gets pregnant. \n\nEtc.\n\nI get along with my SIL, even tho she is admittedly kind of a b*tch.  So when I found out I was pregnant, I was hesitant to tell her and my brother. \n\nA month ago I was visiting my parents and they (sil/bro)  asked me if I was pregnant. I panicked and said no. In truth I was 2 months. \n\n(Mom tells me later that after I tell them I'm not pregnant, bro and SIL talk about it and feel bad that I'm having a hard time getting pregnant too. They sympathize with me.)\n\nI felt bad lying but I didn't know how to tell them. I was sure if I told her she would cry and make a scene and not want anything to do with me anymore. \n\nThe next day I talked to my brother and told him I was pregnant and I was sorry for lying. I explained that I was worried about SIL and if she would hate me knowing I was pregnant. He said not to worry and he would talk to her. \n\nAfter talking to his wife, they decide they are mad at me for lying? \n\nSo today, a month after, I have another doc appt and come visit my parents. SIL walks into the house and I say hello, as usual. She walks right by me as if I were invisible and ignores me completely. She goes to the basement and I never see her again for the rest of the day.\n\nI realize I shouldn't have lied,  and I apologized and explained why I did so. But doesnt this prove my point? \n\nOr am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for considering leaving?",
      "description": "I am a 22 year old male, the youngest of 6. All of my siblings are 30+. I am the youngest by a large margin, and so my mother always went above and beyond to make sure that I had a better upbringing than my siblings did. I would argue that our relationship is of a very different nature than those she has with her other children.\n\nOnce my father passed away after my freshman year, my mother's mental health has rapidly deteriorated. She lost her job and began drinking heavily to drown her sorrows. She got another job, but then lost it soon after. She has been out of work for over a year now, with no intentions of going back. She is near retirement age so I really do not blame her for that.\n\nShe is now showing some signs of early onset dementia. I can't help but think it is related to her over consumption. She can remember things that happened 10 years ago, but not 10 minutes ago. She's becoming very frail both physically and mentally. She'll ask the same questions, and tell the same stories over and over again. I try to just listen and enjoy her company, but it is all very sad and hard for me to deal with. \n\nRecently things have gotten markedly worse. She goes out in her car and forgets where she is going, or how to get to the place she is meaning to go to. She went to the store last week, and on her way out spent 30 minutes trying to start and drive someone else's car, until the owner of the vehicle came out and told her that she was in the wrong car. During all of these events, she was 100% sober. \n\nWhen things like this happen, I am the very first person to hear about it. \"Did you hear what mom did? Moms losing her mind.\" This is all very stressful for me, because the people calling me (my siblings) know that there is nothing I can do about this right now. \n\nIt's as if my siblings expect me to graduate college, get a job in my hometown, and then live with my mom and take care of her for the rest of her life. I'm 22. I can hardly take care of myself, let alone my 59 year old mother who couldn't tell me what month or year it is. But after everything she has done for me, I couldn't say no if this was asked of me. \n\nThis is where my original question comes into play. Last summer I met someone really special while on an internship halfway across the country. I think I might be in love with this person. I could never ask them to move out here, for a number of reasons. A big part of me wants to move out there so we could be together. It would be a new experience for me. I feel like this is an opportunity that I should not be so quick to pass up.\n\nThe way I see it, my 5 older siblings are being selfish to put the burden of responsibility for caring for my mother solely on me. But another part of me says that I'm extremely selfish for even considering moving away at a time like this. I will be graduating in little over a month, at which point I will find myself at a fork in the road.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Background, I am on a semi-vacation/job hunt in California. We were given free tickets to a comedy show. It's not my first choice and since the show were before we wanted to go out I accepted.\nThe comedian is apparently somewhat famous but I've ever heard of him. Anyways he kicked off the show talking his friends Aziz Ansari and Louis CK. I was like whoa...bold move and I was seriously taken aback and pretty defensive.\n\n\n He told more jokes and I didn't laugh once. He then said somthing about \"#movement (auto mod didn't like this term ) has run its course!\" I couldn't help myself so I yelled out somthing like \"that subject is never funny.\" He stopped in his tracks and called for the door  men to walk me out and that he wasn't messing around because he was sick or something.\n\nThe manager met me outside and said that I was kicked out but he's comp our drinks which made me feel good until he started chewing me out like a little kid that stand up is an \"art\" and it's the \"height of asshole\" to heckle a set. He said I was on a two week ban. Really...ok.\n\n\nBut am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "My ex and I broke up a couple months ago, but we co-signed a lease and are living together until June. Itâs a two bedroom place so we are able to stay out of each others hair and do our own thing with little conflict. \nRight before Christmas my ex had his wallet and house keys stolen. I went out and got a spare made for him so that he wouldnât have any issues. Last night, he decided to go to the bar with friends. As he was leaving he told me that he wasnât sure where his replacement key was, and he didnât have time to look for it because his uber was here. He asked me to leave the door unlocked for him to come home. \nA little background here is necessary I think. We live in a mostly college student townhouse complex. There have been multiple car break ins, and theyâve gotten my car twice. They have to come within a couple feet of my front door in order to get to my car. I am pretty anal about locking the doors, especially since the break ins. It makes me uneasy knowing my front door is unlocked and people are walking right by the door and breaking into cars and stuff. However I agreed to leave the door unlocked to avoid conflict. \nThis morning I woke up at 5:30 to leave for work and he still wasnât home. I texted him that he knew I had work this morning and I was going to lock the door while I was gone and that our puppy had been out and was crated. I figured since he had found somewhere to stay the night he would be okay to stay there until 10 am when I got off of work and could let him inside the house. \nHe was FURIOUS. Texting me that I locked him out on purpose, that he went back home anyways knowing the door was locked and he was forced to sit outside in freezing cold weather waiting for me. He blamed me for upsetting the dog who could hear him but couldnât get to him, and that the whole neighborhood thinks Iâm âpsychoâ. Now heâs telling me that heâs got a fever and itâs my fault heâs sick since I locked him out. When I first did this I didnât think I was doing anything wrong. I didnât do it out of spite. I left the door unlocked all night and he decided not to come home. But now all his text messages and verbal abuse are making me second guess myself. Am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "I had no plans of going to the work X-Mas party.  I went 4 years in a row.  Then skipped last year.  And I know I should go, but i didn't plan on it.  There's always people missing for one reason or another.  My reason was because I didn't want to go.\n    \nIt's a small office of about 20-30 people.  4 of us work closely together outside most of the office.  I was pretty sure it was known that i wasn't going.  I mentioned it many times when discussing the office Christmas party.  Mostly among the 4 of us.  It was not a secret that I wasn't going.\n    \nYesterday, the day before the party, Lady1 and Lady2 were telling me I should go.  I reminded them,  I am not going.  They said the boss would be disappointed.  I said I know and I choose to miss this years party.  We discussed it for several minutes.  And that would be maybe the 5th time we discussed it and about the 12 time it was brought up in passing in just the last few weeks.\n\n     \nTonight the Xmas party was at 5 pm.\nAt 3pm Lady1 comes in and says, \"Marcusthegladiator, your not going to the Christmas party!!!????\"\n\nMe, \"Ummm No, I've been saying I am not going for weeks now.\"\n\n    \nLady 1, \"WHAT! The boss already payed for you he's going to be upset.\"\n    \nMe, \"I never said I was going.\"\n\nInterject Lady Number 2\n\nLady2, \"I asked you a month ago and you said you were going.  I put our names on the list. \n    \n(There's an RSVP list in a break-room I never go in because it's in a different office at the other end of the floor.)\"\n    \nMe, \"I never told you I was going, I was never going.  Why did you write my name??\"\n    \nLady2, \"I asked you a month ago and you said you were going.\"\n\n    \nThen we go back or forth for a minute with he said she said.\n    \nNow I'm thinking, OK so it's already a disappointment to the boss, now it can be an upset cause someone wrote my name on the RSVP and he paid for me.  I never asked anyone to write my name.  I never told anyone to write my name.  No one ever asked me if i wanted them to write my name.  No one ever told me they wrote my name.\n\nThe reason I have no desire to go is because little things like this are a daily occurrence.  And I feel like I am taking crazy pills often.  So I would rather NOT spend an extra evening dealing with it.\n\nNow am I the asshole for being upset with Lady1 and Lady2.\n\n    \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "**WARNING, LONG POST**\n\nI am American (20) and my boyfriend (20) lives abroad. In his country, he has to be fluent in English before he can start college. So currently, he is enrolled in a year of intensive English learning courses at his University before he formally starts his 4 year degree. Well at the beginning of the year, he asked me if I could do his online homework for him. Basically every textbook chapter has an online workbook chapter that needs to be done. So I agreed to do this mostly because 1. He doesn't have/can't afford a laptop and 2. He has an iPhone 5, so I thought that it would be really terrible if he had to use a small screen to try to do the online homework. Anyways, I'm obviously fluent in English so I thought it shouldn't take me as long. As I soon find out, it's a lot of tedious work, so each chapter usually takes me 1.5 hours. I am a biochemistry student that really does not have that kind of time to waste, but I made a promise so I decided I shouldn't complain. But, every time I did a chapter, I never even got a thank you. 0 acknowledgment. I would  just get a  heads  up about when the next chapter was due. So far, I've finished 12 chapters, which is literally the whole textbook.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case, fast forward to last week. This online workbook gives you unlimited tries on all question. After 2 tries on any question, you get to click a button \"see answer\" where it shows you the answers. And then you can do the question a third time (knowing the answer) and get a 100%. So last week, while I was doing the 12th chapter, there was a word search/scramble question. These questions come up each chapter and they take me ages. It's a bunch of jumbled up letters and I must make the correct word. Well the words that are the answers are related to the subject of each chapter. They're actually in the textbook, which I don't have obviously but he does. So I took a picture of the question a few days before the deadline and sent it to him. I told him to find the answers in the textbook and simply just message them to me and I can type them into the workbook. It would take him a couple of minutes and save me 30 minutes trying to figure out these words. I've asked before and he never responds, so I usually end up doing it. Well this time I thought the deadline was in an hour and I didn't want to leave it blank and he still hadn't sent me the words after a few days. So I submitted the question twice without answers, used the see answer function, and then put all the answers to get a 100%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell he finally woke up after I finished chapter 12 and he was pissed. He said his teacher checks if they use the answer function and that I had just ruined his grade. He said I was too lazy to actually do the question and didn't care about his grade, so I used the answer function. At first I thought he was joking. Keep in mind he's mad about 1 question out of thousands of questions I had done at this point. 12 dang chapters. I mean he was really upset and said that \"I didn't care at all about him\" and that I didn't even try and that I could've solved the question. I told him that I did try but I had no idea because the words were in the context of the chapter from the textbook. I told him that I asked him to check the words in the textbook days ago, but he never sent anything. And I told him I thought the deadline was in an hour and I didn't want to leave it blank and get him a 0.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that point we argued and I was completely shocked by how ungrateful he was for all the time I had spend doing a whole workbook of homework. I told him he should say thank you to me and apologize to me for being so disrespectful. He refused, saying that he would never apologize, and that I should actually apologize to him for missing a question. I told him that I'll never do his homework again and that we should change the subject and talk about something else. Well right after I said that, he blocked me on everything and disappeared. I tried to message and call but nothing went through. Now I knew that he had another chapter due for the new workbook in a week, so I was curious to see when he would unblock me. Lo and behold, he unblocks me and messages me 5 days later, 2 days before the next homework is due. After blocking me only because I said I won't do homework anymore and just wanted to change the subject, he still refused to apologize or show any remorse at all! So I told him he better go to the university library and use their computers (which was always an option) to start his homework, because it would take him a while and I 100% wouldn't be doing it. I also told him he could borrow a laptop from one of his three roommates ,but he never responds to that. I repeatedly told him, if he apologized to me or said sorry, I might do his homework (I would've). But he said \"never\" and that I should apologize. Come today and the deadline has passed. He didn't do his homework and he got a 0 and blames me. He said he hates me, that I've broken his heart, our relationship is over, and that I've broken his confidence. He said that I've ruined his life, I'm evil-hearted, and that I'm egotistical for wanting and apology and just a simple thank you. \"There's nothing more important to you than your ego\". \"Nothing can change the fact that you let me down. I trusted you. How was I supposed to do it?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really dumbfounded how he has come to all these conclusions and feels this way. I mean am I crazy? He's so adamant that I'm the one in the wrong that I feel like maybe I am really a POS for not doing his homework? I mean when I try to tell him my point of view, it really feels like I'm talking to a brick wall. How can someone be so stubborn to not apologize or say thank you if they're not right? Is he right in some way that I'm missing? Am I egotistical? Should I have just done his homework since he doesn't have a laptop and it would have taken me 1.5-2 hours while it would have taken him 5+? ",

      "description": "So a few months ago I was at my dadâs house when he asked me what kind of car I wanted. I told him I was thinking about a Jeep Wrangler. Cut to 2 weeks later- he tells me to get my wallet, because he has a surprise for me. I drive over to a storage unit. I see the Jeep thatâs normally there- completely inoperable because the last owner rammed it into a telephone pole. We clean it, use a hammer to fix the dents, and find out the radiator is busted. We get a new one and apply it. Next time I come, itâs working. I thank him for buying me a car- and he kind of laughs and says that itâs his until I pay him off for it. I ask him how much he got it for- $2,500. I know thatâs literally nothing for a car, but itâs a 2002 Jeep- itâs older than I am. He says that everything we buy to fix it is added onto the price. And he *keeps buying accessories.* Currently I owe him around $3,500. All the money I have is 17 years worth of birthday money- not even half of it. Honestly I donât want to pay him off for it, mainly because I canât. But AITA?",

      "description": "And then throwing it out without telling anyone after we left for Christmas break.\n\nSo backstory, this is my first apartment style living arrangement (2nd year of College and the apartment is through the school). The only roommate I knew before moving in was the one I shared a room with freshman year (referred to as B). The other two guys were friends of B, and Ive met them once (Only one is important for this story, to be reffered to as S).\n\n I got this coffee table as a gift from my step sister and picked it up before the year started. It was very nice and but had a delicate glass center piece, I had figured it would be broke at some point.\n\nBut not two days into the semester. \n\nA side note, My roomates are quite a bit more social than i was freshman year, so it was understood that there would be a ton of people coming over (inviting themselves over a lot, but that's a story for another time.). All three of my roommates share the same social circle. \n\nSo we had some people over and B had left to go home for the weekend, and I ended up hanging with this group for a bit before retiring to my room and catching some Zs. I'm a bit introverted so I don't enjoy trying to make conversation, but I don't have any issue with these people.\n\nI woke up the next morning and found the living room a mess, with my coffee table moved and had our floor mat over it. It didn't register to me, but 30 min later I checked it out, and it was broke. There was still glass shards around! I eventually got an explanation from S that something had happened, but no details. Turns out he gave me a edited version of the truth, so that I wouldn't be mad at a friend for accidentally breaking it.\n\nA little mad for him lying about it, but I finally got this explanation late that night as all my roommates were gone the full day. Mad cause I didn't get any explanation. Regardless, time moves on and I clean it up. S complains about the hole in the table frequently across the semester.\n\nSo fast forward to the Christmas break, and I leave for the year. B returns to the apartment for a bit after everyone leaves and lets me know that the table is in the Dumpster outside! No explanation for a week until S finally responded to our group chat. Apparently he has another table but wanted to surprise us (S lives across the country and Flys to his home on breaks). It's not that I don't believe him, but his message had no follow up and it was written kind of sarcastically, which is common from him. \n\nAm I the asshole for getting angry that my table was thrown out?",

      "description": "For as long as I can remember, since I was around 7-9 years old, when ever i saw a vagina I would get horny, before I even knew why or what to do with them, I just had a natural sexual attraction to them. But a penis has never done anything for me. \n\nSo I was chatting to this transgender girl I met, first transgender person I got to have a proper conversation with, and I was asking loads of questions because I was genuinely curious and wanted to understand more. After a while she asked if I wanted to go out to movies with her, I agreed but as long as we went as friends. She asked why and I told her that I'm not sexually attracted penises. \n\nThis really upset her, and made me feel kind of shallow. Sex is definitely better when you are emotionally involved, and maybe there is a chance I could of gotten emotionally attached to her... So am I being shallow? Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "Background info:  I am a manager at a pretty successful independent restaurant. Iâve worked there for the last twenty years, as a server then bartender then moving into management. Since it is a family business, thereâs people who have known me since I was tiny. Some of these servers have been there since the beginning, and Iâve known them for 30 years.  A few years ago they fired the server manager based on poor job performance and after a few months I took over the position. \nOne server in particular, letâs call her Patty, has been there for 30+ years. Sheâs been head server, helped run the restaurant, and very much cares about the business. However, she is loud and abrasive and bossy and has actually scared quite a few new employees away. \nThis person and I have spent a lot of time together, planned many group outings together, helped each other outside of work, and had a ton of fun together. However, now Iâm her boss and she is a b***h. Iâve tried talking to her, sheâs been spoken to by HR and written up numerous times and her behavior does not change. At our last HR meeting she was told if she doesnât stop telling everyone what to do and being rude, she would be suspended. That day was today. \nThis last week I had numerous employees come to me with complaints. She also spoke to me numerous times this past week disrespectfully and extremely rudely. Sheâs made it clear she does not respect me professionally and thinks my predecessor (who was fired for being petty and nasty) did a better job. \nKeep in mind this is someone Iâve thought of as a friend for the past twenty years. She has many wonderful qualities and does so many wonderful things for people (examples- sees everyoneâs aprons; brings in Easter baskets for some of the staff who donât have moms, etc). I value our friendship and have respect for her as a person. \nI took the complaints and my observations to HR today and she was suspended. Iâm responsible for my entire department of fifty or so people, and the majority of them feel bullied or belittled by her. Her defense is that sheâs trying to uphold the standards of the business and that things are slipping. Iâve told her numerous times I appreciate her experience and knowledge and if she has concerns to please come to me about it, instead of bossing the rest of the employees around. Sheâs been warned numerous times that the next step was suspension. \nAITA for putting my friend in this position? One more strike and sheâs fired- an employee of 35 years and a friend of more than 20. I pretty much pushed this suspension to happen. ",

      "description": "Long read, tldr at the end. Throwaway because my bf reddits too\n\nI (F24) and bf(25) live with my bf's parents. We've lived with them for a few years while paying off student loans and haven't had any issues. However, recently my bf introduced his little brother (6) to PS4 online gaming and got him set up with an account. Now the PS4 and TV are located in our room, I didn't mind at first because they only played together and usually my bf kicked him out after an hour or two. Now it's evolved to his brother playing as soon as hes home from school and occasionally my bf's cousins (around the same age) join in. There's times that I get home from my evening workout after work so around 7:30pm/8pm and his brother and cousins are still playing! On the weekend his brother is constantly bugging us to play and will wait outside our door or the bathroom to ask us. Anytime we leave my bf tells him he can play so sometimes we leave for hours and come back and he's still playing. \n\nNow I've told my bf before that it's frustrating to constantly come home to kids in my room and kicking them out every day makes me feel like an asshole. Also, I play some games too so my game time has dropped as well. He understood and tried implementing stricter hours but that only lasted like a week. Now his little brother is acting very entitled and gets upset when I dont let him play which is at most 2-3 times a month (usually on the weekend) when I just want to relax in the room. \n\nNow I had a day off yesterday and I heard his little brother complain to his parents that I'm hogging the PS4 and that it's not fair that he can't play today and I'm always kicking him off. I didn't hear their responses but that comment kind of pushed me over the edge. I called him into the room and told him I heard what he said and that wasn't very nice, playing the ps4 is a privilege and he's not entitled to play every day. Because of his rude comment he couldn't play today or tomorrow. He started crying to his parents, his parents haven't said anything to me or bf but I feel like I may have overstepped my boundaries? \n\nI do feel bad because I remember how much fun I had playing games when I was younger but I feel like the kids are constantly in the room and my room is really the only private space I have in the house. So am I the asshole for kicking bf's little brother off the PS4? WIBTA if I restricted their game time to only a few times a week? \n\nTldr: Bf's little brother and cousins play the PS4 in my room for multiple hours almost every day. Am I that asshole for kicking them off the PS4 for a few days? WIBTA if I restricted their game time to only a few times a week? ",

      "description": "âAM I THE ASSHOLE FOR CALLING IT QUITS IN THE END AFTER A ROLLER COASTER OF A RELATIONSHIPâ is my actual question. I ramble a bit as my situation just happened last night and I really tried to check myself and just go out for a smoke and breathe and I came to a serious realization about myself and aspects of my life. Anyways,If at any point u can answer that, feel free to stop there and let me have it. \n\n\nTl;DR: KINDA LONG TOO BECAUSE I WANT TO PAINT THE FULL PICTURE BECAUSE IM REALLY MISSING SOMETHING.(Iâm honestly desperate for an answer. I know itâs not an advice thread but please point out what I wish was obvious to me.Full details in the bottom. Happy new year before I forget. ) Gf and I had a bit of a falling out tonight after I found out she slept with another dude while we were in a weird spot but definitely not dating. but for once itâs me getting a taste of my own medicine.  And it hurt like fucking hell because I treat others like shit and put myself first and I came to a massive realization after a rough relationship with my gf I (Iâm 22, and I want to stop this cycle of bullshit. Iâm miserable because Ive been stuck in this loop and now that Iâm for some reason seeing things differently I really donât think Iâm good for a relationship) . I really believe I love this girl. I really feel like I would use our current incident against her. Itâs just how I cope. And I donât want to do that because itâs not fair to her. Treated a wonderful girl and person like shit and she took it. Almost decided to bail out after getting her pregnant after a couple of months of us meeting.   (I have 2 kids already that I love to death and have every other weekend. The only time I was sober was when I was with my kids and at work. I started losing my shit and drinking seemed to be the answer [DUMB] A lot of other details and this shit just happened and I just... really feel taken back by it. I think I should end it. I believe sheâd stand by me if I really went to therapy or something to sort out whatâs in my head but.. Iâm mad. I honestly want space. And I feel bad but I canât not be upset and I can just lose my shit randomly just by thinking about it. My kids donât see this shit too much. Iâd love to take them more but my shitty work schedules and a lot of other things (like their mother not being willing). \n\n\nHonestly, thereâs so much backstory to this that itâd take til next year. I was not a very good boyfriend at all.  She and I met at a bar. It was cool. And then I started losing my shit, treating her kinda bad, and drinking a lot. Fast forward. Sheâs pregnant. I push for abortion but he l we decide to try it out.  Long story short, we try an apartment. I canât stand it. She has her family move in to replace me. I start dating someone else and move back home. (Not sure what o was doin here. Iâd like to cry that I have a mental illness but I really am just a fuckin idiot sometimes)\n\n\nSheâs a perfectly fine girl tbh. Sheâs smart and pretty. And sometimes she definitely deserves better than me. Fast forward some more. I realized I fucked up. She takes me back immediately but she comes to live with me for a bit so we can get back on our feet. (The stress of the apartment and all really sucked and strained us both so it was a relief no matter what and I was wrong to just leave, I know)\n\nFast forward more. I quit drinking. . We try it again, ya know. Not workin. Sheâs bitter which is understandable. But sheâs totally stuck ( family is fuckin shit.) So we live together.us and the baby. I also have my other kids on the weekend. ( sheâs great with them) . At some point, I just get bored and start talking to someone from work. Fuck around a bit. She finds out. (Which hurt her feelings and honestly, I wish I didnât do it. But I did. And it hurt her bad. I came to a realization though.. I really fucked my head up between blowing things out of proportion, justifying my own actions by twisting things ( any time she would go out or something when we were first dating, Iâd be a dick sometimes but in my head I would come up with bizarre shit. It seemed like she slept around a bit and that hit my insecurity hard [seriously fucked up. I know.... ]) , and drinking hard for almost a year. Sheâs perfect.. sheâs wonderful. And about 2 months ago she said she was going out with a friend (she and I were friendly and having sex again at this point but definitely not dating.. and she instead messaged some dude and fucked him. And fuck I am angry. And not exactly at her. She never planned on telling me but I called her out on something earlier tonight because I couldnât shake a feeling. Ya know that fucking awful pit? Itâs even worse because I deserve it. \n\n\n\n\nNow, sharing ever bitty detail, well, as much as I can remember, am I the asshole for.. for being upset? I know itâs not fair to her. But before this, it seemed like we were getting closer. And I felt like we were getting somewhere. And then.. we even got back together. Sheâs put up with so much of my shit and Iâm fairly certain has never really done anything else behind my back. (Which it kind of wasnât, even. [Iâm not too sure if a comma goes there. ]) But I just feel stupid. I act like an asshole and so dumb shit to protect myself. Itâs shitty but itâs kept me okay(so far). And it feels like the LITERAL moment I let my guard down, (maybe itâs karma and I might deserve it for the bullshit I did, but it never fuckjn fails that I get hurt. This is a trend in all relationships of mine.  Whether intimate or not.\n",

Iâm being as supportive as I know how to be but after a year plus Iâm tired of hearing about it. The problem is that sheâs big in talking/venting/ranting and not having that ability would make her miserable. My solution is she gets to do that, just with someone else.\n\nCouple side notes 1) she has other family and girlfriends to talk to and believe me she does do so but I still get an earful on a regular basis. 2) sheâs blocked her sister on Facebook and other social media but gossip and she said nonsense has a way of finding itself to us. Once she hears anything itâs like a full blown relapse and we have to muddle through the initial fight all over again until we get to the newest transgression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit - i botched the title originally so i killed the first post.",

      "description": "For some background, I live with my brother while he's getting his feet under him and I'm getting my masters degree. He is 27, I am 22. He has been dating this girl \"Liz\" for about 6 years and she is about to come unglued waiting for him to propose and he claims that he's just not ready yet. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, my brother found my Tinder account and he and his friends basically catfished the shit out of me using pics they stole from Instagram. I was an idiot and I fell for it, hook line and sinker. I wanted to get revenge on him some how but wasn't sure. \n\nThe week before Valentines day I was in B&amp;N and saw this book \"How to Buy Diamonds\" on one of the endcaps. I saw my chance so I bought the book. On Valentines morning I stole my brothers phone, turned it off and watched him stomp around the house which in reality was a pretty good prank. He went to work without his phone and since I was home all day, I \"hid\" the book in the stack of crap my brother keeps on the coffee table and at like 4 I texted Liz and said basically \"Bro lost his phone, he wanted me to text you to come over now if able so he can take you out.\" She texted me back and showed up maybe an hour later. \n\nI made sure the binding of the book was plainly visible and let her in. I said I had to study in my room and closed the door. I could hear her flipping through a magazine and then about died laughing when she called her sister or friend and said something like \"he has a how to buy a diamond book! Oh my god. Do you think it's tonight? Oh my god! It has to be tonight. It has to be! I call you back as soon as it happens!\" I literally couldn't contain myself I was laughing so hard. \n\nSo bro got home, they went on their date. Maybe 2 hours later they came back through the door screaming bloody murder at each other. Obviously he hadn't proposed and she was screaming at him why did he have a \"how to buy diamonds\" book if he wasn't going to propose. He was trying to talk his way around it all because she was furious with him. Finally she dug the book out of the stack of stuff and threw it at the wall. My brother obviously knew it was me at that point but Liz didn't care and said she needed a \"break\" to figure out if the relationship is really for her after 6 years. As far as I know she hasn't spoken to him in two weeks. \n\nFor my brothers part, he understands that I was just getting back at him and he admits it was a pretty good joke but he is truly, truly broken hearted over Liz possibly breaking up with him over it. I feel really bad but at the same time I didn't make her freak out. \n\nAm I the asshole for doing it?",

      "description": "I was redirected for r/relationships to here! They were a lot of help, but I still want to hear this subs opinion on the situation. \n\nFirst of all, I would like to apologize for my English. It is not my first language, but I am hoping to learn more of it as I go!\n\nThis happened a couple days ago. While me, two other girls, and the girl that broke my phone (I'll call her Heather) where walking home from school. This happened about 50 meters from school ground.\n\nSomething you should know about Heather is that she is on the bigger side and does boxing as a hobby. So naturally she has a lot of physical strength. I on the other hand am as tiny as they come. Hethers was being her playful self and body slammed herself into one of the girls. Mind you, we were walking in a straights line, so that made the girl that got body slammed, slam into the other girl, and then that girl slammed into me.\n\nI first got slammed into a metal fence (we were on this small bridge) then roughly hit the pavement. The fence left a pretty bad bruse, and my pants were completely beyond repair at the knee aria, leaving me with 2 bad wounds that my aunt who is a medical professional begged me to go to the hospital because \"it looks like you will need stitches\" I didn't go, and one of my knees is still beading, but I don't care. \n\nMy phone, witch I was holding in my hand got completely shattered. The bottom half of my screen is nothing but broken glass. When I saw it I said that she will pay for it. After that I went to the shop i bought the phone in (as fast as my knees would take me, my theory is I was running on the adrenaline from the fall) They said that my phone insurance doesn't cover broken screens but they could sent it to repair for 150$. I said ok and went home. I am still paying of this phone for 2 years, so I can't get a new one. \n\nMy guardian (my aunt, I really hope my parents are in a better place now. :) ) freaked out, saying that I will not pay for that phone with my money, and that she is willing to go to the principal if needed.\n\nAfter that a friend that is in my friend group tryed to tell me that I do not need to fix the screen, some people just let them be as it is (which I do, the phone is barely working) and that I am not homeless so I have no right to say anything about my torn pants. I got mad and told her to mind her own business, this has nothing to do with you. Hether left the chat group after that. I proceeded to have a panic attack after the whole thing. I send a message to Hether saying how much the screen cost, and that we can work something out but she ghosted me.\n\nToday I came into school and Hether and another girl ignored me the whole time. Another girl told me I shouldn't be asking Hether to reimburse me for the screen because she is my friend. Another girl told me I took my anger out on all of them because I said to that one girl in the group chat to mind her business. The said girl is still taking to me, but only a little. I tryed to talk to Heather but she just did sighed and pushed past me.\n\nIs what I am doing wrong? Please help me. I am willing to split the costs or maybe make monthly payments for the screen with her. But she will not listen. I don't even think I can get the school involved because it didn't happen on school grounds, just next to them. My aunt is thinking of getting the parents involved. I don't want this to escalate,but I will not just stand here and say nothing happened. Please give me advice on this situation, thank you! :)\n\nTL;DR: Friend broke my phone screen and is now ignoring me. I'm trying to work things out before they escalate, but she will not cooperate.

      "description": "A couple of month ago I started dating a colleague from work who was flirting with me since years. I became single recently and as he seemed to be a nice guy I gave it a try. We regularly met and he kept telling me that he likes and appriciates me and how much I mean to him. \n\n4 weeks ago he told me about a girl he fell in love with. Certainly I was puzzled and confronted him when he said, he never promised me anything, this was just a friends with benefits thing and I shouldn't make a drama.\nIn parallel, he is in the inner cycle of getting a promotion which I do not take the decision but have some strong influence on the decision making process. I always supported him as the strongest candidate and his revelation of the other girl came right at the time after the decision should have been made. But in fact, it wasn't so I used my influence to make sure somebody else gets the job. On top of that I planted the seed that he is not a reliable employee as I strongly think he only used me to get the job and shouldn't be rewarded. \n\nAITA for using my job to get revenge on an ex lover?",

      "description": "Long story short i've [19F] never had a good bond with my parents [Both well in their 50s] because of mental health issues they didn't support me with and a weird mix between being overprotective over me and me being 'adult enough to figure stuff out myself' in their eyes. Living with them made my depression much, much worse and made me feel like shit in general. That and not having many friends really got the worst of me for a while. \n\nLately, i've got a loving and supporting boyfriend [21M] who i've been childhood friends with 10 years ago. Basically i stayed over at his place for a night and never left, and have now been unofficially living with him for almost 5 months.\n\nMy parents want me to come home (Which i do around biweekly) or just look for a place for myself but because of my mental and physical health issues it's just not the smartest thing to do. My parents now keep bugging me for small stuff (Claiming i've been breaking their stuff when i'm over, guilt tripping me for taking care of me for all those years) and now i've had a small fight with my brother [15] and they want me to come over to talk it through tomorrow evening.\nI told them i couldn't, because i have a concert and just generally don't feel like it. Me and my bro worked it out already so i don't feel the need to. She basically told me \"If you think a dumb concert is more important than your family you can just fuck off\" which basically made something snap in me and i said okay and hung up the phone.\n\n I don't think i'll have much contact with them anymore now and i know it hurts my parents a lit because they do care about me. The years of physical abuse and gaslighting/other forms of manipulation just made me so tired and scared of my parents i seriously don't feel at home ( or even comfortable) around them anymore to the point of having suicidal thoughts. AITA for cutting them off?\n\nTldr; My parents have been unsupportive / manipulative for years and are guilt tripping me for living with my boyfriend instead, making me feel so much happier.

      "title": "WIBTA for not going along with any Christmas plans with my old group of friends from high school?",
      "description": "So I've known a majority of the people in this group from middle school, so roughly almost 8/9 years. However, we are all growing apart as it tends to happen when people split up for college and move all around. The thing is though, is that for years around Christmas we have consistently done secret santa and hung out. More or less everyone is in town for the break and we all coordinate something. And every single year it's been held at my house.\n\nThis past year though, I had a really bad falling out with one of the girls within the group. She became part of the group during high school, but we had become close before we went off to college. She was the one person that remained close by and we were \"best friends\". The reason why I cut off communication with her was because she kept trying to get me back with my ex, and consistently was rude to my new boyfriend. My ex had pushed to remain friend shortly after we had broken up and had claimed they could handle it but ultimately wasn't moving on. They ended up throwing a big fit when I got in my current relationship over a year after and just was getting crazy drunk and blaming me for them finally leaving the group. My ex-friend was by their side constantly, and I understood her reasons for it, but months after and she was still trying to push us together was taking its toll. I had explained to her why I broke up with my ex to begin with but apparently that was never respected. We tried working through it, but she kept bringing my ex into the picture so I finally was done dealing with all the drama and told her to have fun with my ex. \n\nWith a majority of the rest of the group, who were aware of my new partner during the last Christmas meeting and a couple know the ex-friend disliked him, they don't know about all the drama that took place after because we don't all keep in touch. And many aren't aware that we don't speak anymore as far as I know. Only one friend knows all that occurred and I still keep in more consistent contact with her. \n\nWe had spring break come up after we had the falling out and I did make plans with this group of friends and we hung out for an afternoon before I had to leave for work and such. The ex-friend didn't take part for whatever reason, but I also made it clear to the mutual friend who planned it that I did not want to accidently run in to her whatsoever. And that I would be fine seeing them another time if she was to join them. This mutual friend also acknowledged that for these group hangouts it would probably be better if it was held at another house besides mine. Which I completely agreed with. \n\nMore recently though, I recently talked with the mutual friend and asked if there were any plans in motion for this Christmas break, and I wanted to speak up about my desire to not be part of the secret santa and also reiterate that I would not be comfortable having anything at my house if the other person was to come. As for secret santa, I didn't want to put either me or my ex-friend in the awkward position of getting each other, and then further having the gift exchange primarily be with one person over another. \n\nThe mutual friend misunderstood what I was saying though and thought that I completely didn't want to meet up with anyone if they were in town. I clarified it with her that I was referring to specifically secret santa and she understood and actually didn't want to do that regardless since the group has grown apart. But she first had been arguing about how everyone would be willing to work with the fact that I just don't want to see my ex-friend.\n\nIn thinking about it however, I almost just don't want to do anything they may plan. I know that they would all be willing to work to accommodate me and want to not choose sides in the matter. But I honestly haven't talked with a majority of them directly since that last break where we met up. And I would hate to impose restrictions on what is supposed to be a light hearted gathering. \n\nAnd they all just don't understand the issue that occurred. Even the friend that I have kept in contact with has more or less written off all that has occurred in regards to my ex-friend even though she can acknowledge that I was always trying my best to be respectful and the ex-friend was the one crossing the line over and over. \n\nI was even having an open conversation with her about how horrible the situation was because it tanked my happiness and confidence for months when it happened. Because when my ex was blaming me for everything, my \"best friend\" and the mutual friends I stayed in contact with were all by their side because they felt that I was strong enough and didn't need support. The mutual friends only changed their behavior after my boyfriend went and explained that they didn't have the whole story. Ultimately, I explained to my friend that from my point of view none of the drama was worth it because I lost a person who was supposed to be a good friend, and I had to deal with my ex blaming me for everything when I had made it clear we were over for more than a year before I got into a new relationship. And the mutual friend basically just said that all the drama was unfortunate but there was a silver lining because she was able to meet my ex and become friends with them. \n\nI told her that it's all fine and dandy for her to not be bothered by all that occurred and be happy cause she got a friend out of it. But for me personally it wasn't worth it. I left it at that in terms of the conversation with her. But it just basically confirmed for me that she excuses all of my ex's and my ex-friend's behavior. I never asked any of them to pick sides and still never have and never wish to do that, but I always question how they could be okay with the way they were acting. Because both of them were explicitly badmouthing me and my boyfriend, either to our face or to the mutual friends. \n\nAt this point, I'm really am questioning whether I even want to try and hang out with this group of friends from high school when I barely talk to any of them and the one I more consistently talked to I am unsure of if I want to remain friends with. I feel like it would almost be better if I just remove myself from the picture and not even worry about hanging out with them. If they all hear the story from my ex-friend later on and believe that I am the asshole, well then I guess that's their opinion of me and it's unfortunate. \n\nI've talked with my family about it, but they don't see why I just don't want to deal with it anymore and they don't understand why I need to \"give up\" my friends cause of the drama with the other girl. I've just explained that it's a normal part of moving on. \n\nHowever, I would like to hear a more unbiased opinion. I still feel overall that they are good people. But it's all just a lot of stress that I don't want to deal with, and I barely keep in contact with them. Would I be the asshole if I just left the group and didn't join in on any plans, even if they were willing to find times where I wouldn't  run into my ex-friend? And would I be the asshole to discuss more specifically why I don't want to take part with the one friend that knows everything?\n\nTL;DR: My group of friends that I barely keep in touch with typically do plans around Christmas. I want to bail out on any plans cause I don't want to deal with the stress of coordinating with an ex-friend that prioritized my ex when we were supposed to be \"best friends\". My other friends in the group aren't aware of all the drama that happened and the one that is more or less excuses all the stuff my old friend and ex did. Would I be the asshole for completely removing myself from the situation and not committing to any plans? ",

      "description": "Background: \n\nSo about a year ago my brother and his wife got into a fight. They almost broke up. My brother and his baby came to my house as they had no where else to go. (Iâve always been the caretaker of the family since mom is an addict and dad is unstable).  I told them they could stay with us (even though we have NO room cause my other brother and his friend already live with me). Well good news is the brother and his wife made up the same day. So he never actually stayed with us. But the option was there in case he needed it. My fiancÃ© didnât argue. She wasnât pleased, but she didnât argue.\n\nNow, her brother is an ex addict. Heâs been homeless for about 5 years and addicted to meth and heroin. He lost his first 2 sons 5 years ago. He got clean about a year ago with a relapse 7 months ago. 9 months ago he got another addict pregnant. She just had the baby. He is now working with CPS to get custody of his kid. The problem is he lives in a halfway house that doesnât allow children. He has applied for other housing options which could take 1-12 months to actually get into. CPS needs to know where he and the baby would stay if it took him longer to get approved for the housing. The baby will be in the NICU for about 1-2 months since it was born with a lot of heroin in his system. In that time he could get approved for his housing. He might not. If not, CPS needs to know where he and the baby will stay.  So he asks my fiancÃ© if they could live with us (if needed) until he gets his other housing. \n\nThe thing is though, is I have 4 stoners living in my house. With constant weed smoking. Everyday pretty much all day (no comments on this please we are adults, we have no children in the house, we own our house, we all have jobs etc etc). If I invite an ex addict into my home with all this paraphernalia I think itâs a bad idea. Will he relapse? Will he even be able to care for the kid? Are we going to become a daycare? He didnât want his other 2 kids, how is this one going to be? There will be a drug addicted newborn in my house crying all hours of the night (I work at 4am every morning).  Is this âonly a couple of monthsâ going to turn into years? \n\nI want to so badly say no. But I feel like âwell she did allow my brother to stay with usâ (even though he didnât end up doing it). The other things is he and the baby could go live with his dad. He lives alone, has 2 extra rooms and is waaayy financially stable. He just doesnât want to because âEvery time I live in (insert town name) I relapse because all my friends are thereâ but the thing is we live only 5 minutes away from that town. I donât see the big difference. \n\nSo guys. Be blunt. Let me have it. WILL I BE THE ASSHOLE IF I SAY NO TO HIM AND HIS NEWBORN COMING TO STAY WITH US?  ",

      "description": "I have known my friend for 10 years now (and dated at one point but broke it off mutually) so I know a lot about his life. He is a nice person, but in my opinion, is a complete pushover. He is 25 years old, has stable job, and earns a decent amount. Since the time that I have known him, he has been completely devoted to his parents, to the point that they can do no wrong. His parents are immigrants from India (as are mine) and he feels that they have sacrificed a lot for him to come to this country, get him a private elementary school education and paid for part of his college (which was mostly paid for by scholarships, his parents paid for around 20k). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently, he lives at home with his parents and pays for the electricity &amp; phone bills and monthly payments for a leased car (they all share one car). He saved up around 80k and his parents saved up around 20k to put a down payment for a house together. All of that is fine and all, but here's the problem: his parents have exhibited behavior that goes outside of normal Indian parent expectations, in my opinion. When they decided to get a new car, his father consistently complained about any of the cheaper models, and they ended up getting a more expensive one. Alongside that, the parents consistently disliked the houses within the realistic budget that he set and they ended up being adamant about one particular house that was way over budget. These are the two main things, but there are lots of little things I picked up on over the years about them hinting at wanting a certain phones, complaining about gifts, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my  problem is, my friend comes complaining to me all the time about such things. He always laments that he wishes he had richer parents, that he's jealous of our mutual friends who have no real responsibilities, that he wishes he could just be young and carefree. I have always tried to be supportive, but at the same time, I always say things like it is. Today, I kind of said fuck it and ended up telling him that his parents are being selfish by wanting a more expensive house, fully knowing that within 5 years or so, he will be footing the mortgage payments. I also said that his parents should've tried harder to save more money over the last 16 years that they have been here instead of expecting so much out of their son. I also said that he should pick one or the other: be a completely doting son and do what he feels like he needs to do...or, do some things for his parents but also think about saving for his own future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, he got mad at me. I know what I was definitely harsh (especially calling his parents \"selfish\") but I really was tired of the same recycling of him coming to me to complain about his responsibilities but never putting his foot down in front of his parents. So am I the asshole and do I owe him an apology now?",

I walked away and never reported the incident. \n\nIt was in a particularly bad point of my life and I had enough grief without worrying about other people's, plus I doubt the woman in question would have done anything had I been in trouble.

      "description": "About six months ago I was accused of a hit and run. The person who reported the hit and run claimed they witnessed me bump into a car in a parking lot, which I have no recollection of. Anyways, later that night I get a call from my local police station asking if I had been driving in this town near by which is not my hometown, I said yes, confused why I was being called. He explained  that a  bystander had reportedly saw me bump into a parked car and I should call the officer it was reported to in the other town. I did that and ended up meeting with the officer at the station a few days later and he did not want to hear anything I had to say. In fact, he did not even care to see my car which I found to be weird, since if I hit a car and caused $1000 in damages (which is what the police report claims) wouldn't he want to see my car? I also should mention that the parking lot where I supposedly hit the car is RIGHT across from the police station and there is supposedly no video surveillance of the accident. So the officer decided to give me the ticket and I went on my way. I was curious who this bystander was who reported the accident since he wasn't even the OWNER of the car, I looked him up on the internet after seeing his name on the police report and after seeing a photo of him I remembered when I was pulling into this parking spot that there was another young guy with a girl in a black Mercedes who were competing for the parking space and I pulled in ahead of them, and as the car drove around to the adjacent side he flipped me off. So I got a lawyer and explained the whole story to them and they still could not get the ticket dropped and instead wanted me to come in to the office and sign a paper to say I accept 2 points on my licence and a fine of $300. I refused to sign a paper acknowledging any wrongdoing for something I didn't do. This was about 3 months ago when I met with my lawyer and since then they have been very coy and seem frustrated at me for not taking their advice. I should also mention that this happened six months ago and the owner of the car that I supposedly hit and cause $1000 worth of damages too hasn't consulted their insurance company of it or contacted me.

Every time I come into class, I either get a chair with wheels or just a regular one. Most of the time, I swap out a regular one for one with wheels from a table that nobody uses since weâre always on the computers.\nOne day, I walked in and had a regular chair. The boy next to me had some wheelied chairs, and out of laziness to go to the tables, I swapped them. Whatever.\nThen he comes into class, and he sees that thereâs a regular chair. He was like âughh I donât wanna go get another chair,â and I admitted that I swapped our chairs. Because he didnât want to go get the wheelied one, he says that I should go get the chair for him. I said no, and that there was one at the tables waiting for him. He starts whining for me to go get one, and the girls who sit behind us say I need to go get the chair.\nNow Iâm confused on why theyâre starting to get mad at me. They raise their voices a bit at me and tell me to go get the chair while the boy whines and demands for me to get it for him too. I cave in, and I just go get it for him. \nAITA?\nNote, i use the wheely chairs often, since I move around the room in the chairs so I can quickly turn to help the people around me since they ask for help often.

      "description": "I recently invited a three of my good friends to go on a snowboarding trip last week. I told the three of them that to give me suggestions of people of who I should invite as well. Well they suggested a mutual friend, lets call him Sam, and that they all wanted to come along with us. We all, including Sam, frequently played video games together and hung out together occasionally. However, I disliked Sam because of reason such as him being obnoxious and often oblivious to his suroundings which caused him to be a pain to hang out with. Therefore, I told my friends that I did not want him to come because of the said reasons, which they agreed to. Well, as you can tell from the title, Sam shows up to the ski resort. Intially, I thought Sam showed up by himself but found out that my three friends invited him behind my back. I was initially angry but unwilling to ruin the trip when along with it. ",

So, you can guess that things get pretty intense. I lived with my brother for a chunk of time because I have a child and I can't wander the streets with a five year old. They're relationship is more than my family puts it out to be. My family, especially my dad and our uncle, think it's one sided and that his girlfriend is just the crazy one. But, I witnessed my brother destroy her tv, burn her clothes, accuse her of cheating if she even smiles while texting someone. I'm not saying my brother is the only psycho one because I've also witnessed her key his car, steal his money, pour gasoline on him. They are just both toxic with each other. I've kinda grown to not really care about it because it's never black and white. I got tired of it and I blew up on my entire family because they kept talking about them. I feel like I should care but I shouldn't at the same time. My family really went in on me after I told them that I don't care. \n",

We all sit together and buy our tickets a year in advance. The seats are just aluminum benches (god how I wish they were stadium style fold down seating) that sit 15 people per row. We have 11 people in out group so there are 4 others in our row. The first two are season holders like us, and the next two are open for purchase. The last few years no one has ever purchased the two so we all got to enjoy plenty of room. Well, this year someone did and we were all packed. The guy didnât buy annual tickets, they were just one day passes. So the odds of him renewing those exact seats are pretty slim. Regardless, The guy was just a jerk the whole time so while I was tailgating with my friends after the race, I brought up the idea of adding those two extra seats to our season packet as kids seats ($10 per seat per weekend as opposed to $235), you know, âwe would like to bring the kids to a race *wink wink*â.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey all thought it was brilliant so I got right on it and I was able to add them to my packet for the 2020 races. The September tickets havenât been released yet, they arenât sold to anyone but they canât be sold just yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now Iâm kinda wondering if we are assholes for buying seats at a discounted rate knowing we are just going to use them so we can all have some extra room?",

Especially since she had been going though heartbreak, since the person she loved suddenly ghosted her, but before New Yearâs Eve, she told me that she want to say something that might be very rude, and me being willing to always listen to her, I agreed that she could tell me anything. \n\nShe then told me that âIâve been such a fucking bitch about (her ex?),â and that âshe knows Iâm sick about hearing about herâ, (which is true but Iâve always tried to give support and advice anyway.)

She said she understood but I mean a lot to her and that she doesnât wanna whine and complain all the time and that (other person) is okay with it but sheâs worried about me. \n\nI havenât talked to her since then, because Iâm not comfortable talking with her anymore, and now I just really need closure about am I the asshole?

Once she found a house we moved in with her and she had told us her fiance which my brother and I haven't known for very long before him moving in. Immediately there was problems such as him yelling at me and my brother for being lazy even though he was the one that never took care of the house due do his \"breathing problems\" even though he is still a very avid smoker. He also took the door knob off of my door and would regularly walk into my room without knocking, causing him to walk in on me changing multiple times without apologizing. \n\nSkip forward to December of 2018, my brother turned 18 in January of 2018 and moved out so i was all alone in the house. My dad gains custody of me. It was one of the happiest times of my life. court date was on a Wednesday so my dad told me to stay the rest of the week and he will pick me up on Saturday. But as soon as my mom got home she tried to guilt me saying I don't love her yada yada yada. \n\nAll seemed fine at my dads, his girlfriend moved in prior to me staying there full time and she seemed like a nice person and so did her family. Boy was I wrong. September 2018 is when i started dating my boyfriend that I am still dating right now. My dad gave me a lot more freedom than my mom did so i tried to spend as much time with my boyfriend as I can and my dad seemed fine with it, i made sure that he met my boyfriend and his parents. But for the past i want to say 6 months my stepmom started to get on me. If i didn't put away a single dish that was in the sink I would get yelled at. If i didn't have breakfast with them on the weekends because i would eat something prior to them waking up, i'd get yelled at. It turned into a vicious cycle of her and I arguing her accusing me of stealing her stuff and her always insulting my mother and my boyfriend and my life decisions. I'll admit that I have a very bad attitude but she is more of a \"I'm going to ruin her life in secret\" person. Now my boyfriend dropped out of high school mid sophomore year but I know he is very smart and very much wants to go to college after getting his GED. He is working full time and has a truck and his license. He is a very hard worker and he worked for everything he has now, being born to a mother with very bad bipolar disorder and an injured navy veteran. Because of her strong judgments towards my boyfriend and his parents, she started to push it onto my dad. And my dad listens to her. I don't want to say my dad is a pushover but he sure as hell believes every little thing that woman shoves down her throat. It's gotten to the point where my dad will find any reason for me to not go over to my boyfriends house and even flat out said that he will not help me pay my college tuition if i move out of the house when i turn 18 knowing if me and my bf are still together by then, that is my exact plan. \n\nWhere I live the legal age of working is 16 and i turned 16 in October. I was job hunting and i still am trying my best to find a job so I am able to be financially independent as soon as i'm 18. Now it's February 2019 and I have still yet to find a job although i do have an interview next week. My dad is forcing me to apply for different jobs, not acknowledging that most places don't want to hire people that are still in school especially not a 16 year old. But he says I'm grounded until I find one. My self esteem and my motivation have lowered and it has gotten to the point where I don't think I want to live here anymore but I also wouldn't want to go back to my mother. AITA for possibly blowing things out of proportion? Am i just over reacting?",

Now, im extremely frugal and i feel that if he wants to give his children the things they want, it's up to him, my share of house bills shouldn't have to go up so he can afford all his kids \"demand\" (as in demanding 2 extras activities plus language institute plus going to all that in uber).\nI did recently buy him a car (it's mine but I don't drive) to optimize time and make the kids less annoyed when we go out but from that to working every day is a huge leap I'm not willing to take while in medical school which requires tons of reading ours and thousands and thousands of practical classes.

      "description": "I have a habit of telling my boyfriend I'm going to shave my head bald as a joking response to mean that I can do whatever I want to and he can't stop me.\n\nEg. \nMe: I think I'd look nice with purple hair.\nBf: Your hair looks great now too :)\nMe: I WILL SHAVE ALL MY HAIR OFF\n\nI say it mostly as a joke but also with the intention of gauging his reaction to it as shaving all my hair off doesn't seem impossible for me to do seeing as how I've cut off my long hair on impulse into a pixie cut (before I met him) as I find it cathartic :-) \n\nHe was always mildly irritated. Today he kinda snapped and told me he saw a story online about how a man left his fiancÃ©e because she cut off all her hair the day before the wedding without telling him first. I was like WTF WHAT KIND OF ASSHOLE MAN and started to get pissed at my boyfriend for not agreeing that that man was ridiculous. My stand was that it's OUR hair, we can do anything we want with it without permission. What's more, it's just hair!! It can grow backâ¦â¦\n\nMy bf's argument is:\n1. Most people like to \"show off\" their SOs (would feel proud if their friends think their SO is great).\n2. The fact that she's doing it for attention i.e. would you still marry me if I'm bald, is disgusting\n\nHe also sheepishly mentioned that looks are definitely not everything but to him (at least), having hair really is a important part of someone's image. I realise SOs are not meant to be shown off butâ¦â¦ like I'm guilty of thinking that way too.\n\nI just thought it was interesting how my first thought was WHAT A MAJOR ASSHOLE the groom is but after hearing my bf's POV I'm starting to think the bride might be a little assholey/childish? I still don't feel like I have the need to inform anyone of my decision to do anything to my hair before doing it thoughâ¦? ",

      "description": "My(25) best friend(24) and I are very honest with each other and talk about everything. Iâve always kinda wondered why he dresses the way he does but never really said anything outside of occasionally making jokes which weâll both laugh at. Well tonight I brought it up and what started out as a lighthearted conversation turned into us arguing.\n\nIt started with us checking on our lives a bit. Happiness. Stuff like that. Weâve both been struggling with feelings of depression and so when we meet weâll check on each otherâs mental health sometimes. Told him it's the little happy things we do for ourselves that count. Well I used that as a way to ask about his appearance and like usual he rolled his eyes and smiled cause weâve done this before. I said the whole âwhen you look good, you feel goodâ thing and he said âI just donât care how I look.â This is where things got heated.\n\nI should describe his typical attire for context. I would describe his appearance as that of a middle schooler from the early 00s. Hair thatâs long and in his face all the time, some sort of graphic tee with a pop culture thing, baggy jeans and sketchers shoes. This is what I always see him in no matter the occasion. Itâs not bad. Like he doesnât look homeless, he just doesnât put in effort past the bare minimum.\n\nAnyway, after his remark I told him that itâs not okay to not care about how you look and that heâs 24 and needs to put more effort into his appearance. Well things snowballed from there. It only got worse. I tried to convey to him that his appearance affects other peopleâs perception of him and how it can actively work against him by putting himself at a disadvantage. Also that itâs about being the best him he can be. He went on about how itâs not important to him and that he doesnât think about those things and doesnât really care what people think. Thinks itâs all superficial and shallow. I admitted to him that it is but thatâs just unfortunately how people are. We yelled at each other some more. He yelled at me saying âI donât know why you care so much about something that doesnât matter.â I told him itâs that I just canât fathom why someone wouldnât want to work on something that is entirely in their control that affects how others see them. I tried to get him to see how it can affect his love life or job opportunities. No dice. He said itâs whatâs on the inside that counts. I agreed and told him that no one will give you the time of day to see whatâs on the inside.\n\nWe finally cooled down a bit after a long time of arguing. We kind of reached some resolution. I made sure to enforce that I was coming from a place of love and that I just wanted him to be happy with himself. But we ended the night on not a positive note. I drove him home and we didnât say a word to each other. I legitimately feel his lack of caring about his appearance is hurting him. But I think I went about it in an asshole way.",

      "description": "Need some honest opinions &amp; possibly a reality check if Iâm wrong from this glorious community.....\n\nGood friend of mine is getting married &amp; I have been asked to be a bridesmaid. My husband has also been asked to be the best man &amp; my family has been invited to the wedding. \n\nWhile we were out shopping for the brides wedding dress she happened to mention that she is not having kids at the wedding at all. \n\nPrevious to this, because my husband &amp; I were both asked to be in the wedding party she told us both that our son would be an exception to that rule. \n\nThe bride stressed how much it would mean to her if my family could be there as well &amp; she very well knows that anyone &amp; everyone who would normally watch our kid would be at the wedding. \n\nAs a side note: we are NC with my outlaws &amp; they will never ever get alone time with our son so having them babysit while we go to the wedding is completely out of the question. The bride &amp; groom are both privy to all the details of the blow up with my outlaws &amp; are fully aware of the entire situation. \n\nI didnât say anything at the time because she had already expressed that we were an exception to that rule. A few days went by &amp; My husband &amp; I both got a text message asking us who would be babysitting our kid? \n\nI had filled my husband in on what had happened when we were dress shopping &amp; he said he had an uneasy feeling about it &amp; the comment was a âhintâ. \n\nSo my husband texted back saying that our son would be with Bellarinaâs parents as previously discussed, due to the bride wanting my family there. She then informed us that, that is not fair on my parents &amp; how could they possibly have a good time....? \n\nWe asked the bride if we could sit down with her &amp; discuss this &amp; go over what she originally told us &amp; she refused &amp; said she had changed her mind. \n\nMy husband then said well Bellarinaâs parents have offered to stay home with the kid. To which she declined &amp; said that was unacceptable âthey had to be thereâ. My husband then said well Bellarina &amp; I will forfeit our places in your bridal party &amp; stay home with our kid. \n\nShe flew off the handle &amp; told us we had to get over the fact the outlaws had done severe wrong by us &amp; we needed to apologise to them &amp; make up, so they could watch our kid for us so we could all be in / go to her wedding. \n\nHubby pointed out she was not willing to compromise on what she had previously stated we could do, knowing full well that we have no one else to watch our kid. He said if she was now committed to her mind change {which we fully respect &amp; understand} we would bow out now before planning &amp; purchasing for the wedding got too far along. \n\n[Please note at this point, our attire &amp; other bits &amp; pieces for the wedding had not been purchased at this time (thank gawd) if they had we would have graciously paid for them &amp; moved on.]\n\nThe bride wasnât having it &amp; demanded we all be there as usual but we had to do something with âthe kidâ. Hubby took screen shots of this whole convo &amp; texted it to the groom who was horrified &amp; said he was not aware this was going on. \n\nHubby explained yet again the kid either got to come or my parents or us would not be in attendance at the wedding. The groom completely understood &amp; then proceeded to contact his wife to find out what the fuck had gotten into her. \n\nApparently she didnât want our son showing up her niece &amp; nephew.... by having our son there would take attention away from her niece &amp; nephew. Hubby &amp; I were like WTAF....???? No one at the wedding knows our kid &amp; my parents would make sure no one noticed him at all. Heâs a fantastically awesome well behaved kid unlike the niece &amp; nephew. \n\nAnywhooo..... the bride kicked up a real stink with her husband so her husband let her know that hubby &amp; I would not be in the bridal party &amp; would not be in attendance to the wedding because of her change of mind. (The groom is an awesome bloke &amp; loves my hubby to bits &amp; fully respects us &amp; our kid, also knowing full well my in-laws are assholes who cannot be trusted). \n\nThe groom said to us he was going to call his wifeâs bluff &amp; put her thru hell for doing this to us. \n\nSo as of now hubby &amp; I are not in the wedding party &amp; will not be attending the wedding. \n\nAre we the assholes????

      "title": "AITA for thinking my mom shouldn't get any of my dad's inheritance?",
      "description": "My dad has been married to my mom for more than 15 years. My dad used to always say that my mom was the happy and social half to his more quiet and reserved personality. Additionally, he's worked 27 years of his live to support the marriage and is currently retired at 59. Since I'm 16, I have trouble remembering exactly how far this goes back, but I remember that at least over the last 4 years my mom has been abusive. We think that she's developed some form of bipolar disorder but we can't be sure because she refuses to get herself assessed. She's been in denial over the state of my parents' marriage, called my dad a drunk loser and harassed him when he was struggling with his alcohol addiction, falsely accused him many times of having an affair with absolutely no substantial reason to believe so, and refuses to accept that she's wrong (one time yelling at us because we disagreed with her about Jell-O being healthy). Moreover, she's said that hitting her kids makes her \"feel like she's doing her motherly duty\" and one time pushed my dad to the floor (when he was 58). I feel like for the majority of my life my dad has been the only one I can turn to because he can understand me and my brother and manages to be rational. My dad has been nothing but a selfless giver to my family, and my mom still complains about what he provides and calls him manipulative. One night when I was with my dad, he confessed to me that the only reason he hasn't divorced my mother is because he can't afford to pay the alimony and he needs to have money for sending me and my brother to college. He cried and told me this while my mother was slamming her fist against the door and saying to \"not listen to him because he's manipulating you.\" He continued by saying that when he dies, he's going to try to find a way to split as much money as he can between me and my brother and attempt to leave nothing behind for my mother. This is where personally I think my situation is morally questionable. I'm comfortable saying that I don't love my mom and I also believe that she isn't *entitled* to any of the money and I don't want to forgive her, but my moral values also conflict and make me think \"well we should at least leave her something.\"  \nWhat should I do?  \n",

      "description": "I had a psychiatrist appointment in san jose and cyrus/aia wanted to go to a dollar store to shop. I suggested that they should come with me because the 99 had way better produce and we could get some pho or something. Cyrus was adamant about getting in n out. Aia and I agreed on noodles. I had no objections to doing both. Before my appointment I had to mess with my printer to get it to work so we leave a little late and I apologize to aia because we couldn't drop her resume off somewhere she wanted to work. On the way, Aia discovers she can't do her reading on the 17 northbound because of all of the movement. She tells me the reading is due at 7. My psych appointment takes an hour as predicted and ended up being extremely emotionally taxing. (I did tell them 30 minutes to an hour before we left) Cyrus and Aia apparently go to in n out during such. When they come back with my car 15 minutes after my appointment ended, Aia tells me she left room for noodles. So I figure, yeah let's go get noodles. I drive us to a pho place 15 minutes away and when we get there, cyrus says we should leave. Aia complains that it's expensive and that I said pho is $6 to $8.(I'm from LA) It was really $10 to $11 and that turns out to be average for San Jose. Therefore, she is not eating. Cyrus offers to pay for her meal but she refuses. At this point, I'm hungry and have a massive headache so I decide to eat. Cyrus asks me if I can take it to go and I say no because rice noodles go bad pretty fast. Im pretty disappointed that im eating alone here but I eat as fast as possible without throwing up so we can go. It was a pretty big bowl so it took like half an hour. We go to the 99 15 minutes away to do our grocery shopping and we head back home to santa cruz. On the way back, we encounter a ton of traffic and I apologize to Aia again. From here, Cyrus starts exploding at me saying that I asked them to come with me and that we never made plans to get noodles. He says I'm a dick for eating the noodles when no one else was eating and when he said I should take it to go/we should leave that should have been my cue to just not eat and that it essentially translates to we dont have time for this. Eventually I stop listening because I have a huge problem with people yelling in general and they both know this. I tell them that if we didn't have time, they should tell me there isn't time instead of just saying we should leave because I cant read their minds. (Make your needs be known/be direct) They just claim that I'm flipping it on them and that I'm saying they should have done more. Unbeknownst to me, Aia just wasnt doing her homework and absolutely needed to be at home to read something on her phone that was in her pocket. I was going to apologize to Aia about this whole thing, but something about being yelled at and insulted for an hour by her boyfriend made me not want to. At this point, my medication wears off and I just start putting minimal effort into the conversation by just making snarky semantic arguments to push him off more.",

      "description": "Iâm a college senior and our break between semesters just started. This had been a particularly rough semester for me so I opted to stay around campus for a few days after my last final was over. I told my family I would be home before the holidays, but didnât say a specific date. My family took offense to this, but I tried to explain I just needed time to myself. All my roommates had left so I had peace and quiet which I had desperately needed. My dad was not a fan of this at all. Anytime I talked to him he said I needed to come home and that I couldnât still be near campus for any good reason. I love my dad and understand he just wants me home, but when I am home he just works. I donât see him at all. Iâm not exaggerating when I say he works every single day for 12+ hours. I asked him if he would take a day off to catch up and spend time together but he told me he had no plans to do so until Christmas. Disappointed but understanding I accept I probably wonât see him until Christmas or Christmas Eve. \n\nWhen home my parents often revert to treating me like Iâm a kid again and I donât appreciate it. I manage with it since I do stay in their houses when I come home, so I should respect their rules. But my goal was to just unwind in an environment where I didnât have to think about other people. I donât feel bad about needing time to myself but want to check Iâm not being rude to my family by doing so. \n\nIâll be home today but I donât think it was unreasonable for me to not rush home. My mom also works a lot &amp; my sister is busy with her kids. Their lives donât stop when I come home and I end spending much of my time at home alone anyways. Iâd rather be alone where I full reign over myself. Where can drink a glass of wine without being lectured about it or go out with friends without being constantly called and texted about my whereabouts. \n\nSo am I the asshole here? \n\n(Just to clarify, I know bills need to be paid! Iâm not mad that he works but my dad is a workaholic. Has been since I was a kid. Will go months to a year without taking a day off. It put a lot of strain on his marriage with my mom and eventually contributed to their divorce)",

      "description": "So hereâs the background. Iâm not a professional photographer by any means. Iâm learning how to do it on my own. I have a cousin that wants to be a model and frequently asks me to take photos with her, and itâs generally a fun experience and itâs no issue. We both get something out of it, so no one charges anyone.\n\nIn comes my problem: I decided to maybe start branching out. I donât have a job, so these shoots would be even more exciting if I knew I was getting a little money in my pocket. Iâm still learning how to do it, though, and didnât feel right charging people for pictures that may still be subpar. I also would have to get a business license if it goes too far. \n\nSo I scheduled to take pictures of C1 (Cousin 1, the model cousin) this week and C2 (a cousin on the other side of the family) this weekend. C1 has made sure multiple times that Iâm involved in the collaboration (we take artsy pictures sue us) and has even said she wonât do the pictures if Iâm not excited too. C2 is different. So far this is feeling a lot like work and an actual shoot. Sheâs decided to bring other people in on the shoot, which is honestly fine? But itâs people Iâve never met and I have really bad social anxiety so it just makes it even less fun. She even asked if I could drive to another city to take the pictures, which was quickly declined because I donât have anything to reimburse my gas money.\n\nI realize I canât charge her now, but I was considering charging people (even family) from now on if both shoots turn out good. This experience has made me really hate doing all this work and still not having any money. The problem is, she has multiple siblings who want pictures too, but Iâd be charging them if I enacted my new rule. I wouldnât be charging C1 as we do artsy collaborations and her family consistently does things for me anyway so it wouldnât feel right to charge her.\n\nSo my question is, if I cut off free photo shoots after C2 and only gave free shoots to C1 doing pictures I enjoy, WIBTA?",

The emphasis isn't to be accusatory, but rather reverent. *She* is incredible. Smoking hot, funny, total package. The thing is, I'm afraid I'm starting to let it affect our friendship. I know, rationally, they aren't trying to exclude me or make me feel like a third wheel, but when they start doing their couple-y, cutesy thing when we're out with friends it just...idk, it makes my skin crawl and I feel almost dirty for having seen it. Like it's something I wish they'd keep private, you know. It's even worse if they kiss because part of me can't help resenting my friend for sleeping with their own gf. \n\nOne of our other friends commented the other day that I seem to have gotten more outgoing. Which I guess is true enough because whenever I'm around *her* I feel like I have to be \"on\" all the time. \"Look at me! I'm funny! I'm cool! I'm even pretty good-looking so why haven't you noticed me?\" \n\nTL;DR: AITA for wanting J's girl? ",

The dog was shaking, it was around 40-45 degrees out, also very dirty and had twigs caught in it's fur. It was alone and apparently came into the store last week but was shooed away. A couple said they know who it belongs to but refused to take it saying\"just put it back out on the street, we don't want it smelling our car\", it had no collar. We called animal control and the answer machine said they don't work weekends. Me and my coworker by order of our manager we're to walk around the corner of the store and leave it. Bare in mind coyotes live in our neighborhood I was afraid they might get it. Just before letting it go a family (mother, father and two small children) asked about the situation, they offered to take the dog in for the night as they were also worried, the father said he would take it to get looked for a chip in the morning and they went on there way with the dog. I was later berated by a woman that said that I shouldn't have given the dog to strangers and that it probably belong to somebody, she said they probably knew that the dog was worth a lot of money and would just end up keeping it.

After I was born it got a little worse my mom started throwing fits because I was getting more attention than her. Eventually (according to my dad) she would starts fights so she could leave. She would leave for weeks at a time and then one day just show back up for a few days and she would start another fight. Sometime in 2006 she cheated on my dad and had a baby. The baby was taken because when it was born it was having withdraws from something so they tested the baby (and my mom)  both of them had meth in their system so my dad got his name off of the birth certificate and adopted the baby out of the family. The fights kept happening and my mom kept leaving for weeks at a time. About a year and a half later my mom cheated AGAIN with a different person who we will call G and low and behold she got pregnant. My dad said enough was enough and filed for divorce. The divorce happened and my little (half) brother who we will call B was brought into the world (and my mom stole my dads cat). Everything was fine for a while. Until my moms boyfriend (G) moved in with her. He was abusive as hell he would hurt B and I, my mom. G's friends eventually started making death threats towards me and B. My mom started picking up G's habits and would hit me and B (like a lot). So I begged my dad to keep me home. This went on for about a year until my mom decided that she wanted a new life and moved to a different state. I went and saw her the Christmas of that year. After that Me nor my dad heard anything from her. Not for FOUR years. Then one Christmas there's a gift card with a lot of money on it and a big letter of \"how she thinks about me everyday\" and \"how we need to rebuild our relationship\". I called her we talked for two weeks and shes silent again for about a year suddenly shes in town and demands that I see her. We went swimming at a hotel, and had food. Another 2 years of silence and boom another big gift card and another letter. I decided that I didn't want to talk to her because of all iv'e heard. Fast forward to a few weeks ago and I find that shes cyber stalking me. I blocked her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

My father passed away 5 years ago, which put a lot of economic strain on all of us.\n\nI caught my brother coming home obviously high on many occasions, Iâm not sure what the specific drugs he is using, but I have seen some in his room on his desk. It bothers me a lot so I decided to sneak onto his phone when he was asleep, search keywords on the iMessage search bar like âdrugs,â âweed,â and âbuy.â \n\nI found this guy who doesnât say much but says just amounts of money, so I figured this was his dealer, I deleted the convo and changed my contact name to the dealers one.\n\nA few days later I got the text asking to purchase a âdubâ I told him yes and found out a dub was a gram amount or something. I had no idea what he was gonna buy but I played along and told him to meet me at a nearby address.\n\nI waited there for him and when he got there he immediately froze. I asked him what he was doing here and he lied saying he was going to meet up with John, (a close friend of ours) I told him I knew he was coming here for drugs. \n\nHe was very upset, saying he doesnât understand the stress he is under. I replied with I know youâre under stress but drugs arenât a healthy solution to your problems.\n\nWe talked more and eventually I convinced him to let me take him home. We drove back in silence, he explained that he wanted to try to get help. So I scheduled a doctors appointment for him to see if we can get a therapist. I donât know how much thatâll cost but Iâm starting a job soon so that I can afford it.\n\nOverall I feel it was a good ending but me going through his phone was a violation of his privacy. I donât know if âthe ends justify the means,â but I donât feel bad for going through his phone, just wanted to know if Iâm in the wrong so I can apologize.\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Background: I have a really good friend, almost like a younger sibling to me. They have recently had an extremely close relative die, and are struggling quite a bit with it. Think nuclear family member. I'd like to keep the exact relation vague, but will provide it if needed. I live across the country from them (US) and I know I'm about all the support system they have. Parents are jerks, SO is pretty self-centered, and not a lot of close friends.\n\nIt should be blatantly obvious that I should make myself available for calls and such for a while, and help them out.\n\nHowever, this friend calls me about every bit of drama they have. SO issues, family issues, work issues, mental health issues... you get the picture. Meanwhile, I feel like the support goes one way sometimes. I have been able to share some of my problems with this friend, but I have to ask for the time focused on me, whereas it feels like they just assume I am available to lend an ear at any given time.\n\nI have a lot going on personally right now, and am honestly exhausted emotionally. I also know that this particular case is not just drama for my friend, but a genuinely horrible experience. I've lost someone of this particular relation myself, and I know not having a support system is horrible. But I just mentally and emotionally don't have the energy to deal with their pain right now.\n\nWould I being a self-centered asshole if I don't make myself available much when my friend needs me right now?",

      "description": "Long story short my girlfriend knew someone back in high school that was in a really bad spot due to drugs and things of that nature. That friend has since had 2 kids and has another one on the way and knows absolutely nothing about taking care of kids. Sheâs basically homeless and does not take proper care of her kids at all. \n\nMy girlfriend has loved kids and wanted a baby for as long as sheâs been able to walk. I admire that part about her very much. She fell in love with one of them and that baby just turned 1 year old. My girlfriend insists on taking her every weekend she has off work for most of the weekend. The mother is all too willing to not have to take care of one of her kids so thatâs never a problem. \n\nI have a few issues with this. we live in a pretty small 1 bedroom apartment and have a dog as well. When she has the baby we have our dog locked up all day and night because sheâs concerned about the baby. The apartment also gets absolutely trashed over the time that the baby is with us. She always says that she will clean it afterwords and she does most of the time but I canât stand our home being a mess for that long. And tbh itâs just crowed with all of the babies stuff.  She also spends a lot of money on the baby on new clothes, food, diapers, equipment like bottles or high chairs.\n\nShe gets so much joy out of babysitting that when I object in any way she reacts like Iâm destroying everything that makes her happy and that I want nothing more than for her to be miserable. I donât have any problem with her babysitting for a day or something along the lines of that but 3 days straight seems excessive to me. \n \n__TL;DR__ AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to watch a baby all weekend in our small apartment even though itâs what she lives for? \n\n",

He called me down to go do the dishes I voiced my reluctance but went down anyways he tells me to make sure to clean the dishes before I put them in start running the hot water to clean the pots and pans. I start loading the forks and knives and he yells at me asking why Iâm not running the hot water. I say Iâm putting the utensils in first and if he wants to do it his way he can do it himself.  5-10 minutes in he walks in and notices I put in a plate withought cleaning it at all and freaks out saying I did it on purpose to go against him proceeds to take it out and throws aggressively into the sink breaking it. Mind you I put it in dirty completely on accident.  So were arguing over how Iâm not doing it the right way and I say you can do it then if you want to do it your way and walk out. Iâm wondering if Iâm the asshole here by not listening to what he said or if he is by overreacting and making assumptions. ",

      "title": "WIBTA for cutting ties with my grandmother?",
      "description": " I have two surviving grandparents, both on my dad's side. They're in their late 70s. I haven't been on speaking terms with my grandfather for years, but I stayed on speaking terms with my grandmother until very recently. The key context to understand is that my grandfather has a long history of abusive behaviour towards the rest of the family and eventually - after far too many second chances - my parents, me, and my sister have all cut ties and told him not to visit us.    \n\n\nMy grandmother isn't like him. In fact, in all fairness, she's always a polite enough person to talk to, she's a nice enough person to fundraise for charity regularly (ironically, for an anti-child abuse charity), and I actually have a few nice childhood memories of my own with her. The thing is though, I resent that she's supported my grandfather through all his abuse towards the rest of the family and I resent her obsession with keeping up appearances. I see her as his enabler and I don't think she's ever going to change.  \n\n\nMy dad agrees with me about all of her faults but he still takes the high road and keeps up a relationship with her because she's his mum, because she's not the actual abuser, because he thinks she's had her standards for acceptable behaviour warped by 50+ years of living with my grandfather and because he doesn't think she would cope well if he stopped speaking to her. My dad's probably right about every one of those points, including the last one.  \n\n\nUnlike my dad, I'm at the point now where when she's tried to call/text I've decided not to answer, and I passed on the chance to see her the last few times I've been in the area. I haven't explicitly told her I don't want anything to do with her yet because calling/texting just to say that seems unnecessarily dramatic, but obviously I'm bound to run into her eventually and that is pretty much how I feel. To be honest though, it wouldn't be that stressful/traumatic for me to go back to occasionally replying to her texts and making small talk/ignoring the elephant in the room when I run into her every 4 months or so (I don't live in the area any more so the only time I might run into her is when I visit my parents), it'd just feel fake and awkward to me. \n\n  \nSince I can cope either way, I'm second guessing if it would be better to maintain some token contact with her because I'm sure hearing what I really think will have my grandmother in tears, and because me being honest might make it harder for my dad who's trying to maintain a relationship with her (To be absolutely clear, I'm under no pressure from my dad on this, he knows his parents are messed up and he's encouraged me to handle it in whatever way's best for me).   \n\n\n**Hence my question, would I be the asshole if next time I see her I go with my instinct and tell her she's out of second chances with me and she should stop trying to call/text me?**  \n\n\n**For context, here's a recap of our family drama and her part in it:**\n\n* She stood by for my grandfather's physical and verbal abuse towards my Dad and Uncle in their childhoods (I didn't learn this until after most of the below).\n* She stood by/never said a word throughout several incidents of my grandfather yelling abuse and foul language at me in my teenage years, including in front of my little sister.\n* When I was 19, I stood up for myself, and my grandfather hit me and burst my lip. My grandmother pulled a head in the sand routine, didn't get in touch to ask if I was okay and stopped visiting (back then I was used to seeing her every day). My grandfather eventually made what seemed like a genuine apology and - to my regret - I accepted it. After that, she reappeared again and tried to act as though nothing had ever happened. When I confronted her about that behaviour, she apologised and promised never to do it again.\n* A year later my grandfather takes issue with my mum telling him to keep his dog on a leash when he visits, waits until she's alone and starts screaming in her face that she doesn't know anything and was a nobody before she married into his family. We react by telling my grandfather he's out of second chances, and to stay away from us. My grandmother reacted by pulling the exact same head in the sand routine for months. Even years later, she's never accepted my mum's version of events and spent the next few months saying she couldn't cope, and we should forgive him without an apology because he's family. \n* A few months later, my grandfather had a stroke and it wasn't clear how long he had left so my dad - to his regret - decided to patch things up after all. A couple of months after that, my grandfather's fully fit and involved in our lives again. He starts a shouting match and calls my dad a failure for downsizing the family business (my dad was about to undergo surgery for the second time in 2 years). When my dad finally draws the line and tells him no more second chances he drives away threatening to spread rumours about my parents in the local community to damage my parent's business. My grandmother was there and said nothing.\n* Over the next few months, we gradually find out my grandfather's told the local community (extended family, neighbours, almost everyone my parents do business with) a series of lies, including that my 'ungrateful' parents cut ties with him and a completely false story where I hit him and he had to defend himself. We learned from extended family that my grandmother had been there whilst my grandfather was telling those lies to them. My grandmother denies it and denies that her husband would even do that, but I don't believe her. She's also tried to tell us we shouldn't have told people outside the family about my grandfather hitting me.\n* She told me and my then 17 year old sister she was contemplating suicide to pressure us into forgiving him for her sake. Maybe she genuinely was and at the time I reacted with a lot of sympathy, even though I refused to do what she was asking. Looking back though, I think it was wrong to put that on her grandchildren rather than blame her husband or discuss her problems with her friends and adult children.\n* It's been a few years since all of the above, my parents, my sister and I eventually reached out to my grandmother and told her we'd like to have a relationship with her but not her husband. We kind of made it work and got to a place where she would visit us for half an hour or so every other Sunday and avoid talking about my grandfather. Even after everything though, she clearly doesn't respect our decision to cut ties with her husband and she's asked us three or four times if we'll 'stop being awkward' and give him another chance 'because he's family'. \n* In October last year she brought my grandfather to the family home for the first time in years on the day before my sister was leaving for university, claiming he's still her grandfather and entitled to be there for big family moments and get a picture with her. My sister - the only one who was home - refused and asked them to leave, but it still really upset her. That was the last straw for me and I haven't spoken to my grandmother since.   \n ",

      "title": "AITA for not taking back my fiancÃ©e after I tried very hard for very long, and not saying it's because she slept with other guys while we were separated?",
      "description": "My fiancÃ©e believes I cheated on her. I did not, but she has big reasons to believe so. She caught me red-handed literally, it's just someone plunged my hand in their blood while I was asleep and unaware, and she doesn't believe that part. So, she believes I cheated on her and it is hard to blame her for believing so, as if she believed me she would be kind of a fool. But I never cheated on anyone.\n\nI really wanted to fix our relationship, I made all the oathes, all the promises, professed our love all I could. I tried hard, and I tried long. But all she was seeing was that I cheated on her and I wouldn't admit to it. Eventually she broke off the relationship as she couldn't see it work. I tried to avoid reaching harrassment-level, but I still for a while reached to her trying to appeal to her how our relationship was the greatest. I stopped when she started seeing other men so casually that even I knew. The stop was abrupt. Not a complete stubborn no-contact, and I didn't give a reason, but contact between us used to be me trying again and again to convince her, and suddenly it was just her sometimes asking about mundane things about our past common interests.\n\nWe've been separated for about six months. Recently she's reached out to me asking if we could see to go back to our relationship, and she mentionned possibly to the engagement. I told her no, that we're better as friends with a history now. However, considering how everyone saw me pursue her long and hard, with my life, the drastic difference that came abruptly is understandably puzzling. She's confused about what changed, and she pressured me for answers. I told her I don't think she believes me now that I'm innocent, and it wouldn't be good for either of us to live in such a relationship with that big an awkward stain. Well, it's true that it is one of my reasons. But that was the case from the start and that didn't stop me from pursuing her long and hard at first. She's still asking about why now that became \"don't even think of getting back together.\"\n\nWell I have reason two. I just don't want to get back to someone I was engaged to, who then broke up with me and slept with other people. That situation is not marriage material to me. All I can see is she had the opportunity to not go to other people, and she discarded that opportunity. When I commit to someone to the point that I want to marry them, we will have no such thing to deal with. As far as I'm concerned, we were meant to be until she made us not meant to be. I don't think she did bad. I think I would waste valuable time of my life being with her when I could be spending it finding my best life instead. Exploring other great people who'd be great life partners without having to deal with them going elsewhere when they feel like it. Or just making the best of being single.\n\nBut I don't feel like telling her that. All she'll hear and tell everyone is me accusing her of cheating anyway.",

      "description": "About a year ago, I met a pretty awesome girl , that I will call Jackie, that I instantly liked. She is super funny,interesting and definitely my type. We hit it off pretty well and right from the start we talked a lot. Three months after we meet I asked Jackie out , she said no. Jackie mentioned she felt like she didn't know me well enough to date. This was pretty hard on me and I considered unfriending Jackie here but after a discussion with her I decided not to. \n\nA couple of months later, once I thought I was over her I dated another girl that I will call Paige, but after two months I realized I did not like Paige but rather still liked Jackie. As soon as I realized this I broke up with Paige. \n\nConsidering that the original reason that Jackie had given me to reject me was that we didn't each other, I thought that maybe now I had a chance. After waiting for the break-up with Paige to be less fresh , I started flirting with Jackie again.  We texted almost every night. Things seemed to be going well, Jackie was very responsive to my texts, invited me lunch and other things she participated in.\n\n I decided I had to talk to her about my feelings again. I felt that asking Jackie out again might be insensitive so I didn't ask her out again and just told her I had feelings for her. Jackie this time told she felt we weren't compatible. For multiple reasons including fear of not moving on from her if we stayed friend and not wanting to be a mess like the last time she rejected me. I decided to cut her out of my life. \n\nTL:DR Hit it off with a girl asked her out , got rejected became really good friends with her and after 9 month told her I had feeling for her , got rejected again, decided to cut her out my life.",

      "description": "I have this friend I have known for a long time and we used to have really interesting political discussions. He always had really strong opinions and I always enjoyed a good political or philosophical discussion.\n\nYears went by and I noticed that he became more and more radical in his viewpoints. The change didnât occurred overnight. Anyway the more I was discussing with him the more I felt uncomfortable with his viewpoints. The thing is that heâs really intelligent and can spin any argument to feel rational and straightforward even when you realize that the conclusion is âwe should forbid Muslim people from naming their babies the with an Arabic nameâ or âwe should forbid them walking down the street wearing a djellabaâ.\n\nMaybe for context I should indicate that weâre French and over here there is a strong political undercurrent against Muslims. He never acknowledge it clearly but I strongly suspect him to subscribe to the far right political party in France (the Front National). Thatâs a big no-no in polite society, here.\n\nAll of my other friends cut bridges with him. They told me I should do the same. The thing is that I still like him. I just donât want to talk politics with him anymore. Heâs having health difficulties and I suspect his pain is bringing to the forefront all his dark ideas. I personally believe that we all have prejudices inside of us but we know better and try to overcome them but itâs harder to do when youâre in pain because you just want to hate the world and you then have an easy target.\n\nIs being friend with an asshole makes me an asshole by association?\n",

      "description": "Context: I (18 y/o) suffered an accident about a month ago, and part of my recovery is to walk a lot every day. I take a cane with me just in case, through I'm not visibly disabled and walk pretty well, though I get tired after walking a long way. A few days I go, on return trip from my walk, I was tired and a bit hungry, decided to stop by a Burger King. \n\nAs I was going through the doors, I wasn't paying much attention, mostly from being tired and lost in throught about something else, and a stranger that was exiting just before I was entering held the door open for me. I didn't acknowledge him or say thank you, see being tired and lost and thought, but I still recognize that I was rude regardless.\n\nAfter I passed, I only realized that the door was held open for me because the helpful stranger said *\"You're welcome\"* in a quite annoyed way after waiting for my \"thank you\" that never came, and he left. At the time I felt pretty bad, only then realizing my mistake, but then I got annoyed that the stranger seemed to be offended that I, a tired young person walking around with a cane, didn't say thank you, and decided to voice his offense in a snide \"you're welcome\"\n\nThis is probably an incredibly insignificant AITA post, but after thinking about it I really want to know what y'all think. Who's more of an asshole, me who didn't say thank you, or the guy who gave a snide \"you're welcome\"?",

      "description": "Throwaway because my friends know my Reddit. \n\nThere are five us in our friend group ranging from 23 to 15 and we are doing a challenge. Anytime someone in the group calls you, you have to answer on speaker no matter what. The only exceptions are school, funerals/weddings, and church. We all put a hundred bucks in a jar and the last one to not answer the phone wins the game. Two of our friends have already dropped out so all that is left is me(F15), my boyfriend Q(15), and our friend R(M16). We've been going back and forth for about 2 weeks at this point. \n\nWell, Q and I decided to call R after school while we were working on our homework and the call went like this. We called him, he answered and Q asked him if was excited for this raging college party on Friday night our oldest friend(M) got us into, btw there was no party, and R was confused. Q and I jokingly tried to remind him of all the booze and drugs that would be there and he kept denying it, growing more and more nervous to the point of stuttering. The nail of the coffin came when I said something along the lines of \"You remember Clarissa, that smoking hot senior from M's sorority? Well she can't wait for you to do more body shots\" Q died laughing and we expected the same from R but all we heard was his mom yelling at him to hang up, so he did. Yesterday at school R told us we got him grounded, his phone confiscated and chores up to his eyelids. Not to mention he isn't allowed out of the house unsupervised for two months. \n\nR told us to go fuck ourselves and hasn't spoken to us since. Q felt bad and apologized to him and is somewhat on his good side but I kinda don't feel bad. He could've said when he answered the phone that his mother was there like we all do when we get a call with our parents nearby but he decided not to. I feel bad that he got put on essentially house arrest but I don't regret the call. The group is split down the middle with M on my side and our other friend on R's side. Q is on the fence but is trying to get me to apologize so we can all just be friends. I refused and still do. \n\nBut I've been thinking about it more and I don't know if I'm in the wrong here for not apologizing so I came here to Reddit during my class freetime. Am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "In August I moved in with two of my high school friends and a friend of a friend (FoF) who needed a place to stay. In September or October we signed an agreement to live together again because our rental agency wanted to know if they needed to start showing our place. We had talked about living together before and after signing the agreement, and at no point did anyone hesitate to agree. It's not a legally binding lease, more of a gentleman's agreement that reserved our apartment for the next year. \n\nThis past weekend one of my high school friends and FoF told us they're moving out at the end of the current lease. I'm not as upset with FoF because she understands that what she did isn't cool and she fucked us over, but my friend doesn't think he did anything wrong because we hadn't signed an actual legally binding lease. Since we had agreed to live together again I didn't start looking for housing until now. Of the 13 properties I have inquired about (a total of 40ish units) I've found 3 units that are available. Most people sign leases in November/December for August move in dates so it's pretty picked over.\n\nI'm not mad that they want to move out. I'm mad they backed out on our agreement to live together, waited until now to tell us (leaving me with very limited options for housing), and that my friend doesn't understand why I don't think what he did is acceptable.

After graduation we both moved back to our hometowns (which arenât too far apart) to live with our parents and save some money before moving in together.\n\nSince iâm back in my hometown iâve been seeing my old friend group much more regularly and honestly itâs been great. Back in high school my house was always the hang out spot and since iâve been back thatâs pretty much how itâs been going as well. itâs close to everyone, on a major street and has enough room to accommodate everyone. My friend group is amazing and iâm very lucky to have them i would be lost without these people. \n\nHowever a friend and i recently had a disagreement and they told me they hated my significant other (in an effort to hurt me i guess). We are back on talking terms even though our friendship took a hit after that. They (the friend) is back to coming over and hanging out.\n\nMy problem now is that my s/o and i are about to move in together-from all indications it seems like my friend group is expecting my new place to be the hang out spot again since itâs not too far from my old place and has all the benefits sans my momâs cookies :,)  \n\nI am uncomfortable with the idea of my friend coming over to my new apartment if they do not like my s/o. Itâs not just my place anymore-itâs my s/oâs home as well. personally, i would be upset if my s/o brought someone into my home who does not like me/would be glad if we broke up so I am trying to extend the same courtesy.\n\nThis friend and I have been friends for many many years and this fight is one of maybe a handful weâve ever had. It feels strange to be moving somewhere know my house wont have that open door policy weâve always had anymore. \n\nI have not spoken to anyone about this as I feel like I am being forced to choose between two people i love very much and donât know how to relay this story to others verbally without sounding biased towards one side or the other. \n\nWIBTA if I shirked hosting duties? WIBTA if I straight up told my friend iâm uncomfortable with them coming over since they hate my s/o? I feel that if I stop hosting altogether it will be significantly harder to get everyone together but if thatâs the right thing to do i really canât complain. \n",

      "description": "Tomorrow, my parents and I were invited to eat homemade dinner at my brother's girlfriend's house. I offered to make mini cupcakes. I spent the better part of two hours baking them. They had cooled and I was just about to pack them up and hide them because my dad is notorious for grazing off of foods, and he will eat and eat if no one's there to stop him.\n\nSure enough, in walks my dad. He beelines for the cupcakes with arms outstretched. I physically put my body in front of them and say no while trying furiously to shove them into a Tupperware without ruining them. \"I can have just one!\" he laughed, I laughed and hissed at him jokingly, which got more laughs. I figured he would stop at that, but he's still going for a cupcake. I managed to block him out and walk away. The mood was still light and playful (or so I thought). I told him he can have as many as he wants tomorrow, they're not even iced yet. I had the exact amount to make a perfect grid of cupcakes in my holder and I wanted to impress my brother's gf. I walked away with the cakes and that is that.\n\nFast forward two hours, my mom came home with groceries and I could get started on the frosting. She also brought home some fresh fried chicken wings she bought for Grampa's dinner (she's his caretaker). She said she got an extra one that Dad and I can share. I offer half and he didn't want it. I said ok, so I make funny \"Mmm! Yummy!\" sounds as I eat it. He joked, \"well maybe I do,\" and reached a hand out. I jokingly pulled back and said, \"I changed my mind!\" although I fully intended to give him his half.\n\nWell I'll be damned if he didn't explode. He yelled, \"well I don't want it now! You always do this! You play games and act like a child! Like with the fucking cupcakes!\" and he stormed off to his office while kicking things.\n\nNow I'm left wondering if I was being too petty and immature for not letting him have a mini cupcake. He's in the kitchen now baking boxed brownies that he's made clear are just for himself. He's fucking diabetic and doesn't need a whole box. I still need to make frosting, but don't want to be in the same room as him. \n\nAm I the asshole because I didn't let him have even a single cupcake? Or for playing games with the chicken? Am I always playing games?? I feel bad.",

Him saying this, meant that I could not say anything to him outright\n\nThings reached a new low yesterday, and he decided to break up with her. I nudged along some things, and brought some thoughts forward which he already had. You can say I'm indirectly responsible for him reaching that decision, although, he was going to take that decision some day. The only thing stopping him was it was his first love, so he was a stupid idiot in love. \n\nThing is, I should feel guilty, shouldn't I? Instead, I can't stop a grin coming to my face. She's toxic as fuck; she screamed at him to stay away from her, blocked him on a whim, and she's being repeating the same arguments every time they fight, which is pretty frequent. He's family, he's like a brother to me. \n\nAITA for feeling happy that he's breaking up? Should I feel guilty about it? ",

It got quieter since i sort of yelled.\n\nHe said \"calm the hell down, it's not that serious. jeez, you're kind of killing the mood...\"\n\nI said I was sorry and didn't say anything after that because I was about to cry because I felt so bad for causing a scene and everyone was probably really annoyed with me.

      "description": "To give some background info, my group of friends (me, friend #1 and friend #2) have been doing just about everything together for almost ten years now. We met in school, and have grown really close. About two years ago a new student (GF) came to our school, and was in all of the same classes as us. Inevitably, we all got to know each other. Personally, I originally tried to keep my distance from GF because we don't really have that much in common, and her loud and outgoing personality can be kind of abrasive to me sometimes.\n\nLast summer, friend #2  and GF started spending a lot of time together because they would go to some of the same youth events. They never really got super close, but when we all came back together for the beginning of this school year, she became a more present member in our friend group.\n\nThe more I got to know about GF, the more I realized that my initial judgements might have been too harsh. But things started getting uncomfortable when she started overtly flirting with friend #1. At first it was kind of funny because we were all kind of flirtatious with each other anyway (we're all just a bunch of silly girls). But after a while, it became clear that this new addition to our group had serious intentions of dating friend #1 despite the fact that friend #1 clearly rebuffed her advances.\n\nFriend #2 and I both talked about this situation together when the flirting and touching never stopped, and decided that we just needed to keep our distance. Friend #1 is now in a relationship with GF, and I want to be supportive because they both seem happy together. The issue is that friend #2 and I believe that the girlfriend is actively trying to cause problems in our friendship, and make us grow apart. We have already talked to her about starting false rumors that friend #2 lied to the GF about friend #1's feelings (which she denies despite there being evidence to refute her story).\n\nAll in all, I am trying to act like it is not a big deal, because it's not my relationship to worry about, and I want my best friend to be happy, but I worry that I will keep growing apart from my best friends because I would rather not be around her GF who I think might be toxic. Now that they are dating, everything I do with friend #1 also includes her GF. Even when we are just meeting up to work on a project for a class that her GF isn't even in.

      "description": "A few months ago, some of my friends got into a falling out with their friends. At the same time I got really depressed and started isolating myself. The three friends (who are all roommates) I think started using me to complete their now-incomplete friendship group. They'd show up at my house unexpectedly, bring food, spend the night... It was nice at the time, because I kept thinking \"everyone actually hates you and just pretends to put up with you\" and having them around also mitigated the loss of my social life. I know that they also spend a lot of time at my house because it's more conveniently located than theirs. But they did take interest in me as a friend as well.\n\nIn the past few weeks, I've been feeling a lot better. I've had a lot of homework to make up, which has taken up a lot of my time. I've been spending time with some new pals from class as well, and all the rest of my time goes to my boyfriend. So I haven't seen a whole lot of the three, but last week I get a text from one of them asking me a question I forget to respond to. The next day, another texts me to check and see how I'm doing, as I hadn't seen her in awhile. It was kind of late, so I fall asleep and forget to answer that, too. I do have a short text conversation with the third a couple days later. In general, I'm not the kind of person that is good at responding to texts.\n\nThree days later, I get a call in the morning from the roommate. I'm half awake in bed, but don't feel like waking up fully to talk, so I figured I'd shoot her a text later. I fall back asleep and end up in a rush to make it to class. I start getting in the shower when I hear a knock on the door. I check my phone quickly to see if anyone mentioned stopping by, but no one has, so I ignore it.\n\nAfter class, I have 2 calls from an unknown number. It's an officer from the police department, checking to make sure I'm okay. Apparently all the unanswered texts were concerning, and after I didn't answer the morning phone call I think the knock on the door was also one of them checking on me. I guess the police was their next idea. I call him back immediately and get it cleared up, and then text them all to let them know I'm fine.\n\nI get they were just worried about me, and I appreciate that. Considering how I've been, it was probably scary. I should have texted them back. But also.... I only had three days of actual no contact with them. I go three days without talking to friends all the time. I had no idea they were that worried. It's not like they even texted me during those three days. I just feel really weird about it all. I think it was a massive overreaction to involve the police. The clinginess of this incident really freaked me out, and I can't really explain why. Naturally, everyone I've told this story to has called me a massive asshole. I still don't really want to be friends anymore though. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": " Iâve been growing closer with a friend whoâs also in my grade, and itâs been nice to get to know her better. We were hanging out in a group of friends and I accidentally exposed the area in which she lived in. She retaliates by exposing my feelings to my crush. I feel like I should end the friendship because while I sometimes have fun with her, a lot of the time, she seems tired of me and is very blunt with me. She doesnât treat any of our other friends like this, and it just sucks. I sent a text a couple of days ago that I unsent, but not before she saw the message. The text came out as slightly pathetic, with me apologizing again, and me basically saying that Iâm sorry that I ruined our friendship and it was nice while it lasted. Weâre in a mutual friend group, so Iâm conflicted on whether I should do what I want and work on trying to repair the friendship with her, or if I should just not be friends with her. I know our friend group would pick her over me, so Iâm not exactly in the position to start a fight. Thanks for listening to my rant.",

      "description": "Obviously a throwaway account. Also sorry if I make any mistakes, English isnât my first language.\n\nMe [M24] and my boyfriend [M26] got together about 5 months ago (weâve known each other for maybe 9 months before that). Iâm very happy with him and heâs pretty much everything Iâm looking for in a guy. Thereâs just one big problem in our relationship...\n\nHaving anal sex with my bf is unbearable for me because he has a really big and thick penis. Itâs not exactly the length thatâs the problem but rather the girth. I am by no means inexperienced when it comes to anal sex, but trying to receive him just hurts like hell. Weâve tried everything we could think of (different positions, different types of massages and relaxation techniques before sex, etc.) but I always end up being in an awful lot of pain anyway.\nI tried enduring it two times, thinking Iâd eventually get used to it, but itâs just not working out the way it should. He obviously doesnât enjoy having sex with someone whose face clearly says âI hate thisâ either.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a very frustrating issue. We both like having sex, but if it doesnât work it just doesnât work, you know? We still pleasure each other orally and with our hands, but at the end of the day that isnât really enough for either of us.\nSwitching positions entirely is no option either since he doesnât enjoy bottoming at all.\nI feel a little guilty and embarrassed about being unable to handle his size, especially after he constantly brought up the fact that his exes had no issue bottoming for him before.\n\nHeâs made two suggestions on how we could fix the problem, but I rejected both of them:\n\n1. Using poppers (I think using them often is dangerous and I donât feel comfortable with the idea of drugging myself up just to have sex)\n2. Having an open relationship (I get that I clearly canât give him what he wants, but ofc I donât want my bf to have sex with other guys while weâre together)\nSince I rejected both ideas, heâs become more and more frustrated with me and accuses me of not caring about the whole thing and evading the problem which isnât true. I just feel like I shouldnât have to give up my principles for the sake of sex, if that makes sense.\nAt this point I just have no idea what to do anymore. I know sex is a really important part of a relationship, but I just hate the idea of breaking up with him over this. Our relationship is pretty much perfect otherwise. He actually feels the same way I do (Iâve made sure to ask him several times), but since we both canât agree on / find a solution, Iâm scared of what might happen...\n\nWhen I asked one of my friends for advice, he told me I should just get over myself and try out one of the methods he suggested, but like I said, I feel like I shouldnât have to give up my principles for the sake of sex. When I explained that, he said Iâm being childish and that itâs essentially my prudishness that keeps us from having a fulfilling sex life. Hearing that hurt and made my guilty feelings even stronger.\n\nAITA for refusing to try out the things my BF suggested and maybe putting our relationship at an even bigger risk that way?",

      "description": "**Note:** Due to having Aspergers, I'm not good at social context.\n\nFirst some back story. I went out with someone for around 3 years. Relationship was amazing for the first 2 years but became began to become toxic when they began to withhold affection, sometimes blanking to me whenever together. This also went to the point of them showing me their Facebook/Phone password in an attempt to find out mine to their own admission. It became worse overtime as they began to start talking more and more about another person rather obsessively, to the point I was suspicious that something more may have been happening. I found out that my ex had cheated on me with this person, however to find out this information I needed to access their Facebook account without them knowing and see a private message they had with someone, confirming to me that they had cheated. I wouldnât normally have done this, however after months of not knowing, the anxiety of this overwhelmed me and caused me to do so. This broke my heart, causing me to lose any trust I had in them. However, due to the way I found this out, I couldnât admit to knowing they had cheated on me as I would have needed to have said how I found this out. Due to this, I held my tongue on the matter and they broke up with me a month later.\n\nAfter all of that, with the anxiety of not knowing if our relationship was going to last for months on end, making it the only thought I had in my mind for months and realising how controlling and manipulative this person actually was afterwards, it left me very distrusting of people and made me numb emotionally and romantically for over a year. Now whenever I think of this person or see a photo of them, I get very anxious and angry at the emotional roller coaster they had put me though and do not want to associate with them ever again. \n\nIn the present, was at a meeting in a pub for a society Iâm a part of, which Iâm on the committee for. Great night until I noticed that my ex came along, to which was the first time I had saw them since we had broken up. A friend of mine took me outside since they said I looked anxious when my ex came in and wanted to know what was up. From telling them why, they said I should talk to the President (one of my best friends) and see what can be done. Messaged them later to ask if we could prevent my ex from coming to meet ups due to the rather bad history I have had with them (there are more things that had happened, but omitted due to word limit). They replied in surprise saying that they didnât want to since they havenât broken any rules at the society, to which I said that with them around I donât feel I would be able to perform my duties for the society with them present.\n\nTLDR: Was in relationship, suspicious of cheating, accessed their fb, I was right, left devastated and emotionally numb for over a year, they come to society meet-up, I leave due to their presence, try to ban from society, president rejects due to not breaking rules\n\n",

We've been together 2 1/2 years. \n\nMy girlfriend \"Julia\" can sometimes be unaware of the social clues people around her are giving off, especially when she has been drinking. \n\nThis was the case last night when we went to go hang out and have dinner at a friend's place. Over the night Julia had a lot of wine and we ended up staying until almost midnight when this happened. \n\nI could tell that our friends really wanted us to leave so they could go to bed but are too nice to actually tell us to leave. It was getting super uncomfortable and Julia just was not picking up on any of this. At one point when we ended up alone in the living room for a minute I whispered to her that \"I think they want to go to bed. We should head out now.\" \n\nShe told me to stop being \"ridiculous\", that they were all having fun and I was trying to ruin her \"good time\". I decided to give it a little longer to see if she would pick up on the hints before I would remind her again that we should leave. \n\nBy the time I reminded her for the second time, it was 12:30 and everybody but Julia was irritated. I asked my friends straight up when Julia was in the bathroom  if they wanted us to leave and they finally said yes. When she came back I told her that they said we should leave but she accused me of lying because I \"just want to go home.\" \n\nI stood up, thanked our friends for having us, and grabbed Julia from behind by her waist, grabbed her stuff and put her in the car. Like I said she's a whole foot shorter so there wasn't much she could do to get out it.\n\nWhen I put her in the car I told her she was being embarrassing and we were going home. She told me to fuck off but didn't say anything else about it until today when I was at work and she texted me that I was being an asshole last night and I shouldn't have picked her up like that, she's not a child, and she doesn't want to talk to me until I apologize. \n\nThat's the thing, I don't know if I should be the one to apologize. She was the one disrespecting everybody's time and not listening to my attempts to get her to pay attention to our friend's hints that we should leave. I didn't know what else to do at that point. \n\nAITA for picking her up like that despite all my other attempts to get her to leave?",

I'm also a person who gets burnt out easily, so I make a point to keep work separate from my home life, when I clock out for the day I want to go straight home or to do the things I want to do.\n\nMy coworkers have been inviting me fairly regularly to hang out with them outside of work. I'm very grateful to be asked, but I'm not particularly interested. We get along well at work and they're a good group of people, but I don't want to hang out with colleagues outside the job. I've given excuses or gently turned them down multiple times now, until one recently confronted me and asked me outright why I never come out.\n\nI did my best to explain to him in as respectful way as possible by saying that I value them as colleagues and feel very fortunate to work with them, I try to keep my personal life separate and I don't really have the time to make new friends right now but am thankful for the offers. He seemed a bit taken aback but accepted my answer.\n\nI told my partner later that night and she said I was being a jerk, and that I should give hanging out with them a chance. I honestly just..don't want to. It's not that I think I'm better than them or anything they did wrong, I'm just not into it. I don't really need work friendships to be happy, I have solid friends right now and don't really need anymore nor do I have the time to invest in building those relationships, I'm happier just keeping to myself. We all get along great at work, I'll gladly socialize with them there but when work ends I kind of just want it to end. Note that \"you need to do this for your job, networking is important\" doesn't really apply in my position, socializing isn't really critical to what I do. This is purely an emotional question.\n\nDoes this make me an asshole?",

      "description": "Okay so my school does a yearly robotics competition. This year was a little bit special because there were many more contestants than usual and many more prizes were to be given.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am a fairly good programmer and electronics technician, objectively in the top 3 in my school. So for the competition I was in charge of the programming, and since no one took responsibility for the electronics, I designed it too. In order for everything to be as repairable as possible and as easily debuggable as possible, I designed the code and the electronic circuits to be as simple as possible while always following my teams requirements (like a good leader should). Not that I don't like bragging but everything I put into that project was objectively perfect, nothing was out of place and each and every thing has it's own unique value and purpose. So although it was not much, it was perfect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy competitor on the other hand made some very exotic way of movement (holonomic drive, very beautiful and practical btw), but everything was imperfect, his controller would disconnect, it would waste too much power etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy favorite, and arguably the best, professor at our school informed me that this guy was to get the prize as the best programmer. Now of course I did not agree with that, I wanted at least to have my code measured and compared to his, my complains hit deaf ears. I protested during the competition being very ironic against the professors and other teams, pointing out every imperfection other robots had. Then back at the lab I got in a huge fight with my friends, among them my best friend, who believed I do not deserve the prize and no comparison should take place because they are different kinds of code. Now, I generally am an asshole, so I informed them that they have no idea what they're talking about, offended them for having attended the same school as me and still being incompetent little shits (I do this all the time, but it's objective, even the professors agree) and stormed out of the lab. I won't be in school anymore this week so this will go unresolved but I'm pretty sure they won't talk to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBTW it is not below me to give github links to both my code and his, and also videos of the robots, so feel free to ask if you want.",

      "description": "I'm currently studying abroad in Europe but before I left (about a month ago) I had to move out of my apartment a couple days before my flight. I talked with a friend (who is with me on this study abroad trip) of mine like a month in advance to make sure it was okay with his roommates that I would stay at their house for 2 nights so I wasn't homeless and they all agreed. I slept on a couch, and in the morning (as I still had classes) would go to school, shower at the gym, go to classes, eat at the cafeteria for lunch, and buy my own snacks/Jimmy John's on the way home for dinner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, it's now about a month later and **my friend tells me** that his roommates insist I pay them $10 to help with the bills. AITA for being reluctant to pay? Honestly it's not that much money (which is an argument that can go both ways) but I would feel so much better about paying if the roommates were to politely ask me themselves during my stay instead of telling my friend to tell me to pay up a month after the fact. I just feel like it was a rude execution on their part but that's for Reddit to decide. I did already pay them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand I should've probably done something or offered to pay a little bit but because I had planned this in advance and it was with a good friend I felt it wasn't super necessary especially since I didn't really use any of their utilities except some internet (which they pay like $30 a month for).",

      "description": "Basically, I am a doctor who graduated from one of the top med schools in the country. Because of this, I know what it takes to make it as a doctor. My eldest daughter is also on a medical track: she goes to a top 20 school and is excelling. She is a junior, and will probably get into one of the best med schools next year. \n\nMy youngest daughter is not like us. For my eldest daughter and I, math and science come more naturally. Itâs not something we need to work hard at. My youngest daughter, however, really struggles with these topics. In college, she has to study for her STEM classes for hours and hours just to get the average grade at a school thatâs not very difficult. \n\nMy daughter, to her credit, is a VERY hard worker and I admire that. However, that hard work could be placed to a field that she can really excel in instead of being a doctor; she will always struggle in med school, but she can take her talents elsewhere and become an amazing law or business major.  \n\nThe drama is that she called me yesterday and told me she had trouble getting accepted with an internship, and asked if she could work with me this summer. I basically told her she should reconsider the medical professions because she spends all day studying and she is barely average, and I donât think she can succeed as a doctor. BUT I reassured her that itâs okay and she can find something else to shine in. On the phone she was really quiet, and I ended the phone call with âI love youâ. After this, I have my eldest daughter, ex-husband, mother, and siblings spamming me and telling me to apologize. Youngest wonât even pick up the phone. \n\nI understand that her feelings may have been hurt and while thatâs valid, I think tough love will help her in the future. For example, it may have hurt her feelings when she was younger because I wouldnât let her eat cookies for dinner, but as a parent you need to protect your children, even when it hurts them in the short term. \n\nTl;dr: Told daughter she wonât succeed as a doctor, now everyone is mad.

      "description": "My boyfriend and his brother are 4 years apart and growing up his brother has always been  a role model to him. My boyfriend loves him dearly and is like his right hand man. \n\nBut personally I never liked him. Can you guess why? He's really open about being a white supremacist and goes on \"left wings suck\",\"every other race is lazy\" rants on facebook a few times every month. The one time I met him though he was actually chill, and didn't really seem to take my race into account. I'm black by the way.\n\nMy boyfriend himself almost never brings up my race and honestly has this kind of intolerance to talk about it. Everytime I'd say some playful stereotype like \"Black people do this ____\" he just turns into a brick and you can just tell he doesn't want to talk about it. \n\nIt seems I'm the only one who's slightly conscious about race because before we got together - his fantasies surrounded white women and just out of paranoia/insecurities I would question if he's satisfied with dating me - to which he would reassuee me.\n\nHis brother was arrested 5 days ago for attempted kidnapping, assault, and hate crime. From what we know - he was in the parking lot of a club where he got into an argument with a black man because he was smoking in front of his car (he's really defensive about his health because his immune system is shit). When the guy was walking away he continued yelling racial slurs at him, and swung on him from behind. He beat him and attempted to push him inside the trunk of his SUV before a security guard intervened. \n\nThe first few nights my boyfriend was an indenial brick who refused to talk about it so I respected it and we carried on as normal. Just last night he came over and we were watching Happy Feet. The whole time I could see on his face that he was in deep deep thought, and just looked like he desperately wanted to say something. I asked if he was okay and it took him a minute before he said \"Yeah...I don't think Connor was wrong\" and that basically killed every mood. As our conversation progressed he revealed  that he's gonna side with his brother no matter what and this wasn't an exception. \n\nI'm asking if I'm the asshole because I feel like we've been together for 6 mos and race has never been an issue. He's not the bad guy, and it's really out of what transpired his brother did - and his choice to stand by him. I do want to end things with him. \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to break up with my girlfriend?",
      "description": "So I just need some advice on this because I've been having an internal conflict on the subject for a while now. \n\n  My Girlfriend and I have been together for about 3 years now and I meet her towards the end of my senior year in HS. I had just gotten out of a pretty length and grueling toxic relationship, and truthfully, I never intended on hopping back into another one so soon (roughly a month after my breakup, we started talking, 2 months later we started dating).  She ended going to school out of state so for the first year and a half our relationship was mostly through screens, we made it work by having movie nights on Skype and trying our best to keep communications up. Aside from the regular issues that every person who has ever done long distance deals with, we fared pretty well. Eventually she came back in state for school and has been here ever since. She's really become my best friend, someone who I can joke around with, speak freely with, and who is extremely supportive of me and my goals. I really do love her.\n\nAnd that's why this is so difficult for me. \n\n  Since the inception of our relationship my girlfriend has always been extremely sexually inexperienced. That in it of itself has never been an issue, I was more than willing to be patient with her and guide her. However, to this day my girlfriend remains a virgin because she has an extreme phobia of penetration.   \n\n  Since the beginning of our relationship I've always made it a clear point that sex was a really important factor to me in a relationship, as I'm a pretty sexual person myself. This made the long distance portion of our relationship really hard for me because I always felt like we never actually established real physical intimacy before she left. We'd see each other every few weeks, sometimes we got frisky, other times we just watched movies and hung out. For a while I was okay with just oral, because I viewed it as baby steps towards having sex, but I would always have to be the one to engage. For a while she said that she just felt awkward and wasn't sure how to start as it were, so I always gave her the benefit of the doubt. It's always a bit odd when you have to consistently make the first move or always ask for something sexual; almost like you're not wanted, but I attempted to put my ego aside for the sake of our relationship. Throughout our period of long distance I would periodically bring up sex and how important it was to me, in an attempt to remind her but not necessarily pressure her. She always said she understood and when the topic of \"when\" would come up, she would basically keep saying next time or maybe soon, answers in that vein,  and she promised to work on her phobia. During her first summer home we tried a good 7 times, each time getting progressively worse with the last time resulting in her crying and squirming as I towered over her (Missionary position and I'm a pretty tall fella). To be frank with you I felt somewhat like a rapist after that last attempt and it really put me off the idea of sex with her in general. We'd have arguments about the lack of sex constantly and after a while I stopped even bringing it up. \n\n Sex became the furthest thing from my mind whenever we hung out. \n\n As a result of what felt like a lack of physical intimacy between her and I, I became more physically distant. If I wasn't engaging something, there was no engagement. She eventually got disheartened by the lack of affection I was giving her and demanded a reason for it, to which I explained my stance. Once again she promised to work on her phobia, and I promised to work on being more affectionate and intimate with her (PG-13 intimate). Time went on and I made noticeable efforts to give her attention and affection, and again I felt like I was being snubbed. I was always making the first move, I was always having to ask. Once again I reached a boiling point and I became colder, and was really thinking about ending it, that was about 2 years in (patience is a curse?), but during the talk in which I was going to do it she informed me that she started to see a sex therapist. Hoperestored.jpg \n\nThat was 6 months ago and we still haven't tried to have sex. The last time we tried to have sex was almost a year ago now. Shes telling me shes really really wants to and she really has come a long way from where we started. She will now offer, sometimes she even asks (oral) and our sex life in that regard has gotten better but I really am just kinda over it at this point. Part of me really thinks we'd be better as best friends, and I don't want to be the one to take her virginity now, because I really am unsure of how I'd feel after.  I don't wanna go through with it (sex) and then break up with her because how fucked is that, and at the same time I would feel like a dick for breaking up with her and throwing away a 3 year relationship while discounting her, albeit, slow efforts because of this one issue. I really can't tell if I'm the asshole here or it's really just a lose lose situation no matter how good of a guy I'm trying to be. Give me some perspective and advice if you have it please! Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Nearly a year ago I was feeling unsatisfied in my marriage. I realized I was not attracted to my wife and began questioning my sexuality. I was seduced by my now-boyfriend and began a physical relationship with him. However, since we have a 10-year-old son together, I didn't want to hurt her feelings and I felt afraid to come out as gay to my wife and child, I felt it was best to keep this a secret from her, rather than divorce her. This was admittedly an asshole move from me. \n\nWell, eventually she found out about the affair. Of course she wanted a divorce; however, we did not separate for some time. I had managed to introduce and integrate my boyfriend into our household, and he did the cooking for our family as a favor to her. He and my son have a good relationship. Even though I thought she would appreciate it she wasn't very happy about this arrangement, presumably because she cannot get over my infidelity.\n\nI suggested to my wife that she see the therapist that I also see to discuss her feelings because I felt he had been very helpful with me. Due to confidentiality reasons I don't know exactly what they talked about, but in the following session I had with him, he asked about my wife. He was not exactly professional about it and his body language and the way he spoke implied he was attracted to her. I decided to let this slide. \n\nOur son has also had issues with acting out and social withdrawal in the midst of the divorce. For whatever reason my wife decided he should see the same therapist we are seeing. He visited our house for dinner a few times. \n\nHowever, I was not aware that they actually had a romantic relationship until he suddenly announced they had proposed. Apparently my son supports it... he has taken my wife's side in the divorce. The therapist has ended his professional relationship with me to avoid conflict of interest issues. I can't help but be very upset about this. I feel like I have been betrayed by both him and her. Even though I was not sexually attracted to my ex-wife I do care about her very much and I doubt my therapist has her best interests in mind. Furthermore this is probably going to be the talk of the neighborhood and it will destroy my public image as well as mock me by reminding me that I failed to love her as much as a paid professional. AITA? ",

As someone who has some confidence issues when talking,especially to women, she really makes me comfortable and is incresibly umderstanding. I couldn't ask for a better girlfriend. There's just one thing that bothers me.\n\n(And this is where it turns NSFW) As it turns out,she likes to do a lot of kinky stuff in the bedroom. At first it was a tame,stuff like blindfolds,little rough action here or there,nothing crazy. But later on she brough more and more stuff. She really likes whips,handcuffs and other more robust sex toys that I just can't stand. I get super uncomfortable of she starts using any of those things and the sex turns really poorly. I tried to say that I l'm not comfortable with it,but she ignored me.\n\nThe culmination of this came when I found out the hard way she really likes puttung fingers in someone elses assholes. When she pushed her two fingers in my asshole the pain was unbearable and I had to stop. I was angry at her that she keeps doing this ahit that I'm not comfortable with.\n\nHer response was that I should just grow up and don't make a big deal out of it. She said that partners always sacrifice for eachother even if it's uncomfortable to the other party. She said that she does everything she can to please me in bed even if it's uncomfortable to her(though I can't say for aure if that's true). But that got me thinking,does she have a point?

I have a tuned Subaru Impreza WRX STI that is my hobby, my transportation, my life, I'm more comfortable behind the wheel than I am in my own bed. Its not quite as fast as I want it but it looks amazing and the sound system is seriously as good as it can be.\n\nI live in a large apartment complex in Tucson, I'm guessing probably 100 units or so. Not sure. Anyways the complex is really cool because a lot of places won't let you work on your car, well I can pay an extra premium every month to get a mechanics spot under shade. It's an extra 2 bills a month but so worth it. \n\nWhen I work on my car I BLAST my system. It helps me think and focus. Also important to note our complex has quiet hours between and 10pm and 8am, I follow these to the letter but I do need to work on my car so some Saturday's and Sunday's I crank shit from 8:01am to 9:59pm. I am not breaking any rules at all.\n\nI moved in in January and this Sunday was apparently a major problem. I had two people ask me to turn it down. I totally did but one came back and said its not the volume, it's the bass, can I turn the bass down. I said I would try but I guess that wasn't good enough because he came down a third time. Finally I told him I paid for the spot, I wasn't breaking any rules, I'd only be out there until 10pm. He said his kids had to go to bed at 8:30 and the bass from my car was rattling his walls. I told him I'd done my best to accommodate him but I was done. He told me he'd call the police (who never showed) and talk to management. I just stopped responding to him and cranked my system to drown our his barking. I worked on my car until 9:59 when I turned my system off.\n\nI got an email from my apartment manager asking if she could come by. She's really cool and I want to help her but I feel like I'm paying extra for the mechanics spot, I'm not breaking any rules and that guy had no right to talk to me like that. She said she managed a nice place and she's gotten complaint after complaint about my car. I told her I was sorry but I was still well within my rights and not breaking rules. She asked me to please consider for her sake using headphones Or earbuds if music is that important to me. I said I'd try,\n\nI worked on my car all night last night and used ear buds and it just wasn't the same. I spent thousands of dollars and so much time to tune my system perfectly and to not use it when I want sucks. I want to help her out but am I even being an asshole in the first place?",

      "description": "My ex \\[18M\\] and I \\[20F\\] were friends for about 2.5 years before we started dating in February. It was one of those \"will they, won't they\" friendships, and our whole friend group approved of it when we made it official. We seemed compatible in terms of future wants and needs. We talked about getting married after college and he was supportive of my unconventional career choice. \n\nOver the summer we got pretty physically close but never had sex. We are both religious and drew the line that below the belt was off limits. I have a very low sex drive (later found out I have PCOS) so I didn't mind. He has a much higher sex drive and often asked me if we could make out, once took my shirt off without asking, and talked about my body more than any other aspect of me. I don't mind kissing but he didn't take 'no' for an answer if I wasn't up for it so I just caved and let him kiss me. I didn't realize this wasn't healthy at the time.\n\nAt the start of October he told me he'd been addicted to pornography for the last five years, consuming it almost every day. As mentioned before we are both religious so the thought of him getting off to other women bothered me. I told him I would work on rebuilding the relationship if he got professional help for it, either from a counselor or pastor. He told me he would \"if I wanted \\[him\\] to.\" A couple weeks went by and he didn't seek help for it, seemed like he was ignoring the fact that it ever happened. He told my brother and that's about it.\n\nIt bothers me because his perception of sex is likely very inaccurate, and any time I look at pictures of him I know what was going on in the background. I personally have never viewed porn and it is something I'm not comfortable with in a significant other. I figured because he is religious that it wasn't going to be an issue. When we first got together I mentioned that porn wasn't something I approved of, but we never discussed it.\n\nAbout two weeks after he told me, I broke up with him over text. That's the part I feel bad about. Granted, most of our communication was over text and we didn't see each other in person very frequently after fall semester started. I should have called him or met up, but I wanted to be able to control what I say through written words rather than verbal.\n\nAITA for not being physical enough? AITA for dumping him? AITA for not being comfortable with pornography? Please let me know.",

      "description": "So here this, I have several disabilties resulting in me being able to only work parttime. Because of this, my boss doesn't want me on field work because they deem that I cannot deliver \"continuity\". I totally do not agree with that reasoning, but that is an entirely different story. This is important to know though.\n\nNow, I have the type of contract where they are not obliged to give me hours to work. I have bo idea what this is called in English so I'll just liteally translate the Dutch contract name to English: a zero hours contract. There are about 7 others at my job with this type of contract.\n\nNow yesterday, there was a course for \"all zero hour contractors\". That would include me, except it didn't because it was a field course and they are not going to educate me on something I can't make them earn the investment back (not that O agree since I *want* to also work in the field). Thing is, they have been going around all day calling it the \"zero hours contractors course\". They tried to do it behind my back because they all knew I wasn't included but I'm not deaf of course so I heard it all. \n\nIt all felt like the middle school type of bullying where you're purposely not included. And in this case, I know that was indirectly and unjustly caused by my disabilities. They just decided for me that I cannot do fieldwork. Even though I did fieldwork for them before back when I was still an intern and keep saying I want and can do fieldwork. It feels like discrimination and bullying that they kept using the term that should include me, but didn't anyway.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole for calling out my managers on this and ask them to use a different term for courses like that in the future? Like \"field work course\"? I mean, that would still hurt because I still *want* to be included but at least my coworkers don't have to feel like they need to hide from me when talking about it because they know I am not included in something the name suggests I should. \n\nI really want to know if IWBTA here because if IATA I probably would'nt get any more projects either leaving me essentialy out a job so I need some perspective because this really, really hurt my feelings.",

      "description": "I'm going to try to keep this concise as its not too big of a situation, but I like writing so no promises. Also, sorry about mobile formatting.\n\nI'm a 19 year old guy, that might be relevant to some of you when making your judgement. So my family is pretty traditionalist, especially my dad. I value tradition and am conservative myself, but being raised in Canada has made me see things a bit differently than they do. So the scene is Christmas Eve, and as per usual my parents Skype their families (almost all of my extended family lives in Poland, so thats our only form of communication) to wish them a Merry Chrsitmas and talk for a bit. Usually I'd join in, but this year I really wasn't feeling it, so as soon as my dad motioned for me to come to the computer, I instead went upstairs.\n\nReason for this is twofold: First, I haven't seen any of that family in 4 years (that was the last time we flew to Poland), so I feel we grew apart naturally. Second, when I was in Poland, I tried my best to engage with my cousins and talk about stuff, but because of the language barrier (I understand Polish perfectly, but speak it very poorly) and different interests, they didn't seem especially interested in talking to me. My uncles, aunts, and grandparents talked to me more, but that was just the standard \"so how's life, how's school\" type of thing, just felt artificial. I spent most of that trip just with my brother.\n\nSo essentially, I feel like these people are my family in name only. I don't care about them, don't want to waste my time talking to them. I have 2 cousins that live in Chicago with whom I talk to fairly often (no language barrier, I can relate to them fairly well, and I visit them once a year, even by myself if my parents can't make the trip), I'm super close to my parents, and my brother is my best friend. I feel like that's family enough for me, and I have close friends that I'd sooner call family than the Poland people.\n\nNow the asshole part. After the Skype call was over, my dad stormed into my room and yelled, saying he was deeply offended that I wouldn't talk to his family, and that he didn't raise me to be such a bum(?) My parents and I speak Ukrainian, so the insults he hurled at me were in Ukrainian and I'm not sure if that's an appropriate translation, it means something like that but a bit more derogatory. His reaction came as a total surprise to me. I expected he'd be unhappy, but I don't see it as such a big deal. I promised I'd join the call next time to get him to calm down. We've since reconciled, but it's been on my mind, I feel guilty but don't really want to adjust my belief on this.\n\nShould I try to put on a show for my dad and be nice to these people? Should I genuinely try to build a relationship with them? Should I put my foot down? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I received a letter in our mailbox from our new next door neighbor today. The letter politely asks us to take down a wind-chime we have on our back porch that has been there for 2/3 years because it âdisturbsâ their sleep since they decided to use the bedroom closest to our back porch as their bedroom (~30/35ft distance between the chime and the window of their room). Itâs quite a nice wind-chime; itâs on the larger side and metal - cost me over $200. Not a cheap item, and the sole purpose of buying it was to place it on the back porch.  Before hanging it, I asked the neighbor living there at the time if they would be bothered - they said not at all, so up it went. \n\nI absolutely love it. My backyard is my oasis - my chime, bird-feeders, hanging plants, and we have a 11x16ft 5k gallon koi pond with a large waterfall feature (which is currently off because it is winter - but could be argued is even louder than the wind-chime when running). \n\nThis neighbor has only been living next door to us for ~3/4 months - so it was there while he looked at buying the next door property, it WAS NOT added after he moved in. \n\nIâm looking at the situation like this:\n\nOur chime was in full view (our fence is only 4ft tall) while he looked at the neighboring property. \n\nHe decided to pick the bedroom closest to our back porch (approximately 30/35ft away) as his bedroom, knowing the wind-chime was there. \n\nI also wonder if they have tried other options to lessen the sound, or if the first action was just to ask us to remove it....? \n\nIf we take it down, we have a really nice $200 wind-chime that basically becomes worthless. I donât want it hanging in our house, or on our front porch because 1.) our kids would tear it up if we had it inside and defeats the purpose of a WIND-chime, 2.) easy to steal on the front porch since it just lifts off of a hook, and 3.) we donât spend much time in our front yard during the summer - our time is mainly spent in our backyard with our kids, and we wouldnât get enjoyment out of it there.\n\nIâm willing to move the chime another 20ft to the other side of our porch if that will give them some relief, but I feel like asking me to take it down isnât a reasonable request, because to me, I feel like Iâm being asked to change things about my property that were there long before this person moved in and eat the $200 price-tag.\n\nI donât want to be an asshole neighbor, but I also donât want to take down something that was expensive and brings me joy because someone new moved in. Weâve been here for 6 yrs and the chime has been here for 2 or 3yrs. \n\nMy husband and I plan on talking to them to try to reach a compromise,  but I need to decide what my line in the sand here is. \n\nSo, reddit, WIBTA if I kept my wind-chime?

Instead, two weeks ago, Jane got back together with an old boyfriend who *may* have been abusive. I'm not sure, all I know is my (sane) brother-in-law once kicked him out of his house and got into a fist fight with him. This was like two or three years ago.\n\nI personally I have not met this guy, let's call him Joe. But, Jane always has some kind of abusive/slimy/or pathetic guy hanging around. Her second kid is literally a result of her lying to a poor guy to get his sperm. She's obviously a horrible person, but we'd really like to have a relationship with her kids. That being said, experience has taught us Joe is probably an absolutely awful person. \n\nWe knew Jane was with Joe when we planned Christmas, but specifically didn't invite him along. We heard that Joe ruined my nephew's birthday party by bringing his (Joe's) mother who had some kind of argument/insulting match with my own mother in law. I don't know specifics. My husband refuses to go to those events and we took our nephew out for his birthday separately. \n\nWe just got a call from my father-in-law about how Jane is upset that Joe was not invited. FIL asked my husband if he would like it if I were excluded from Christmas. Jane has allowed me to come every year, despite not liking me very much. Husband argued it's different because we're married and have been together for nine years, while Joe could be gone in a week. Plus he doesn't want the drama of Joe being around. FIL responds that because I was always welcome, even when we first got together, we should extend the same courtesy to Joe.\n\nFather-in-law has informed us that Jane, her two kids, and Joe, will not be coming to Christmas. Husband feels like that's fine. But I'm not so sure we've done the right thing anymore. Yeah, Jane is horrible. But we've never even met Joe. \n\n ",

Iâll come to you if I want to talk about it.â\n\nThis will be our third year together and Iâm concerned that he hasnât talked about it at all. Iâm pretty confident that he may not have ever mentioned it again if I hadnât asked.  We have a great relationship, save for some anger issues on his end (canât talk about much in-depth stuff or question his logic without frustration or resignation) but heâs never remotely been physically aggressive or sexually forceful towards me. He does seem to like being sexually deviant or into âweird shitâ (define at your own discretion) but nothing harmful or masochistic. Heâs a big, strong guy, and always has the persona of being âin chargeâ. Heâs very anti-therapist, having been to quite a few , and apparently never meeting one he felt comfortable with, nor gained or any benefit from.\n\nMy worry is that a) heâs dealing with something thatâs really gonna wear on him (and in turn, us) over time, b) our future children are going to potentially be around someone in his family who is abusive and I wonât know, even if he does, and c) I feel as though Iâve told him everything about myself, including assaults and family trauma in my past and, while I recognize that itâs very hard to talk about, itâs important to me to go into our marriage without secrets, especially big ones like this.\n\nWeâre planning on a long engagement, so thereâs no impending date to worry about, but I obviously want to marry him, and I hate the idea of being not fully aware of who he is and what heâs gone through. \n\nWas I wrong for bringing it up a year later? Should I let it go?",

      "description": "Girlfriend and I have been dating like 4 months. Sheâs a beautiful woman and Iâm very attracted to her. The thing is, sheâs a bit hairy. She shaves or using cream on most things to deal with this. But for whatever reason, she doesnât remove the hair on her toes and fingers. \n\nOddly enough, I noticed the toes first. I wouldnât say I have a foot fetish but I do like to touch girlâs feet if Iâm having sex sometimes. I was considering sucking on them but then I noticed...that. And so I just skipped over it. Then I looked at her fingers too and noticed she has hair in similar places there. \n\nWeâre usually fairly blunt with each other so one day I just asked if she could shave them. I could tell I offended her/hurt her feelings. She said no one has ever said anything about it before. And I was like âwell maybe they didnât wanna hurt your feelings?â After that she called me a jerk and that was the end of that conversation. \n\nI donât know. Is it that bad that I asked her to shave? I realize itâs ultimately her choice. I just thought I would let her know because it is a slight turn off...",

      "description": "I've been with my boyfriend for nearly 3 years now. He's great in most regards but sometimes I feel like he takes me for granted. Come Christmas time, without fail, I will get him a gift of some kind but he won't get me anything. He'll get gifts for his parents, his 6 siblings, just not me. It's the same for birthdays, he'll buy stuff for his mates, family, never me. I sort of don't know what to say when his parents ask me what he got me.\n\nIt's not a money issue, we both earn more than most, plus I would be happy with literally anything (like when my ex gave me a pretty stone he found at the beach). It's that he doesn't feel he needs to do anything for me that hurts a bit. He's said a couple of times \"he doesn't know what to get me\" so I tried dropping really obvious hints (eg here's some $10 steel necklaces I like, I'd love to have something like that that you gave me). His memory is shit so it wouldn't surprise me if he forgets any hints I give him.\n\nWe don't really go on dates or anything anymore either since I usually just cook at home.  \n\nAm I an asshole for expecting something, anything?",

      "description": "My boyfriend (early30sM) and I (mid20sF) have been together for around 3 years and have lived almost that whole time. Let's call him Cory. Cory and I moved in with his mother (late50s) in June last year. Let's call her Carol. We did it so we could save some money and we knew it was just until she retired in about 3 years. \n\nA little about Carol. She's been divorced twice and is from a small town where they're a little more country than we are here in the suburbs. She told us and Cory's sister (late20s) and brother-in-law (late 20s) that she would never marry again. Let's call them Amy and Rory. She said that in June right after we had all moved in together.\n\nThe very next day she's talking to a new guy. He's the same age as her. They actually went to high school together, dated then and went to prom together. This was over 40 years ago and they haven't talked since. Let's call him Frank. \n\nIn these last 40ish years, Franks also been married and divorced and has 3 daughters of his own and now grandkids too. He does drywalling or something of that sort.  Frank has lived in that same small town ever since\n\nCarol's giddy like a school girl and Frank seems to make her happy so were happy for her. He reminds her of home, they have a song together, and she gets along with his kids great. It seems fine.\n\nSoon enough he's coming up and spending the weekend at our house. No biggie. Cory and I are happy to get to know Frank. But then it's next weekend she's down in their home town and then he's back here. For a weekend then a few days then a week and soon enough he's visiting his home on the weekends and staying here the rest of the time.\n\nWhen this first started happening, Carol asked Cory and I about how we felt about Frank moving in with us. We respectfully told her we didn't feel comfortable with it. They had only been together 3 or 4 months, we didn't know him very well, and we didn't feel comfortable with their drinking habits (neither of us drink, Cory's been sober for over 3.5 years now). \n\nBut Frank still kept staying here. And we have noticed a quite a change with Carol. She usually very social and goes out with her friends very regularly and now she stays in and seems to be even avoiding some of her friends. She rarely talks to us anymore but is constantly calling or texting or FaceTime Frank's daughters. She's been really disconnecting from us. Not just Cory and I but Amy and Rory too. \n\nHer plan for the longest time was to move closer to Amy and Rory after retirement as Cory and I eventually planned on moving up there too. Carol's always talked about being a grandmother. But the other day she told my mother that the only reason Amy wants her to move closer is because she wants Carol to be a babysitter. \"I am absolutely NOT doing that.\" Now her plans are to move back to Carol and Franks hometown after she retires. 6 hours away from where all her kids will be living. \n\nWell, this Christmas, he proposed. She said yes.\n\n8 months ago she said she would never get married again. \n\n8 months ago, Carol's father told her to never let go of her son, that he'll always be her rock. After she got engaged, he told her it's time to cut him off and cut him out.\n\nWe all expressed our concerns about the engagement to her. The fact that they had only been together 6 months, the fact that he was basically homeless and unemployed when he proposed to her, and that they haven't actually known each other for 42 years. That a lot has happened and a lot has changed that you haven't seen. \n\n2 months into their realtionship, he had already asked for Carol's father's permission to marry her. After that happened Carol told Cory that Frank wanted his Blessing too. He never asked for it and never even discussed it with him. But what Cory did ask is that they wait until he was able to propose to me. As we're not engaged yet, they clearly didn't respect that request.\n\nAfter that initial conversation about Frank moving in, he still moved in anyway. And now, Carol asks us almost every day when we're moving out, even though the lease isn't up til June.\n\nShe's pushed us all away. She barely talks to us and we live with her. I can't imagine how Amy and Rory. And when we confronted her about the engagement, she got extremely defensive and didn't talk to any of the four of us for 2 weeks about it. \n\nWe want to be happy for her. We truly do. But she's jumping into this too quickly. She makes good money and it kind of seems he's just trying to leech off of her retirement. He's out of work right now, is living on unemployment benefits, and definitely is not actively looking for employment. And his lease was up one week after he proposed. \n\nSo are we the assholes for not supporting them? \n\nTl;Dr Mother's getting married after only dating for 6 months. Are we the assholes for not supporting them?",

      "description": "My friend Jesse and I who knew eachother for about 6 years prior to working in the same dealership have recently had a \"falling out\" and she has been giving me the cold shoulder and basically speaking to me like a stranger since this occurred.\n\nJesse is kind of qwerky and likes to say weird things to amuse others, such as: \"I don't like beans, I just eat them so they cant eat me first\" etc etc.\n\nSo from this, our receptionist put up sticky notes in the lunch room with quotes of this weird stuff she says and everyone loves it, she seemed 100% cool with it. I find it really funny.\n\nI was emailing Jesse last week about how hungry I was and couldnt wait for lunch, she responded with \"Me too, I just took a big crap and considering taking a bite.\" I was not expecting such a morbid response so I laughed really hard and decided to send it to our receptionist to put up. The receptionist couldn't believe it and thought it was fake until i showed her the email and she laughed at it too. So she put it up in the lunch room. Jesse wasn't a big fan of this but didnt really care. Then I thought of a few other funny but waaay more tame things i should get put in the lunch room so i sent them to the receptionist too. She was crying from laughing so hard at the things i sent her but hadn't put them up. Jesse found out and was furious at me. She was really upset about it but continued back to work ignoring me. \n\nI realized maybe I took it too far because she has anxiety and worries a lot about what others think of her So I decided to have the receptionist take down all of the stickies in the lunch room as Jesse wasnt happy with me at all. I called her that evening and said i was really sorry and offered to take her out shopping. She basically said thank you for saying sorry and that was it.\n\nShe now talks to me like a co-worker she just met and pretends we aren't friends. I understand i hurt her feelings but why is she throwing our friendship out the window like it means nothing? Things actually ended better for her since we totally got rid of ALL the stickes but she is treating it like I stole her husband from her.\n\nAm I as big of an asshole as she thinks I am? Or maybe is her anxiety distorting her view of the situation?",

One second sheâs dying to get my attention the next sheâs ignoring me. I understand and didnât say anything about it and kept a positive attitude. \n   So Emily is planning this event out which is happening in the summer time and at first I wasnât very enthusiastic about it until this week where sheâs finalizing everything for the event. So weâre on the phone and i had recently found out some good news for this event. Iâm excited to tell Emily and as Iâm telling her she fully shuts me off on it with a âshutup I donât wanna hear about thisâ with a belittling tone. I was dying to tell this girl these good news and in return i got a response i was not expecting. So i said okay and hang up the phone. Emily starts texting me Iâm a such a dramatic person etc... At this point I let her know that sheâs been very rude to me the last couple of days and that was just my last straw I couldnât just let her slide. Emily responds that sheâs having a bad day and why canât i just let her have her bad days. I let her know that even if Iâm having bad days i never talk to or act a rude way towards her and Emily responds that sheâs not me. We talk things out and make ends meet. \n\n    The next day Emily was good the whole day. Until the night time when she just got upset out of nowhere. I tried to comfort her and sheâs afraid to talk to me bc she feels like all she does is upset me then comfort me. I let her know thatâs itâs okay and that everyone has bad days i love her regardless itâs nothing and just temporary. We donât talk for a while until i ask her is everything fine and she seems really down with a following question asking if itâs me? Emily responds back not everything is abt you and that everything is always  about me 24/7 and Iâm just simply that type of a person. \n    ",

      "description": "AITA for not wanting a third child? \n\nMy SO and I have two beautiful, smart, and wonderful children. I had very difficult pregnancies and postpartum was an even bigger nightmare. I was diagnosed with PPD after our first child was born and then PPD+anxiety after the birth of our second. I was a SAHM and my husband works long hours and helps with the children when he can, however the bulk of the responsibility falls on me. And it is hard work too. They are pretty close in age. I do all the housework, including mowing the lawn and home maintenance. \n\nRecently, after our youngest started preschool, I have been able to go back to work and I have been the happiest I have been in 10 years. I am self employed so I can schedule work while still being there for my children â which is very important to me. I was even able to take my family on vacation using only money I earned working. It felt great. \n\nSO and I have been in couples therapy and having a third child is a huge point of contention. He claims to be miserable and depressed over the fact that we have not had another child yet. \n\nYesterday, during our session, he announced that he might have to consider divorce if i do not give birth again. The therapist seemed to be taking his side and assured him that wont be necessary to consider because once I work through my âlittle traumasâ she is sure everything will work out for us. It is being presented that I am holding his lifeâs dreams up and âgatekeeping his happiness.â I feel terrible and hopeless as if I have zero choices. I dont want to destroy his dream of a large family (something we both talked about years ago before we got married). And I do not wish to destroy our family by divorce simply because I cant handle having more kids.\n\nBut I also want to be happy and I feel selfish. I spent yesterday after the session having a panic attack until it was time to pickup carpool after school.  I feel like a complete asshole, especially because some of what the therapist said. I hate myself. But I am also angry and hurt and going through a lot of emotions. \n\nAm I an asshole? ",

      "description": " So this happened years ago.\n\nMy parents occasionally plan to go to their origin country for vacation. I've been there about 3-4 times now and I despise being there. I won't say the country's name because I don't want people pointing out the few \"pros\" or defending it because that's not what it's about.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't hate the place where my parents came from but it is a crippled country. (Currently in war over religious issues). Trash is EVERYWHERE and the place is so freaking hot, I have gotten seriously ill on my periods because of it. The place is filled with bugs and spiders, water taste odd and I don't trust it, beds are literally tables with cloth on it, the bathrooms are in inhumane condition, etc.\n\nI don't get to choose to go, and the last time I had to go there I begged not to go. Mind you this vacation takes about 2-3 MONTHS and that's basically my entire summer vacation drained!\n\nI had to along side my young siblings. Heck, we got kicked off the first flight because my sister was crying.\n\nOnce there I could not STAND talking with (I kid you not) 100s of relatives. I have a freakin big and talkative extended family. I PLEADED my dad to take me home. I have an irrational fear of being home alone but it was better than this surprise \"vacation\" I was forced to go to. He refused.\n\nI was (and still am) an introverted, mentally fragile, and disturbed being. My parents forced me to talk, travel in the polluted air, use the bug-invaded filthy bathroom, wear uncomfortable clothing. If I didn't I'd be berated, forcibly dragged out, etc.\n\nI broke down. Suffering from depression my parents refused to treat besides with prayers I could not catch a break. I've had severe \"end it\" thoughts and attempts round 24/7. I would be dead if I didn't have access to the correct tools at that time.\n\nSo I refused speaking with my extended family. I became a mess. I went beyond my breaking point.\n\nMind you, I was in a country who spoke an entirely different language. I can't speak correctly if it were to save my life.\n\nI was hospitalized when my body came in immense pain during the stressful environments (unsuccessfully adapting to it) and pure dehydration on my heavy period.\n\nAITA for cutting out my extended family for this?",

      "description": "Iâm currently a senior in high school ready for college. Iâve done a ton of research over tons of school and have applied to multiple colleges so I feel I know a bit more than some of my classmates. \n\nA friend of mine was telling me about how she was planning to apply to a pretty prestigious college. This college really only accepts the top 10% of classes with the occasional high SAT student or a good athlete. They are also known for being very pricey and stingy with scholarships. \n\nThe friend is not in the top 10% of our class and does not have the greatest scores but is a good dedicated student. I told her with a school like that itâs a bit of a toss up to her. I told her to really focus on her application essays because I have seen those make or break a student and offered to let her read some of my essays or proof read hers. I also told her to apply to multiple schools because itâs just more opportunities and invited her to apply for the college I plan on attending. \n\nThe next two days after this conversation I was gone on a college trip and returned to school on Monday. There was a lot of ignoring and whispering among students so I knew something was up. I went to lunch and everything unfolded. \n\nBasically the entire lunch table ganged up on me and explained how shitty and insensitive I was. They all said that I said the friend was stupid which I never said. They said that as friends we should only uplift and believe each other can do anything. I explain that I didnât believe that was right and that I like to be honest. I would rather have someone give it to me straight rather than blowing smoke up my ass and watching me fail. They replied that whoever taught me that was okay to think had âwrongedâ me and that my friend had parents to tell her the truth and I should just support her. \n\nI apologize to my friend and offered to talk it out or just leave her alone. She wanted to just drop it. This led to me losing some friends and constantly fearing more will leave because people talk and rumors spread. Am I the one in the wrong here? Was what I said insensitive? ",

M has [Meniere's disease](https://www.healthyhearing.com/help/tinnitus/menieres-disease) and now whenever she gets overworked or really tired she ends up bedridden for about full day.\n\nThats just background info the meat and potatoes start about 2 months ago when GF first went to the hospital. She decided around that time to leave for Mexico, cause \"If he dies there I can't be in that house alone\" she spends her time there partying, and discovers facebook where now she is compelled to put out every single thought and feeling she has. When she comes back GF is still bouncing in and out of the hospital and everyone is preparing for the end. While GM lives near M she starts demanding M do things like take her shopping, read her mail, get her groceries, and basically take care of everything pertaining to GFs death. After so many years being married to D now GM starts getting on M case about the decision to marry D and move to America, M being WAY too nice for her own good does everything GM asks. Emotional stress and overworking finally hits M like a truck and she ends up bedridden a full week, after a few days D takes M's phone and iPad, because GM was constantly calling, messaging, and face-timing demanding stuff or complaining that she isn't getting any help. My sister has been sent over a few times to take care of M. Now it's just this past week, I've got a provisional license so I can drive with an adult that has their license, now I've been tasked with driving her around, all while she tells me to be grateful she took care of herself and she is still alive, and that if GF had been a better person he'd still be alive. I'm a high schooler taking a few college classes and I'm having a hard time keeping up whilst constantly taking care of GM but I'd rather do it than M who is also in college. GM also frequently tells me and my sister that we need to either marry white people or white looking Mexicans, and that we should never be in a relationship with another black person or any asian people. GM now has taking to badmouthing my new aunt that my uncle married while my grandfather was around. GM threatens to move to Texas with her gall pals if she isn't taken care of and almost daily mentions that we should all be grateful she is alive.\n\nTL;DR AITA for hating my racist, rude, and fairly annoying GM",

      "description": "My friends and I ordered takeout to pick up at a restaurant near our campus. We asked for the lunch special on the phone when we called and placed the order. \n\nWhen we arrived to pick up the order, instead of making us the lunch special, which is a smaller size of the regular, they had made the regular instead. The following exchange occurred: \n\nThe owner of the restaurant, heavily pregnant woman, tried to ring us through. The price came up to a lot higher than we expected. My friend asks her why itâs so expensive and she said that we ordered the regular entree. My friend tells her that we had in fact placed an order for the lunch special. Instead of apologizing and righting our order, she turns to her employee who was answering phones and asked whether we had done this, or given the ânumberâ (the regular entrees have numbers) for the item. The employee lies and says that we gave the number. \n\nI told her that there was no way we gave a number because we didnât even have the regular menu out. When we were ordering, we only were looking at the lunch menu. She rolls her eyes and left with our food and went to the back to repackage it. At this point, I was like ok so this isnât great service. The employee just lied, not to mention as someone running a restaurant, she shouldnât have doubted her paying customers in the first place when we told her the order was wrong. \n\nThen, she came back with the new lunch menus and proceeded to ring us through again. At this point, I remembered that the lunch specials usually come with a side salad or soup, so I asked her if we could get that. \n\nHer reply was to ask us if we had asked for it on the phone. She told us that if we didnât order the lunch special then we wouldnât get the soup or salad. Both my friend and I started defending ourselves, saying for the third time that we did in fact order the lunch special. She retorted and told us that if we didnât ask for a soup or salad when we ordered, then we wouldnât get it. So we asked her if that meant that if people donât know they get a soup or salad, then they donât get it? And she said that some people donât want it so how was she supposed to know we want it if we didnât order it in the first place. We then asked her if she always treated her customers this way, that if they donât ask for it when they place an order, then they wouldnât get their sides. She said âI didnât say I wonât give it to you.â\n\nI was honestly so shocked at her attitude. I know sheâs pregnant but she still is working in a restaurant and as paying customers, I didnât think we deserved to be treated this way. Iâm not the most stable person either, so I got angry and told her that she canât treat her customers this way. That were from a nearby college and if she wants people to come back, then there is no benefit to blaming her customers. We then left, without our soups or salads.\n\nAm I the asshole for arguing with a pregnant woman?? ",

      "description": "My wife's mother recently went into hospice due to end stage dementia. Yesterday my wife, who's been trading shifts watching her mother with her sister, decided that she wanted to go out to lunch with her friend and told me to watch her mother and keep her comfortable. I'm the worst at taking care of people but I said yes.\n\nAbout an hour in I thought I was doing a good job but then I smelled something foul. It was obvious that she had soiled herself. I didn't want to change her because I promise you I would've thrown up and I know I couldn't handle it. I told her I'd call a nurse and did call a nurse three times. I came in and out of the room to check on her and tried to keep her calm while we were waiting for help.\n\nLong story short my wife beat the nurse home, and after changing her mother lit into me. She expected me to tend to her mom's every need including changing her messed diapers, wiping her down, and powdering her because \"that's what taking care of someone means\". I said that she's known since we were dating that I don't do smells and can't clean up messes like vomit and feces. I lost my cool when she kept pushing the issue and told her that if it was so important to her then maybe she should've stayed with her mother instead of going to lunch without asking her sister to stay with her and asking me to change her mother without asking me. I would have done it, even want to, but there's just some things I can't do/feel comfortable doing.\n\nHer and her sister are both refusing to talk to me and things are extremely uncomfortable.

But our friendship really took off when she had a breakup with her boyfriend and she needed someone with her. We use to just talk with each other but after sometime we started holding hands and slowly we did some other simple stuff too. But now she says she kinda has feelings for me and she thought that i also had feelings for her but i didn't and i was just kinda enjoying the physical thing between us. The bigger problem was when she started saying to me that she wants to marry me and i'm like i can't take these kind of decision so early. Also, she isn't the kind of person i'd want to marry so it was a no. But now she is upset from me because i was just in it for the physical stuff and had no feelings all along.",

      "title": "AITA for being annoyed that I was called out on my mess?",
      "description": "I share a house with 3 other people. Our shared areas don't have a lot of storage, and our kitchen is small. So small that probably no more than 2 people can be in there at once. Having such a small area means that it gets messy very quickly. Now lately I've been having a guest over that likes to cook when we hang out. To compensate this, I try to clean up our mess + extra. This weekend they cooked a pretty elaborate meal for me and my roommates to share, which was very nice. After we ate I washed our dishes, cleaned the counter,cleaned the stove top, swept the floor, and wiped down our dining room table. Food was put away into containers in the kitchen that same night. They came over again and we made breakfast. We used one pan for everything we made and I washed any additional dishes used to make the food. I had class, so I wasn't able to sweep or do anything additional other than wiping down the counters. Nothing was spilled on the countertops or stove. We made very minimal mess. We did however leave out extras of what we made for anyone else in the house to have. \n\nOne important thing to note is that one of my other roommates had a guest over too this weekend (they cooked).\n\nAfter I leave for class I get a text from one of my roommates (we'll call her J) that roommate S, is pissed. She apparently ranted about the house being kept a mess. I'm usually the type to assume I'm the one not being self aware enough to notice when I'm causing problems, but this time I just feel annoyed. S said that food being left out overnight, the stove not being clean, and other common areas being cluttered were an issue. In the past 2 weeks I have personally deep cleaned the kitchen myself multiple times on top of just generally cleaning up after myself. I hand wash all my dishes almost immediately after using them and try to just maintain things I see dirty around the house. \n\nI can see how leaving out extra food may be an issue if no one eats it, so next time I'll just leave a note that there's extra in the fridge, but other than that, am I the asshole here? I just feel annoyed that A) Roommate J told us about S ranting and she couldn't tell us herself. B) She's acting like this happens all the time. I try to make sure I clean up after myself + anyone else I have over. It's very possible I miss something when cleaning up, but I avoid leaving any big messes for others to deal with. C) S has been gone for most of this week/weekend. She basically came home, complained, and left again. D) I feel a lot of this could be directed at my other roommate who had guests over that did do some of the things she complained about. If that's the case then I would rather her just confront her directly vs. complain to everyone about the actions of one person.\n\nI don't want to be oblivious if I am in the wrong here, but I just feel pretty annoyed about this whole thing.

      "description": "I was raised by a wealthy family, not obnoxiously wealth but comfortable and have been able to have nice things and holidays etc. this weekend was a trip out of town, funded by my mother for my birthday. She paid about $1500 for two nights away in a rural town.\n\nWe rented a beautiful Airbnb with a pool, rain showers and a giant bath tub. It was just meant to be a relaxing weekend with bubbles and face masks. The first night was awesome. Cheese, crackers, and a bottle of Dom Perignon vintage 2009. And then tequila. I had saved my ass off to make this weekend happen and put a lot of money towards food and alcohol. My friends had also spent approximately $200 on food.\n\nThe next day I really wanted was a good hour or so out in the afternoon to burn off some steam. Iâm quite an active person. I had made some suggestions such as hiring bicycles ($20 for the whole day), or having a nosey at the local vineyards (find a cheap wine and maybe shout everyone a cheese board) or taking a drive out to the coast. We settled on the beach.\n\nI was getting more worried about friend 1. She had gotten extremely quiet and friend 2 and I had decided maybe she needed some space as we are all quite introverted. I had asked periodically if friend 1 was okay, as had friend 2. When I noticed friend 1 hadnât really cheered up, I decided it would be best if we headed back.\n\nWhen we returned Netflix was put back on. F 1 at this claimed she was feeling a bit flu-y. She headed to bed after dinner.  F 2 and were quick to brush it off and check on her an hour later.\n\nFriend 1, yelling, targeted at me: âI get that this is your weekend and I shouldnât have come if I couldnât afford it! But you have spent the whole day making me feel like shit about not having any money! and now I feel like shit because you made me ruin it!â\n\nShe proceeded to continue yelling, talking about how I wanted to do things that costed money. I canât remember the entire rant and I didnât get to respond as she stormed out of the room.\n\nThe gist was I made her feel like shit for not having money. F2 stood in the door kind of in shock. She very kindly offered f 1 a ride home. I could hear f1 on the phone still ranting about me being terrible. I had enough and went to remind her (not kindly) that f2 had offered her a ride out and to please take it. \n\nI would never intentionally make some one feel that way. I had intended to pay for any activity we had chosen. I may have not made that clear. I believe she could have spoken to my earlier in the day before she had worked herself up into such a state. On the other hand, I must have said something wrong in the day. \n\nIt was a dick move asking her to leave considering we were far from home and she doesnât drive but I was very upset. I think it was not going to be resolved. I feel like I let it escalate and should have asked when I initially sensed something wasnât right.",

      "description": "So my friend Enrique and I are pretty close. But one thing that always causes an argument betwen us is our different music tastes. I LOVE old school rock and roll like kiss, led zeppelin, the rolling stomes, green day, greta van fleet, and queen. My friend however likes hip hop music like twopoc, biggie, kanue west, snoop dogg, and NWA. The only rappers I like are jwce wrld and Tom MacDonald. Anyways, today in school Enrique and I were doing an assignment together and our teacher was playing some hip hop. My friend tells me the song playing was by biggie and I said \"that explains why its so bad.\" He says that it is good and that rap is better than rock. I said that only idiots like rap, and that he should listen to real music that isn't about drugs and sex. He goes to the teacher and switches teams, so I'm now with some girl I don't even know. I get that maybe I was rude, but rap sucks. I tried talking to him after class and he told me to go away. So reddit, was I the YTA, or NTA?",

When she first got pregnant we still maintained our sex life but since she started showing I've kind of been put off having sex for many reasons. 1 is that I kind of feel like awkward having sex with her when there's literally a baby in her stomach. Although I know it technically doesn't hurt the baby it's just weird to think about. 2. I honestly find the stomach a turn off. She always been really thin and fit and since getting pregnant she's gained like a bunch of weight and I'm just not as eager to have sex as we used to.\n\nMy GF thinks I'm an asshole and gets angry, like really mad whenever I turn down sex or whenever she sees me masturbate or watch porn.

      "description": "Ok...background first then weâll get to the meat. Thereâs also a TLDR at the bottom for those who donât want to read all of this. For those who do...sorry. Thereâs a lot.\n\nSo I just started my second year in college. My first year I met this guy (weâll call him Chad) who was finishing up his fourth year. He was cool to me and my friends so we decided to hang out with him a few times throughout the year. There were more than a few times he bought booze for us and was overall a swell guy. Until one night... to make a long story short, he was rubbing up on a few of my female friendsâ feet and being super creepy about it. It made everyone super uncomfortable, to the point that my friends said they didnât want him around at anymore parties. I agreed and we never hung out again.\n\nFlash forward a couple months, and Iâm at a party with a different group of friends and Chad happens to be there. He makes me some drinks, we chat and I get very drunk. At some point in the night a bunch of us are sleeping in the living room and my friend on the other end of the room jumps up from the couch and runs into the kitchen. A few of my other friends follow her and they talk in the kitchen for about an hour and come back, everyone goes back to sleep. A few weeks later, she tells me that she freaked out cuz Chad was grabbing at her feet while she was sleeping, causing her to wake up and have a panic attack. After hearing about that, my whole friend group (except one guy, weâll name him Bob) swore off hanging out with Chad since heâd been acting so creepy.\n\nOk, now to the actual meat. About two months ago was my collegeâs homecoming game. We (being me and the second group of friends) decided to have a party to celebrate and hang out. Bob volunteered to host at his apartment, and the night was set. All of a sudden, Chad shows up at the homecoming football game asking when the party is and where. Myself and six of my fiends pull Bob aside and tell him that if Chad is going to the party then the rest of us arenât. He said heâd take care of it.\n\nWe get to the party. Itâs lit, everyone has a great time and post a bunch of pics and videos on our Snapchat stories and other social media platforms as you do when the party is lit. We all pass out feeling pretty good and not worrying about anything. However, when we wake up about 15 of us (including myself) have texts waiting for us from Chad about how we all betrayed his trust and how he canât believe that he called us his friends. He blocks everyone who was at the party on every social media he has and has his fiancÃ© do the same. As it turns out, when Bob said he would take care of it he meant he would tell Chad that the party was canceled and just throw it anyway. So when we put a bunch of pics online of us hanging out, Chad saw it and got pissed. He and Bob had a huge fight and werenât on speaking terms for a while. I think theyâve made up now, but Iâm not sure. The rest of us have made no attempt to patch things up with him, and some of us are more than ok with the way that things turned out. After all, Chad was a total creep and we didnât like him.\n\nSo anyway...are we the assholes? I know Bob couldâve handled that differently, but should we have made him choose between Chad and us? Was it really fair of us to put him in that position? Weâve all sort of accepted that Chad isnât around anymore, and some of us like I said are pretty happy about it given his creepy vibe. Weâve come to terms with what we did, but Iâm interested to hear some opinions from outsiders.\n\nTLDR: A guy I met last year turned out to be a total creep. We found out he was gonna be at a party we were going to, and told the host was a close friend of his to chose between us and him. He chose us, and creepy dude got pissed.",

      "description": "So I recently started my second year of college and my best friend has left for a foundation year at a university further away from where I live. I was struggling really badly with making connections with other people except for this one guy who has been a friend/acquaintance. I'm quite shy and find it difficult to talk to people at times, especially when I'm trying to focus on my coursework.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I continue, I should mention that I have a boyfriend, and we've been in a very stable relationship for the past year. Not a lot of people knew because I've only talked to 2-3 people properly in the year before. I'm also one of the only two females in my class, and we don't get along well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day when I was heading out for lunch, this guy from my class called Jacob (not his real name) started complaining to me about how class is horrible, is full of chavs etc. I rarely ignore people if they try to talk to me, so I just nodded throughout this rant and said stuff like 'yeah I get that' or 'there's still a lot of time before the assignment is due'. After getting back to the class we started having a more general conversation, and he's been sitting next to me and talking to me since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJacob drives, and we drove back to school from a fast food place. After getting out of the car, he asked me if I had a boyfriend. I told him 'Yes I did, have been stable for a while.' He then backpedalled and said he was asking for the other friend of mine because he claimed that he was being very protective and clingy (when in fact he was just trying to help me not drop out of the course from feeling like I didn't belong, also he is not interested in woman).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I knew he had feelings for me from that point, and it made me uncomfortable at times when he would ask me if I wanted to get a ride home or if I wanted to go out drinking with him alone. He would keep telling me that he wants to ask something but that would be unfair on me. I knew what was coming so I just tried to avoid staying behind as much as possible as to prevent him from dropping the bomb (as I knew it would make me even less comfortable about being around him). Lily, the other female in my class picked up on the fact that he had feelings for me and have said that we would look cute together in front of the whole class despite the fact that I've told her twice that I had a boyfriend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo finally, today the bomb dropped whilst I was walking out of college. Jacob told me that he was sorry if I would feel guilty over this, but if I ever had troubles in my relationship with my boyfriend that he would be there. He knew I had a boyfriend but he chose to say this. I just told him that my relationship with my boyfriend is very stable. I didn't know what else to say after that so I just walked faster towards my bus stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis event made me very uncomfortable and made me cringe horribly when I got away from the situation and I talked to my boyfriend and my best friend about it and we all agreed that it was out of line. I feel bad that I talked about this event behind his back (with people who I know outside of college). Am I the asshole here?  \n\n\nTl;dr - Guy confesses his feelings to me when he knows I have a boyfriend, cringed and reacted badly after the event which made me feel like an asshole.",

      "description": "Okay, so my mom got me a cheap computer for Christmas last year for school and while I'm super grateful, she's not the greatest with technology. It had barely enough storage to run windows so I couldn't save anything to it. I've since sunk about $150 (probably half of what this thing was originally worth) into it to try and speed it up and expand storage, which has helped some but it has now developed some other problems.\nThe new problems include randomly restarting  (like a lot) and it doesn't like to connect to wifi. So I've been thinking about buying something else to replace it but is it too early (since this is just over a year old) to get something new? Should I just tough it out for a while longer (I have over a year left before I graduate if that makes a difference) or do you think she would understand?\n\nAlso if it makes a difference, this is not my main computer, it's just a smaller one that's easier to take to class.

      "description": "It's as fucking absurd as it sounds. TLDR at the end.\n\nSo for some context, I'm in a women's choir class. I transferred to this school two months ago and so you'd think all of the rules would have been clearly laid out for me by now, but nope. Apparently there's a rule against putting on lotion (which is strange to me because I've done it dozens of times in that class before, within his eyesight, and so have others, and nobody said anything but oh well). \n\nAbout five minutes before the class ended, I put on some hand lotion because it's cold where I am and my skin dries out. A few minutes later my teacher (all the way across the room) yells about him being able to smell it, even though it doesn't smell bad or strong or anything. At the same exact time though the bell rang, so I just left and didn't think anything else of it.\n\nFfw to next class and we're doing \"checkups\", where one person from each section sings their section's part solo. For example, I'm an Alto II/Tenor I so I'd sing either of those parts, with an Alto I, Sop II and Sop I singing their respective parts. So we're kind of in the spotlight a little bit.\n\nThe entire class went fine with no lotion mentions until I was up for mine. I was halfway through a song when my choir teacher noticed a few girls talking under their breaths. He stopped us and asked the girls why they were talking, and I was like ?? until this chick points at me and goes \"She did it, I watched her do it!\" and then I was like ???? what the fuucucuck\n\nSo everyone is rambling back and forth about me and I'm just kind of standing there, awkward and confused. But then the teacher hushed them and I had to continue singing in front of a crowd of girls who were angry at me for... putting on lotion the day before. I'm not an awful singer but it kind of threw me off the rest of the time. \n\nAfter I'm done, the teacher starts giving a speech about discretion and when it is and isn't a good time to be discreet or something, I honestly don't remember because I was too busy feeling humiliated. Then he asks whoever did it to come forward, and I just apologize because I kind of want it to be over. The bell rings &amp; I leave and I can hear them talking shit together but I honestly didn't give af lmao.\n\nSo AITA for putting on lotion when my teacher doesn't like it, even though I'm unaware of that rule? My entire choir class seems to think so.\n\nTL;DR: My choir teacher yelled at the very end of class because he smelled my lotion. A girl embarrasses me &amp; calls me out for it in the middle of my performance the next day, when it wasn't even an issue anymore. AITA for not telling the teacher it was my lotion?",

      "description": "I play this game called Far Cry 5 on my PC. It's made by Ubisoft, came out in early 2018 so almost an entire year ago, and is mostly solo-player and co-op with some player-vs-player, too. Through the game and UPlay, Ubi's own client similar to Valve's Steam, I made this friend, \"Mr. Z\", who's from the other side of the world. I live in the eastern hemisphere and he lives somewhere in North America, like many other people that play the series.\n\nA few weeks after he added me I noticed strange things when we play co-op, such as neither of us dying or even taking damage from anything, him super-jumping, and him giving me hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of in-game loot, which should under normal circumstances take a while (several hours of gameplay) to collect. I asked him about it and he revealed that he uses cheats. I told him I'm against cheating in PvP games and he said that he only uses them in solo and co-op and never in PvP, which means he uninstalls them first, every time.\n\nEarlier today, we - Mr. Z, his friend \"Ronoid\" and I, so at least 3 people - were talking on UPlay group chat. I happen to have mentioned Mr. Z using modded software, which shocked/startled/surprised (whichever word English-speakers use) Ronoid and made him what Mr. Z was doing. I tried to defend Mr. \nZ by saying that he only does it in solo and co-op, but the conversation ended soon after that.\n\nLater that day, which was just today, Mr. Z told me, on private chat of course, that he needed my help in doing a co-op challenge, which he immediately followed with, \"nevermind, I forgot you hate cheaters\". When I saw it I genuinely felt bad and sent several apologies, still in private chat, including things like \"I'm sorry\" and \"I only hate malicious cheaters, those that do it in PvP games like GTA Online which is infested with those kinds of people\". He replied saying that he was playing Far Cry PvP with his friends who then hated on him, accusing him of using cheats in PvP and faking his scores/stats, and they all left his lobby. I really felt bad about this, I know it's my fault. I did a shitty thing. I said a few more apology phrases like \"I'm sorry that happened\" and some others. I wasn't being sarcastic at all, I genuinely felt guilty. I don't remember our full conversation but I think I made him hate me as a friend, because I think he said a few sarcastic-*sounding* things like \"I wonder how easy it is to do it in multiplayer... easy as 123!!!\"\n\nTL;DR: I knew my online friend used cheats in a game we play but only in solo and co-op and never in PvP. I mentioned it in UPlay's group chat which made his friends think he's a cheater, and *probably* made him hate me.",

      "description": "On mobile so please forgive formatting.\n\nA little bit of background. My high school graduation is coming up. My dad wants to invite his mom and dad (my grandparents) to my graduation. Now my mom and myself arenât exactly on good terms with them. They (my grandparents) have repeatedly disrespected my mother and I. Hell my grandfather even called me garbage in a restaurant in public in front of his (grandparents) family friends for not being able to fluently speak Chinese. He (grandfather) also decided to not go out to dinner at the last minute (some BS excuse about being sick in the hot weather) with my mom and I even after my dad and his wife(grandmother) pleaded with him (grandfather) to go and at least greet us. So as you can see I have some personal reasons on why I do to not  want them to attend. Not to mention the fact that he (grandfather) is about 88 years old and in a wheelchair. Yet my dad is insisting I get them tickets to attend my graduation and if I donât heâs (dad) threatening to not attend it. So am I the asshole for not wanting them to attend?",

      "title": "AITA for not helping my friend get a job alongside me? (Long expl. + TL;DR)",
      "description": "A little bit of background: I (F19) have a friend (F18) who we'll call W. So W and I have known one another for six months. We went to school together as kids but never really talked, but hit it off when we met again at work.\n\nOur job is hell and the whole place is filled with problems that I won't even begin to unpack here, so we want out of there as soon as possible. \n\nI've done everything I could to be a supportive friend. The first time that W came to my family's house, she spent 26 hours in my home, only leaving for 2 to go with her boyfriend to the hospital to see a family member. Her boyfriend was probably at the house for a total of 8 hours. This, by the way, was my first time meeting him.\n\nI bent over backwards to be a good hostess. I accomodated W in every way. I made pizza, hot chocolate, tea, a snack tray, gave them candy and Christmas gifts and even gave her clothes. I remade a few of her drinks because she didn't like them. I was overly accommodating because, frankly, I'm a dork and haven't had a friend who actually wanted me around in years. So I really wanted to impress her. Stupid, I know, but all my life I've been the meek, submissive friend who goes along with whatever the other person wants because I don't want to be all sad and alone. \n\nBut she quickly took advantage of me. I started paying for everything, being the host every time, giving up on pre-made plans to run W's errands with her, and even helping her hunt for jobs. She wants to get hired in at the same place as me so that we can \"work together and hang out.\" I don't like this idea and I don't think she has a good work ethic - she isn't someone I would want tied to me when trying to get hired somewhere.\n\nNevertheless, I caved in and sent her a list of at least 7 jobs I had been considering applying to. Just yesterday I went pounding the pavement and submitting applications. I told her what I was doing because I hadn't replied to her for hours, and didn't want her to think I was just ignoring her, as she gets pissy very easily. If the conversation stops being about her, she ends it. W is also very insecure and jealous, and I see that being a problem if I were to succeed and her fall behind. She can be very spiteful. \n\nFor example, her boyfriend (M19) and I have a lot in common. We have very similar personalities and the same sense of humor. W is very flat and doesn't get a lot of jokes. She hates movies, comedy, etc. and tends to scold her boyfriend a lot when he makes jokes or acts goofy. I, however, get the old stand-up references he makes and very frequently we either think or say the same thing. Her boyfriend is also very well-mannered and appreciative, whereas she is not. He always thanks me and my family, acts respectfully and apologizes for W's attitude and/or behavior. He called her out when she made a dig at my weight and apologized on her behalf. \n\nThough, I think W takes this all  to be more than it really is. I see it as just being friendly, but she does not. The only issue I could see, or understand, is that her boyfriend is a hugger. He hugs everyone. Hell, he hugged my mom twice as soon as he met her. He'll hug me hello and goodbye every time I see them. If he forgets to, he gets out of the car to do it. According to W, he has autism. I'm not very educated on autism, so I'm not sure if this is common with people who are on the spectrum, or if it's behavior that is unique to him. \n\nSo that, what we have in common, and her insecurity paints a very muddy picture. She acts very territorial, randomly says that he is \"her man\" and kisses him, straddles him or full on gooses him right next to me. It's uncomfortable as hell. I have a boyfriend as well, but I wouldn't dare make out with him in her bedroom or smack his ass when she's standing close enough to hear the reverberation from his cheeks. \n\nSo, naturally, when I admitted I was out applying to jobs, she immediately wanted to know where I applied so she could apply as well. I said no, and she got pouty and abandoned the conversation. All of this has made me not only want to stop helping her look for work, but also stop being her friend. I feel stuck, though, since I don't have many friends to begin with. I'm naturally the kind of person who puts my friends before myself. So I'm not sure whether or not I need to cut her off or if I'm being selfish and should help her out. \n\n\nTL;DR - \n\nAITA for not wanting to go to a new job with someone who walks all over me, treats me like I'm less than her and belittles my job/experience in front of my own family, calls me fat and compares me to her physically in front of her family/boyfriend, and doesn't work hard? \n\nIMO I've done a lot for this girl. I've been there for her through tough times, helped her clean up for her boyfriend to impress him, given her loads of gifts and treated her to food in almost every outing. I take a lot of shit from her, including jabs at my body/general appearance, my intelligence, my position at our company, etc. Do I have grounds to be upset/ditch her ass, or am I just being self-centered?

      "description": "Throwaway because I think my friend knows about my main Reddit account. Also, sorry for formatting if it's weird, I am writing this on my phone. TL;DR at the end. And, sorry for crappy english, it's not my first language. \n\nI have a friend I have known for a couple of years now, she lives in another country but we have seen each others a couple of times and we talk daily and I would say she is a very good friend of mine. She was supposed to come to my country and visit me  in a couple of weeks, but after what happened yesterday I am not so sure anymore. \n\nI was going to have a very busy evening with work but I managed to catch up with her before leaving for work and she mentioned she will be working as well during the evening, but she was feeling a bit under the weather. I told her to take it easy and let people at work know in case she started feeling bad so she could go home and rest. \n\nWe didn't speak anything until I got home from my work shift. There was still an hour or so left of the day but all I was thinking about food and sleeping since I had to go back to the work in the morning, so the fact that it was still think first of April had already left my mind. \n\nThen, I got a message from her, saying she collapsed at work, started throwing up and now she is at the hospital and the doctors are trying to figure out what is wrong with her. She also had a very candid photo attached in it. So, of course I panic and start crying, wondering if everything is okay, she already had mentioned that she was feeling a bit sick before her shift began. \nShe then said it might be something serious and the upcoming trip will be compromised because of this. \n\nI am a sensitive person (which she knows) and I take stuff like this seriously, and I was so scared for her, I got extremely worried for her and I felt bad that I could not be there for my her... Until she said it was an April Fool's joke. \n\nI got mad at her, because \"pranks\" like these go into the same category with all those dumb cheating, pregnancy and \"i'm breaking up with you\" jokes.\n\nShe said it was not a big deal because it was still April Fool's and \"the joke only lasted for a couple of minutes\" but I was livid. She said I should have seen it coming and it really was not that bad. I honestly wanted to tell her to cancel her flights but I thought I should calm down first. I haven't spoken to her since. She has not apologized properly  and she has been sending me messages today as if nothing ever happened.\n\nI know I might be overreacting if I tell her to cancel her flights, but I feel really  bad because she thinks this was a good joke and I think I need a break from her after this.\n\nSo, WIBTA?\n\n\nTLDR; A friend who lives in another country  was supposed to visit me soon made kinda cruel april fool's prank (imo) concerning her health, and now I am thinking about telling her to cancel her flights because I am upset and need a break from her. \n\n",

      "description": "So as a hobby I started making beef jerky. One batch is usually more than I can eat so I share with people. Everyone who tried it really seems to like it.\n\nI've even had a few people offer to pay me for it. I always decline because I feel weird accepting money because then I feel like I owe them something. What if I mess up the marinade or I get a not so great cut of meat? Plus I would feel bad giving away something I made other people pay for. And I like sharing it. It makes me feel good that people enjoy something I made.\n\nAnyways, one woman I work with has told me time and time again how much she enjoys my jerky. She's asked me a few times to buy jerky from me. I'm always appreciative of the compliments but decline. Today, she texted me saying how much her kids love my jerky and could she pay for the supplies to make a full batch just for her next week? Usually the meat for one batch is roughly $20 and nothing in the marinade is super expensive but I guess it would add up. Again I declined, saying I don't feel comfortable selling it, but it's a lot of work and money to make a full batch to just give away. I told her I would be happy to keep a bag aside for her on my next batch but because of my schedule I probably wouldn't be able to make any until next month.\n\nShe tried to insist but I still declined. Come to find out from a mutual work friend that now she's going around telling coworkers that I'm being unreasonable and how shes just trying to \"throw me business\" and I should feel bad because her kids really like the jerky and I won't make it for them. AITA?\n\nTL;DR I make jerky as a hobby and refuse to sell it. Woman I work with insists on paying me to make some for her. When I refuse she says I'm unreasonable.",

Basically I was in a discord call with a group of friends talking about random stories while playing video games. After a while one of my friends mentioned that K sent a message about 5 minutes before he told us of K saying that she cut herself. Obviously everyone (excluding me) started typing and messaging K on discord to ask if she was okay (which she is) and saying that they like her and shit to be nice. The problem was that about 5 minutes after her first message about cutting herself with a razor she posted an image of her arm. The Image showed the top side of her arm with small red patches here and there but no scratch marks, no cuts and no blood were anywhere to be seen. I was telling everyone that it was obvious how fake it is and that she is clearly fine because of the fact that she started posting memes for about an hour after the first message. But because K is a female everyone except for me believes her 100 percent and think Iâm being shitty just because this kid basically bullied me 2 months. AITA for making jokes about it like saying âHaha big moodâ and shit like that, even though K was passing some serious moral and ethical lines just for attention?",

O almost always gave in. O would tell us how the \"talks\" were just him begging. O would always make sure to emphasize that she didn't fear X.\n\nOne night, we were having a bonfire and drinks when X pulled in. O jumped in his car for a \"talk\" in the driveway. As X pulled off and drove away O came back crying.\n\nX was acting crazy again and made threats. O downplayed it with her usual excuses for X. At this point, we already knew we were shitty friends for allowing this to go on in the first place. \n\nAbout an hour, the party had mostly broken up and it was just O, me and 2 others. X pulled up and O got in as usual. Then, O gets out of the car angrily yelling at X.\n\nAs it intensified, me and the two other 2 all agreed we should call 911.\n\nI have never called 911 before so we were shocked when two cops came running up out of nowhere and handcuffed both of them. \n\nBy this point, other friends came outside. O was still in handcuffs so I told the cops I called bc of X but they were both in violation and both arrested. O hurled insults at me as they took her away.\n\nO suffered some serious consequences. The cops found some illegal pill or something so charged her for drugs too. O lost a really good job. And had kids at home to support. \n\nI saw O the next day and she said sorry and i did the right thing but i never saw her again.\n\nI reached out a few weeks ago with a new phone number. When she asked who I was I told her and didn't get a response. I sent a few texts in the following weeks letting her know I miss her. A few nights ago, she finally responded.\n\nShe made small talk for awhile asking what I was doing and saying she was home alone and had been drinking. O then asked me to send a pic. I'm a guy so I responded with \"of what?\"\n\nMe being a homebody, O has seen me look my worst before, so I took a quick selfie and sent it with a sarcastic caption about how sexy I am.\n\nHer response: \nO: Uhh... wtf. I thought u were someone else.  \nO: Ur an ass!\nO: U called the cops on me. \nO: Fuck off\nMe: Ok but why?\nO: U were a great friend..b4 u called the cops!\nO: Goodbye \nMe: I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do.\nShe has never responded. \n\nAnyone can claim that I was NTA due to an NC order and abuse in the first place. But it isn't so cut and dry. O didn't want an NC but by law it was auto. ",

      "description": "Sounds bad I know but hear me out! I work as a dog sitter/walker and one of the dogs, called Mulle, who I take on regular walks is terrible with other dogs. Like if a dog gets too close he will bark and growl and bite. He had a bad upbringing so itâs hard to unlearn this behavior as it is so ingrained in him (this is besides the point but I just donât want anyone to think heâs a bad dog, heâs the sweetest he just has a lot of problems that arenât his fault!).\n\nAnyway I was walking Mulle where I usually walk him and all of a sudden three unleashed dogs come running up to us. I freak out, because Mulle is kind of a big dog and these dogs a not even half his size so a bite from him could do a lot of damage. But they all surround us and try greeting Mulle. He starts barking and growling, obviously.\n\nIâm trying to keep Mulle behind me, away from the other dogs while trying to locate their owner. Finally she shows up and tryâs to put leashes on her dogs, one at a time and painfully slow. And while she does this one of the dogs run up to Mulle from behind and Mulle just lunges. I panic I do not ever want to see a dog die so I do the only thing I can think of, I kick the other dog away from Mulle. Look a panicked okay? Thinking a kick is better than a bite to the neck. But I feel awful. I mean I kicked a dog! But it was for their safety. But maybe there was a better way. Idk I just feel bad. So am I the asshole?",

      "description": "This actually happened awhile ago - but I've been feeling kind of guilty about it, so I still think about it. \n\nI have two kids (2 and 4), and sister-in-law(SIL) has 2 kids (5 and 9).  We both live in the same city.  Her parents (my husbands parents) live in a small town about a 5 hour drive away.  I'm very close with their parents. Both families frequently visit the Grandparents, and sometimes we take each others kids with us (but not always).  Although, because my kids are younger - we take their kids more than they take ours (they've never taken our youngest).  Which is fine - he's a toddler, so I get it. \n\nIt was Christmas break, and both families were planning on spending Christmas break at the Grandparents house.  My husband, SIL and her husband all had one week of vacation.  I was lucky and had 2 weeks of vacation.  \n\nMy niece (the 9 year old) was having some problems with her parents (fighting a lot), so my SIL had actually sent her to the Grandparents early.  So she would be there for a total of 3 weeks. \n\nWith my extra week of vacation, I decided that I wanted to head to the Grandparents house a week early as well (my niece was already there at this point).  The primary reason I wanted to go early was because I wanted to put my older son in ski lessons before everybody else got there for Christmas break. My SIL's family does not ski at all. \n\nI contemplated inviting my nephew to go with us, but then I decided not to bring him.  I feel terrible because the other 3 grandchildren all got to be at their grandparents house together, and he was stuck in daycare by himself.   I also felt a bit bad because there was a slight precedent for bringing the other families kids with us (although I actually hate this precedent!).  My SILs family does almost always offer to take my older son with them when they go, and guarantee that they would have offered to take my (older) son if the situation was reversed. \n\nI didn't want to bring him for 3 main reasons.  ONE:  I thought it would be kind of awkward for my son (age 4) to be in ski lessons all week, when his cousin (age 5) wasn't.   TWO:  The drive is was 5 hours of dangerous mountain winter driving.  I am a nervous driver anyway and was already stressed about the drive with just my 2 kids.  I honestly didn't want another kid in the car.   THREE:  Honestly - I didn't want to look after him for a week.  I wanted to have a week of vacation with my kiddos.  Inviting him would mean the adults would be outnumbered 4:3, which is not a huge deal, but also adds up to slightly more work for everyone. \n\n\nAnyway - AITA?  For what it's worth, my husband thinks I am. \n\n",

      "description": "So, this is gonna be long, but Iâll include a TL;DR here: WIBTA if I didnât invite the cousins who bullied me growing up to my wedding?  \n  \n  \nGrowing up for me was hard. I have Neurofibromatosis 1, so Iâve always looked a bit off growing up. Always bullied by other kids around my age for it. Never really had anyone close to me who I could be a kid with. Even my own cousins would pull this crap with me, and my aunts and uncles of whoâs parents they were, lived by the â kids will be kidsâ mindset.  \n  \nLetâs cue to two of them Iâll call M and G. M dispite being two-three years older than me was practically always smaller than me, and has a less than good home life than I did. Which came off as he resented me, and made sure to make a point to make my life hell whenever weâd go to my grandparents for family events. Doing the typical stuff such as playing âhide and seekâ them just never looking for you. Crap like this lasted until him and his family moved away and Iâd see him far far less, which at that point heâd just verbally try to put me down each chance he got. \n \n \nNow Iâve not been the only one heâs had issue with, he assaulted my other cousin over 5$. Thereâs other stories here but Iâd best avoid them. \n  \nG on the otherhand, the best way I could put it was she was your typical spoiled brat mean girl and just always made me feel bad and down, and sheâs just not enjoyable to be around due to being the kind of person who is one: Still like that, and two: always has to one up everything and I just donât want to have to deal with it.  \n  \n\nNow, the main question comes in, Iâm starting planning my fiancÃ© and ours wedding and we are finalizing the guest list for the invites, Iâve askes my mom and dad about this and said I would be extremely rude and a dickhead if I excluded anyone from the family, but these people have brought nothing but negativity, malice, and bad vibes in my life and I just donât wanna deal with it, so WIBTA if I excluded them?",

And I used to be friends with someone who was obsessed with kpop. She said that she was \"in love\" with random kpop stars, and that she is sure that, despite the fact that most information about them comes from sources that aren't them, and that they don't even know she exists, she still knows that, if the kpop star and her were to meet, the kpop star would fall in love with her (despite the fact that all of these kpop stars are far, far older then her, and it would be considered pedophilia). I of course, told her, that you cant fall in love with a celebrity of any kind. If you do think you're in love with someone, who doesn't know you exist, and that you have never spoken to in your entire life, and probably never will, you aren't in love with them. She would get legitimately angry with me because I said I didn't like kpop very much, or if I said that I didn't find one of the kpop stars she was \"in love\" with attractive (or at least not as attractive as she did), she would just stop talking to me for a few hours. We got in a big fight over this stuff, and she blocked me. This happened a few months ago, and I doubt I can fix anything, but I still wanna know if im in the right in this situation, cause ive gotten both yeses and no's from the people ive asked",

      "description": "So I like the spot I live in and like my roommate alright, but this situation sort of has me feeling disrespected and a little nervous tbh. \n\nMy roommate is a 40 yo man, and not small. Iâm a 125 lbs 28 yo woman, and carry my own just fine but unfortunately we move through the world a little differently. Mainly, I donât really invite guys I donât know to stay at my house. Not that I think random dudes are gonna hurt me, but I mean, common sense says thereâs a likelihood it could happen. At least I can defend myself against someone whoâs in my same weight class. Men tend to be outside of that. \n\nMy roommate has a burning man camp and loves to be host to people from all over the world, which is actually pretty cool. But it just weirds me out that he invited some guy to stay at our house when he was out of town with his girlfriend, didnât really tell me until I asked him what was up, (he asked if I was gonna be home that night, I asked him if he was having a guest over).  \n\nSo Iâve already texted him explaining this. I am hoping he understands where Iâm coming from.  As well, I have a dog who probably wouldnât bite a stranger coming into the house, but Iâd hate it if that happened. I asked for at least a heads up in future so I can decide to be there or not, and get my dog so heâs not acting like a guard dog to a stranger in the house when no one is home. \n\nYea, so I might be over cautious here, but my intuition says strange dudes in my house without their host is a bad idea.

      "description": "His vocal tic is this really loud fucking noise that sounds like someone is clearing their throat.  I canât explain it perfectly.  Itâs like âUMMPHâ.  But itâs *loud*.  You will hear it all across the house behind locked doors.  It wakes me up every god damn morning.  And he does it constantlyâIâve counted and Iâd average it to around 6 times a minute.  I canât be around him.  I wonât be in a room with him for long because it hurts my head.   I donât watch movies or shows with the family in the living room because I canât handle the headache.  My only moments of bliss are when heâs sleeping because he doesnât do it.  \n\nI asked my parents about it.  And they donât want to get him medication that could help, but theyâll get me ear plugs.  Are you fucking kidding me?    And on top of this they treat me like Iâm being insensitive.   And they can tune it out so why canât I?   How theyâre able to tolerate it is beyond me.  Iâm not exaggerating when I say he might as well be screaming when he makes this noise. \n\nBut hereâs my big issue.  The biggest one.  I *know* this motherfucker isnât doing his tic this loudly, this often at his school and job.   Thereâs just no way.  Think about this logically with me.  He literally wouldnât be allowed inside of a classroom with how loud it is.  There is no way the people he sits next to in class tolerates it.  The teacher wouldnât be able to teach properly. \n\n\nI get it.  Heâs comfortable at home, heâs around his family, so he feels like he can âlet looseâ with his urge while heâs here.   But thatâs not okay with me.   If you are able to lessen the volume and the frequency, which you *have to* be able to do, then why canât you do that around me?   \n\nI get treated like an insensitive asshole whenever I bring it up.  Iâm not allowed to be comfortable in my own home beside of this constantly screaming in my ear.  I have no one to talk to about it.  Am I the asshole?\n\n\n\n",

We've moved into a 2 bedroom house with just ourselves.\nWe share one bedroom and he's converted the spare room into his office.\nI have 2 rabbits that I love unconditionally and now winter is setting in in the UK, darker days etc. I've found my rabbits can't play outside in their enclosure as much. Also because of my shift patterns (I work as a nurse), I haven't been handling them as much so they haven't been as friendly with cuddles recently.\nI've asked my boyfriend whether he would mind if I set up an enclosure area in the front room. They won't be free roaming, it's all enclosed and the bunnies won't be able to get to any of our furniture. They're also toilet trained so they poop in a tray so very easy to clean. They can exercise more inside and people often find their rabbits become more friendly because they have more interaction.\n\nHe has given me a very firm no simply because he doesn't want rabbits in the house.\nAITA for thinking he's being selfish?",

      "description": "First off, I understand that mental illness is serious. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I would never make light of therapy.\n\nThat said, my mother is a narcissist. And I do mean a god damn fucking narcissist. To the point where in this book which I read, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2133999.Will_I_Ever_Be_Good_Enough_Healing_the_Daughters_of_Narcissistic_Mothers my mother checked off on 31 out of 33 traits. It would have been 32 but one question I was not sure about because it seemed to be the kind of question that might require some mindreading, but still, 31/33. She will check off on nearly all if not outright all, for any other checklist someone might use for NPD.\n\nI have so many stories of her narcissistic bullshit but that's not what this sub is for - let's just say that she is a liar, thief, serial cheater, and overall a user (of people) and shitty person who REFUSES to learn from her mistakes. For years she has manipulated me. However, several years ago, I crawled out of the FOG. I learned about JADE and why to not do it, I learned about DARVO and Gray Rock and all that shit. Sometimes when arguing with her I might slip back into old habits and start to JADE a bit but I have gotten much better at standing up for myself after doing plenty of reading (including the book above) and certain subreddits like justnoMIL.\n\nMother darling has definitely noticed a change in my behavior. When she DARVOs, I attack her with all the viciousness of the product of the mating between a meowl and a velociraptor, refusing to back down until we end up in a stalemate (which with a narc can basically amount to a victory) Before, when she would cry/act like the victim in an argument, I'd feel bad and give in. Now I just continue attacking because knowing that she is trying to manipulate me only fuels my rage.\nGod \n\nShe has tried to blame this on my SO. She constantly attacks him (to me) telling me he can't take care of me because he has a disability (I have a disability too, me AND SO work fulltime in good jobs) among other stupid attacks. (she even has attacked his physical appearance, she has no place to talk because she is 100-150 pounds overweight)\n\nTo deflect her attacks from him, as well as giving more cred to my newly-developed spine, a month ago I told her I had been seeing a therapist for over a year because of my anxiety and depression.\n\nI didn't expect her to take this well and... well, my expectations were met. She mocked that fact, then asked me if my therapist was a legit, professional one, etc etc. Trying to worm out information about my \"sessions\" Even told me to make sure I told my therapist about all the WONDERFUL things she did for me my whole life.\n\nThis is why I said I was seeking a therapist - because there was no way I was going to tell her that I had gotten my shiny spine from people online. If she was going to make fun of a therapist, naturally she would mock Reddit or the books I read.\n\nThing is, I feel bad about lying about therapy. I would never mock anyone in therapy and I feel weird about lying about such a serious issue. I've had to repeat this lie to her a few more times when she complains about my changed behavior, or even tried to spin back what I said (ex. I said my therapist said that this specific behavior of my mother's is abusive. So now my mother calls my standing up to her abusive) so I have to maintain this lie that I am actually seeking a therapist. Normally I feel that people should NOT lie about therapy because I've seen people do this (or make up mental illnesses) for pity points/escaping responsibility.\n\nAITA for making up a therapist to defend myself?",

      "description": "So a little background:\n\nI am absolutely 100% terrified of chickens and I have no idea why. I couldn't tell you a single thing about chickens that is scary or creepy, but every time I see or think about them I am filled with overwhelming fear and paranoia...for seemingly no reason at all. I've never had any sort of traumatizing experiences with chickens or even a singular chicken unless I've somehow deeply suppressed the memory. Its become a running joke among my friends and family and I'm able to acknowledge that its a strange irrational fear but the sheer mention of chickens puts and image of one lurking behind me and then I find myself checking over my shoulder to seem if somehow one has managed to sneak up on me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, recently my mom has completely redecorated our kitchen to be themed around CHICKENS of all things. This includes pictures of chickens, salt and pepper chicken shakers, plates and hand towels with chicken pictures and even statues meant to look like real chickens . {WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS???} I wish I could say I could ignore them, but no matter where you look there is always a chicken...staring...directly at you. I don't even know if she did this on purpose or if she just wasn't thinking, but wtfff I'm too scared to go into the kitchen now because I'm being watched.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo top it all off, my sisters (who definitely remember my phobia) have decided that it is HILARIOUS to take those life-like statues and stick them in cupboards so that when I open the door the chickens fall on me and send me into a panic. I haven't said anything to my mom yet because I know she spent a lot of money on all the decorations and I don't think she even thought about the fact that I am terrified of them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, all that being said, would I be the asshole for asking her to return the decorations and do a different theme?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I have an irrational fear of chickens and my mom has decorated the entire kitchen area in chicken decor.

      "description": "We've been together 4 years, living together for about 3 years. He has to medically retire from the military, which can happen as soon as February. So we decided we'd like to do a courthouse wedding before then and do a small (30-40 people) wedding in Vegas later on so that our families can attend. I am so excited and happy that we are going to get married soon.\n\nI sent him pictures of rings I liked, which are mostly rose gold halos with some sort of diamond alternative like morganite. I found my dream ring and sent him a link. I didnt say I had to have it, but I did let him know that this particular ring was my favorite so far.\n\nTonight while in bed he randomly asked me \"How much is the most expensive dress you own?\" To which I replied probably around $50. He then said something along the lines of \"If that's the most expensive thing you own then why the hell would I buy you a $2300 ring?\" He proceeded to say how ridiculous it was and laughed at me.\n\nI feel like if he were to have said something along the lines of \"I would love to get you that ring but I feel as though we should put some of that money towards the wedding or honeymoon,\" I would have been fine and open to that. But I ended up feeling like he was saying I wasnt worth it. I felt like shit and was immediately angry. I don't see what the cost of my own dresses have to do with my engagement ring..?\n\nHe makes around 50k so $2300 is definitely less than what he makes in a month. I also dont believe a guy should pay 3 months salary on a ring and those rules are silly. While this ring is my favorite I don't HAVE to have it. I'm fine with cheaper but similar styles. But I cant help but feel like shit based on his response.\n\nOne of the main reasons why im angry is because I've seen him make a lot of expensive purchases in the past 2 years that weren't needed. His justification is that if he uses it every day then it has to be nice... and expensive equates to \"nice\" for him. I dont know how many times I've heard him say that. The job opportunities that hes come across for after he leaves the military actually pay more than he gets paid now. It feels like hes saying I'm not worth it because I dont splurge on myself like he does on himself. Feels like he is saying Im \"cheap,\" therefore I dont deserve that cost of a ring.\n\nIn his defense, it is a time of transition and uncertainty for him. Even though these other job opportunities look promising, it's not all set yet. We will also need to move out of state soon. We plan on having a small budgeted wedding (around 5k) after we move and he gets settled in a new job. So I get why he doesnt want to spend much right now. And I'm open to that. But I just feel so hurt.\n\nAITA for suggesting a ring with that price?",

My sister has had parties in the past that have been mellow, and a couple that have made me extremely uncomfortable with how many people are there(my sister is aware of how uncomfortable these parties make me).\nRecently, my sister told me she would be having people over on a weekend night while my parents were gone. This was fine but I ask for nobody to go upstairs or in the garage so they dont let out our animals. The night of I go about shutting and locking all the doors that need to be a locked and set up a gate up for the stairs. \nWhen I entered the kitchen I asked someone if the room smelled like gas to them. Someone had leaned against the oven and left the pilot on for who knows how long. I turn it off.\nI look at the stairs and it seemed like somebody tracked dark wet mud all the way up to the top. I follow the trail and try to get into my parents room. My parents door was locked so I pick the lock open. I wasn sure what to expect when I walked into the room but it ended up being a guy in the bathroom. I knock on the door and tell him he shouldn't be up there.\n When i checked the garage someone moved everything and unlocked all the doors, again. I walk out to find four people sitting in my garage that doesnt have any lights sitting on the ground with the side doors open. They had let all of my moms indoor cats out.\nIrritated now by the last few incidents. I find my sister who was in charge of the music. The music was very loud still so I yell multiple times for her to turn it down or off so I could make her look for my moms cats. I get her and a few people to go outside and help me find them. I was really upset during this time so and I told her it was really bad that someone had let them out and how upset I was. After a bit, fortunately we got them together and I put them all in my room for the rest of the night.\nI walked out again and the room was filled with smoke and smelled like fire. The room was full of people yet nobody seemed to notice. Someone had leaned against the oven and turned it on causing a box someone set on it to catch on fire. I grab the flaming box and push through the group of people to set it in the sink.\nThe next day I get home from work to find my sister was loudly explaining to my parents on how upset she was that I yelled at her because the cats got out painting me as the villain of the night. Frustrated, I walked into the room and asked why she was saying such mean things. It turns out her best reason for saying all this was due strictly from the fact that I yelled at her about the cats. At this point with everything I had dealt with the night prior I exploded. I told my parents everything that had happened the night prior. She had nothing to defend her point, but now she wont talk to me and has disinvited me to our trip to various music festivals we had planned together this year. AITA for being so mad?",

      "title": "AITA for being upset that boyfriend is gifting $20 state tax credit to his brother",
      "description": "Ok. Maybe super boring thing to bring up. Boyfriend and I have been living together for over 5 years. Over a year ago we moved into his family home with his sister and uncle after his mother died. He has been baring the brunt of all the household decisions (fixing old ass plumbing, etc). He is also addressing challenges that come with living with adult family members, one of which is retired and bringing in a small pension and the other that has had a job for a total of three months in the past 10 years and stays in the bedroom drinking most days. Prior to moving in, the boyfriend and I spent almost every weekend for 6 months cleaning out the family home of over 50 years of accumulated junk.\n\nThe other family member, Brother A, doesn't live in the family home, but has been bringing over a monthly amount to cover his part of property taxes and the home equity loan that their mother took out a while before she died. The brother doesn't live here, but wants to pay in so that the property (that's worth a ton of money, btw) won't get sold. The brother lives rent free with his girlfriend, but makes half as much as my partner and I do individually. Side note-the brother did not participate, although invited, in any of the 6 month weekend house cleaning events.\n\nEnter the point-\nYesterday, my boyfriend was doing his taxes. He was getting to the state part where the tax software offers one free state tax processing. For the past 5 tax seasons he has gifted it to me, which was nice. It would be totally understandable if he used it for himself. But he said that he was going to have his brother use it because he makes half as much as we do. So I was mad because he deviated from a pattern unexpectedly and said it in a weird way. The brother has always made half as much and has always not paid rent as long as I've known him so what's changed? If the argument is financial then why isn't he considering the fact that I pay over 25% of my income on student loans. In fact, the only reason I can do this is because I live for low rent in the family home. So, it's crazy for me to even allow myself to jeopardize this situation, but I am looking forward to having a situation with more standing when the student loans are paid off. Ultimately, I'm not my boyfriend's child and he is under no obligation to want to have a partner he has to take care of. The brother goes away on weekends often with his girlfriend and drops money on hotels like crazy. The boyfriend also puts the brother on the shopping club card accounts, but, admittedly, I am always with the boyfriend for shopping days so it is probably no big deal. $20 is not that big of a deal, but I feel hurt about this and think, just maybe, I might be the asshole.\n\nI confronted him about it and another separate issue relating to the brother last night and he said I'm being ridiculous. My gut feeling is, despite how minor this situation seems and how good our relationship has been, that this means something not so good. My boyfriend thinks I'm being petty about $20, but it's not really about the $20. I feel like he considers his brother over me and that he thinks the brother is putting in more effort than I think the brother is.\n\nAITA?\n\n",

We have been on very good terms and have met up several times to work out issues of custody and how we want to raise our child. \n\nThe last time I saw her, she was really showing (34 weeks). As we were leaving, we hugged and I felt a pretty strong desire to bond with my child, so I put my hand on the bump so I could connect with him/her. She swatted my hands away and stepped back from me and told me not to touch her. I tried to explain that I was just trying to bond with my kid, and she can't understand where I'm coming from because she gets to have this close connection with him/her and I am so separated from the baby right now. She wasn't hearing me and left. Then she texted me and told me we should work the rest of it out formally in mediation. I texted to apologize, but she isn't answering. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for going to church with my Exâs mom?",
      "description": "My ex and I have been broken since July of 2018 and it ended quite poorly, sheâs not allowed to talk to me because her boyfriend (sheâs now dating the guy she was dating before me again) doesnât allowed her to talk to me unless she wants to yell at me. We had no closure and that bothered me quite badly but with time I realized that itâs not on me, I tried but she refused to. Her and I had been together for three years and I moved to Germany to be with her and in that time her family became very good friends of mine, therefor I would go to church on Sundays, the same church her mom goes to and weâd talk for a few minutes afterwards. Nothing more than that. I recently returned to the little German town on Thursday and went to go pick up a box of stuff that she found that was mine. During that time I asked her if I would be seeing her at church that Sunday and she said yes. So, Sunday comes around and I go to church and she shows up a bit late with her dog, everything goes as normal and afterwards her and I start talking a bit, sheâs not doing well because of her depression and she has a lot of worries so I asked if sheâd like to talk about them, she said yes so we started walking back to her place (about 5 minutes from the church) and she told me whatâs going on. Then, my ex comes out and walks right past me without saying a word. I thought it was a bit rude but I understood that she didnât want to see or talk to me. I went home and she proceeded to text me that Iâm not allowed to go to church there anymore because itâs âweird to be doing anything with my mother, you need to move on.â I really donât want to stop going there, itâs small, I like the sense of community it has and as Iâm not very religious, if I didnât go there I most likely wouldnât go at all. But it always felt special there. She threatened to bring her ex/new boyfriend with her to church if I continued to go there and theyâd harass me, neither of them go to church regularly / at all. I decided itâs most likely not worth it because her mother isnât doing well and doesnât need that stress in her life and neither do I. Am I the asshole for wanting to still go to this church and be able to talk to her mother for 5-10 minutes a week?\n\nTL;DR: I go to the same church as my ex girlfriends mother and talk to her for 5-10 minutes after the service. My ex then told me sheâd bring her (ex before me)new boyfriend and make me stop going. Am I the asshole for wanting to still go to this church and be able to talk to her mother for 5-10 minutes a week?",

      "description": "So I just started working at a new job, Ive made some friends but I dont really consider them all that close because we all just met around the beginning of this year.\n\nThis includes my boss'. Ive got like three, two of which happens to be mother/daughter.\n\nThey are nice, and I like them however its painfully apparent their management could improve in several different areas. I know theyre not exactly on anyones good side right now for every person I've spoken to has something to say about it. Its usually not anything good. Plus, their performance has caused a few to quit. Good people might I add, caring, responsible, respectful. Its a shame, but also gives way to hinting at something shady that might be going on under the surface. Thats what I, and others suspect anyway based on what was talked about with a select few.\n\nI'm just hoping they'll get it together with time, after all they just opened up late last year and managing can't be easy when you're forced to work overtime nearly every week because of underemployment.\n\nSo anyways, the mother, the top boss of the facility has her birthday fast approaching. Her daughter, the boss I usually go to if I would need anything, wants to celebrate with everyone at the workplace. To me thats strange, but I get it I think. Personally I'd want to keep my birthday private and celebrate between family and close friends.\n\nSince I barely know the two I wasnt exactly planning on attending the party they are throwing. The more the daughter talks about it the more it sounds like shes expecting everyone to not only attend but pitch in on gift giving. (This is all via text mind you)\n\nShe wants to gift her mom a gift card, 100$, and explained that since we have ten workers we all should be able to put in 10$. That's what I make in an hour.\n\nIt would be reasonable to me if I knew these two better and considered them closer.\n\nBut I dont, its all purely impersonal. Friendly, but impersonal. I'm nightshift, so I hardly ever see them too.\n\nI just think its wierd to be giving my boss money. Even if its her birthday. Isnt her family going to give her gifts? I dont know why they need me, near stranger, to gift her.\n\nEither way, I am damned if i dont socailly, so I think i might contribute anyway. I usually have no problem at all throwing money to gift people I love, spoiling my siblings when I can afford it. \n\nBut this isn't just for me here, I mean i know a couple coworkers literally working 3 jobs, living paycheck to paycheck. It feels all too wrong to be asking money or gifts from them. &gt;&gt;; it doesnt feel right to me, I'm inexperienced so i dont know if its custom to do that for your boss.\n\nI dont know if im being a stickler, gluttonous, or unreasonable. I dont know, what would you do in this situation? Am I an ass for not wanting to have anything to do with her birthday? I have half a mind to call her out but I dont know if Id be in the wrong.",

      "description": "Context: I went to my friend's birthday party around 2-3 weeks ago, and I met one of her lifelong friends. At the party, we played truth or dare, so we ended up kissing. I ended up developing a tiny crush on him (we'll call him Javier). We all went out again two days later and we bumped into each other. Nothing really happened aside from some jokes that we would look good as a couple. The birthday girl (let's call her Julieta) asked him in private if he liked me, and he responds with \"a little\". \n\nOn Wednesday me, Julieta and Javier decided to go to a cafe. We ended up going to Julieta's house to watch a horror movie. She had already watched it so she wasn't paying a lot of attention. There was only one blanket, thus I and Javier shared it. He was getting extremely close to me, and I was ok with it. She had to leave the living room twice to either go to the bathroom or her sister asked her for something. Therefore, we began to make out. He talked about how he liked me and complimented me. It felt more lust than love, honestly. We had to go early to go home because it was getting late, and I didn't want to walk alone when it's dark. \n\nFast forward to Friday, he kept asking me for nudes, so I delivered (which I regretted it the moment I sent it, so I deleted it. But since we were using whatsapp, it saves the image to his phone). He then asked where I lived so he could go to my house on Monday to \"get to know each other\" and he kept insisting for us to be alone. I told him no, because my mother wouldn't let me. He went on how no one would find out and it's not a big deal. I kept refusing so he says to visit his house (while the both of us alone). I asked him why we couldn't do this outside. He responded with \"No, my aunts are everywhere and they'll snitch about us\". He also talked about how his brother is sometimes at his house, then I told him, \"So why can't your brother be there with us?\". He answered, \"Just no, it's not like I'm going to have sex with you\". I didn't respond for some time and he just went ahead and texted me, \"You know what? Don't even come to my house\". I wrote him back with a simple \"ok\" and we haven't talked since. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to be alone with him at his house?",

I didn't inform my boyfriend of the insane amount of snow on the truck that he would have to clean off (which I usually do). He left with only a few minutes to get his kids to school, and he saw all the snow and lost his shit on me. He then called and bitched me out for not telling him ahead of time. \n\nSo AITA?

      "description": "It was New Yearâs Eve. I live in a small apartment complex that has 2 separate apartments. One on top and one on bottom. I live in the top and my neighbors on the bottom. \n\nI notice that my neighbors are celebrating the new year and have guests over including a lot of kids. They begin shooting fireworks so I take a look. When I get to the window I notice that the kids are shooting fireworks near my car.  To picture my parking situation imagine a rectangle as the building and form an L around the building.\n\nThe bottom of the L is the side of the building and where I park. The top part of the L is where they park and close to their front door. Not much of a yard to do anything with.\nSo anyway when I look I notice not only are they on my side away from all their vehicles and are shooting fireworks on top of a brick which seems unstable.\n\nI go outside and walk down and see the kids over there and the owner of the bottom unit. I walk up to him and just politely ask hey can you guys move away from my car just a little bit closer to the middle of our building and he says âdude just go insideâ I got under control. \n\nI did NOT say this in a mean way. Weâve only had one other incident. It is that they were putting their trash in my garbage can that I pay for. I never said anything but One day it was to full to put mine in so I took their trash out and sat those bags on the ground. He later asked me how much money I want to let him put his trash and I say none. It would be better if he got his own because one can not support both households. But a bag here or there wonât hurt.\n\nOther than that no incidents have occurred and I felt that his comment to just go back inside was unnecessary. I ended up telling him that if anything happens itâs on them and to have a great new year and have a good night. \n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "About 4 months ago me and 2 other friends signed up for painting lessons. We were all interested back then wanted to give it a try. 4 months later everyone except me seems to have booked progress. I'm talking about people painting Bob Ross style of paintings versus me who's paintings still look the same as when I started (which also look the same as my paintings I did when I was 8). This despites continuously practising at home, watching painting videos, learning about different styles, etc...\n\nWhen I told my friends I wouldn't continue anymore because I don't enjoy it anymore and get embarrassed between the others with my mess, they said I ruined the fun for them and that I was overreacting. They also called me selfish since I was the only one with a car and the practice place is far away (we live in a remote area and while I was the one driving, they did pay for the gas etc, though, we never really agreed on something like this.) We still had 4 months of painting lessons to go which we all payed up front, so they are also pissed that it would be wasted money now",

After my first of two classes, I get a text that my next class ( a three hour lab) has been cancelled, but he still has his class (a three hour lab at the same time). \n\nI tell him that Iâm going to go home and Iâm sorry about the inconvenience, but I didnât want to wait for 3-5 hours (my first class ends at 9:15 and lab starts at 11). He then starts to get annoyed (understandably) and curses me out. Particularly him saying that it was my obligation to take him home pisses me off because I was doing him a favor. Also, his motto is âIâm gonna do what I wanna do and you have to deal with itâ and now that I gave him a taste of his own medicine, heâs angry. In a few days itâll all be over because heâs my best friend and we have arguments such as these on a bi weekly basis, but now I am livid. \n\nTl;dr I told my friend I was gonna take him to school, but when my three hour lab got cancelled, I went home early so he has to take the bus home instead of me waiting 3-5 hours to take him home.

      "title": "AITA for getting upset with someone wanting to pet my dog while I was cleaning up after him?",
      "description": "My husband and I typically walk our dog every evening in order to get his energy out. To give some background on our dog: He is a gorgeous dog--when I say that I'm not just being biased; he's from a line of showdogs that just didn't meet the standards of the breeder, and given that we train therapy dogs (NOT service dogs) we decided to go with him. We have received compliments on him since he was a puppy, from random strangers, to groomers, to people literally driving by in their cars. At first it didn't bother me much until people started to approach him without asking. As I stated before, he's being trained for therapy as I have a business in counseling and have several clients interested in participating in animal-based therapies with dogs. In order for him to be trained properly he needs to pass two tests: CGC - Canine Good Citizen and the Therapy Dog Test. When people approach him without asking or make noises to get his attention and distract him in an attempt to have him pull towards them, it screws with his training. We have since gotten a \"training - please do not distract, please ask to pet\" vest for him and have a bit more success with strangers leaving us be. Still, that doesn't stop everyone. \n\nRewind to a few days ago: I was walking our dog and he (dog) was squatting to poop. My husband wasn't with us as he had to stay late for work, nbd. I can handle walking our pooch on my own. Now our walks: It usually takes about an hour of walking him before he goes (he's picky, what can I say) so when he *does* go we like to just let him be. As he was finishing up I started to pick up the poop and someone approached us, one hand out to touch our dog without asking. I was kind of annoyed by this--here I am, trying to cleaning up literal shit, the dog literally has a training vest on that says \"PLEASE ASK\" and he's (the guy) just trying to pet my dog without my seeing. Once he sees that I not only see him but am annoyed, he looks at the vest, and then asks. I respond, \"Dude, we're a little busy right now,\" and show him the dog shit I'm picking up. The guy then made a disgusted face, called me rude, and walked away. \n\nI get that I could have been a little more polite than pointing out the actual shit. Maybe this is just a compounded frustration of people feeling entitled to touch my dog because he's fluffy/cute. Did I react to harshly? AITA?\n\n**tl;dr: Training a dog for therapy, dog has a vest on that says to ask before petting; while I'm picking up my dogs poop someone tries to pet him without asking; I point out the poop to the guy and he gets mad and walks away. Should I have just let him pet my dog since he eventually asked? AITA?**",

Many in-laws, friends of the family, and children (a large percentage of which I have no real relationship with) will be attending. \n\nAs someone who suffers from both social anxiety and a stutter, these types of situations make me very uncomfortable. It's incredibly difficult for me to speak and hold a conversation. I can't relax and enjoy myself. I'm on edge the whole time.\n\nIn the past, I've always attended these gatherings (holidays, ect.), but as I grow into my mid 30's, I feel I deserve a break from the stress. Just the thought of blowing off this party brings me instant relief.\n\nI would love to be honest and tell my family how I feel, but I'm afraid I will come across as a selfish dick. Most people don't understand the emotional baggage and embarrassment that accompanies having a stutter, or social anxiety. I'm afraid they might think I'm making excuses, and trying to play the \"I'm special so give me an exception\" card.\n\nHave I earned a reprieve, or should I go and simply \"grin and bear it?\"",

      "description": "Disclaimer: This situation in particular is really resolved I guess in that we argued and then stopped arguing and moved on and I'm not really holding a grudge. I just really.. don't know if I was right in my feelings on the matter.\n\nLast week me and my boyfriend went to dinner before a large event in town. My boyfriend had been sliiightly irritable earlier in the day, but we both have a handful of mental health issues and work so that happens semi-often. He was fine when we left for dinner.\n\nAt dinner (Red Robin's btw), there was a football game on one of the TVs. I think it was the Patriots and the Packers? He was watching on and off while we had conversation. We arrived at the topic of sports, and then sports mascots, and how a lot of NFL teams aren't even real mascots.\n\nHe mentioned it would be funny to found a team and have your mascot just be some incomprehensible creature, and I was like oh, that's a thing, let me show you a picture! The Philadelphia Phillies (Baseball) have a mascot just called the Fanatic who is... weird. No discernable creature.\n\nIt took me like 10 sec to unlock my phone and get to pulling up the pic. Without looking at me (he kept his eyes locked on the TV which was behind me) he said \"no\". I said, oh, it's just a picture, and he repeated himself \"no\". I would like to also say he said it semi-hostiley, not super aggressive or yelling, but sounding annoyed.\n\nI was really confused, and kept insisting, and moreso asking \"but why???\" and he just said \"because I don't want to!\" and I continued to be like, but. WHY???? We went back and forth and he said \"I'm saying no and need to respect me when I say no even if I don't have a reason\".\n\nNow, we fought more after this and it escalated. I definitely (probably?) overreacted by getting really frustrated and upset by this and threatening to leave dinner (which is not what I'm asking about BTW, that was probably an asshole thing) and after maybe 15 min we both calmed down and returned to dinner.\n\nWhile we argued though he made it about me \"not respecting him and his no\" which... I don't feel like I have to say the weird things that starts to imply (which I brought up to him afterwards), when, to me... It was just rude??? Like, ok, yes, I guess, in general, if somebody does not want to do something I should not and try not to make them do it.\n\nBut how is it NOT rude to just... blatantly refuse to look at a thing COMPLETELY RELEVANT TO THE CONVERSATION and give literally NO CONTEXT AS TO WHY?? He eventually \"explained\" it was because he didn't like me being on my phone at all while we were on a date (which is totally fair but nothing he had ever brought up beforehand) but... isn't there at least a much nicer way to go about this? Even a \"no thanks, not right now\" or \"I'll look later\" or \"actually can you please not be on your phone right now\"???\n\nAITA??? I legitimately don't know. I usually feel confident in our arguments whether or not my feelings are legitimate but... I honestly cannot tell this time.",

      "description": "Currently deployed, have a son who will be a year old here this month. Stateside his mother lived with me because she doesnât work and her family lives far away so itâs the only way I get to see my son every day. I provide for them financially in every way. I am sending her money while Iâm gone. \n\nI left fairly recently, and while I am gone she will be splitting time (a few months a piece) between her family and my family so they can spend time with my son and help support her. Yesterday, she asked me if I would be ok with our son being in daycare for half the day M-F so she can go to the gym and work on her esthetician license. Her mom runs a daycare out of the house. I am fine with this as it gives her a chance to have some time to herself and the kid can socialize with other kids. So, I told her Iâd be fine with that and then she starts talking about how much it will cost. I said, âI have to pay my sonâs grandmother to watch him?â She then says that her mom is running a business and she could have a paying client blah blah blah. \n\nWe went back and forth a little bit and I said I think itâs bullshit Iâd have to pay my sonâs grandmother to help out taking care of him while his dads deployed and I thought that was the whole point of her going up there. The only silver lining to me being gone is that heâd get to spend time with family and theyâd get to spend time with him. It really kinda miffs me that Iâd give anything to get to spend time with my kid and Iâd have to pay his family to do that. The most frustrating part is Iâd honestly be surprised if this was coming from my sonâs grandma and not his mom. Sheâs very stubborn and after saying all this still doesnât understand where Iâm coming from and thinks I just donât want him in daycare. \n\nAm I missing something? AITA? How do I get her to understand where Iâm coming from? ",

      "description": "I (19F) met one of my really good friends who we'll call Rachel (20F) during our first week of freshman year of college. In the second semester of our second year, we're still really close.  \nLast semester, Rachel met and started dating a girl (19F) that we'll call Morgan. I wouldn't say that Morgan and I are friends, but we've hung out, either with Rachel (with me as the third wheel) or with our group of friends.\n\nI'm a lesbian, Rachel has just recently begun publicly identifying as bisexual, and I don't know about Morgan's label(s).\n\nBefore I get to the problem, I should say that Rachel is really, really, *really* affectionate. All the time and with everybody. She's constantly hugging me, playing with my hair, and saying she loves me. But she does this with everyone, so I've never really thought too much about it.\n\nHere's the problem, though- The other day, Morgan literally cornered me in the dorm bathroom and said she wanted me to stop being friends with Rachel. When I asked why, she didn't really give me a straight answer, all she said was that it was weird for her and we needed to stop. I told her I wasn't interested in Rachel like that and I left. We haven't spoken since, which has been a little awkward.\n\nI'm not looking for a relationship right now, and I've said that with both Morgan and Rachel present. Even if I was, I'm not interested in Rachel in anything more than a friendly way, and I wouldn't go after someone in a relationship. I don't think Morgan's talked to Rachel about what she said to me, and if she has, Rachel hasn't said or done anything differently.\n\nI understand that Morgan might not like that Rachel is so affectionate with everyone but I don't think I should have to cut her off because of that. I don't want to make Morgan feel uncomfortable but Rachel is one of my best friends and I don't think this is fair. AITA for staying friends with her?  \n",

The fact that it's hard work was the main reason I didn't want number two, and part of my argument was that I didn't think she would be able to handle it either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now when she complains about how tired she is, how tough it is with two, and how awesome it is for me to be able to go to work and get out of the house, I feel like telling her to fuck right off.

I was furious to say the least so in anger I snatched the vape from her, walked outside and threw it into the concrete.

Not a close friendship, but the kind of friendship with somebody where you catch up with them from time to time, realise you have very little in common with them, and then don't see them again for six months. For the record I don't have many of these kinds of friendships, but I have a hard time saying no to people when they seek me out.  \nSince his wedding 18 months ago I have not seen or heard from him once. He stopped cultivating his garden so to speak, and only spent time with his wife (who is much younger) and her friends. Basically, he let her put all the effort in for them both when it came to socialising and couldn't be bothered with the people he used to know. He moved away and started a new life.  \n\n\nHis wife abruptly left him two weeks ago, and since then he reached out and has clung to me and another one of my good friends like a rash. Strange text messages in the middle of the night, essays about how depressed he is, etc. We've both felt bad for the guy because he's going through a really rough time (his wife is already with a new guy, who she was probably cheating on him with) and have caught up with him a couple of times to soften the blow/genuinely tried to make him feel better. He usually spends our time together complaining how he's now cut-off from the life he had, which is fair enough, and how he has no-one to hang out with. I genuinely feel bad for the guy.   \n\n\nI have absolutely nothing in common with him though, and he is leaning on me as though I was his brother or best friend. Each catch up is a therapy session and it's really draining.  \n\n\nI don't consider him a friend, but I don't want to make a bad situation worse for him so I keep catching up with him and pretending to care, but I'm running out of f\\*\\*\\*s to give...  \n\n\nAITA?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Some backstory, I've lived with my current roommate for 2 years now, and I'm moving out in about a month because of the location and the fact that I'm no longer enjoying our living situation due to many factors and tensions over the course of living together. We currently aren't really talking, not due to a big fallout but because we just slowly talked less and less and it just became almost zero communication other than hellos and goodbyes (although the past couple days she has ignored me when I say those as well.)\n\nWe had an incident a couple weeks ago where I hadnât noticed that I left part of the counter messy for a couple days, and she told me she was upset that I hadnât cleaned it yet. I apologized and cleaned it. \n\nThere was a period a couple days later where I had come home to the kitchen absolutely trashed about 5/7 days of the week. As in food, trash, and cooking utensils on almost every surface. I felt quite justified in saying if she expects me to clean up after myself (a completely reasonable request) that I should be able to expect the same from her. She said she noticed and it that she was sorry, but she ended up bringing it back around to my clean up and how she was really annoyed that I just hadnât cleaned it up.\n\nThere was more to this conversation but at one point I said if it bothered her that much she could just clean it herself, and she responded itâs not her job to clean up after me, which I agreed to, I just didnât feel the situation required an angry response.\n\nHereâs where I wanted to ask if Iâm the asshole. There have been two areas on the counter and our dining room table that have been sticky and gross for a couple days now from her cooking/eating. I believe she didn't notice, and I brought it to her attention, not exactly politely but not rudely either, and asked her to clean it, using the words that she had said to me in the previous incident.\n\nShe said sorry, and that she may have missed something when she cleaned after she cooked, but now she is ignoring me and it is still not cleaned.\n\nAm I the asshole for not just sucking it up and cleaning it myself? What I did feels petty to me as it's really not a big deal and it is relatively easy to clean. I only have a month living here left and I'm trying not to make it a hostile living environment, but it feels very hostile, not only because of this but other things in the past. I could have easily avoided an argument and simply cleaned it myself, like I said to her about the first incident. Am I being a hypocrite?",

      "description": "TLDR: My mom was angery ant a employ that quit with no notice, so she decided to yell at me and embarrass me in front on my hockey coaches. And wasted one hour of my possible study time.\n\n\nMy mom wanted me to go to my hockey practice, I would have gone but I had 2 finals the next day and I need to study for them. When we were at the house I told her that I needed to study, because I did not have much time to study to day after I woke up at three pm (I woke up at three pm because I was studying until three am) she did not listen to me and she went out into the car, I went to the car because I did not want her to come back in and yell at me and my brother or break our stuff (she already broke my computer monitor)\nWhen I got in the car she started driving.\n\nWhile we were driving I told her that I was up till three studying because I am very worried about my finals, she said that that was my problem and she doesn't care. I asked her if we could stop to talk and work this out with out a argument she said no we are still going there if you like it or not, she said I did not give her 24 hours notice so I could not stop this. I asked if I could call the coaches and ask if it is ok I do stayed home studying for my finals, she said call them and handed me her phone. I called the all the coaches numbers and none of them picked up (I think they were all driving to the practice) \n\nWhen we got to the rink I asked her why she was doing this and she said I had an employee quit with no notice after a full days work and I think this is the problem with melenals these days (I am not a melenal I was born in 2003) I asked her why she was putting her anger for another person on me, she dodged the question and said you melenals don't commit to anything, I asked again and she said am not putting and anger on you I am just saying you can't commit to a job or anything like that. I can and have commited to a job and I did a good at it, I worked the job for as long as the position existed, I also commend to football and I went to every practice and game I also do the same with hockey but since I have exams I need to focus on studying. She then yelled at me and insulted me in the car then said either go talk to the coaches or play. At this point I was crying and said I don't want this to become a bigger argument and I want to know why you are so angry at me. She left the car and said that she does no need this from me. I went in and told the coaches that I could not be at practice today because I need to study. They then laughed and thought I was joking I said no and I need to go they said ok and I left (I was still crying during talking to the coaches) and me and my mom had a silent ride back home\n\nWhen we got home my brother asked why we are back I told him the story and he said I was in the wrong.\n\nSo am I the a hole, or why did my mom act this way.",

      "description": "Throwaway account\n\nI've been with my boyfriend almost 3 years. When we first met he told me he was a virgin, in his mid twenties. He knew I was not as I've been open about past relationships. Ours is the only \"real relationship\" he has been in. \nThe other day it somehow came up and he made a comment like \"yeah that's what you think\". After half an hour he finally admitted that he had lied to me about it. For years. He tried playing it off like he only said it the one time but I know that we have had multiple conversations around it over the course of the relationship.\nTo clear it up I'm not mad that hes wasnt  a virgin but I dont know why he lied about it. His excuse was because of his religious family but I remember him telling me he had done everything else but sex. He also told me he had been waiting for marriage. That was a big deal to me. I was really patient and put up with a lot off bullshit over the last few years. I felt responsible in a way , to really push through issues in the relationship or cut slack because I took his virginity that he said he had beenwaiting to lose with the right person. \nHe basically told me I \"couldnt stay mad at him\" and asked me what I want him to do, since he lied about it a long time ago. He apologized but the fact he was trying to lie when I was confronting him makes me really upset. I feel like hes lied about a bunch of other things now. He keeps telling me to drop it/get over it and that I'm an asshole if it changes my view if him but honestly right now it does. Aita? \n",

      "description": "Hey my dudes. I recently finished an amazing game, and bought the DLC for it. The main character for this game is a woman. \n\nThroughout the base game, there are plenty of female fighters and hunters and yada yada, but after finishing a specific side quest, you hear mutterings of âCan you believe a *WOMAN* is blah blah blah? At least she did it for a *MAN*â, and things of the like. I donât mind that, and actually appreciate that it spurred some (sadly) realism into their world building. The main character was never slandered for being a woman, which contextually made sense and was fine. The sexism was solely in one city of the game, towards a specific character who is not you. \n\nIn the DLC, one of the very first people you talk to is a man, and he says âYou know, youâre a lot like my daughter!!! Youâre both...uh...how do you put it...â and main character retorts angrily, âWomen?â to which the guy is like âNononononono youâre hahahahhaha independent? hahahaâ\n\nI absolutely hated that. I hate that the base game was set up with gender roles and yada yada in place, then suddenly in the DLC, it changes. The above comment wasnât even relevant. It didnât even make sense in context. It was very poor writing. \n\nSo I texted a friend about it, saying âFuck that kind of dialogue tbhâ and such, then she texted back and said âThatâs a super shitty stance you take on that.â then turned on her read receipts for me and has been ignoring me since. Admittedly, I did not mention that it was specifically a problem in continuity and writing, but she took it as a jab to feminism. \n\nAm I the asshole??? ",

      "description": "I was born, raised and went to college in Philadelphia but my fiance is from the south. Last year his cousin got married at this plantation and it was really beautiful and had a nice aesthetic and since we were getting married in the South I wanted to have a plantation wedding as well. Obviously I don't support slavery in any way but it's just a pretty location to have a wedding and evokes southern charm with the antebellum themed houses and beautiful backdrop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we started planning the wedding, I asked 6 of my friends to be my bridesmaids. One of my bridesmaids I was  best friends with in elementary, middle and  high school but drifted apart a bit when we went to colleges in different states. We are still friends but  definitely feel college change us in many ways. She became very passionate about social justice issues and black identity (she is biracial- half black half white) which is great but we didn't relate as much. She is completely against the idea of a plantation wedding. She says it's like having a wedding at a concentration camp and they were the settings of terrible practices towards slaves . I really think this is an unfair comparison. People were killed at concentration camps and those are set up as memorials to the holocaust. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she is very adamant about it and says if I have a plantation wedding she won't be my bridesmaid and won't attend my wedding. I think it's a bit ridiculous and dramatic to sacrifice a 15 year friendship over something so petty and provide and ultimatum. It's a piece of land that has culture and history. What's worse is that it's making some of the my other brides maids uncomfortable now and they are thinking I should just have the wedding at a different location. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here? ",

      "description": "Hey,\n\nMy recent girlfriend of 2 months was round last night. We had already had sex twice, it was late, and I decided to go down on her. To begin with when we were kissing and I started giving her head I was fully hard. Thing is, I was giving her head for about 20 minutes, and I was lying down so my body weight was on my penis also. Now I was really enjoying it and really aroused, but after that length of time and the fact my penis wasnât being touched and it was essentially squashed between myself and the bed, it wasnât the ripe old police truncheon it was 20 minutes before. It was just semi-erect. Like I was clearly turned on but it just needed a tiny bit of attention etc before penetration. \n\nI thought that was reasonably normal, I didnât think it means I have erectile dysfunction or anything. I mean any other time we have sex I donât have any problems. \n\nWhat the issue was, is the way she reacted. When I came up and kissed her, she grabbed my penis and saw it wasnât fully erect. Then she just kind of slapped me gently and rolled over in a mood like ânever mind then youâre not even hardâ. I told her I was turned on I was just down there for a while, and itâd be fine after some foreplay. But she said I was selfish and basically left and slept on the sofa. \n\nToday Iâve been in a foul mood because honestly it just upset me, like I feel like maybe my dick just isnât working right. She said it should just be hard. \n\nSo basically my question is, although I have a suspicion that Iâm not an asshole in this situation, I still wanted to get second opinions; am I an asshole for not keeping an erection in that situation? Or rather, is it NORMAL or should I actually be concerned about ED? And lastly, am I wrong for being in a mood with her and telling her Iâm upset about it? \n\nSorry this is a bit crude. Thanks anyway. ",

      "description": "Context goes a little far back but within 2018: things started to go awry when I left the DnD group for being sensitive to sound and that I got mad at his friends for laughing at the mic even when I asked the DM to lower their voices (and yes, I also lowered my volume to the minimum).  \n\n\nWhen I learned that my bf was going with his friends for a hangout, I felt offended and blocked all of his friends because I thought that they were hanging out without me, therefore excluding me from the group even if they did tell me that I was their friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe night I had a hysterical fit (because this seems more appropriate) over Discord, my boyfriend told me I was apologizing to them but just telling me that I was just forcing my apology over them and they were having none of my bullshit. I can't really grind on the deets here since I don't recall any memories of that night due to having a mental illness that worsened that night.  \n\n\nI think they know of my illness because I have a vague memory of them discussing that they too are going through mental illnesses of sorts, but it seems that they failed to understand that I'm a different case from them, especially when I decided to stop my medication for more than 6 months to try to cope with expenses and to avoid medication dependence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it right for them to get mad at me and that I feel guilty for feeling for how I felt and that because of said feelings, my relationship with his friends are practically non-existent now?

      "description": "I'll try to make this concise. Started dating this girl for about two weeks, she love bombed me and told me she doesn't like guys usually but knew I was different. we were supposed to have sex (she planned it, weird) but then get a text from her saying her grandpa is dying. I was as supportive as possible without being overbearing, she wouldn't open up. Then she gets extremely distant and pulls back by saying she doesn't know what she wants or if she wants anything, and that we should continue hooking up without expectations of a relationship. A week goes by, she always had an excuse to not hang out. Then grandpa dies, she cancels our weekend plan to go home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe hang out the night she gets back from home, and she tells me she wants to be friends, that the only guys she's ever dated were her best friends first and they both cheated on her so she's guarded. Didn't say there was no hope but didn't imply odds were good either. I agreed to friendship because I thought she was in a bad state mentally due to the grandpa, and because her history is valid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found out that when she pulled back the first time, she started seeing her ex-hook up. They're just casual but it didn't matter to me. I called her out, she claims she told him they were over when she met me, but his grandpa had died around the same time as hers so she crawled back to him because they could relate. She said she hoped I could forgive her and start a friendship and I ended it by saying I needed space and time to think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave been in no contact, received a simple happy Thanksgiving text from her which I responded to but that's it. AITA for abandoning a girl who fucked with me mentally, pulled back multiple times without giving me a chance, only to overlap with her side guy? I will not tolerate people to treat me like garbage while enjoying themselves with someone else, but I feel like an asshole because I do care about her and would have loved to get to know her better, but her actions leading up to this moment made me feel strung along and devalued as a human",

      "title": "AITA for not supporting my husband",
      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom. My husband (43M) graduated college with a degree in journalism many years ago. He worked at the same paper as a reporter for over ten years, and was fired without warning or explanation about a year and a half ago.\n\nOriginally I was supportive, but six months after he was fired he still hadnât found a job, anywhere. He was set on finding another job as a reporter even though itâs a dying industry, not looking at other fields. I had been gently asking him to look at other careers, but he refused as his experience and background are in journalism. I set him up with a life coach through my insurance to help support his job hunt, helped him with writing/rewriting his resume and cover letter, and encouraged him to go to a therapist since he was extremely depressed about being fired (he said he didnât need to).\n\nAs his unemployment was ending and he still didnât have a job, I gave him an ultimatum- find something, anything, or move out.\n\nHe found a slightly better than minimum wage job, which left me still covering the majority of the bills and anything for our ten year old son. After much fighting about his job, he decided he wanted to take the LSAT and go to law school. \n\nI supported him in taking the LSAT, offered to get him a tutor, bought books and practice tests, and took our son out of the house on Sundays so he could take practice exams. His LSAT score was mediocre. \n\nI told him I only supported him going to law school if it didnât put us in a ton of debt. Heâs received an acceptance and partial scholarship to one school, but it would still cost over $100k to attend. \n\nI have straight up told him I donât support this. Unemployment for lawyers is extremely high, and that, combined with the debt weâd take on to do this, seems to make this an unreasonable career prospect at his age. Iâd also like to be able to pay for my son to go to college, and with the timing and debt weâd take on for law school, doesnât seem feasible to me (my husband says it does).\n\nIâve told him Iâm not opposed to him going back to school for a new career, but it needs to have better prospects than being a lawyer. He says this is the only thing heâs interested in and has any skill in, that heâs finally found something heâs excited about and wants to do.\n\nIn another fight about this today, he told me everyone except for me is on board with this- his parents, his friends that are lawyers and judges. AITA for not supporting him?\n\nTL; DR: My 43 year-old husband wants to go to law school to start a new career. I want him to choose a more realistic/less costly field. He says everyone except me supports this idea. AITA?",

      "description": "On mobile, blah blah blah, etc. \n\nTLDR: Husband started snapping coworker when she was 17 (now 18) and allegedly removed her from his snap list when my SIL, her husband, and I told him it was inappropriate. Thought that was that. Two days ago, I found that theyâre friends again and theyâve been exchanging conversation. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 2 years, and I am 8 weeks pregnant. He is in a management role at at a local large gas station/convenience store. Last fall, I found out that he was exchanging Snapchats with a young coworker, who was 17 years old at the time. I told him that I was wildly uncomfortable with their contact and that it was inappropriate. He told me that it wasnât like that, that it was kind of weird but that he felt bad for her because she doesnât have a lot of friends. (Iâm not sure how true this is because she post some pretty risquÃ©/sexy photos online.)\n\nFast forward to Christmas, and we are with his family. I bring up the issue to his sister and husband because we are very close with them and I trust their opinions. They both agreed with me, telling him he needed to stop what he was doing immediately. He said he deleted her on Snapchat and I thought it was done. \n\nFast forward to about 3 weeks ago, my husband and I join an xbox live party with a couple of my husbandâs coworkers, not knowing that this teenage girl was one of them. She doesnât say a word and immediately signs off. I find out after some probing that sheâs been upset about my husband deleting her and that he blamed his cutting contact entirely on me. He did this by telling her that he deleted her because I was uncomfortable. I was pretty unfazed by this because it apparently wasnât affecting their work relationship so I figured sheâd get over not being Snapchat buddies. \n\nTwo days ago, my husband is in the shower. My husbandâs phone starts ringing. I look and see itâs a telemarketer so I double click the lock button to end the call and see a Snapchat from coworker on the lock screen. Immediately, Iâm furious. I go to the bathroom and say, âI donât know whether to be angry with you or furious right now.â He asks what Iâm talking about and I tell him what I saw. He goes silent for a moment and then says, âShe added me back. I didnât know what to do. Iâm sorry.â I walk out and he finishes his shower. He comes out to get dressed and again says heâs sorry and that heâs a piece of shit. I didnât really acknowledge him because I was still so upset. \n\nIâve taken the last two days to think and I canât begin to understand why this girl is so important to have a friendship with. I trust my husband completely and I know that he hasnât been unfaithful because he literally has no time to be. Heâs always either at work, at school, or at home with me. \n\nI told him today that Iâm upset and we would talk about this when he gets home from work tonight. I donât think I should be having to have this conversation again about how inappropriate I feel this friendship is but the other part of me is wondering if Iâm an asshole for trying to stop my husband from being friends with a coworker. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA here?",

      "description": "**Back story**\n\nI used to be friends with (let's call her) Sandra, then she became controlling and manipulative (and now that I think of it, fairly emotionally abusive). I fairly much stopped talking to her because of this behavior. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this, one of Sandra's kids bullied my eldest kid for about a year, both in and out of school (mainly emotionally - isolating her from friendship groups, continually putting her down, calling names, lying, etc). My kid didn't reveal it until the end of the academic year, so we couldn't address it. Now the kids are at different high schools, so I thought it best to just leave it without making a fuss (while telling my kid that we recognized that Sandra's kid's behavior was completely unacceptable and that she was amazing for having dealt with it so well. It's no longer an issue).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been in their house: chaotic doesn't do it justice. I suspect that there's emotional abuse within the home, and that from my experience (while we were friends) her husband is the victim. The kids frequently have no bedding, wear dirty clothes to school, aren't dressed appropriately for the weather, are frequently left for long periods of time without supervision, and all three (youngest is 8) play Grand Theft Auto and similarly rated games. I totally get that everyone has the right to live in a house and raise their kids any way they see fit. I don't care if she never cleans her kitchen. I'm concerned with the appropriateness of the care given to her youngest kid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The incident**\n\nNow to yesterday. Her youngest kid comes into class with an anime comic which he shows to the 8 year old kids in the class. There's explicit nudity and some images of intercourse. My youngest kid tells me about it and knows enough to say that it wasn't appropriate. I report it to the school. They've come back saying that they're going to advise that he doesn't bring the comics in again. (Additional info: this kid has been reported several times for violent behavior - in and out of class - and defiance.)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My concerns:**\n\nAn 8 year old has access to (and has shown in school) comics with inappropriate sexual content. I don't think that the school's response is sufficient. So I reported the case to an NGO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reddit, AITA??**",

      "description": "Sorry, Iâm on mobile.\n\nSo Iâm a bi girl, and while not in the cards at the moment Iâd like to have a relationship at some point. Thereâs a pretty good chance that relationship could be with a girl, and Iâd like to be able to treat my hypothetical s/o the same way the rest of my cousins treat theirs. \n\nMy momâs side of the family is pretty conservative, and my cousins on that side regularly make homophobic jokes. If any of them really cared that much about me being not straight, Iâd be okay with just cutting them off. Iâve never been too close with any of them anyway. However, there are still a few complications.\n\nNumber one is my Grandma. My mom says that I absolutely cannot come out as long as Grandma is alive, as knowing that Iâm gay would âbreak her heartâ. I love my grandma, and I want her to love me, but I do want to know if her love is unconditional or not. Iâd also like to see if she could change. Sheâs getting up there in years, but sheâs a genuinely good lady with a great heart. If I came out, I could show her that the LGBT community is full of lovely people and she could learn to be more tolerant. But I donât want to cause her pain, and I donât want to be disowned or forbidden from going to family events.\n\nThereâs also the issue of the rest of my immediate family. I donât want to separate them from my cousins and aunts and uncles, especially since theyâre much closer with them than I am. Me being out could result in the entire family being excluded from Thanksgivings or vacations, or having to choose between me or the entire extended family.\n\nI also donât want them to think Iâm a predator because I like girls. Iâve heard them talk, and I know what they think about the LGBT community. Iâm worried that instead of realizing Iâm still the same person, theyâd think I was secretly some kind of evil predator the whole time.\n\nIâm only going to come out when I get a girlfriend thatâs serious enough to bring to my family, but I want to make sure Iâm doing the right thing when I do. WIBTA if I came out?\n\nFeel free to ask for more info.\n",

We dont get along well.\n\nShe knows that I had many boyfriend's before my current boyfriend and she paints me as a slut. Last month at a dinner she told my boyfriend that he should not get his hopes up because I was not a keeper. My bf was hurt and he started feeling a bit insecure after that. \n\nSo, I discovered that she was a Chaturbate cam girl when my friend came across her on the website( my brother doesn't know about this) and I decided to have my revenge. So I posted her Chaturbate link in the family group chat when she was live masturbating on the cam. All hell broke loose and everyone was shocked. Her family is extremely conservative and they were apalled. \n\nLater, she called me and I really felt sorry for her. She was crying and apologized to me and asked me if I intended to do anything more. My brother was mad at her and this caused a serious rift in their relationship and her parents told her that they have nothing to do with her anymore.\n\nDid I go too far? AITA?",

      "description": "Hey everyone, so I (28F) have been out of my parents' house for a while now, but visit frequently (once a week or more) and stayed there for about 6 months while I was moving back into the area. They have a lot of pets - a bird, 2 goats, 3 cats, and 3 dogs (one which they plan to breed this year once she is old enough) - which I am close with and consider \"family pets\".\n\nOne of the cats recently got sick while they were on vacation in Hawaii, and my brother and I had to deal with all of the vet issues-- taking him to the ER (he was literally almost dead when we got him there), consulting with the doctors, making medical decisions, and eventually footing the bill, which took my mother 5 months to finally pay back in full (after much reminding). About 2 months later, he had another issue and required surgery, which my mom willingly chose to do (more vet bills, but on her this time).\n\nSince then, he has been peeing on the floor in the guest bedroom. This is common after the types of issues he has had, and there are many ways to resolve the issue, which she tried zero to do. All she has done is complain about the cat, repeatedly ask me to take him (husband and I just moved into our recently flipped house), and she went so far last weekend to now start asking if we know anyone that wants a cat because \"she wants him out of her house\" and \"he has one foot in the ground\". I actually asked her if she doesn't love him anymore because of this issue, and she replied that no, she doesn't.\n\nI'm trying to accommodate the cat here, but we just rescued a dog and need to make sure they get along first, then acclimate him to the house and see if the peeing issue is resolved or if he is still having problems. I'm worried that my mom is getting impatient and that she may do something in the meantime.\n\nThe last part, which I feel ready to confront her about, is that all this while, she has been preparing to breed her youngest dog. I feel strongly that if she is having this type of reaction to the cat, she shouldn't be bringing more animals into this world, even if her intent is to sell them as pets. The cat had a medical issue that has led to the peeing problem, and her response has been to get angry, threaten to put the cat down, and admit that she \"doesn't love him anymore\".\n\nTL;DR Mom wants to put down family-beloved, otherwise healthy cat after medical issue causes random peeing \"on her brand new hardwood floors\", but actively planning to breed her dog to sell puppies.",

Ive planned this for about a month and It consisted of 2 Girls and 2 Boys. Now the catch here is that if not more than one girl went. The other girl didnât. Parents rules, Which I honestly think is reasonable but inconvenient. So one of the girls which ill just call her rose said for 3 days in a row and before i left âIll 100% be thereâ so me and the other boy left. We met up by the park and waited. We texted rose and the other girl.  Now Rose wasnt responding which was slightly annoying but nothing to bad and the other girl said she would be late. After around 40 minutes of waiting she said âi wanted to go to Sams with my brother sorryâ so we had to cancel our plans while we were there making it awkward. So i got mad at her and refused to talked to her for several day, Note that we were not to close friends at the time. But i still feel guilty. So Judge my fate reddit!",

      "description": "Husband and I have been together for ten years.  We have a beautiful daughter and Iâm pregnant with our second due in May.  \n\nMy first pregnancy was unplanned and after several years of sobriety, my husband relapsed and got a DWI.  We have since built a respectable life with stable jobs, a house, live in a good area, and put our daughter first.  \n\nMy husband started drinking again after several more years of sobriety and I found out I was pregnant with our second.  I told him to stop drinking around our daughter and myself.  \n\nHe has continued to sneak around and drink.  He has shown little to no interest in my pregnancy or the baby.  All preparation has been left up to me.  Things are getting neglected around the house and I canât keep up.  \n\nI have been secretly documenting and seeking legal advice from an attorney on separating and gaining full physical custody of the kids after I have the baby.  I plan on telling him to leave the house and find a different living situation.  If that fails since weâre both on the mortgage, I will be taking the kids and leaving myself.  \n\nThere has been silence between the two of us for quite awhile but the other night - while drunk - my husband came to me and told me he needs help with his drinking.   He is not the man he wants to be and he doesnât know what to do anymore.  He said he canât stop drinking but he wants to. \n\nI was too angry to really respond and told him to get to an AA meeting when he gets sober.  I left the room.  \n\nMy close friend when I confided in her told me I was being an asshole for rebuffing him and not giving him a chance.  Apparently, my plans to secretly leave with the kids are unfair and I need to talk to him now about it because heâs their father.  \n\nI donât want to talk to him about it until after the baby is born and Iâm too angry to want to help him.  Why does he get to be shitty and drunk and distant when it suits him and then ask me for help.  Iâm so overwhelmed with just the preparation of another human life coming into this world and protecting our daughter from his bad choices, Iâm just tired.  Selfishly Iâm tired.  \n\nAITA for not supporting him and going ahead with my secret plans to leave him and take the kids without upfront discussion?",

She also said that she doesnât expect me to read her mind but I should try harder and shouldnât have to be told everything to do.",

We've been together for 4 and a half years now.\n\nThis year I'm not doing so bad grade wise, he's not. And he's always trying to get his grades up. Which I understand, but sometimes I just wanna hang out and not just awkwardly sitting there while he does what he needs. I'm not trying to say \"Ignore your school work because I matter more.\" But sometimes it also feels like I'm getting nothing from him in general. \n\nSometimes I feel like he deliberately ignores me. I told him how I felt, and we agreed to work on it from both our ends. But it feels like within those three weeks we've gone in a circle,\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend is busy trying not to fail and I'd like to spend  time with him more with him.\n\nI understand if I can come off as the ass in the situation",

      "description": "So I met my current boyfriend while I was an intern while in school. He was a seasonal employee who was sort of my supervisor. Heâd give me work to do and stuff, and I had a crush on him from the moment I met him, but he had a girlfriend. i didnât know her, but we were in similar graduate programs and I know some of her friends. I couldnât really hide my feelings, and for the 3 months we worked together, we would flirt a lot and volunteer to work on projects alone. I fell hard. Weâre really alike and even our bosses would say that we belong together, even though they knew he had a gf. On my last day at work before I moved for a full time job I got, we all went and grabbed beers, and I pulled him aside and confessed my feelings for him that Iâve had since day one. We made out. I think he felt bad afterwards because of his girlfriend. He was supposed to move in with her two weeks later.\n\nWe continued to talk and he texted me one day saying he just had a long and difficult conversation with his gf and was asking me if he should tell her what happened. I asked if they were breaking up and he said yes. Because of that, I told him to not tell her. Well apparently they didnât break up after that convo, and she found out what happened. He initially lied to her about it because he felt so awful and didnât want to hurt her. We continued to talk all the time, and apparently they broke up, but they were trying to âwork on thingsâ and fix their relationship. He said he had some feelings for me so we continued to talk everyday while he was working on his relationship. Apparently the other girl found out and was furious. They finally officially ended things about a month after he confessed to cheating on her with me. Idk what happened to her except that she was in therapy. He said that things were on their way out with her anyway, and he had feelings for her but also had them for me and wanted to see where they went. \n\nWe started officially dating a month later and Iâve never felt this way before. Iâve never really had a serious relationship before and itâs been a long time since Iâve been with someone and I feel like heâs the one. We talked and got engaged a little less than two months after we officially started dating. \n\nI feel like it may be a little fast, but I am pretty religious so this feels kind of standard, especially with how I feel. My parents are super happy for us and I am too, but I have some lingering hesitations. He cheated on his gf to be with me, and I know he was telling her that nothing was going on between us while they were trying to âfixâ things. When she first found out he made out with me, he told her that I had just confessed my feelings and he rejected me, but only because she was so angry and upset and he got freaked out and scared, so I get it. But he said that things were on their way out with her anyway and he had had feelings for me for a few months while they were still together. And we connect so well, like God had this plan for us to be together. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "I have a 50-50 custody arrangement of my 8 year old daughter (Lisa) with my ex-wife/her mother (Ariana). For the past few years I have been making it a point to not attend events that Ariana is attending, and she has not been attending events that I attended. If it were up to Ariana, we would be chums - I, however, do not wish to have a friendly relationship with her. A civil relationship for the child's benefit is all that is necessary.\n\nLisa joined a sports team this year, and the year-end banquet is coming up, at a restauraunt 10 minutes from my home. Ariana informed me that she would like to attend. I requested that since Ariana attended the first game of the year (which was scheduled on 'my' day) that I be able attend the banquet (which also happens to be scheduled on 'my' day) alone this year, and she attend next year's banquet. Ariana replied that she would be there \"no matter who has her that day\". She offered to sit at a separate table and that Lisa would sit with me. \n\nI explained to her that I did not think it was best for Lisa to have both parents at the event, but only be able to sit with one, and that sitting together was out of the question - I have no interest in conversing with Ariana. I reiterated my request to switch who takes her each year, and that I be able to take her to the first one (since she attended the first game). \n\nAfter a few more exchanges with this same story playing out, she informed me she had explained to Lisa (she was home with her at the time) the situation, and had explained my feelings about not wanting to sit at the same table with Ariana, while in the same email explaining my feelings incorrectly.\n\nI told her that I didn't think it was the right thing to do to put Lisa in the middle of this argument, and that it wasn't her place to tell Lisa how I felt about the situation. I informed her that constituted disparaging me to Lisa, and was justiciable - then told her not to do it again. \n\nI then told her that I had discussed the situation with Lisa (I waited a day so I could discuss it with her in person), and that Lisa did not want to be put in a situation where she had to choose between her parents, and that Ariana will be taking Lisa to the banquet by themselves this year, and that I would like to take Lisa myself next year. I also included that Lisa said this seemed a fair way to do it. I know this seems hypocritical considering I just called Ariana out for it, however... damage control.\n\nAriana replied that she is not taking Lisa to the banquet just because I decided she would, since it will be 'my' day - that I needed to make it work. She said if she finds out that Lisa doesn't go because I was \"too busy\" that day, it's my fault that Lisa was unable to attend. \n\nTL/DR - I wanted to take her by myself. She said no, she's coming too. I said, fine, you take her. She said, no, you bring her and if you don't you're the parent at fault. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "My friends enjoy home hangouts. Every other weekend we would pick a location, typically my apartment or Lizâs (my close friend) apartment, and we'd all bring stuff for group entertainment. Being good friends, everyone brings food or drinks to share. Sometimes I would bring some nice alcohol or a meal, sometimes only chips and juice if that was what I could afford. Similar situation for other friends: sometimes they bring pizza, sometimes only a board game. No one was ever be called out for not bringing something. We're all college students so we totally understand that money can be tight. No big deal.\n\nAnyway, this night, Liz was hosting. I texted her asking if there was anything in particular I should bring. She replies saying that a friend I did not know would be bringing food for us. Cool. I opted to bring drinks and some video games. Note: This friend had been to previous group gatherings, I just didnât attend those.\n\nWhen I arrive, the new friend is not there yet. There are only desserts available. The friend, Mary, showed up about 15 mins later with those super long Port of Subs sandwiches cut into about a dozen pieces. Mary places it on the table and most of the group goes to get piece. I don't because I was in conversation with Liz at the time. Our conversation ends and Liz reminds me to go get some of the sandwich because we'll be playing games soon. I notice the sandwich has some stuff I don't eat but this free food at a group gathering, so obviously I'm not about to complain. Also, I'm pretty hungry at this point. I picked off what I didnât like and ate the rest.  \n\nAs the night winds down and people are talking about going home soon, Mary announces that anyone who ate a piece of the sandwich needs to venmo her $4.23. She says she did the calculations, that's the cost, and that she's sorry but she's on a college budget. I'm super annoyed because she waited until AFTER we all ate to put a price tag on it and like I mentioned, the sandwich isn't really something I would choose to eat but I did because it was the only non-dessert option. Liz told me she had no idea Mary would want to be paid back, especially considering that Liz's boyfriend had to give Mary a ride from her dorm to the sub shop, then to the apartment, then back to the dorm again when the night was over, all free of charge. Half of our friend group did know Mary before I did, so I have no idea if this was normal behavior for her but they didn't seem particularly surprised or annoyed. I think most of the people that ate a sandwich did venmo her. I personally decided not to pay her because I felt it was unfair for her to spring the cost on us after we ate. Had I known I would be charged, I wouldn't have eaten it. I do feel a bit bad because maybe she did really need the money but we're all on a college budget so it's not like that's a unique situation either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA? I'm willing to pay her if I am.",

She really wanted to go out (which we have not been able to do for a while) and spend the weekend together before she leaves, but several of my old friends are already excited that I'm making a trip in, and one had planned a party, which he has already spent a decent amount of money on. \n\nI'd love to spend the weekend with my wife, but my closest friend has already gotten the weekend off, which as a cook/bartender  is hard for him to do, and spent well over $100 on a small party for me. \n\nI can tell my wife is dissapointed, though she understands, and i want to be here for her before she leaves, but i don't want to leave the people expecting me hanging out to dry either. I offered to take her out on a nice date tomorrow, as I'm leaving on Friday, to make up for it, but i still feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. \n\nAITA for not cancelling my trip?\n\n\n",

      "description": "Iâm a high school junior, and I recently got into theatre. Iâve done two plays- one at my public high school and one at a local private all girls school. Because Iâm a guy, I was able to get a good role with little experience (they need as many males as they can get to fill the roles). \n\nNow Iâm auditioning for the play at the private school, and my friend is planning on doing the play at our public school. I prefer the private school plays because they are higher budget, better facilitated, and to be frank, I prefer the people there. \n\nMy friend got a large role in the play at our school, but heâs unhappy because he wanted the #1 lead in the whole thing. So today, he asked me âshould I audition for the play at (the private school). I do not want him to do so. \n\nImmediately I knew that it would not be easy to communicate to him that I did not want him to do the show. Itâs nothing personal, but I have made new friends and I would like to keep things the way they are. The private school is something of an escape because I can be a different person than usual, as none of the people there knew before I started doing their plays. \n\nSo when he texted me asking whether he should try out, I tried to be as delicate as I could (I was aware of the dangers of such conversation right away). I told him that I use the plays there as an escape, itâs nothing against him, heâs still my friend, but I would just prefer to keep them separate. I told him that he is of course free to make his own decisions but I would prefer if he did the show at our public school rather than the show I will he doing. He did not take kindly to this. \n\nHe was immediately angry. He said (over text) âI wonât fucking do it thenâ and said how he thought he could do the show with me because he has in the last confided in me that he is unhappy with the state of our drama program. \n\nAnyway, I tried to be civil and respectful. I repeated that he is obviously free to do what he wants, but the fact that he is angry doesnât change my feelings. All of these interactions were occurring over text. \n\nHe proceeded to go in with some personal attacks. He called me âMr. Bigshotâ even though I did not brag at all. His claim was that I thought I was better because I did the private school show when the truth is I just felt very strongly that I loved theatre and wanted to immerse myself in it ASAP. He also guilted me by saying âfine, Iâll just go be miserable at (public school)â. I would him I would not tolerate this kind of treatment when Iâm trying to be open and honest with him. \n\nI wanted to talk to him IRL, and the opportunity arose when I saw him tonight at a school event. I got a moment alone with him, and asked to talk, but he shook his head and said ânoâ. I was mad at that point because I felt like he didnât even want to attempt to figure things out.\n\nI feel like Iâm being fair because Iâm being honest, but itâs also possible that Iâm being mean by telling him I donât want him there?? \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I learned how to change my own carâs oil a few weeks ago and was super proud of myself. You know, researched it and watched a video and got my own tools and did it all myself. No problems. I was feeling pretty confident. \n\n My girlfriend mentioned that she hadnât changed her oil in about a year, had not even topped it up, and I was shocked by that. I told her thatâs way too long to wait for an oil change. So I offered to change her oil for her, too. BTW she drives a 1995 Honda Accord. She said she could just take it into a garage and pay for some one to do it, but I insisted I could do it for her if she just bought the oil.\n\n So I looked up which oil and fluid capacities her car takes (gasoline engine, cool climate, 5W-30 should do the trick). I proceeded to remove the oil plug, and I noticed that it was SUPER tight. I had to really reef on my wrench to get it loose, but it came off in the end. The oil drained into the pan super grubby and I showed it to her. I cleaned the plug, wiped the area around the thread on the reservoir and screwed the plug back in and tightened it up. I made sure it was pretty snug (Iâm a strong guy and gave it a few really good tugs) but definitely not as tight as it was when I first removed it, because that seemed ridiculous. Put the new oil in, ran the engine for a while, checked the dipstick a few times, and made sure it had enough. She was happy, and I was pleased with my âmanlinessâ Hahahaha. \n\n A week later, this morning she texts me before she goes to work saying that her engine cut out and wouldnât start. I tell her to check the oil level. Dead empty. I tell her to check underneath to see if thereâs a puddle of oil underneath. Yup. She mentions the engine was making knocking sounds before it cut out. \n\nFuck. Sounds like the engine ran out of oil and seized. She took a cab to work. Havenât gotten a diagnosis yet but Iâm going to assume that I didnât put the oil plug back in properly, or the thread got damaged somehow, and the oil all drained out and her engine got destroyed. \n\nI feel like a piece of shit for insisting on changing her oil myself and that itâs all my fault. AITA? ",

      "description": "So Iâm Randall and I have a friend group and we are all close and have all been hanging out for a long time now. For the past few years we all hang out together at least once a week. The group consists of me, my friend James, and two sisters, Sarah and Megan. James and Sarah have also been in a relationship for three years now but broke up a few days ago (He broke up with her). To make a long story short, James booked an upcoming trip for him and Sarah that they were both excited for and he spent a good amount of money on the trip (trip cannot be cancelled). But seeing as him and Sarah just broke up he asked me today how I felt about the idea of him altering the trip so his money wonât be wasted. Altering would mean, inviting me, his brother and Megan instead.Honestly that does sound like it would be fun but I felt like it would be a little grimy to take the spot on the trip that was initially meant for a close friend of mine. And his logic for inviting Megan was that him and Megan are still friends outside of his relationship with Sarah and weâve hang out as a trio in the past (prior to the break up) and a breakup shouldnât change that. Even though Iâm technically closer friends with James than Sarah, Iâm still close to Sarah and think it would be insensitive of me to go on that trip. And I kind of think she would be mad at me for doing so (If she found out). WIBTA for accepting an invite in her place?\n\nPS: Turning this into a group trip with the four of us mentioned in the beginning is unfortunately out of the question.\nP.P.S: This is a throwaway and all names are fake because Iâm paranoid lol.

      "description": "Backstory is needed. Donât take the title at face value. Itâs also worth noting everyone in this scenario are college students, i.e., not particularly wealthy. \n\nTwo days ago, an acquaintance of mine was asking around for donations for a charity drive heâs participating in. Very actively asking around. Heâd send Venmo requests immediately to anyone he spoke with, eventually running out of Venmo requests (I didnât even know there was a limit on daily requests!) and just trying to convince people through word to donate. \n\nHe gets to me, inevitably, while Iâm doing some reading for a class, and goes through his whole donation routine. I tell him I donât have any cash on me right now. He tells me to just Venmo him. I tell him Iâll bring some money tomorrow to donate, because I have some spare cash and change at home Iâd much rather donate, since itâs been sitting on my dresser without use for a few months. Heâs not at all happy with this answer, and pushes me a while longer to Venmo him, but eventually leaves me alone. \n\nSo that night I go home, collect every spare dollar bill and quarter I have (eventually amounting to a decent donation sum) and stick it in a Ziploc bag so I can just hand it to him the next day without much hassle. \n\nThe next day comes around. Iâm back sitting in the same spot, doing reading again. He sits down about 10 feet away and starts eating lunch. I remember that I promised Iâd donate to him, and that this might be the only time I see him that day, so I get the Ziploc out of my bag and get his attention. I pantomime throwing the bag for him to catch, and throw it towards him. Poorly. It ends up landing on the ground next to his table, because surprise surprise, throwing things in Ziploc bags isnât particularly easy. \n\nHe wasnât happy about this. Not one bit. He immediately goes off: âSeriously dude? Did you just do that? Do you seriously not realize how disrespectful that is?â. This goes on for some time, and Iâve got a shit-eating grin on my face because I was certain he was joking. What was wrong with that? I was genuinely confused in the moment until it hit me he was totally serious. After his rant, he storms off for a good half hour to some undisclosed location, leaving all of his belongings and food just sitting at the table. \n\nI can understand that there exists a small number of situations that this would be totally disrespectful. If I didnât know him whatsoever and threw money at him out of anger, yeah, that would be disrespectful. If he was begging on the street corner and I cared so little about him that I tossed money on the ground in front of him, that would be disrespectful. But no, this is a guy Iâve known for three years. Someone that less than a month ago, I was sandwiched next to trying to fit three people in the back of a car, and so we watched football on his phone during the drive. Weâre certainly not best buds, but weâre casual with each other. And if he thinks itâs appropriate for him to bother me while Iâm trying to read for a donation, Iâd think itâs appropriate for me to try to toss him my donation when he didnât seemingly want to come by me to grab it himself. \n\nNormally, I would do my best to talk to him and explain the situation, make him understand what I did wasnât trying to insult him, but heâs been so unwilling to even look at me that I donât think this is a bridge I need to bother to rebuild. \n\nSo, and I the asshole for tossing him my donation? And am I the asshole for not caring enough to apologize?",

He greets me at the door when I get home from work every day, he is always down for a cuddle and he doesnât seem to know that his claws and teeth could be used for violence against humans. Seriously, you could pick him up and toss him around and heâd just meow at you. Not that I would ever do that. Heâs my precious Pidgey.\n\n\nBut, in other news, fuck Pidgey. Because as much as I really do love him, he sucks. I understand that cats can develop territories, and lately Pidgey has adopted the upstairs bathroom and hallway. However, this seems to apply only between the hours of 5- 7AM.\n\n\nEvery weekday morning itâs the same: my alarm goes off and I sneak out of my lovely warm bed. Already, Pidgey is on the other side of the door meowing like itâs his job to wake me up or Iâll sleep forever. And no, before you even suggest it, heâs not hungry. The first thing I do is go downstairs and feed him; he ignores the food completely and runs right back upstairs to bother me in the bathroom.\n\n\nYou know those tear-jerking videos of dogs greeting their owners after long absences? Itâs like that, every morning, only itâs 5:30 AM and Iâm fucking tired and trying to get ready. I cannot deal with him every single morning. He puts out his paw in this cute little pantomime of âpet me pet me!â and I just do not have it in me. Donât get me wrong, I pet the shit out of the little bastard, but itâs never enough. I get in the shower, he sticks his head through the curtain and meows at me. I get out, soaking wet, and he covers my wet legs in cat hair before I can dry off. I brush my teeth and he jumps up on the sink and bumps my hand. Cat hair everywhere, and no amount of petting settles him down.\n\n\nThe rest of the day, heâs a normal chill cat. Heâs upstairs right now, being chill. If I go up there, heâll come over and say hi, but whereâs all the intensity? Right now Iâm sitting downstairs on the couch with a perfectly good open lap and two hands that could be used for petting (if I werenât currently shit-talking him online), but no. It has to be the only time of day when Iâm on a time constraint and otherwise unable to give him the attention he demands.\n\n\nI could shut the bathroom door, of course. But such a good boy deserves my love, doesnât he? Heâs a good boy. Every time I growl âenough!â and rudely toss him off the kitchen sink, I feel like an asshole. He seems to have gotten it into his head that this is the only time of day he can receive love, and he goes after it with the intensity of a drowning man. It seems so sad to deny him. Should I just accept the fact that this is his love language and set my alarm earlier to make time for Pidgey? Or is he a fucking asshole who needs to fucking chill?",

      "description": "I'm a junior. There's a freshman, let's call him Mason, who is unpopular and bullied. As a freshman, I was pretty unpopular as a freshman, although not bullied, just a loner. But sophomore year, I became popular. Mason's parents and my parents are friends, and Saturday they came over for dinner. Mason asked to talk to me, I told him to come to my room. He told me he really wants to be popular, and asked if, since we're family friends, I could invite him to stuff and all that. I thought about it for a moment, and mulling it over, it's a resounding fuck no. Why? It's a lose-lose for Mason, me, and my friend group.\n\nFor Mason: Think of it this way. Everybody hates him because 1) I hate to say it, but he's unpopular for a reason and 2) he's a freshman. So what happens if I suddenly start inviting him to shit? My friends will see him as trying to force himself into our group, and hate him even more. \n\nFor my friends: As I've said, nobody likes him. He's kinda weird, never stops talking about the weirdest shit, etc. So they'll be forced to hang out with someone they hate.\n\nFor me: My friends will resent me for forcing Mason onto them.\n\nSo I told him no, and explained my rationale (I wasn't as blunt as I was here). He got upset about this, and repeated he really wanted to be popular. \n\nSo I told him, if you want to be popular, you have to earn it. He seemed confused, so I asked him why he thinks he deserves popularity. He asked what I meant. The conversation from there went like this:\n\nMe: You can't force people to be your friend. And that's exactly what you're doing. You're trying to force people into being friends with you, but they won't be your friend unless they want to.\n\nMason: So you're saying I'll never be popular?\n\nMe: No, I'm saying if you want to be popular, you have to work for it. People aren't going to like you just because you want them to. You have to become worthy of their friendship and respect.\n\nMason: So how then?\n\nMe: Stop whining, start lifting weights, join some clubs, pick up a sport. Take a good long look at yourself in the mirror. Be brutal with yourself. Get a new haircut, a skincare routine, whatever. Learn some social skills. Then come back to me, and I might invite you somewhere. \n\nHe got upset at this and left, and apparently he told his parents. His parents told my parents, my parents thought I was perfectly reasonable, his parents thought I was being an asshole. I think I was being reasonable here. He's trying to force his way into popularity. That's the wrong way to do it. I know that because I've tried it. It'll only cause people to hate him more. He can't force people to love him no matter how much he tries. So the only option is, improve himself. Then maybe people might like him. But he and his parents disagree. \n\nSo, aita?",

      "description": "Hello Reddit, I need some advice.\n\nSo my roommate and I get along just fine besides sometimes she's a little bit messy and I will ask her to clean up every once in a while, no big deal.\n\nHowever, we've had this issue only one time before where I go to bed late and accidentally wake her up. (Obviously, this is NOT intentional!). She's an art major so she really doesn't have much homework but there has been times where she has come in late from working in the art studio (around 5am) and woken me up. This has only happened a few times, but I didn't mind and didn't say anything to her. However, when I'm napping she will often blast the TV as loudly as possible (she has a lot of free time, so she's here watching TV often and I respect it as one of her hobbies). But I always just try to cover my ears with my pillow and sleep, again, no big deal.\n\nSo I've only woken her up once before that I know of. The other time this happened I just ran into the room for one second to grab some clothes since I was sleeping at a friend's house. She blew up, just like this time.\n\nLast night I was up studying late, but I needed to take a shower before bed so I got my clothes from the drawers. My drawers are well organized and I'm able to get what I need quickly. So, I just grab my towel and PJs and head for the bathroom, then by 4:30 ish I'm finally in bed. It really didn't take long for me to get my stuff at all. Definitely less than a minute I would even argue that I was only in there for 30 seconds. Anyways, she had a problem with it. \n\nSo with this being the second time this has happened to me, I decided maybe we need to think of a common ground or solution.\n\nHere's the screenshots of our conversation:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/RQE9PUC\n\nAITA here? I genuinely cannot tell and don't know where to go from here. I can't think of any other options and of course I feel bad that I woke her up but she's making it so hard to have any sympathy. \n*All of the what's and the question marks are where she seeimingly becomes a different person or takes a different side of the conversation, I was genuinely confused",

      "description": "First off I'm not implying that my dad is being an asshole for commenting on my instagram. He's  definitely not, and he's just supporting me.\n\nHere's the thing though, it was supposed to be an account only for art without anyone that I actually know following and without revealing my identity because I like to keep myself out of the attention and only show my art. Anyway my dad followed me anyway and the thing is that he's the only person who comments on my posts so it's kind of an awkward feeling to think of people thinking \"aww she doesn't have any friends, only her dad comments on her posts\" (which I don't have any friends but hey)\n\nIf I actually had other people commenting on my posts I wouldn't feel this way about him commenting it's just that he's the ONLY person. I feel like I'm probably too old to feel this way and I'm being immature. \n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting my dad to comment on my posts?",

      "description": "TL;DR: I slept with an ex, found out that a month after the event she got engaged to her (long term) boyfriend, was guilted into telling her fiancÃ©, receiving verbal abuse from multiple sources. AITA?\n\nFull Story: many years ago I broke up with my ex because she cheated on me. Over the years, we've met up a few times for some casual fun, the latest being a couple of months ago. I knew that every time we met up, she had been with the same guy, but she always claimed that they were \"broken up\". She would then disappear for a couple of months, when they would \"get back together\", and come back when they were \"broken up\". A month after our last encounter, she got engaged.\n\nAbout a week after that, a friend mentioned that their cousin got engaged, and showed me photos. The photo was of her cousin, the fiancÃ©, with my ex. I was shocked, and confided to my friend that I had slept with her cousins fiance a month before. She told me that I needed to tell her cousin, and that it would be wrong for me to do nothing.\n\nSo, with that, I got his number, messaged him the story, showed him proof (screenshots of text message conversations). He ended things with her, as apparently they had never broken up (I guess I knew but never wanted to admit it), and now her, all her family, and most of his family, now blame me for breaking up their engagement. It's now making things awkward between my friend and I, as her family now hates me. AITA?",

Itâs her ultimate decision in my opinion. Her dad feeds her fish sometimes but he mainly eats vegan. He grew up eating meat but took on this annoying kombucha drinking lifestyle a couple of years ago and is anti-meat.. well land animal. \n\nAnyways, today he picked her up from daycare and told me she told him that I gave her chicken. He said that she was so sad to find out that I gave her chicken and he feels like I violated her trust. Sheâs three. She is fully aware of what sheâs eating and I donât sneak it to her. He told me that sheâs an animal lover and is devastated. Really? What the hell. \n\nI just want to know genuinely, if Iâm the asshole here because I donât think itâs that big of a deal. ",

When I checked the packet after coming home, it had spilled all over so I went to return it. I showed it to a girl sitting at the front desk. i also had the money for the replacement and had decided to pay after getting the other pack as it is a small business. She called her senior and in the meantime, handed me a replacement pack. the senior examined my pack and accused me of using half of the glue and intentionally spilling the other half for a replacement. I tried to explain to him that it was not the case but he refused to listen. At this point, I lost my cool and walked away saying that I will ever visit them again. now i feel bad for acting that way for such a small amount of money. AITA for doing this",

      "description": "Me (14M) and my girlfriend (14F and now my ex) broke up because we didn't have any romantic feelings towards one another and got into a relationship because our friends said we had the same interests, and that we were made for each other (I guess not after what happened). She said she wanted to be a friend of mine and still talk to me as friends. \n\nOur relationship was going for 2 months and I wasn't really interested or invested in it anyway, and one day, she said she wants to break up and I said that I was fine with it. She said that I have to help her get through the breakup heat, to which I agreed to. A few days later, our friends (who told us we'd be great together) started asking why we broke up and stuff like that. I didn't say anything at the time, and neither supported her version at the time because I wasn't invested or interested in this, plus this was going on while our mid term exams so I needed to concentrate. \n\nDuring the same time, I got to know (not through her) that she was in a relationship with me just to make her ex jealous. I didn't care, but when this got to our friend circle, everyone got mad at her, and my friends started to think that I was interested in her, but she wasn't so, according to them, she betrayed my trust. I didn't say anything again, and one of her best friends (friends since childhood) was my good friend too. And there was now already a gap between them due to the whole breakup thing. I still didn't care. But according to my ex (whom I was still talking to) said that the situation could've been different if I said things in support of the breakup's reason. But I said nothing. I feel kinda guilty about it, and wanna know reddit's opinion on this if I'm the wrong one here. ",

We donât necessarily always do it, sometimes we do corned beef and cabbage instead (or nothing), but we often do if the weather is okay.\n\nMy sister started dating a new guy a few months ago, call him Bill. Heâs allergic to shellfish, which I think we knew, but it hadnât come up before. We planned the crawfish boil, and then day of, preparation already started, my sister asks what the menu is. My mom tells her weâre doing the crawfish boil thing. She goes âwhatâs bill going to eat?â Record scratch as we all realize.\n\nWe panicked and debated alternate food options for him, but then he said he wouldnât be able to come if shellfish was served. We went ahead with the original plans (as food had already been bought.)\n\nHis family was in town, so he and my sister went to their place for dinner. She and Bill joined us the next day for a more casual dinner.\n\nTurns out, he was super pissed and offended that we didnât change the menu.

      "description": "Back story, wife is friends with a âbullishâ woman whom I have repeatedly asked to stop being âtom boyishâ or physical with me, basically invading my âbubbleâ.  Nothing really sexual about it, just makes me uncomfortable and I feel it disrespects my wife, as if a male was to act like that around her and me, it would irk me to no end.  My wife thinks its funny.\n\nThis woman has a 13 year old daughter who I would say on the younger side mentally, but more mature physically, and i would say she has some of her mothers traits.  \n\nShe stayed with us, as she has previously, both have.\n\nThe incident in question was minor, I was leaving a room with food in my hand then out of nowhere a suprise punch happened in the middle of my back, it didnt hurt, but it was hard I guess for a 13 yr old, i was certainly caught off guard and shocked ( im a jumpy guy ). At this point i faced the girl and said in a stern voice, âim serious, do not punch me againâ at which point she punched my shoulder, again not hard, but enough to be seen as a ânot listening challangeâ, i then asked her to stop again and stated something along the lines about i am serious again, at which point again she punched out.  I believe it was either in response to that or another attempt is when i took hold of her wrist.\n\nI want to emphasize i was not gripping her, nor making her arm move in any abnormal  way, it was a relaxed hold.  i am at least 3 times her weight and probably 18â taller, if i wanted to âphysically restrainâ her beyond stoppinn her being able to throw punches i could of.\n\nNo marks, no cries out, she was giggling like it was a challange.\n\nSo why AITA question? Because my wife took it upon herself to chastize me about placing my hands on someone elses kid, how it was innapropriate and how I should apologize to the girl.  Maybe all valid points but she did this in front of the girl, to the point of when I tried to explain myself and what i was doing what i was doing, the girl said âmaybe you should stop speaking nowâ, but my wife thinks I am completely in the wrong and I feel she has belittled and demasculated me.\n\nI freely admit i have a dry sense of humor and there is joking verbally all round in certain situations.\n\nTl/dr - wifes friend daughter who stays with us from time to time, suprised punched me in the back, when i tried to adult to get her to stop, she continued, I held her wrist in a manner that just prevented myself being punched ?

      "description": "Ok, so here's the thing. My brother wanted me to buy something for him as I have Amazon Prime and he doesn't (he wanted it shipped faster). I bought it. I already owe him a decent amount of money for a shared phone bill, and he's been kind enough to let it go on, although recently he's been more on me about it. After I bought it, he asked me if I would want the price of what I bought to be taken off what I owe him (it was less than what I owe him) or if I wanted him to repay me for it. I said I wanted him to repay me for it. He asked me if he wanted him to Venmo me it, and I said I'd rather our parents (who are the primary account holders on our bank accounts we've had since we were younger) just transfer the money. He said he was ok with that as long as I was the one to ask our parents to transfer the money. I agreed to that. I just recently asked them and they refused to transfer it, because it's \"not right\" to ask for money from someone you owe money to. While I agree with that to an extent, my brother and I already had an agreement on it. When I told them as such they still refused to transfer the money.",

      "description": "Hey all,\n\nMy girlfriend [25F] and I[24M] had a small argument about this situation. We resolved it, we just wanted to hear some other people's takes on it. Also, the girl in question turned out to be gay anyways, but neither of us knew that at the time of the argument. Ok, here's the story:\n\nGirl in question (let's call her Wanda) is close friends with some of my really close friends, and we've hung out several times in group settings. I get along well with Wanda, we've talked about cooking together (we both love to cook), and she's met my GF once before. We texted several times about getting together to cook for some friends, all innocent stuff. Then, she sent me a text saying that she was going out with some friends and \"It'd make me happy if you came :)\". I perceived this to be a little flirtatious, and told my GF about it. I didn't think it was a big deal, and I told my GF that if Wanda still wanted to hang out or cook together, I'd be fine with that.\n\nMy GF's take on the situation was that A) Wanda was being disrespectful to GF and our relationship by hitting on me after meeting GF, B) It would be a dumb idea to put myself in a situation where someone who had already made advances towards me could do it again.\n\nMy take is that A) Wanda didn't actually cross any boundaries (of mine at least), and as long as she continued not to, I didn't see a problem with being around her, B) I have enough self restraint to keep it in my pants around someone who's hitting on me.\n\nIt's worth noting that Wanda's invitation to go out with her (which I declined) occurred a month prior to the argument, and I hadn't spoken to her since. In addition, she's not from the US, so maybe in her home culture, that's just how friends speak to each other.\n\nLike I said, this was a one-night argument and after more discussion and some time to cool off, we basically realized we were approaching the issue from two different sides which is why we couldn't come to an agreement at first. And, I found out later from a friend that Wanda was gay anyways so it's a moot point. \n\nSo, all said, AITA for saying I'd still hang out with her after she said something I perceived to be flirtatious?\n",

      "description": "So my best friend is getting married, her sister and my sister are best friends also, so its the 4 of us. We've been bf's for years, we aren't really close with other girls, so its always been just us.  \n\nHer now-fiance asked my sister and I to help set up the proposal and of course we were ecstatic to help out, shes the younger sister same as me, so it was such exciting news and the whole day turned out amazing. We were the only friends there, the rest were family, so of course we're like family to each other. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe, my sister and the bride-to-be's sister had all thought of the idea to have a surprise hens and go to Bali. We would split the cost 3 ways and make it our last holiday together, a last harrah before she leaves us for married life. We knew everything would add up in terms of money wise, but it was for our best friend, a once in a lifetime occasion, money isn't an issue. We had our eyes on the lingerie we were going to get her, the kitchen tea presents, engagement and of course the wedding present. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe four of us went our for dinner just recently, and the bride-to-be says she has to tell us something really sad. We had no idea what was coming...\"I'm not having a bridal party\". She said of course she would of had myself and my sister but they cant afford to have a bridal party, her sister is going to be Maid of Honour and thats all. I dont know if its just me, but the bridal party is the funnest part pre-reception right? The sleepovers before the big day, everyone getting their makeup and hair done, the limo ride, the photos, the endless supply of liquor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sister and I were absolutely shattered and has now got us thinking, why should we be spending so much of our money if she isnt willing to splurge a little for a us? Not even, we said dont worry we'll pay for ourselves! Its your big day, its us, we want to be apart of it!! She said she wouldnt want that, even if we were happy to do it, because her fiance wouldn't ask that of his friends. The part that really got me though, was her saying she \"still wants us to be apart of it all\" to me this sounds like use and abuse? We can throw a bridal shower, a kitchen tea, the best hens night, but why should we go above and beyond now? Obviously I know I can't compare wedding costs to a few \"gifts\" but whats a bridesmaid? a dress? hair? makeup? Like I said, I was more than happy to pay for all of that just to be able to share this day with her, rather than sit on the sidelines with everyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I an asshole? Is it selfish of me to think of it that way considering its her wedding and big day? Or do my sister and I have reason to be hurt and angry and not want to put in our all anymore? ",

We have a large family, he had 3 children from previous relationships, the youngest two are still living with their mom and going to school. They donât live with him, so they only see him on vacations. I figured itâs good to let them have some alone time, and they have a pool to keep them happy! \n\nWell, everyone has been telling me that today was the big day, a bunch of extended family are coming over to stay the night at the house for the first time. My mom isnât in town yet, but I had been going back and forth to their house and mine for the past few days to see the younger kids. \n\nWell, one of his nephews ended up canceling, and his oldest daughter, her boyfriend, and their baby girl got in last night. He calls my mom, tells her I stood him up three times this week. Which isnât the case, I came every day I was supposed to and stayed a couple hours, and then went back to my place. \n\nMy mom calls me and is upset that I âstood him upâ and this to them means I didnât spend every moment there. Sure I couldâve stayed the night and had my roommate watch my dog for a few days, but it felt right to head back to my home to go to sleep since the other rooms were going to be occupied with guest tonight. \n\nAITA for not spending the entire time with my family when they come for vacation? \n\nTL;DR Step dad is at his house with his kids for spring break an hour away from my home, I donât spend the entire spring break there, and am being told I am standing them up.

      "description": "Buckle up, y'all, there's a lot of shit to unpack here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this all started when I came home for winter break from college to find that my dad's girlfriend, who I've only known about six months, and her 6 and 9 year old kids had moved in. No one told me this information beforehand, so it was a surprise to find mine and my sister's belongings in bags and her kids living in our rooms. My dad turned the office into a bedroom for me and the guest room a bedroom for my sister, but it was still a huge shock to come home to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been having a really hard time with all of this. I don't know his girlfriend very well and her kids make the house feel constantly chaotic. They've been trying to plan a lot of outings for her and her kids and my family (I also have a 10 year old brother and an 18 year old sister), and every single time it ends with someone upset or a fight between two people. Our families haven't been meshing well at all. On top of all of this, my dad has been extremely distant. I've tried to voice my feelings and he just won't listen. We haven't had a real conversation since I got home, even though I've tried time and time again. I even had to come home to find that my pony and my goat had both died and he just didn't think to tell me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally today I lost it and went off at him when he told me he was fed up with my attitude since I came home. I started listing things like no one telling me she moved in, him being distant and not actually talking to me, constant chaos and stress in the house. I also mentioned that it felt way too forced when we all went out and I'm not interested in doing things the seven of us until I feel comfortable and ready, which he didn't like at all. I ended the fight by saying \"if I had a car I wouldn't be here right now\" and to that he just walked away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI kind of feel like an asshole because this is my dad's life and I should have respect for it, but on the other hand, I don't understand how someone I talk on the phone with everyday could make so many big decisions and completely leave me out of them. I've felt awkward in my own home for two weeks now, everyone is stressed all the time and it's starting to affect my (very fragile) mental state. No amount of voicing my feelings has come to any actual meaningful discussion. I'm supposed to be here until January 5th and I don't know if I'm going to make it. I'm genuinely not ready to welcome these three new people into my life. I will be one day, but right now this has all been too quick and it has affected me very badly. Am I a selfish asshole, or am I justified in my feelings? ",

      "description": "This issue came up again this Christmas and Iâm really wondering about it. I still feel  a bit guilty. Basically I am a young adult. I wasnât very close with my dad growing up and after he divorced my mom he moved away quite far and we didnât have much contact. He sort of tried to stay in my life but I saw him at most once a year, for a few hours.  Fast forward to now, we have a working relationship and we talk every few weeks. I still see him about once a year. Last year I asked what he wanted for Christmas and he told me he wanted wool socks. I looked at several different outlet stores that were in my area and somehow couldnât find wool socks. I found a wool blend finally at one store and purchased these. \n\nMy dad thanked me at Christmas, but later informed me that they werenât the right kind. I of course felt terrible but he brushed it off and said not to worry about it. This year he brought up the whole thing again. I promised Iâd try my best to get the right thing. \n\nMy question is, am I the asshole for asking someone what they wanted, and then not getting that thing? I suppose I couldâve gone online and ordered some specific wool socks, and clearly it upset my dad. ",

      "description": "For context: A dumbass person in my school decided to create a insta page called âconfessionsâ. Basically, itâs anonymous and anyone can say whatever they want. Then, I donât know what the fuck happened but someone started to frame my best friend for âsomethingâ (I didnât get anything from the explanation someone else gave me) by using an emoji thatâs infamous to her. Earlier on, my other best mate told her (my best girlfriend) that sheâs overreacting to this and that she needs to calm down. Then, I find the page, and thatâs where trouble begins.\n\nIâm of a joking nature, I like to take on problems by laughing at them, or making other people laugh. I canât help it, itâs who I am. I also like to shitpost a lot. So as soon as I found the page, I started shitposting and saying stuff along the lines of \nâI want to suck (guy) fucking chin itâs so hotâ\nâGay whoever reads thisâ\nâPenisâ\nYou know, typical shit.\n\nItâs worth mentioning that I knew my friend was not feeling so good. I know, itâs sorta selfish, but in my defense I DID try to help her, I offered her to talk, to get through it. She responded with #Ok. I thought it was a âwhatevs, typical weekend dramaâ, so I continued to shitpost and troll in the comments.\n\nThen, someone said âi think (my best friend) is a pet to (other girl friend I have)â \n(In my country pet is âmascotaâ and whoever knows spanish knows that itâs a way to say you suck this persons dick for clout)\nIt is worth noting that in my country thereâs this stupidly famous youtuber whoâs catchphrase is âclaro pes mascotaâ, which roughly translates to âofc my subordinate/slaveâ. He says it as a joke, and I did too. I tagged my best friend with âclaro pes mascotaâ.\n\nI know, I know. Reaaaally stupid, but I didnât think it twice. Next thing I know, my best friend is talking shit on me on our chat with stuff like\nâI hate you how could you say thatâ\nâI hate how you take everything for a jokeâ\nâHow did you find that funny you cuntâ\nâFuck you this page is tagging me in every single  post and you come and say thatâ\nâI would appreciate if you please supported me or just shut the fuck up if you donât care.â\nI apologize, saying thanks for being direct, and I donât know how to help with what she replies wit\nâThen just shut the fuck up.â\n\nI sorta feel like an asshole, but some part of me tells me it wasnât that bad.

      "description": "First post here, so I'm sorry in advance if I've broken any rules. I am also sorry if the formatting is bad, since I'm on mobile and if I make any spelling or grammatical errors (English isn't my first language).\n\nOkay as the title might suggest I was recently invited to the wedding of my dads girlfriends niece. I know it's far out, but I've always been seen as a part of their family. The invitation said that I was invited to be a part of the ceremony at the city hall and then to a reception where food and coffee would be served. You know just a small thing for family.\n\nToday was the day of the wedding. I was excited since I've never been to a wedding before and got up bright and early to get ready. The dress code was fancy and I wore my prettiest dress and my favourite shoes (this is an important fact).\n\nThe ceremony goes great and it was really beautiful, but the reception would start 3 hours after the ceremony ended. That is absolutely fine and I expected to help with getting the room ready and helping with food when it arrived. What I did not expect was my dads girlfriend asking me to go home to the bride and grooms apartment to clean up after the bride getting ready. I said okay even though I had never been to their place before and don't know where anything is. \n\nAfter I had cleaned their apartment at my dad picked me up and drove me to the place of the reception, about an hour before the guests arrived. I walked into the rooms and saw tables, chairs and most importantly: cutlery and place cards on the table. That's when I realized it was not just a reception, but an actual wedding party. It's fine, no  worries. I'll eat some good food and go home afterwards to do some studying before the semester starts on Monday. \n\nThat's when the food arrived. Nothing was ready. Many things still needed to go into an oven and none of the roasts where cut. I go down to the kitchen which is on the floor below the party and help with cutting meats, bread and plating up the starter. The food is meant to be a buffet, so I start carrying all the food upstairs. That's when the other people helping went up the party and took their seats. As I passed my dads girlfriend she asked if I would quickly take a look at the kitchen before going with them. \nIt was a mess. Nothing had been washed or cleaned while I had been carrying the food upstairs. It took me 40 minutes to get it cleaned and when I went upstairs the others had eaten, so I quickly ate a plate of food before collecting the plates and cutlery and going down to help with cleaning.\n\nThat's when the speeches happened. My dad and his girlfriend really wanted to hear them, so they left me with the washing up and repackaging of the leftovers. I started making coffee as well, since I knew there was going to be dessert. The coffee machine decided to malfunction and sprayed coffee and coffee grounds all over the place and me in my fancy dress. \n\nWhen I was done cleaning that mess as well, I went upstairs to have some dessert with the others. My legs were aching from the many trips up and down the stairs and my back hurt from all the standing. \n\nI said to my dad and his girlfriend that I was going home and she just looked at me like I have three heads. She said: \"And why exactly do you think, that that's an okay thing to do?\" \nI told her I was tired and hadn't expected to help so much, that my dress and shoes  were ruined and that I have loads of reading to do before the semester starts.\n\nSo Reddit, my question is: am I the asshole for going home early from the wedding after helping out instead of enjoying myself with the other guests? \n\n",

      "description": "I was just at the gym working out and minding my own business. I noticed this guy on a machine next to me but I didnât think much of it. As I was leaving and walking through the parking lot, a car with tinted windows rolled one down and it was the guy from inside the gym. He asked me my name and if I had a boyfriend, to which I responded yes. He asked if we could be friends and if he could have my number. Mind you, I am completely uninterested. But Iâm also a small girl and with todayâs weirdos I get paranoid about creepy predators. So these 3 thoughts go through my head: \n1. Do I say no right here and make it awkward?\n2. Do I give him a fake number and risk running into him at the gym later and him being pissed?\n3. Do I give him the correct number, and politely tell him that Iâm not interested in being friends. \n\nI felt pressured so I opted with with third choice. He texted me within minutes and called me twice, to which I responded âIâm sorry I do not feel comfortable being your friend. Have a good dayâ. I really donât think his intentions were bad, but I just didnât want to have to deal with the awkwardness face to face or risk him getting pissed and abducting me (Iâve been watching too much Ted Bundy documentaries). \n\nI told my boyfriend immediately and he got extremely angry that I would give my number out to a random guy and thinks what I did was so wrong and hurtful and fails to see my side of it. I need honest feedback because I cannot read between the lines on this one. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I hate getting receipts when I donât need them. Iâd rather not waste the paper just to have it end up being more trash in my car door. Usually Iâll decline them if the cashier asks me, otherwise I ball them up and throw them away.\n\nI went to Walmart with my girlfriend to get groceries. We only needed a couple of things, so we had one bag and a gallon of milk. We checked out with a cashier, (near the door,) and they hand me the receipt. I take it, tell them to have a good day and go on my way. I instantly ball it up and put it in my pocket so I can throw it away in the trash immediately outside.\n\nI frequently get stopped by the door greeter when Iâm leaving at this Walmart and it always annoys me. I donât think I even look or dress shady. But this time, the greeter saw me come out of the lane with an actual clerk. She watched my girlfriend and I walk towards the door and steps in front of us before we make it to the door. She asks for the receipt and I look at our basic groceries and say âreally?â She says  they just have to check sometimes. She holds out her hand and smiles and I roll my eyes because I know she wouldnât randomly stop others, and I drop the balled up receipt in her hand. Sheâs kind of shocked but starts to open it. I wait until itâs open and start to walk out. I didnât even give her enough time to read it. She says âwait, do you want your receipt?â and pushes the receipt towards us and I pull away and say ânah, you can keep it.â\n\nShe ended up pushing it in my gfs hand only for us to throw it in the trash outside. I know she couldnât have done anything with it besides throw it away in the trash can beside her set-up, but being stopped irked me. My gf says I should include that the lady was in her 60-70s. But does age really matter? Idk, but AITA?",

      "description": "My (25 M) ex-girlfriend (31 F) and I were living together for about 4 months and were pretty serious. She has always had a drinking problem and I've tried to help her with it but she had been through some pretty traumatic stuff so I never expected her to curb her problem overnight. She seemed like she genuinely wanted to get better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways the trouble started when I picked her up from work one night (she works at a restaurant and doesn't drive) and on the way home she tells me her boss had asked her to come into the men's bathroom, cornered her, and made out with her. Something about the way she told me made me think it was consensual, and I know she had cheated on men in the past. I didn't say anything, and tried to go into another room so I could think. She literally throws a fit, busts open the door to the room I'm in, starts slapping, punching, kicking, screaming at me. We sleep in different rooms that night, and after I seriously considered leaving her the next day, we talked and agreed to try to continue our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week or so later, her parents invited us over to spend the weekend at their house. She has a wonderful mother and she and I had talked several times about ex's alcoholism, we were both trying to help her. We have dinner and I decided to go to sleep early because we had plans for the morning. Now it's 2 am and my girlfriend hasn't come to bed, so I got up and found her on her mother's back porch, wasted on vodka, cuddled up on the neighbor's lap. I'm obviously upset but hold my temper because I don't want to start a conflict at this hour at her parent's house. I figured we'd talk in the morning. I carry her to bed (she's too drunk to walk) and tuck her in but I push her off when she tries to cuddle with me. She just says \"Well then leave. Leave!\"... So I left. I drove home in the middle of the night, packed my bags and went to stay with family until I could find a place on my own. I didn't want to put myself in a situation where I was dealing with another violent fit. I felt pretty betrayed but after meeting her in a public place a few days later I decided there was no way I could continue this relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur house we shared was rented, and even though she made decent money she only contributed about a third of the rent. I paid the other two-thirds plus all the utilities, power, internet, etc. After our breakup, I'd agreed to contribute to half of last month's rent even though I wasn't living there anymore. I was respectful but I made it absolutely clear to her that I would no longer be paying the bills for the house. She found roommates and had plenty of time to put the utilities in her own name, I told her what she needed to do. But every time we talked she just tells me she's so sorry, begging for me to come back, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually I had enough and called the power company. I paid the final bill and had them close the account. She hasn't contacted me since then, I'm assuming she had to spend at least a night with no power. The nights are still warm where we live but I've felt bad about leaving her without electricity. Am I the asshole here?",

My mom said that I could use her card to fill up but it wouldn't work so I had to use my own credit card to fill up. As I was finishing up a man came up to me and said can I sell you this? He was offering an obd scan tool and said it was valued at $120 but he would give it to me for $10. I said no thank you and he asked a couple more times while telling me about how he needed to take his girlfriend home and that he needed the gas. After saying sorry he left, my sister told me that I should have paid for his gas. I didn't think to do this at the time. So AITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for kicking my friend from my D&amp;D group?",
      "description": " \n\nAlright so this is a D&amp;D game that myself and five of my friends sit down to play online.\n\nAlright so awhile back my group had kicked another player out for rude behavior. The group decided we still wanted five players so my best friend (Will now be referred to as BF) and I were in another game on another day of the week and we wanted to invite our GM (Will now be referred to as GMF) who we liked. GMF accepted. About a week later when I'm offline BF and GMF are hanging out online in our Discord server with two other players. Now I only have second hand accounts of what happened so I'm doing the best I can with what info I have. This is the rise of the first issue They were hanging out when BF said he was playing a game and GMF said that was gay. One of my other players who is actually LGBT (They will be called P1 for player one.) and called them out for saying using gay in a derogatory way. BF tried to keep the issue from escalating, but GMF pretty much responded with, \"Get over it.\" The issue was taken up with me and I decided to wait and watch to see if he would do it again, he never did.\n\nCut to about a month later where we're discussing doing a one shot based around a kids show and GMF and BF both made jokes about the source material that literally everyone has made but P1 decides to take it personally and starts a moral crusade against both of them. I get pissed about this and try to point out that this is literally just a joke. He gets mad and tells me about how it shaped P1's childhood in DMs. This is an issue he brought up but used it to say that GMF wasn't fitting in with the group. For the next two months we have no issues except for one where GMF is talking over other players and I message him to see if he could not do so. He agreed and kept to his word for the rest of the campaign of letting others speak before he did. He took it to that extreme, I did not ask him to take it there but he did.\n\nCut to another month later and I receive a message from P1 that another player is having issues and says that they would not be able to confront GMF if asked to. The other player does. Their reasoning that they feel uncomfortable with GMF playing with them. The second player asks me to talk to a third player, and that third player states that they are neutral but doesn't see GMF as trying to be a member of the group.\n\nSo I decide that in order to preserve the group I have to get rid of GMF because as the GM of the group I have to remain impartial and everyone here is a friend. BF is upset by this, I am pissed about this but I felt powerless in this situation since I knew I wouldn't be able to resolve the issues.\n\nTL;DR: My friends got in a fight on the internet and I'm the one that has to deal with the fallout. I had to kick out a friend because of a joke he made 3 months ago. I took my own feelings out of the equation when making the decision but I feel like an asshole so I wanted to confirm if this was the case or not.",

      "description": "My husband I planned to take our friend out for his 21st birthday. I was really looking forward to it even though I don't drink I still like to hang out with our friends. \n\nAfter plans had been made mt husband invited another person that we are pretty good friends with. No problem, itll still be fun and I know him well enough he doesnt make me nervous. Then another person that I've met maybe once got invited. I started to feel uncomfortable becuase I'm pretty shy and nervous around new people and it gets amplified 10x when I'm driving. Driving at night even when I'm by myself makes me really nervous becuase it's super hard to see especially with all the lights in the city. I was still looking forward to tonight even though I was pretty nervous about it.\n\nAbout half an hour ago my husband was talking to me about plans for tonight and mentioned 2 more people I've never met and didnt know were coming. At this point I told my husband I wasnt okay with that didnt feel comfortable driving that many people especially the ones I didnt know. He got mad and told me that tonight being fun was based around me agreeing to drive everyone back home but said he understood and agreed to be the DD himself. \n\nI thought that resolved it but he kept making comments about how he wont have fun and he'll be bored out of his mind following drunk idiots around all night. At that point I decided I didnt even want to go anymore because I was afraid hed go back on his agreement to DD or ask in front of everyone from me to DD and basically force me to agree. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?

      "description": "**Some background information:**\n\nI've been dating my boyfriend for 8 months now and we enjoy a relationship more on the private side. We attend parties and events together, have met each other's families, and our friends know we're together, but we don't do social media posts--just a preference for us.  In no way do we hide our relationship, but we are more private due to certain factors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're both in a professional program (in different years) where class sizes are small and as you can imagine, gossip runs rampant. Topics like \"Kate lost her virginity to Mike\" or \"Brad slept with Ashley\" are unfortunately common and it's easy to become the subject of gossip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast November, I attended a party with my boyfriend. It was mostly his cohort and the upper years, but one guy in my class--we'll call him Andrew--was there. I asked him how his term was going and all the formalities. He asked me if the guy I was with was my boyfriend and I said yes. I later found out he took a picture of my boyfriend and I without my knowledge and sent to his buddies on Snapchat. Whatever, it's not a secret but it irked me a little Two years ago, a different group of guys in my class took candid photos of me on a night out and spread it around, stating I was trying to get with everyone in the class.  \n\n\nLater on at another social, his friend Jacob comes up to and asks me who my boyfriend is. He says he knows he's in another year, but doesn't know his name or what he looks like. I answered very generally and he eventually stopped asking. Now, I tend to avoid the first guys other than normal interactions because they say awful things about people, especially girls (e.g. \"Look at the photo of Jade, she looks like such a s\\*\\*\\*, I bet she sleeps around a lot\"). I'd say I've talked to them a total of maybe 4 times this year? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So that brings us to today**. I visit my friend in a study room to ask a question about the upcoming exam. Andrew was there as we discussed a question, and right after asked me: \"So are you still dating your boyfriend?\" I answered, \"Yes\" and asked him what he meant by if I was still dating him. He says, \"I haven't heard anything recently so I didn't know if you were still together\" to which I reply, \"some of us don't like to share everything to everyone, but it doesn't mean we're not together.\" He asked me why I was so defensive, and I told him it isn't really his business to know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that I can be quite private about my relationship, but was I in the wrong to say that?",

      "description": "So my sister has gone through a lot of shit. Sheâs currently living on her own cause she got kicked out of our parents house . My sister has tendencies to ask hundreds and hundreds of favours from people which is understandable however it can be pretty draining at times. Some of these are not easy favours and sometimes youâre off doing quests for her (sheâs in some sketchy stuff). Anyhow one of the things she often does is will ask a favour and you have to be on her time, she asked me to come to downtown and do a bunch of things only to forget some paperwork, we agree to meet today and try again. She is on her way to do the same thing however forgets the paperwork again. (Keep in mind my sister does this stuff often. Where she will forget something and youâre forced to try again at a more convenient time for her) . \n\nNow this is the part where I ask if Iâm an asshole. \n\nMe: hey just being honest but I think this is something you really need to work on\n\nHer: stop nagging me alright I get it.  Stop kicking people when theyâre down. You think I was happy when I forgot the paperwork? \n\nMe: hey dude Iâm just trying to be honest Iâm not fighting you. You interpret this however you want but Iâm just being honest cause this is not the first and or second time youâve pulled this stuff \n\nWe get into an altercation and she begins telling me how Iâm such a nag and I donât see her point of view. She uses an example of getting a dog and if the dog ate rat poison sheâd be yelling at me but Iâm already mentally punishing myself. Basically allow people who feel guilty to just feel guilty \n\nBut ... yes I do understand and I wouldnât deliberately want to just egg it on. Iâm just tired of the strings of favours and how I have to plan according to her only to show up and sheâs forgot shit then having to try again another time ",

      "description": "I have a buddy at work who I text pretty often. She's one of the three people I talk to outside work, and she's the person I talk to most often. \n\nShe smokes a lot of weed, and she mostly smokes shells. For those who don't know, shells are very cheap cigars that you replace the tabaco with weed. You gotta be 19 to buy them and my buddy is 18. \n\nWe chit chat a lot but she never wants to do anything outside talking at work or texting. it kinda sucks but I'm 99% sure it's because her BF is jealous. One of the few times we hung out he called her like 12 times in an hour and wanted to talk on the phone like I wasn't there. She was visibly annoyed with him and told him to stop and said she'd be at his house later, and apologized to me about it. This was months ago. She's ducked a lot of my attempts to hang out with her so I've stopped asking unless it's in the parking lot.\n\nThe other day, She went on break at the same time I got off work. I texted her \"Hey you wanna chill for a bit or are you on the phone?\" and she texted back immediately \"BUY ME SHELLS.\" \n\nI felt kinda shitty and used by that because we haven't seen each other outside work (which just sucks for talking so it's not really hanging out unless it's just dead slow, which it never is) so I just told her I was gonna drive home and she left it on read. She ignored my attempt to instigate our normal night time chit chats but she did send me a streak snap. \n\nPart of me feels like I was being a paranoid emotional dick, but I can't shake the feeling that she's luke warm with me unless I'm a benefit to her.

I have finals coming up and I need to focus 100% on studying everyday for the next month in order to graduate. Because of this I told my gf that I wanted a break from sex for 1 month in order to focus all my energy and effort into studying for my hard finance and accounting courses. I said we still can do 1 date night every 2 weeks for this month as opposed to 1-2 times a week how it is normally. She was ok with the date night thing but super pissed about me limiting her on the sex for one month. The thing is sex with her is so tiring for both of us, we usually go 2-3 times a day 4-5 days a week. And I'm so exhausted after a day of that, I'll never be able to study effectively. She said I'm denying her sex which is super shitty and a terrible thing to do and that I'm an ass clown. She has multiple dildo's vibrators etc to keep her satisfied so I just think 1 month for my future is not a big deal.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Yesterday, there was an incident where I think that I'm 100% blameless. Me and a friend were driving out to this place called Stewart's Drive in. For those who don't know, it's a 1950's style drive-in restaurant where you order from the car and the carhops bring your food to you so that you can eat in the car. I ordered for both of us and when the carhop brought the food, she fastened the tray of food to my window with these clips. But I don't know what happened. Either I knocked the tray loose a little or the carhop didn't do a good job of clipping it on, but the tray completely gave away and our food spilled all over the floor next to my car.\n\nMy friend was pissed and yelled \"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!\" I kept telling him that it wasn't my fault, but he wasn't even listening. He kept calling me a fuck-up and he just yelled at me to drive him home. The carhop offered to prepare another order, but I just yelled at her that I wasn't paying and I drove off. On the drive back, my friend tells me to \"grow up\" and we got into a giant shouting match. I kept trying to tell him that it wasn't my fault, but he was saying that he was starving and I ruined our lunch. I just pulled over and told him to get out of my car if he was going to be a crybaby. He got out and I drove off and we haven't even tried to talk since yesterday. AITA?",

      "description": "Quick backstory: It's been just me and my mom for the past 4 years. About a year ago she let my dumbass brother (24) and 4 other people (F: 35, 16, 13) move in with us. Out of all of us, I (F16) am the only vegetarian. For this reason I prepare my own food for myself and my mom (48, works 2 jobs as a nurse.) No one else in the house makes food for me, the only members of my family that do are my grandma and my aunt that I rarely see. \n\nNow, ever since my brother came down here, he's pretty much eaten everything that he sees. A few months ago my grandma made me some spinach and beet juice so I'd have something to eat, I made some veggie rice with beans to go with this. Keeping in mind that the fridge is full of cooked ribs and chicken, I ate half and put the other half in the fridge for later, thinking it'd be safe, but as you can guess, I was wrong. I came back later only to find it missing, I asked my brother about it and he told me, \"That's gone.\" And that not only did he eat it, but he shared it out to the rest of his posse. I was absolutely livid. For one, this was supposed to be my dinner for tonight since my mom has rule against cooking after 8, and two, the food was a gift from my grandmother trying to make sure I didn't become anemic (beets and spinach are high in iron.)\n\nThis of course turned into an argument where I told him not to touch my food, and he called me selfish and self centered. Afterwards I went against my mom's rule and began attempting to remake the meal, only there's no more spinach or rice, so it was really just seasoned beans. After he saw me take out the can, the convo essentially went like this\n\nHim: \"Aren't you gonna ask if anyone else wants some?!?'\n\nMe: \"No, you-\"\n\nHim: \"Oh why, cause you're selfish??!! If it's in the fridge it's for everybody!\"\n\nMe: \"You all literally just ate. All the precooked food in the fridge in made up of meat, that I don't eat. All that's left is a can of beans, get over yourself.\"\n\nAt this point his girlfriend (f35) comes out and tries to defend herself.\n\nGF: Hey, we pretty much eat the same thing you eat. We saw it in the fridge and thought it looked good. And you're making something else anyway, so it's no big deal!\n\nMe: Except you guys eat meat, both of your daughters refuse to eat most vegetables! You're the ones who made all the chicken in the fridge last night.\n\n\nGonna add on to this a bit a say that this wasn't the last time my brother did this. 2 months ago my mom's childhood friend from Jamaica visited us a gave her some authentic cheese as a gift, my brother ate it all before my mom could even try it. My mom once brought crab home so she could take it for her lunch the next day, her ate all her crab at 1 in the morning for no reason. My mom once made cake for my grandma, he ate that. My aunt made curry chickpeas for me, he ate that before I could try it. And throughout this entire ordeal, I never once touched any food that they've made for themselves, even the ones without meat. I don't even eat their snacks. \n\nAnyways, this happened a while back, but I'm still upset. So, AITA here? I'm actually posting this here now because I'm tired of him calling me selfish for not feed his lazy ass, even though he has a much larger variety of meal choices. \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I'm a 52 year old male with a 23 year old daughter. Our relationship has always had its ups and downs. Mainly because I did not get to see her and speak to her for a big part of her childhood. I left to go back to my home country when she was 3 due to DV issues with her mom at the time. This is completely my fault. I was an asshole. I have since gotten therapy and am happily married.\n\n\nWe reconnected when she was 16 and we were pretty much two peas in a pot. We are very alike and she moved in with me and my wife. All was well, except that we'd have pretty heated fights once in a while. I never got violent with her but I'd scream and she'd scream and my wife (who is very calm) would be stuck in the middle.\n\n\nMy wife cannot have children, but our dream was always to adopt or foster. Finally we were at a point in our lives where we could afford to foster a teenager. But when I told my daughter, she got mad. She said that it was unfair that I would foster someone rather than pay her mom the 'child support' that I 'owed', which was never ordered by a judge as we never went to court.\n\n\nIt is true that I didn't pay any child support but she lived with us for two years and we got her a car, clothes, food etc and spoiled her to make up for it. She says that it's still unfair and that she is hurt that I will raise a child when I was never there for her.\n\n\nMy daughter moved out and went to live near her mom again. I called my ex-wife hoping for support. She called me an asshole and hung up on me? Again **she never asked me for a penny before**.\n\n\nAm I really the asshole here?\n\n\nTL;DR; I want to foster a child. My daughter and ex-wife are upset because they think that i 'owe' them.\n",

      "title": "WIBTA if I leave my girlfriend in her time of need?",
      "description": "Strap in for a wild ride and a whole lot of text. For context, we are both currently 22, and have been together for almost 3 months.\n\nI met my girlfriend summer of 2014, when we were in our second year of uni. We've been good friends since, and really close in 2018. Eventually, that closeness gave way to feelings and we became official in August. Now in my eyes, the honeymoon phase lasted all of about 18 hours, when we had our first 'dealbreaker' argument. From then on, it's been periods of really high highs, and extremely low lows. We fought on average once every other day, and fights always went like this: she berates me relentlessly for 2 hours (insults, swears, the whole shebang), and after that point, she'll either calm down enough that I can finally talk her through it, or she'll decide she doesn't care enough anymore and just leave me feeling attacked and unresolved. Either way, not a great feeling. Anyways, I stuck it out because I was trying to see the big picture and I thought that we could have a really strong future together. \n\nA month in, I went off for vacation with my buddies (without her, cause we planned it way in advance) and that was our first real time apart. I, in another country in the Caribbeans, still did my dutiful role of keeping in touch, reporting what I was doing, etc., so she wouldn't worry. I know this behavior isn't normal of a trusting relationship but she has intense trust issues from past periods, and I told myself it'd be worth it. When I got back, we got a little reckless because of how much we missed each other and decided that it would be okay to go unprotected. It obviously wasn't, and she ended up getting pregnant. Except I didn't know that. I know I'm an asshole for this stuff so far, not practicing safe sex, being neglectful of her condition, emotions, etc., but we fought relentlessly for the next few weeks. I thought she was just stressed because she had certification exams and that she was just lashing out at me, but it was the conception and the emotional swings that follow. Since I didn't know, I took it out as her unreasonably lashing out at me, and I just dealt with her mood swings while slowly losing feelings. I had my own exam and full-time job to worry about and honestly I just didn't know what to do.\n\nSo after 3 weeks, I broke it off on a Friday. No contact on the weekend. I gotta admit. I missed her like crazy and that slight time apart made me realize how much of a mistake I made and that I wanted to try again, if she'll have me. On Monday, she tells me she's pregnant and sends me pictures of the pregnancy tests. And I can tell she's panicking. So I do everything I can to let her know whatever she needs, I'll be there for. and I didn't mean just clinic visits, appointments, consultations, whatever. I meant everything. Emotional needs, etc.\n\nWe ended up getting back together a week later and the abortion happened the following week. After having broken up, obviously our relationship was on shakey ground but I was determined to try and get back to what we had before, or something better/stronger. She continued to lash out at me nightly, because of her pregnancy mood swings, or following the procedure. And I took all of it like a sponge and always bounced back and continued being that stoic, steadfast guy she can rely on. It wasn't enough though; it didn't meet what she was expecting out of me, saying I was acting too much like it wasn't even happening but honestly, I didn't want to ask her \"How are you feeling emotionally?\" about the pregnancy or the abortion because I didn't want to bring her mind back to it, or I thought I could lift her up by just talking about things like normal.\n\nRegardless, here's my life outside of her:\n\n* I work a full-time job, 9-5, that is quite stressful due to understaffed, underpaid, and just poor leadership.\n* I commute 3 hours in a day. 1.5 each way.\n* I have a major certification exam December 1st, which I am really behind on\n* My parents are going through medical issues, and I am almost never there for them cause when I'm not studying, I have to be with my girlfriend.\n\nI say when I'm not studying, I have to be with her, but lately, I haven't even been able to study because the time I allot to studying (9pm - 12:30am at night before I sleep and get ready to wake up at 6:30am for work) is always filled with trying to talk her out of whatever twisted plot she thought up in her emotional state. I've been dealing with this since before she got pregnant. PMSing, just general fights over the smallest things, they always happened at night and she'd EXPECT me to stay up until we resolve it (if you recall, us resolving it relies on how long it takes for her to become rational again). and honestly, she says she feels guilty cause she knows I have to study. but what can I do? I tell her not to feel guilty, cause I do care, I do have feelings, I don't want her to be alone, the situation is 100% my responsibility, and I'm the one asking her how she's doing, etc, offering to drive to her on the weekend when I should be non-stop cramming. I don't know how much longer I can do that for. I have 21 days left until my exam. I lost 4 nights of studying this week because she always starts going off at me at 10 PM, when I just settle down and start trying to study. My mom went in for a cancer screening appointment (I think), and I have no idea how that's going cause I'm so occupied with other things that I feel like I'm losing sight of things I shouldn't.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I started smoking again, I'm not studying enough, I'm losing my sense of self and am just generally depressed all the time unless I'm with friends or at the gym. I lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks despite not changing how much I eat or lift.\n\nThis morning, she fell and twisted her ankle and had to go to the hospital instead of work. I just don't feel like I can do anything to hurt her emotionally right now, but I'm really suffering too. I'm not equating my problems and emotions to hers. But I don't like feeling like I have to pretend my problems or emotions don't exist.\n\nI don't complain about a single thing she asks of me. I don't complain when she gets emotional with me. I don't complain about any of my unhealthy coping mechanisms. But she lashes out saying I created a space where she feels like she can't share how she feels with me. That I act uninvolved.\n\nTo everybody that read all that, thank you so much. I know there may be controversy because of abortion, but for context again, we are 22 years old, freshly graduated young professionals with conservative parents. We made a mistake. Extremely preventable if I had been more responsible, but the responsibility isn't all mine.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I just left her in the middle of everything she's going through? ",

      "description": "For a lot of people, gift-giving can be stressful and an unfortunate factor of the holidays that they simply have to put up with. For other people, Christmas becomes the Gift Olympics and they spend more than half the year prepping for it. I am definitely part of the latter group. I revel in the hunt for the perfect gift. I spend most of November hunched over a laptop, cackling into the screen like a Christmas goblin as I search for presents. \n\nThat being said, I never expect my friends and loved ones to escalate to the mania-like state I achieve around their birthdays and holidays. My family has known about my tendencies since I was a toddler and encouraged me to express my love for them in that way, because it made me happy. I try not to drown my friends in gifts, as they may feel pushed to reciprocate equally. But when it comes to my family, there are no holds barred. \n\nMy brother is my only sibling. Heâs 22, finishing college with a vague plan of what he wants to do with his life, and works almost every weekend at the same job heâs had since he was 16. Most of his money goes towards paying for school, and aside from the occasional outing with his friends, he doesnât splurge on anything. I enjoy spoiling him because of this as well. In the past, I would usually buy presents for our parents and he would add his name to the card, sometimes giving me money to contribute. He has been known to go get presents for people on his own, but usually requires prodding to do so. \n\nLast year I moved out of the house, but within a distance that can easily be commuted for a day trip. While this is not necessarily relevant to the story, his brief visit to my house started to indicate to me that any efforts I make for him would be met with indifference. I offered to host him and several of his friends for a night. In summary, I took them out, wined and dined all of them on my dime, smoked them up at my house, only to have all of them completely ignore me and cut me out of the evening entirely. They didnât even notice when I finally left and just went to bed. After that, not a peep of thanks from him for doing any of it. \n\nAnd then radio silence on my birthday. I can understand not being able to afford a gift, but Facebook literally reminds you when people have birthdays. I brought this up to my mom when she called later that week, and she expressed dismay because she had texted him the night before reminding him about my birthday and to give me a call. \n\nAnd finally, Christmas. I was hosting on my family at my own place for the very first time. Very stressed and overworked at the time, but I pulled it together. He came with my parents, did not get gifts for anyone that year or even cards, and did not thank anyone for the things they gave him. Not even a follow-up, âhey, I really appreciate the thing you got me,â text. I was just hoping for the bare minimum, at this point. \n\nSo am I the asshole for just wanting to cut him off of the gift list and spare myself the disappointment? It feels petty, like maybe my raging enthusiasm birthdays and holidays is clouding my judgement. I am the older sibling and want to be the example of how to act, but itâs hurtful to have him continually ignore something thatâs always been important to me. \n\n",

      "description": "So I'm (F) and in high school. My friend (let's call her Jess) reached out to me and confessed she doesn't feel like she has any close friends, despite starting to hang out with my very tight-knit friend group. We have a meme group-chat on instagram and I thought it might be a good idea to add her to it, since the banter usually isn't that deep and it might be a good way for her to interact and still feel comfortable. Before telling her anything I checked in with the group-chat to see if it was ok with everybody, and I was not expecting a negative answer.\n\nThis girl in the group chat (let's call her Anna) transferred schools last year and though she knows Jess, never really interacted with her. She wanted to keep the group chat tight-knit and only with people she really knew. That's completely fine, if it weren't for the fact that a few months ago she added this random guy she was friends with who none of us knew irl, and we just had to accept him into our friend group. It made literally everyone uncomfortable.\n\nEveryone in that group-chat knows Jess personally and has hung out with them. She sits with us at lunch every day. I feel terrible for excluding her, especially on such weird circumstances.\n\nBut, Anna's friendship with the random boy ended terribly, and that may be the reason they don't want to add another person to the group chat. I feel like bringing anything up would make me the asshole.\n\nI didn't tell Jess about my plan, and I didn't add her so no harm done, but I still feel as if I should take some sort of action.\n\nAITA for feeling like this? Am I trippin or is Anna a bit of an asshole? Should I speak up?",

I was a full blown Christian, except there was one thing: I wasn't. I couldn't believe in god or any of the Old Testament. I didn't say this, obviously but I just couldn't do it, I was basically only going because of my friends. \n\nWell, once we got to 8th grade, we moved on from the youth ministry to the full blown Wednesday service thing, and I went once and have not gone since. Any time they ask me to come to church I get scared and just answer with a half-assed \"uh huh\" kind of response. I know I can't talk to them about it because of my town, so I just try to get by. \n\nSo, AITA and any advice?\n\nTLDR; I stopped going to church because I didn't believe and now I don't know what to say\n",

      "title": "AITA for getting upset for my roommate's lack of cleanliness when I haven't in the past?",
      "description": "So, in the past, I used to be someone who would just accept things for how they were. If someone wanted something, I would be happy to provide. If someone was upset about something, I would take the fault. If something weren't how I wanted it, I would deal with it.\n\nBut my new years resolution was essentially to stop having this attitude: If something bothers me, I'll speak up. If I feel that someone is asking too much, I would say no. If I have too much on my plate, instead of stressing and pulling all-nighters, I would ask for an extension, or for someone to help me out. I feel that this, despite being more selfish in nature, is healthy for me, and in the long run, is healthier for others, as it helps me to serve my own needs and happiness first, which would then allow me to better serve others, but only when once I've helped myself.\n\nIt's been going really well! I'm happier overall, less stressed, my friendships are stronger, and, strangely enough, I seem to have a lot more respect from my boss, coworkers, and teachers. But there's been one area that I've kinda been forgetting about, and that's in my own home.\n\nAnd, so, this is where I could use some perspective:\nWhen my roommate (male, 21) first moved in, I had just finished putting in a TON of effort cleaning up from my last slob of a roommate. All of the dishes were scrubbed. My couch had to be demolded from spilled food. Furniture had to be repaired. The bathtub and floors scrubbed. And as a bonus, I had the bedroom reorganized to make it feel homier and less \"this is my side, and this is your side.\"\n\nSidenote: The dorm has a kitchen and living room merged into one room, a bathroom, and a bedroom.\n\nThings were good at first, and the place seemed to stay clean, but with time, he started to become messier. Since this was before the new years resolution, I kinda just went with it and adapted. I tried to keep things clean, but he just made messes too fast and I couldn't keep up with my busy schedule. Beard trimmings were left on the bathroom floor and sink. Dried chunks of poop were in the toilet. Dirty dishes were left in the sink (I literally switched to paper plates because he used all my dishes). Trash-cans weren't emptied when they filled up, and he literally let them overflow. Amazon boxes would be left in the middle of the living room for literally months.\n\nNow, I'm not entirely innocent. On occasion, I would accidentally leave some of my long hair in the bathtub after showering. I would sometimes run out of time and leave a few dirty dishes laying around. My own, personal desk is kinda messy. Sometimes, if I got an Amazon package, I would leave it sitting around for a day or two until I got enough time to take care of it.\n\nBut... That said, it seems that for whatever mess I left, promising myself I would clean, he would leave double that mess, making it so that I would have to clean up three times as much.\n\nWhen the new years resolution came around, I started to find myself with more time to clean up after myself. And so I did. But his attitude hasn't changed at all, and I'm kinda getting annoyed. I've always been annoyed, but dealt with it because I figured: \"I'm making a few messes too. It's hypocritical for me to judge.\" I really want the living room to be a nice, comfortable place to be in, and he doesn't seem to be respecting that. I own almost everything in this dorm, since I make the most money, and he doesn't seem to respect the stuff as though it's not his. The dirty dishes in the sink he used, but I own them. I even buy the toiletries, and he doesn't think to go and he leaves the empty tubes of toilet paper on the dispenser without going to the closet to get more.\n\nI've even gone so far as to try to make it easier for both of us. I bought a scrub brush to use instead of a sponge for the dishes. I bought a toilet paper holder for the bathroom so that we wouldn't have to run to the closet to grab more as frequently. I even have a donation box for us to throw stuff we don't want anymore.\n\nAll of this is also combines with various stuff like locking me in the bedroom when he has a girl over (instead of asking me to leave), but that's another story.\n\nSo, Reddit, give me some perspective. Am I the ass for expecting him to clean when I haven't previously enforced that? Or is it within my right to be upset for him not treating our place and my stuff with respect?\n\nTl;Dr Despite providing tools and trying to help him out, my roommate doesn't want to treat the place with respect.",

      "description": "I live on a small college campus. This guy lives two doors down from me. When you talk to him, he's a pretty smart dude but his social skills are garbage (coming from someone who doesn't have the best social skills), and it's obvious that he's somewhat autistic, the severity can be debated. I've tried (albeit, not very hard) to be friends with him but he's just intolerable. I feel bad because I don't think he has any friends and most people on campus, myself included, try to avoid him, which isn't going to help the guy, it's only going to make his lack of social skills worse. Anyway, the reasons why I dislike him are:\n\nHe always smells terrible.\n\nHe rarely flushes the toilet. \n\nHe brushes his teeth in the water fountain. \n\nHe's always late to class. \n\nHe's almost always disruptive in class, asking the same question multiple times, only to get frustrated when the professor brushes his question off instead of answering it for the 4th time. \n\nHe's constantly sick and I've woken up to hearing him gagging and/or vomiting early in the morning multiple times. \n\nHe does gross things such as picking his nose, or picking wedgies out of his ass in public. \n\nI feel bad for the guy but can't stand to be around him. I get the feeling that he doesn't understand why people don't like him. I've not really witnessed people be overtly mean to him but anytime he starts a conversation with another student, it's obvious they're looking for a way out of the conversation. I feel he could definitely benefit from somebody teaching him how to have better hygiene but I don't want to upset him by calling him out for his disgusting habits. \n\nI feel like I'm in the wrong for actively trying to avoid him but I don't know what else to do.

      "description": "This happened a while ago. My mom has the habit of ordering me to do tasks for her a lot. They're simple tasks, like charging her phone for her, getting her a snack, getting her a drink, etc. Sometimes, if she's sitting in the room where her phone charger is, and I'm outside, she'll call me into the room just to charge it for her. Most of the time, I don't mind it. I'm generally stressed out all the time, so getting up and doing tasks helps me to get myself back together. However, other times, it gets annoying when it's task after task, and when I get tired. Today just so happened to be one of those times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe made me perform tasks for her today (getting her stuff) and I've been moody, so I was a little annoyed. She told me to get her something from a drawer that wasn't too far from her. I do so, and give the item to her and return back to my desk. She has to leave the house for something, and does so promptly. However, a few minutes later, she shouts my name and shows me some clothes that have been soaked in dirty water from when our neighbours washed their corridors and dumped the water on the floor. Some of our clothes were hanging outside and fell in the water. I was extremely annoyed at this point. She started complaining about our neighbours and shouted at me to put the clothes in the washing machine. At the same time, my dad told me to retrieve something for him. When I was retrieving the item, she shouted again at me to put the clothes in the washing machine. At that point, I yelled at her, saying 'Please wait, I have multiple things to do at once.' I sounded angry, and it slipped out. She ignored it and continued complaining about the neighbours. I gave my dad the item and walked to dump the clothes in the washing machine. She left the house.  \n\n\nI felt pretty awful after that. I texted her saying that I was sorry, but she hasn't replied yet. Everyone else that was there ignored it. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my brother to not do anything with his girlfriend in my bed?",
      "description": "Some context. I'm 23 years old and a college student. Most of the time, I live on campus but as next week is Spring Break, I came home to my parents' tonight. My brother (21) is home and his girlfriend is staying the night, as tomorrow they plan to leave early and go to Boston. I assumed that the girlfriend would get my room, my brother would sleep in his and that I would sleep on the couch. \n\nTurns out, I was wrong. My brother somehow convinced my mom that they should share a room. (My parents are very conservative Christians so I didn't think they'd go for it). Now, my brother's bed isn't big enough for them to sleep in together but my bed is. So, my mom told them it'd be okay to sleep in my bed. Without asking me first. I only found out when my dad came to collect me from school, as he thought I knew. He understood why I wasn't comfortable with it. I talked to my mom and was told that she would wash the sheets in the morning. Fine. Whatever. I accept I'm not going to have a say in this and don't want to fight.\n\nMy brother and his girlfriend come home. I pull my brother aside and tell him that I don't want them doing anything in my bed tonight. My brother got really mad and ignored me for the rest of the night. He made a snarky comment when he went upstairs and my mom asked me what was wrong with us. I told her and she got mad that I said that. I told her I'm not going to apologize for saying it. I also said it was messed up for her okaying this when it was my bed, without asking me first. She said there was no other option and I said that's not true, there definitely was and brought up me sleeping on the couch.\n\nAfter they went to bed, my brother came back down to grab his charger and was still in a mood, mumbling about how everything is a problem. My mom said it wasn't and that I shouldn't have said it. I said I don't regret saying it. Brother said I was mad at him, I said that wasn't true, I simply asked him to not do something. He said \"Whatever, she'll never stay the night again.\" Which isn't at all what I said or even wanted. I love his girlfriend, she's really sweet and I would have no issue with \\*her\\* being in my bed. I just don't want them doing anything in it.\n\nNow my mom is upset with me because he's upset and I don't feel bad. I didn't say I was mad about her being in the room, I know she's slept in there before when I'm not home and my brother has been in his. (Though I'm not naive and think he probably snuck up there, which is why I said something.)\n\nIt's not their bed. It's mine and I didn't say it loud enough for his girlfriend to hear or do anything to make her feel uncomfortable. I said it to him and him alone, because I know him. He's the type that totally would and I think that's why he got mad.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Should I just be okay with them doing whatever they want in my bed?",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend have been together for well over two years now yet she seems to often develop new friendships with guys who always end up liking her.\nThe latest guy she has been hanging out with likes her, of course, but is also emotionally abusive to her.\n\nWe are in a long distance relationship and she said she hangs out with guys to replace the feeling of me being there. \n\nTo expand on him, he has said things to her such as âI want you out of my lifeâ, âyou should kill yourself I donât want to see you againâ and just generally abusive things. He shouts at her when heâs angry and there has been more than one occasion where she has either cut herself or taken far to many pills after conflict with him, luckily nothing too serious.\n\nAm I the asshole for asking her not to hang out with him all the time? She hangs out with him for 11/12 hours at a time, a few times a week. When I ask her to not she just tells me that Iâm overreacting and I shouldnât get angry/upset over nothing.\n\nI know she isnât sleeping with the guy so please donât jump to that conclusion. I just would like to know if itâs right or wrong for me to ask her to stay away from a person like this. \n\nIâve also asked her to stop snapchatting him, texting him and generally choosing him over me when weâre talking on FaceTime yet she fails to listen or even acknowledge any reasoning for my pleads. We could FaceTime for an hour and sheâd be on pause talking to him for 70-75% of that time. \n\nAm I being too controlling of her? Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: My girlfriend hangs out with emotionally abusive boy âbest friendâ and often chooses him over me. Gets angry when I tell her to stop doing these things.",

      "description": "First let me say my Son is not involved in this argument and has no clue about the conflict between my wife and I. I want to provide as much background as I can so sorry if itâs long. \n\nMy Son is in 6th grade and recently a friend from his class very unexpectedly passed away. My Son was friends with the child but from my understanding mostly through school and classes, I personally never met him. This was my Sonâs first experience in dealing with death and coping with feelings he has never really experienced. I had lots of talks with him about death and feelings. I encouraged him to talk openly about it and talk with his friends and my wife and I if he needed too. I have unfortunately dealt a lot with death and loosing friends, an unfortunate consequence of 15 years in the Military and deployments. \n\nThis week the childâs parents decided to hold a memorial hike at a local trail for all of their sons friends. Their will be some type of small service at the top. My wife found out about the service and asked my son if he would like to attend. She later told me about it and told me I would need to take him since she had plans with a friend. I told my Wife I would rather not since these type of situations bring up a lot of emotions and memories Iâve dealt with and put away and prefer to avoid emotional situations that bring these memories back. My wife is well aware of this as well. She immediately got angry and told me since I had nothing going on and she had plans I needed to âbe thereâ for my son. I again told her I will gladly be there for him but being apart of an event with an obvious high emotional state was not something I was comfortable being apart of. She got pretty pissed because I outright refused and stopped engaging in the conversation. Her plans are nothing more than attending her weekly CrossFit classes, just for reference. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to take my Son to a memorial service and not wanting to be apart of a situation I know will bring up a lot of closed out memories and emotions.

      "title": "AITA for ending a friendship with a female friend because she was worried her fiancÃ© wouldnât like her going on an overnight trip with a (gay) man?",
      "description": "So this has been gnawing at me for years, so I thought Iâd seek the catharsis of the ever-wise redditors of r/AmItheAsshole.\n\nI had a female friend who I was very close to. We met in college and both ended up moving to Japan afterwards(weâre both American). Sheâs very neurotic and always thinking about how others will see her, but I always stood up for her because I knew she was fun to be around when that protective veil dropped. I admit, oftentimes it was very difficult defending her from my other friendsâ criticism because she could be pretty nuts, but I did because she was a friend.\n\nThe last straw with her neurotic B came, though, when I asked if she wanted to do an overnight trip to a hot spring. I had done it with two other girlfriends and we had a great time and it was really cheap. We both worked at the same company (I actually helped her get her job) so I knew weâd have off at the same time which is why I suggested it to her.\n\nHer response to this suggestion is what pissed me off.  I wouldnât have cared if she said âNo, Iâm too busyâ or âNo, I donât have enough moneyâ. But she said no because she was worried what her fiancÃ© (now husband) would think about her going on an overnight trip with another man. He already knew I was gay. Weâve met a couple times before. Iâve known her longer than theyâve known each other. And Japanese people on the whole donât really give two shits about gay people. This made zero sense to me.\n\nI pressed her on it and she basically admitted she hadnât actually asked him but was just assuming what his response would be. She had already been building up to this kind of thinking when weâd hang out before this. She told me not to post pictures of us together online because she was worried about what her fiancÃ© would say. She said she didnât want to broach the subject with him at all for fear of upsetting him (which is odd because heâs a very even-mannered guy). I brought her past weird behavior and the fact that her fiancÃ© probably wouldnât have a problem with it and said that if she couldnât stick up for our friendship for fear of her fiancÃ© hypothetically being upset, then we just shouldnât be friends anymore.\n\nI thought I was perfectly justified for dumping a friend who treated me like crap. But a Japanese girlfriend (who knew her slightly but only because she was friends with me) took her side, saying âsometimes you have to sacrifice things so your partner is happyâ. This really irked me, but planted the seed of doubt that I could be the asshole in the situation. Thoughts?",

And theyâre rancid.\n\n\nWhen she was younger she constantly farted just as often but it didnât smell as bad because her parents could at least control more of what she ate. Now that sheâs older sheâs on a rampage, eating ice cream &amp; many of her her âtriggerâ foods.

My mother had called me and told me she was twenty minutes away, I was cool with that. But barely 10 minutes after she's pulling up to the house and she called me telling me that she was pulling up and she mentioned that she was hungry and stuff. I was like wow okay that's a tad bit earlier than expected so I get up to grab my phone, keys, charger, headphones, candy, and a picture that was taken of me and my gf.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go to the front to put my shoes on and stuff to head out but I notice my mom isn't there. I get a text from her saying, \"I'm gone, you think i'm playing\" and I tell her I was at the front and she told me to be ready when she called. And she said that nobody had the door open as if I was coming. She said I had her waiting \"all of those minutes\" and I check the call log of the time she called me and it said she called me at 9:06 PM. I was at the door around 9:08 PM. She had called me first to ask something about my gf's dads car before she said she was pulling up so I didn't know she was there at that moment. So at max she was waiting a minute and some change. I understand that she was hungry but she told me that I should of been ready when she called me earlier to say that she was 20 minutes away. I wasn't expecting her that early and I kept telling her it was only 2 minutes of her time and she just kept shaking her head at me and not responding to that. She eventually came back but she wasted more time than she would've if she had just stayed a little longer so I don't get what was the point of that.\n\n  \nAITA for taking two minutes?",

      "description": "So, I am 15, there Is a guy I went on a date with days ago, lets call him A. A is a nice guy. There is also a guy, a big  bully in our class, lets call him Z. Z and his friends are all bullies, they bully all the guys they dislike, even in our neighbours and in other schools. They are a big group. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, A likes me and he told me that through a letter, the whole school found out about the letter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nZ has always liked me since a long time but I never gave him the chance to even confess. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast week they created problems for A. Today, while we were in class, they kept making fun of A, not that A cares or that it annoys him, A is really a cool guy and he never gets hurt by those idiots but still what they are doing is wrong and bad. They never bully me though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I was mad at them, because they keep on trying to create problems for A and bully him. Yesterday, Z texted me and asked if I want to go on a date with him, that's actually a bit of immature, I mean is he confessing (or asking me out) now that A has confessed? LOL\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, today in school, in the break, I went to the canteen, while I was peacefully eating I saw Z and his friends walking behind A, one of the bullies threw himself on A and A fall on the ground, the bully said ''oh sorry laughing''  and the other started laughing hard. At that time A stood up and pushed the bully, the bully fall on the ground and A ( lol) A stood on the clothes (jacket ) of the bully and went out. They wanted to follow him and if they did follow him, then hell would have broke (Again in our school). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I walked to them before they walked out and told Z in a loud voice, ''NO, is my answer'' he asked '' what are you talking about?'' they were all looking at us, ''I said you asked me on a date last night and I am saying I don't want to'' he actually asked ''why'' (surprisingly), ''I said because you stink''.  All the students started laughing at him, even though they are scared of them but they really couldn't help it, they just laughed and I walked away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was really mad but they didn't do anything the rest of the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA? was I wrong? :( Thanks in advance.

Weâve been dating for just a little over six months now but things are pretty serious between us just to give some background info. Iâm obviously supporting her through this very difficult time but I donât feel bad at all at what he did.\n\nHer brother was always an asshole to my girlfriend and would frequently piss her off. Iâm not going to go into too much detail about this but they had a very bad relationship with each other to say the least and she has even said she wished he would die multiple times. It looks like her wish was granted. \n\nHer entire household is actually a gigantic mess and thereâs a lot of toxicity and animosity between members of her family which does scare me a bit if I eventually decide to marry this girl. Sorry about getting off-topic but, am I the asshole for not actually feeling bad about this tragedy?  ",

      "title": "AITA for not buying my girlfriend weed during her panic attack?",
      "description": "A bit of background: \n\n-My girlfriend has PTSD and is a sexual assault survivor. Her abuser is in prison, but he has an opportunity to get out on day leave in April. She has to go to the prison and give her statement on why she doesn't believe he should get day leave (he's been imprisoned less than a year) and this is very stressful and triggering for her. Her PTSD keeps her from working, and she's currently on disability. \n\n- My girlfriend has been \"self-medicating\" with cannabis for over two years now. She's high maybe 50-70% of the day, and it's affecting our relationship and her healing progress (it causes her anxiety to be without it now). She's admitted to herself that she's addicted to it and began the journey of quitting weed last week.  \n\n- We live in Canada and cannabis is legal and sold in stores. \n\n- She doesn't have her licence at the moment and doesn't have money to spend until her next cheque. The only way she can get weed is if I take her to the store. \n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nLast night my gf was having a really rough time because she was going over the news articles about her abuser. She was feeling very triggered and began having a panic attack, begging me to take her to the cannabis store, saying she'd pay me back on the 1st. \n\nAt first she said she wanted just a CBD strain, then that evolved into wanting a balanced THC/CBD strain. \n\nShe said she's been having a really rough time this past week while trying to quit, and she should be able to smoke once a week when she's very anxious. She was getting hysterical and was hyperventilating and it was horrible to see her feel that way. \n\nI ended up saying no and just taking her for a drive instead. My reason being is that it's hard for me to differentiate between her actually needing cannabis for her PTSD, or her using it to feed her addiction and hide from her emotions. The first day she started quitting she begged me in a similar way and had a panic attack, but afterwards she told me she was happy I said no and she truly realized how much it has control over her. \n\nI think the reason she had such a strong panic attack in the first place yesterday is because that was the first time in forever that she dealt with those emotions sober. \n\nPart of the reason why she's behind in her healing progress is because she doesn't know how to deal with ANY bad emotion while sober anymore. Weed was always her go-to. \n\nShe ended up calming down after a while but I feel incredibly guilty. I don't know if what I did was the best thing to help her or not. \n\nEven today she's still trying to convince me to take her to the store, and I feel stuck. I don't want to enable her addiction but at the same time I don't want her to have panic attacks because I didn't get her what she needed. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\nTLDR: My girlfriend has been using cannabis to help with PTSD for two years but now she's become addicted and can't go without it. After a week of trying to quit she had a huge panic attack and begged me to buy her weed. I said no. ",

      "description": "**TL;DR** *- As a driver - accepted a ride on a ride-sharing app, saw that it was too long a drive for me, asked rider to get out, they said no. Decide to go on with the ride. Rider becomes increasingly disrespectful during the ride - includes putting feet up on the armrest. Pull over in the middle of her ride, tell her to get out - she doesn't. Tell her I'll order her a car, order the car, and promptly cancel when she's out of my vehicle. AITA?*\n\nSo on my spare time I drive for ride-sharing apps to make cash on any upcoming travels I have. I work a normal 9-5, but I genuinely enjoy driving around and listening to music so I don't mind doing this. One night I'm driving really late and decide to crank out one more ride, so I accept a request and when the rider gets in and I start the trip I realize that the ride is close to two hours long into NYC.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar, if you do not have a special license plate and license you cannot pick up riders in NYC, this makes driving from NJ to NYC kind of unprofitable. While they do pay for your tolls you are basically wasting gas driving back to NJ. Also, be mindful that ride destinations are only seen once the rider is picked up.\n\nI explain this and mention that I'm pretty tired so I'd rather not drive her and I would cancel the ride myself so there was no charge to her.\n\nThis where the story takes a weird turn: The rider says no. They don't want to get another driver and that they are already in my vehicle so I have to drive them. We have a small exchange and the rider seems to be a genuinely good person so I decide to go on with the ride.\n\nOnce we cross the bridge into NYC she begins to be obnoxious. Complains about the radio and wants me to pair her phone via BT whilst driving, berates my car, and what drove me off the edge is that she put her feet up on my armrest.\n\nI ask her a few times to lower her feet in a friendly manner, but she refuses to do so. I tell her that if she doesn't take her feet down I'll get off at the next exit and cancel the ride. She mumbles something to herself and I say it one more time to make sure she understands what I'm about to do and she mumbles to herself again.\n\nI get off at the next exit and pull over. She starts yelling \"what are you doing?\" and I say \"canceling the ride\" - which I promptly do. I told her to get out of my car because the ride is over and she tells me she's not getting out. We have an unpleasant exchange and I then proceed to turn off my car and wait until she gets out. She starts yelling some more and telling me that I'm broke and I have no life, the whole nine yards.\n\nNow I'm just frustrated. So I tell her that I'll do us both a favor and order her a driver to take her to her destination. She pleasantly agrees with a grin on her face. Driver comes, she gets out of my car, into their car and then I promptly cancel the ride and I go on my merry way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for handling the situation the way I did?",

      "description": "So this is a little tricky, and I'm posting sort of for my mother too, since she is the only kid out of three who actually gave a shit about her dad and visited him regularly. My grandma married into the family when I was very young. The context otherwise, is that I'm the only grandkid who put up with their disgusting Baptist church views, mostly because I loved my grandpa and wanted to see him as often as possible. I knew I hated church at that age and basically just put up with it because it was a weekly forced thing if I wanted to see my grandparents. I knew I was pretty gay around thirteen, and hearing the pastor of this church tell a kid not to listen to Queen because \"That band is gay\", basically turned me into the massive atheist I am today.\n\nWell fast forward a few years, I knew I was trans, but I didn't make it into a huge deal, I was only out to a few friends. It isn't largely important to the story, but it is very important to me, because I have zero desire to ever be nice to this woman after hearing how her church views queer people.\n\nMy grandpa died around seven years ago, and as per his request, he was cremated and put into a large urn he bought, with four very small urns for his three kids and I, since I was the only grandkid who ever visited him. When my mother and I went to the house to get our urns, my grandma basically told me that she didn't want the massive urn he left for her and asked if I wanted to trade. I took the offer and brought grandpa's large urn home, leaving her the smaller one, while I was happy to have more of him to cherish. I still live with my mother, so the large urn is in her bedroom, which I have no problem with.\n\nSo a few years later (after step-grandma remarried), she suddenly told my aunt she wanted my urn back, because she was getting up there in age and my grandpa had initially said he wanted his urn buried with her. She's remarried, they aren't getting buried together. I think she'd just found out that I'd come out and started transitioning and she just decided she didn't like it.\n\nMy aunts both think that my mom is a bitch for not giving the urn back, but I have been actively campaigning for her to either release the ashes at his favorite fishing spot, or to put some in the garden so he can become a part of her favorite flowers. Neither of us want to ever speak to the vile woman who used to be my grandmother, and we don't speak much to my aunts either, since they don't agree with my transition and refuse to call me the correct name and pronouns. And mind you, this is four years into my transition, I don't look like a girl anymore and I've legally changed my name.\n\nI don't know where my mom and I stand here. Any feedback is appreciated, just please keep the trabsphobia to yourselves if you can.\n\nTldr: am I a bad person for wanting my mom to keep her dad's ashes, despite my nasty hyper religious and homophobic grandmother wanting them back after giving them to us?",

      "description": "The girlfriend of a really good friend of mine is trying to get 30-40 people to all pitch in $10 for a game console for his birthday. Originally she wanted to buy it herself but I told her he doesn't need a gift that expensive since they've been dating for less than a year and she can barely afford her bills but she has it in her head that he really needs one so a few days later she made a group chat asking everyone. I think it's a sweet idea but I just think gifting someone something that expensive is unnecessary. \n\nWhat do you all think of the situation?

      "description": "Sorry for the fact that it's a little long,  TL;DR at bottom. \n\nSo a few days ago, I found out that my girlfriend of a little over a year cheated on me. We're not intimate (and I'm not a particularly sex-driven guy) but by all accounts it finally started seeming like things might get more serious before this. We've lived together the whole time.\n\nI passed out early in the evening (around 6 pm) after a particularly tiring 6 am to 5 pm shift at work. I woke up a few times during the night,  notably 11 45 pm and when I finally got up at 4 am. At 11 45 pm she was in the shower and I joked about how I should join her because I had work again in the morning,  before laughing,  going to the bathroom and falling asleep. Nothing seemed odd at this stage. \n\nAt 4 am when I woke up and she wasn't in bed I knew something was off -- she didn't work that day and she wasn't around? Sometimes she'd work as early as 4 30 am, but I knew she was off that day. I freaked a little,  worried,  but just texted her to make sure she was safe,  to see where she was. I waited around 30 minutes without a response before I started to get paranoid. Mostly worried about her safety at this point,  she'd never struck me as someone who would cheat,  period. I didn't work for another 2 hours so I decided to do some looking around to see if I could find out where she went just to make sure she was safe and not in a wreck in a ditch somewhere.\n\nShe has two phones at the moment: her old one, and an s9 I got for her when I upgraded to one --  they were BOGO at the time. I knew her pass code to her old phone (she knew that I knew it) because sometimes I'd mess with mutual friends on Discord by being like \"oooooo I'm acting weird and saying stuff like 'I'm a butt' spoooooky!\" But never anything bad and I only did it when me and her were playing around. Her old phone was still sitting around,  so naturally the first thing I do is look there for clues. It doesn't have a SIM card,  but maybe she told a friend on Discord she wanted to spend the night with em? NBD if she did,  she'd be safe and I could have my peace of mind,  right? No problemo?\n\nWell,  wrong.  First I find her lying to a friend about how I treat her and playing it up for \"oh-pity-me\" points and naturally that upsets me a bit,  but I figured I'd just talk to her about it later and move on.  It hurt,  but she must have had a reason right? Having this upsetting bomb dropped on me,  I click on the next most recent person on the list that she'd talked to -- some guy she added like 3 or 4 days prior. \n\nNormally I wouldn't give a damn if she made a friend or not, but just the first screen of messages from as late as 3 am is worrying: flirting, kissy faces and a whole lot of \"I wish you'd just leave him and be mine uwu\" from the other guy. It still hasn't clicked with me,  but the gears are turning.  Scrolling up hurriedly, I find two damning things: 1) she sent him pictures of her breasts JUST THE NIGHT BEFORE WHILE IN THE SHOWER and she enthusiastically accepted,  flirted and complimented him on pictures of himself jacking off to her.  The gears finally grind to a halt: Oh my God,  the woman I loved is cheating on me. I break into hysterics,  and later have to leave work early because I just can't focus -- at all. \n\nShe finally texts me back while I'm looking at a picture of this dude's cock, and I'm still in shock so I text her back pretending I know nothing.  I do a little damage control and processing. I haven't read anything else between them,  just the flirting and damning pictures -- I don't know if they've actually slept together at this point or not (still don't) or if it was just pictures. I told her one thing when I moved here,  however,  and that was \"I don't care where you go,  what friends you make or what happens -- no cheating.\" She begged me not to leave her but I did anyway,  and especially when she continued to lie to me up to just a few hours before we broke up I can't bring myself to just let it go. She lied to me all that time and I even gave her free reign before I cut it off to tell me anything on her mind,  to air her grievances, and she seems to have deemed telling me unnecessary. She told me she'd never do it again,  that she'd let me snoop her phone daily if it would prove that she's loyal in the future, all sorts of stuff... I just can't bring myself to forgive her. Imagining her with him is just too painful. I still feel like an asshole for leaving her after she begged me not to though,  and I still have some feelings for her but can't get the image of her cheating on me out of my mind. \n\nTL;DR girlfriend flirted with,  sent naked pictures of herself to,  and enthusiastically accepted dick pics from another guy (of him jacking off, to her.) I have no proof they actually slept together,  but she was gone in the early morning and lied to me about where she was. She begged me not to leave her but I did anyway because I couldn't stop thinking about her cheating on me. \n\nSo, AITA for not giving her a second chance, reddit?",

      "description": "AITA? So the important details: I've always been the one to decorate the house.  My wife and I are both, not necessarily \"homebodies,\"  but we enjoy spending time in our house together as a family.  Over time,  we have discovered that certain things are important to her and not to me and vice versa i.e. she thinks it's really important to have a garden,  so we built garden boxes and hauled soil the whole nine- I could care less,  but it's for the house so I'm fine with it.  I care more about the decisions inside, anything decorative is from my choosing,  because she could have the wall be blank for as long as we live here and it wouldn't matter.  Also fine with me because I enjoy decorating.  \n\nWhen we moved in,  the previous owners had left the hardware in the wall over the windows where curtains used to hang.  It has been on my list of things to do for awhile (we have been in the house almost a year) but other things took priority.  Today,  we were at the store and I came across curtains that were a really good deal and would match the color scheme of our room.  While I was looking,  a saleswoman asked if I needed help,  I asked if she had the teal in the 4 pack (since the 4 pack would be the best price and we have 2 windows) she said she thought they could be ordered and to follow her. I quickly mouthed to my wife I would be right back and followed the saleswoman.  She found the right color and with a discount she applied after tax the total came out to $25, for blackout curtains.  I was stoked. When my wife and son came over and she asked what I was doing I told her ordering curtains.  She became stone faced and said she would be in the car.  I finished the order, walked to the car and asked what was wrong.  She was mad because I didn't consult her at all,  and she didn't want curtains and after trying to talk it out,  we agreed we couldn't agree because I didn't think I did anything wrong.  AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I bought curtains for our room and my wife is mad because I didn't talk to her about it",

      "description": "Throwaway.\n\nSo Iâve been with my girlfriend for almost a year and it has been going really well and we havenât had any huge fights.  Actually I wouldnât even say this is a big fight, I just genuinely want to know if Iâm in the wrong here.\n\nBasically, Iâve always been very inactive on Facebook, but for whatever reason Iâve started posting a lot about Climate Change, Politics, Trump, etc. Itâs nothing too off the wall, crazy, or conspiracy theory but I do have my opinions. This was a couple weeks ago that I started posting articles and talking about my opinions on Facebook. Fast forward to today and one of my friends asks my girlfriend why Iâm posting so much political stuff, shows her the posts, and all that.\n\nMy girlfriend asked me about it and I just said I wanted to share my opinion and itâs all truthful and I think itâs enjoyable. Then she gets annoyed and distant. She said that she didnât want to defend me to our friends and have to explain why Iâm being so political. \n\nA little more backstory: her mother is super crazy with politics, very right wing (not that itâs necessarily bad but she is over the top). Shes a little bit racist and very vocal and a bit of a bully. She is notorious in our community so my girlfriend has had to deal with that all through growing up and has to defend her mom. My girlfriend stays far from being political and never talks about it, i think her mom being so toxic scared her away from it.\n\nAnyway, I told her this was very different, I wasnât posting anything crazy and only one close friend had brought it up in jest. She just said drop it and has continued to be distant. I told her if she wants me to stop then she should talk to me about it, but, once again, she said drop it.\n\nSo, am I in the wrong? Should I have said I would stop as soon as she seemed annoyed? ",

      "description": "Last night, my husband and I went to a well-known chain sporty wings restaurant on the same lot as our local movie theater. We picked the place because we had tickets for a 7:45 showing of Captain Marvel. \n\nWe arrived at 6:30 and were seated quickly. However, we then sat for 15 minutes (an actual 15--I worked in customer service, and my biggest pet peeve was people who exaggerated how long they had been waiting) without anyone making any contact with us whatsoever--no \"Have you been helped?\", no \"Hey, we're a little behind but I'll be with you shortly,\" no drink orders taken, nothing. \n\nThe area where we were seated was sort of in the middle of the dining room, so it was hard to tell in whose section we were assigned. One potential server we'll call Orange Jersey (OJ) was (nonchalantly and without much urgency) taking orders from people who had already been seated before we arrived. OJ made eye contact with us several times as she came and went, but didn't acknowledge us, so I figured she wasn't our server. \n\nAnother potential server we'll call Red Jersey (RJ) was heading toward a booth with a receipt and I politely flagged her down as she passed us, saying, \"Excuse me, miss--would you happen to know who our server is? We haven't had anyone come by our table and we've been here for 15 minutes.\" RJ apologized and said that she could help us and she'd be right back. We said no problem and thanked her.\n\nWhen RJ came back, I asked if she thought the kitchen was moving at a good speed and whether she thought we'd be able to get finished within 45 minutes. She said she'd make sure our table was priority in the kitchen. We thanked her again. Honestly, she was great--she dropped off our check early so we would be sure to be finished paying quickly and brought us to-do drinks without us asking. We tipped her nicely.\n\nAs we were putting on our coats to leave, I told my husband, \"No way we'd be leaving right now if we'd gotten that other server.\" He said, \"Yeah--and we definitely would have gotten her if you hadn't said anything. While you were talking to RJ, OJ walked by behind me and I heard her get pissed off that we grabbed someone else to help us.\"\n\nSo, WITA for asking for service from a different server?",

It bugs me that I will be alone with Vincent in our accommodation and the others will be having fun together. \n2) Vincent is now saying he wants to travel the day after we all get there (because itâs 20 euros cheaper) - this has aggravated my feelings about this even more because I am not happy staying in very small town where I donât speak the language on my own in an AirBnB. I am tempted to say to Vincent âwell I am spending 70 euros more than planned to stay with you and not leave you alone but you canât spend 20 euros. \nFYI - Vincent doesnât know that there was this whole situation about our Spanish friend not wanting him there and that I was originally going to stay with the Spanish friend. \n\nSo am I the asshole for a) wanting us to stay altogether and b) if I say that to Vincent?

      "description": "Heres how it came to be that i showed my current girlfriend pictures of my ex girlfriends who are much more attractive than her. \n\n     So i would consider myself a slightly above average looking guy. Im fit, tall, and have a good personality. Over the years i have been with my fair share of attractive women. But the girl i am with now is the woman i undoubtedly want to marry. I love everything about her in a way that ive never felt for any other woman before. \n     That being said, she is definitely not the prettiest girl ive ever been with, be it hooking up or long term dating. She's what i would consider averagely cute. We know quite a bit about each others sexual history but there are a few women ive been with who she has never seen before that i would consider super attractive to downright gorgeous. She has only ever actually seen 2 of the girls ive been with before her. One of them was a drunken one night stand and the other was an actual ex i dated for over a year. The one night stand was not my proudest moment.\n     So whenever we argue or fight she has this argument that she likes to hold against me. Along the lines of \"i am the most attractive girl youve ever been with. You never have been and never will be with a woman whos better looking than i am, so you better get your shit straight because you have no where to go from here but down.\" And she uses this as her primary argument in a somewhat threatening and very mean kind of way to try and make me feel bad about the women i was with before her. She has even taken to pulling up their pictures and pointing out their flaws in comparison to herself.           \n     So the other day i had had enough. I told her you know what? Ive never showed you these girls out of respect for your feelings and confidence but here are some of the better looking girls that ive been with that ive never told you about. And i showed her some of the girls instagram profiles. As you can guess it didnt end well, we only fought more now she has that to live with for the duration of our relationship. But i was sooo angry and so sick of \"these ugly bitches i used to be with\" always being thrown in my face i couldnt take it anymore. And thats about it as far as that went. What do you guys think? Am i the asshole?",

      "description": "My ex bf gave me closure months after our breakup which made me feel good. So I asked him to do the same with his ex gf for I believed she hadn't moved on bcoz she had stalked me 3 years after breaking up with my ex bf. \n\nSo knowing that my ex won't talk to his ex to give her the closure I then texted his ex the next day asking her why she had stalked me 6 months ago. She said that my profile was on her recommendations so she merely checked out my Insta story. I told her that the reason I was texting her 6 months after she had stalked me rather than on the very day of her viewing my story was coz I thought she might not have been over him and I felt that I could help her now that I've also broken up with my bf. She said she was over him a long time ago and it's fine. That was it. We promised not to tell our common ex bf about our interaction. And immediately next day my ex bf then texts this ex gf telling her the reasons he broke up with her. He surprisingly had listened to my advice after all &amp;then he texted me that he had texted his ex. \n\nNow months after this incident that is 2 days ago this ex gf accidentally asks him how was I doing. He then asked her how she knew me. She said we talked but didn't tell him what.\n\nSo he immediately texts me furiously asking why had I contacted his ex and said, \"why can't you all keep your shit together?\" I said sorry and said that I shouldn't have talked with her &amp; that it was way out of the line behaviour from me.\n\nBut what pissed him more was what was it that I had talked with his ex. But before I told him what it was we talked he said that he's been very good person to me after the breakup but he won't do that anymore and asked me to stay away from him. He now is ignoring me and also the other ex. \n",

      "description": "So my girlfriend and I were together for about 7 Years now, in January she decided to go to australia for 9 Months. Everything was fine and we talked on the phone once or twice a week. After she returned on Monday i invited her to our favorite restaurant and we talked. In the conversation i asked as a joke if she was loyal to me. Her reply shocked me she said very calm that she slept with 4 Guys in this time. So i asked her again because i didn't belived what she just said: \"So you cheated on me?\". And from here just comes the most unlogical explanation i ever heard: \"No,  i was aboard it's not cheating because we are only in a realtionship here\" I kind of freaked out and left the restaurant. I later took her stuff from my aparment and gave it to her with the note that our relationship is over. She cried a lot and didn't realized why i'm doing this so i explained her why. Now she is blaming me on facebook and everythingto be an asshole for suddenly break up for no reason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo did i overreact or not? And sorry for the bad english i'm trying my best",

      "title": "AITA for not forgiving my sister",
      "description": "I just recently discovered this sub and thought it would be a good way to decide on something I have been struggling with for years.\n\nEver since I was a kid my sister was always horrible to me. She's 2 years older than me and she would always treat me like shit. Up until I was about 6, I adored her. I always wanted to be around her but she would always push me away. For example, at times she would just be playing on the computer and I would ask if I could sit in the room and play by myself so I wouldn't bother her. Then she'd hit me and yell at me until I would leave. Things like this happened on a daily basis. Eventually, I started having the same feelings towards her. I hated her and we would fight constantly. I've never been a big guy so she would always win, especially since she had 2 years on me. Basically, she made my childhood a living hell. I was also bullied a lot as a kid and she didn't do anything to stand up for me, in fact, she joined in at times. Specifically around 7th and 8th grade, I was bullied all the time because I was really small and a ginger, basically the easiest target there is. Going through puberty while being bullied by not only your classmates but also by your sister was really hard.\n\nTo give a little more background, my sister and I are polar opposites. She's an extrovert, she fit in with the popular crowd in high school and partied all the time. I'm very introverted as most of you can probably relate with. I like to stay in my room on the weekends and play video games. This was always something she used to make me feel bad. She would always call me a hermit and say I have no life. Any time she would get in trouble with my parents, she would try to take the attention off herself by bringing me up and saying things like, \"look at him, all he does is sit in his room!\" I always did that because I wanted nothing to do with her. I would insult her too, but rarely was I ever the first one to say something. I mainly just kept to myself so I wouldn't be her target.\n\nRight now, I'm a senior in high school and my sister is a sophomore in college. Within the past couple years we've tried to mend our relationship. We're on a lot better terms now than when she still lived with us. My parents kind of helped with that. My mom basically had to tell my sister how horrible she was to me as a kid because up until then, my sister thought it wasn't a big deal. When she was told that, she felt really bad and has been trying to get on better terms ever since, although at times she treats me just like she did when we were kids. This has been going on for the past 2 years, ever since she moved out. I still don't like her and haven't forgiven her for what she did to me. I haven't directly expressed this to her or my parents. Whenever I try to bring it up to my mom, she just tells me to get over it, and what happened is in the past. I find it hard to get over something that is still happening though.\n\nI don't want to make her seem worse than she is. My sister rarely treats me like shit anymore, but I think that has a lot to do with her not being around a lot. I don't talk to her often but when I do she's really nice. We go to movies together and talk a lot whenever she's home from college. Every once in a while though, she'll snap and everything will go back to when we were kids. Sometimes I snap too. I've said things that I regret, and I know my sister has too.\n\nI know my sister really wants to be on good terms, but I don't care to. I really couldn't care less if I don't see her for another 5 years. I still do care about her since she's my sister, but I really don't like her. It's a big point of contention in our family. Whenever my sister is around, problems start popping up left and right. My mom says it's because I'm holding onto a grudge. \n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I sometimes scare my gf for fun and to be closer. Closer as in more cuddly or affectionate. Like when you see a scary movie with someone and they sort of cling to you. I find it very cute and i like the intimacy.\n\nSometimes ill send her innocent looking videos with jumpscares. Sometimes ill hide around corners and when she passes ill jump out and \"spook her\". Or other times at night when she thinks im not home ill go in our backyard and tap on our bedroom window. She laughs it off but after the fact she will definitely cling to me like in a movie theater and we're generally much more intimate.\n\nThe point of contention is in my latest spook where ive been using a no caller prank app to call her phone and leave creepy messages and sounds. Like either just breathing or saying i can see you. She first asked if i was doing it when she started getting the messages because of my past pranks.\n\nI wanted the prank to last longer so i lied and said no and kept up the calls for two more days, telling her her name and address. She was pretty freaked and was going to call the cops until i told her it was me.\n\nShes angry now because i lied but i think its pretty much just a harmless prank, maybe a little overboard with how long it was but harmless.

      "title": "AITA For not wanting to share my food with my girlfriend?",
      "description": "My girlfriend (20F) and I (25F) are living in an apartment together and have been for a few months now. When I first moved in, I had to travel very far from where I lived with no job set up and a couple hundred in savings. I ended up not being able to find gainful employment, working odd jobs and bad hours for some time. For a while I had so little money I ate either rice and beans for a few days or did not eat at all. I did not ask her directly for food, but I did complain about the lack of it I had been eating. She fed me a handful of times, always choosing to buy me take out from a pricey restaurant, when I would have accepted any meal from anywhere. I figured she should have bought food from the grocery store and made it or have me make it because it would have been cheaper, but I kept my mouth closed because beggars can't be choosers, right? Eventually I found good, steady work, but not before I had to have her front me 2 months worth of rent, to pay my half. Last month, I finished paying her back, so we are even, but now our situation has changed a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has started going to school, and is going full time while also trying to working part time. I say trying, because despite setting an alarm for 6 or 7 every morning to go to work before school, she turns off the alarm and goes to sleep until about 9am when she will then get up and get ready for school and skip work altogether (She is not in danger or losing her job, her bosses know the situation and are OK with her not showing up). Because of this lack of work, she is now struggling financially and often cannot afford to feed herself a healthy and stable diet, since she spends what little money she has on juul pods (and often a new Juul, too, because she loses them so frequently), cigarettes and gas for school and work. She also is planning on asking me to pay her half of the rent this month, meaning she would later owe me money (We've already discussed this and I agreed it makes sense, because we do HAVE to pay rent)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem I have been having is that she often eats the food I buy (she always asks first but I have a hard time saying no) and I will often buy food for a meal, cook it for myself intending it to be my meal for a few days so I can save money, but she will eat that, too. My problem is, I am making myself a pot roast tonight and I spent quite a bit of money on the materials (chuck roast is PRICEY) and I was hoping to be able to eat the whole thing over a few days. I preemptively asked her to not eat any of it, because its a nice treat for myself and it cost some money. She got a little upset and said its fair, but wishes I would share with her because she would share with me if I were in that situation. AITA for standing my ground and not sharing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the very long post. Happy to answer any questions to clarify any parts.",

After checking the payments on the website it seems that sheâs skipped a payment or two without saying anything and I didnât know because my credit had been paying it.  Fast forward to today I get an email that says our full rent amount is due on the 1st(it should only be half because this is the last month of my 6). I ask her if sheâll be able to pay her half of the electric in addition to the full rent amount. She said that she could do electric but rent was questionable. Our landlord is very textbook and does not provide any leeway in regards to filing for eviction. Paying the full amount would be giving her another free month with no guarantee that sheâll be able to pay in the future. Itâll be the first month of the year and the school semester starts midway through it, so I know it would suck to be put out, but it also sucks to have to shell out money for someone elseâs responsibility",

      "description": "My close friend invited me to Disney for her birthday with a few friends. She initially asked me to come and \"take pictures of her and her friends because she knows i'm a good photographer\". Okay. Sure. But she didn't want to squish 5 people in one car, so I volunteered to take my own car and drive down, 4 hours, alone. \n\nI got there before them to eat lunch at a hotel on property. I was suppose to meet them at the actual theme park when they arrive. My friend turned her \"Find my friend\" location on so I can see where they are. \n\nI saw they were close to the exit, and I realized it would be dumb to take 2 cars to the park itself, and then to try and find them and meetup with them in a busy theme park would've been a little hectic. So I asked her if she could just pick me up on their way and I can go with them and we can all arrive together.\n\nShe lied and said \"Oh we're almost there! See you there!\". I checked her location, they were still on the highway, and still had to pass the hotel where I was. I called her out on it, she said it would be \"out of the way\" to pick me up. Another lie. I literally send her the google maps directions from her location to the park, proving I was on the way. She then said it would \"take too much time from the day\". I still don't know why she didn't want to just pick me up.\n\nBut she fucking bitched at me for \"trying to ruin her day\". She called me selfish, told me i'm inconsiderate, told me it's not a big deal to just drive my own car to the park. This incident happened a few months ago and was the start of just total hostility towards me from this group, and I can pinpoint it back to this incident.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out, was I really the asshole? I know it was last minute to ask them to pick me up, for that, okay maybe i'm an asshole? But why was it such a huge deal?",

      "description": "Me and my ex dated for most of uni until final exams. It was all going really well until during exams I noticed my best friend started becoming distant. I pointed this out to my ex (still my girlfriend at the time) because I was having mental health issues to do with uni stress and was looking for someone to vent to. (Before I go on Iâd like to clarify that my ex has a history of mental health issues and I had always been nothing but supportive and helpful) My ex responded by telling me that she thought I was imagining it and nothing was wrong. During this time my ex and my best friend had also been getting closer friends to each other. Eventually It gets to the point where my former best friend is requesting I not be invited to parties and group hangouts because he didnât like having couples around him because heâd recently had a bad breakup. (He was still inviting my girlfriend to these parties though) at this point  the situation was getting pretty bad so I asked my girlfriend if sheâd stay away from him because he was treating me like this and I think heâs trying to get to her, this did nothing but piss her off and so nothing changed.\n\nCut to a party about a week later. My friend is really drunk and I ask him why heâd been doing this to me, his response? âIâm super jealous Bro, Grace (my gf) is hot af and sheâs super dope. Iâm sorry Iâm being a dick to you thoughâ then he basically passes out. The next day I get home and I tell my girlfriend and she says he was just drunk and didnât mean it. Over the last two months she hadnât been at all supportive of my issues. Sheâd willingly participated in my best friend back stabbing me and cutting me out of my friendship circle, and sheâd claimed that none of it was really happening it was just cause I had low self esteem. So I broke up with her. A week later I see her making out with ex best friend at a party. Later on I ask her if she believes now that he had a thing for her the whole time. Nope, to this day she claims he didnât see her that way until after we broke up. (Theyâre dating now) \n\nWeâd always been friends for years before our relationship and always said that afterwards weâd stay friends. But given what she did idk if I can. Iâve lost all my friends because of that friend and because of her being totally unsupportive I lost her too. Iâm heart broken but now she thinks Iâm an asshole for betraying our friendship. So am I right? Was I the victim here? Or did I overreact to what he did because of his bad breakup, and it was ruined because of my overreaction. \n\nTL;DR: Ex best friend cut me out of my friend group and started an argument between me and my GF of 3 years that caused us to break up only for the two of them to get together a week later and now Iâm refusing to remain friends with her despite always saying I would if we ever broke up.",

      "description": "So, some of girlfriendsâ extended family have gone on holiday, and they have asked my girlfriend and I to housesit their house for them, to which we agreed. Now their house is about a half hours drive away from my workplace. My girlfriend said that she wants to treat this as a holiday, and she took time off work for it. However, as I am quite short on cash, and I feel I have an obligation to my boss as it is one of the busiest times of year in my occupation and he is really nice and lenient with me, I said that I can still work once a week. However, I donât have my license, because I am terrified of driving (working on my anxiety issues, Iâve got medication) and because I havenât really needed it to be honest.\n\nNow that the backstory is out of the way; my girlfriend said to me that she wants no obligations during her holiday a while back, and that she doesnât want to have to take me to work. She said if she had to drive me to work, she wouldnât agree to housesit. I talked to my parents about this, and they said âif worst comes to worst, we will take youâ. I told this to my girlfriend and thus we are now housesitting. \n\nThe problem came a few days ago. My parents said that they donât want to have to drive 40 mins to get me and take me to work, and then pick me up and drive me back to the house Iâm housesitting. They argue that it shouldnât be an issue for my girlfriend to take me, because we are in a relationship and you make sacrifices for each other. \n\nMy girlfriend says that itâs selfish of me to expect her to go out of her way on her designated holiday to take me to work, and that she did warn me far in advance that she wouldnât have agreed to housesit if this became an issue. She also says that if she has to take me, I will have to pay for petrol, because she canât afford it (because she is a bit of a shopaholic but thatâs another issue which we are working on together). This sucks because I am on minimum wage and donât qualify for student financial assistance because of my parentsâ income, even though I get no pocket money and have to pay for everything myself. \n\nMy only other option is walking to the train station, taking the train (which costs money), and then walking to work, all of which takes 2 hours. I have to get back from work too. Thatâs 4 hours of commute for a 4 hour shift. \n\nI donât know what to do. Who is the asshole in this situation? Who should I be siding with? Am I the asshole for expecting this of my girlfriend? ",

      "description": "Throwaway and mobile, so sorry for any errors. \n\nIâm a bit conflicted over this, so I need any input. I graduated medical school last year and I decided I wanted to take a gap year before I applied to my residency program. In my country, you must be a license doctor before you can apply, so you canât take steps as a medical student like in the US. From what I heard, the exam is crazy difficult and only a handful pass. \n\nAnyway, I graduated in the summer and took a part time job for a couple months in the fall/winter because I wanted to save a little money before I went on full study mode and didnât have any earnings. After some time, I quit because I really needed the time to study. My exam is the last week on September. My parents were on board with this idea and so I could save on rent, and I moved back with them. \n\nMy parents are both professional in their mid 60âs. My mom retired a couple years ago and now stays home. I love my mom, but she doesnât do anything. We have a maid, so she doesnât clean/cook or any of those house chores (iâm not saying she should, so donât get me wrong). She loves to go have coffee at her friends or just be on the phone all day. She literally has nothing else to do. I donât have any problem with that, except that she doesnât drive... She knows Iâm studying ~10hrs/day and she asks me to take her to random places. If iâm not studying, I oblige and take her, but sometimes Iâm completely immersed and she wants me to take her.  I know if i do, Iâll be stuck in traffic for at least an hour and Iâll start getting lazy and not study. Every time I tell her to wait a couple of minutes âtill I take a break from study, she flips out and literally starts screaming and insulting me, even though I calmly try to explain to her that Iâm trying to study, but she doesnât get it and starts screaming even more. \nEven though we have a maid, I still have to clean around the house, cook some times, look after my momâs pets (she has 11cats and since sheâs never home, I have to look out for them. God forbid one of them might sneak out on my watch), take my brother to and from school and stuff like that. The other day, she told me that I shouldâve bought her a bunch of clothes from the money I made working. I mean, I bought her clothes, tennis shoes, and everything she asked me to, except for a particular blouse that I couldnât find, yet she overlooks this and berates me for it.  \nI really donât know what to do because i literally never go out because I have way to many things to study, yet Iâm finding crazy hard to study unless itâs the middle of the night when everyone is asleep. I love my mom, but this is ultimately my future and thereâs not a time where she wonât insult me for being busy and not being able to drive her around town. \nSo, aita here? ",

      "description": "Hello! Please read details. So my husband and I back at the start of our relationship told each other the amount of people we had had sex with. He told me his and I told him mine. I only told him the people I had vaginal sex with, but not oral (which is 3 other guys). TBH I just didn't really think that was important enough to mention and don't really consider oral or just fooling around to be sex/included in the number count. \n\nWell we've been together 6 years, married for two and we have a wonderful relationship. I have been nothing but faithful to him and our relationship is basically perfect. I'm very proud of who we have become and how as have grown together and built a life together. HOWEVER, the other night while getting drinks with my friends and him, my friend decides to bring up a story I told her about a guy that I had been involved with a couple years before I met my husband. (One of the oral guys I had never mentioned to him)....well drunkenly, I might add, we start to tell the story. Now my husband has always been super cool about this stuff and we're best friends. It's a super funny story so I assumed he would think it was funny as well. He acted ok when we told him and didn't act bothered. \nWell the next day we got into a huge fight about it because he said I lied to him for 6 years about my number. I told him I didn't include oral in the count and that I didn't think that the past really mattered anyway. He blew up and said that he can't trust me anymore and how does he know that I haven't cheated on him. I told him I have never and would never cheat on him. This was just something I did back when I was a stupid teenager that I really didn't think needed to be told. In a relationship some things are just better left unsaid. He's still mad. \n\nBut basically....he's mad because he said I lied about my count at the time that he asked me....and I personally don't think it matters. Yes I should have just told him every single person I had been involved with...but I also don't think he should call me a liar and say that he doesn't trust me and that I might as well have cheated on him after we have built this life together and we're both in our mid 20s now. I think he is overreacting. I'm sorry if I left details out that you need. Just let me know in the comments and I'll answer them. So...AITA?",

      "description": "For context, my friend and I have drifted apart quite a bit recently and don't see each other as much at all anymore, but when we are together we get on very well. It's simply a case of us growing up and going our separate ways. We still occasionally see each other, but no where near as often as we used to. \n\nSo essentially, I invited him round to my house for a chill and a smoke (you know how it is) and he said he'd come but not until later as he was travelling back from somewhere. He asked if I could pick up some smoke for him and I said of course. He also asked if I could pay initially and said he'd give me the cash when he saw me later, to which I again said no problem. \n\nSo I go out to pick it up (for those of you who have done drug deals before, you'll know they're not usually quick, easy and comfortable situations and they do put you out a bit) and let him know I've sorted it. I didn't even get a 'thanks' in response; just a 'okay cool'. I know this isn't a big deal in any way shape or form and its not an issue worth bringing up with him, but it really gets to me when people who you've gone out of your way for don't show gratitude and I want to know what you guys think about it. On top of that, I'm picking him up from the train station, so it's not just one thing I've done for him. ",

      "title": "WIBTA For Asking My Male Straight Friend Who Has A GF, If He Wants To Date Me (Male)",
      "description": "I have this friend (M 20) who I've (M 21) known for 1.5 years. We share a lot of the same interests, we've had a great friendship, we go to the same college, and he's the most attractive guy I've ever met. I've fallen HARD for him, and I've been very conflicted on how to handle the situation, as he's Straight and has an ongoing relationship with his Girlfriend of 3 years. On one hand I don't want to push boundaries and make him uncomfortable, I really want to respect that straight guys can have gay friends and it doesn't always need to be sexual. But on the other hand my gaydar has been going off constantly around him and I honestly can't imagine he's straight. I've been trying to be subtle, and have been dropping hints for a while that I would be interested in dating him/having fun, but they either go over his head and he totally doesn't understand, or he just kinda laughs it off and avoids providing a concrete yes/no answer. At this point, I think he's using the GF as a \"beard\" as he doesn't want to come out as interested in guys yet, and I think he's into me too.  I know I'd be an asshole for stealing him from his GF, but if he's genuinly not interested in her and just using her as a cover/for sex, is it justified? **Given the context and my \"evidence\" for him being gay, would I be the asshole if I finally went to him directly and confessed my feelings, knowing that he's said he's straight and has a long-time Girlfriend?**\n\n*Evidence for him being gay:*\n\n* In general, just his mannerisms/personality. He's a very muscular, masculine guy, super into cars and all that so he definitely doesn't come off as flamboyant at all. But he's also the nicest kid I've ever me (like WAY too nice for a straight guy) and there is just something about his personality that says gay.\n* **Almost everyone says they think he's gay. My friends, my gay friends, people at school, etc. He's confessed to me that he's very self conscious that everyone thinks he's gay, and he's very annoyed/hurt that people see him that way.** ***Part of the reason I feel like it would be such a betrayal if I was direct with him about my feelings.***\n* He wrote \"I'm Gay\" on his Facebook page when he was 14. It had no comments or likes, so I was like.. that's odd. I asked him about it, he brushed it off as a teenage joke and deleted the post.\n* We were hanging out and smoking at my house, and he starts asking me all these sexual questions like how big my dick is, if I've ever had sex with a guy, do I like giving BJs, is it cheating to have sex with a guy, etc. etc. (I definitely didn't start this conversation) and after a while I'm thinking he's definitely looking to have some fun so I ask if I can give him a BJ and he flips out and professes he's Straight and definitely isn't into that. I don't push it, and he goes into the other room to sleep. I then get a text from him, we talk over text a bit, and then he asked me to come into his room, pull down his pants, and just ram my dick in him. I'm totally unprepared for this response (WTF), and I try to ask him if we could do some other things first like jerk off or bjs, or he could top me but he tells me he's not interested in any touching whatsoever. He just wants me to ram him, no foreplay or anything. Obviously, me being well endowed, and his virgin butthole not being prepared, that definitely would not have been a fun experience so I decline him.\n* He says he's loosing interest in his GF and isn't as loving/romantic to her anymore. Was considering breaking up with her. I didn't even know he had a GF for like a year, he never talks about her or shows any interest in her.\n* He Snapchat Bitmoji is in a freaking unicorn costume\n* He knows since the beginning that I'm gay, but still sends me shirtless pics on snap\n* A few weeks ago a guy on Grindr sent me $50 for my dick pics, and I convinced my friend to send his too for $60 (Win win, I finally got to see them too, and WOW). The Grindr guy then offered us $400 to send a video of me blowing my friend. My friend's response was \"That's a lot of money. But I can't ð\" And I said \"What do you mean you can't?\", and he said \"I can't ð\" Like.. there's a difference between 'I can't ð' and 'no' right??",

      "description": "Ok so, long story short, I've been dealing with (maybe mild) gender dysphoria all my life but just recently realized I'd be classified as non-binary. I thought I came out to my brother and mother (not at the same time) but they both dismissed it like not a big deal but I think that's mainly cause they don't understand what non-binary means or that it very much involves gender dysphoria. So I don't know if that counts as \"coming out\".\nAnyway for the last year I've been having arguments with my brother, every time I saw him. I suspect this has to do with his recent interest on Jordan Peterson although every time I criticize the guy I'm told I'm \"taking him out of context\" and he won't listen to my opinion cause \"I haven't watched a full (2hour) lecture of his\" (even though he made me watch many videos of his but I can usually stand just 20minutes of the guy)\nAnyway so last Christmas it was just him, me and my mother, who usually takes his side cause she has some pretty \"conservative views\". So as always, we got into an argument (I started talking about the Chinese government but as always we circle back to right vs left stuff). So the argument got pretty heated and the last thing he said was what got me good (as in \"made me feel like shit\"). He expressed his opinion on how gender dysphoria is a mental illness (with a mocking tone, as if it  was something obvious) and I said that for people like him, transgender people kill themselves (which in hindsight was kinda mean, I should have said it was for that idea, not him as a person but anyway) then he said he was getting angry and I said I already was. So the argument stopped there and I left really upset. (What if he's right y'know?)\n\nAnd after much thought I decided to stay away from him at least for a while. I came to the conclusion that it's not my responsibility to educate them nor should I stop living my life as I really want.\n\nFast forward to last Friday and my mom invites me to dinner. I thought we were gonna be just us so no problem. (Cause I decided I'm gonna pretend my mom isn't homophobic/transphobic/etc and not touch the subject again) But when I arrived I saw my brother there. I lied about having to go and left, only waving at my brother while leaving. I tried to compose myself and I think I succeeded for the most part, although I cried all the way home (I live alone 15 minutes away). So I thought \"situation averted\" right? Well when I arrived home my mom texted me telling me that my brother says I'm not talking to him and that's why I left\" ( busted). I just told her yeah and that it's not a big deal (it's a huge deal). She told me that really hurts my brother and that  she wants to talk to me about it and I don't really know what to do.\n\nI feel horrible for everything, for my brother thinking that way, for making him feel bad, for even doubting my gender identity. I've been going over what I would say but everything seems like something that would hurt them to hear. ",

My father is about 40 and we have an awkward relationship due to his old school way of thought and my booksmart way of thought. \nThis has been a thing for a long time now, but i feel really bad about it now.\nAs a kid he always wanted to take me fishing and hunting etc. and I never enjoyed hunting and such and always wanted to stay home. Now, I'm still like that as a kid and he is working on my truck. I want to learn how to work on vehicles since I'm your typical music nerd who likes to stay inside and a clichÃ© introvert, however I just don't enjoy it. I know I need to spend time with him but its always awkward when I try to work with him\n\nSpecifically this morning he had to go put a wheel bearing on my truck and I had forgot he wanted me to help. I showered and all and he waited. I then remembered and asked him what he all had to do and said it would only take about an hour. Well, I kindly apologized since I wanted to stay home today since that's all he was doing to the truck and promised to work on the truck with him when he gets the rest of the parts. \n\nI feel bad but don't think I should because I do love my father, its just the generation split (that I blame) for the awkwardness and I do not know a single thing about vehicles other than any other typical person.  Am I the asshole, or at least an asshole? \n\n(This is my first post, if anyone has any questions feel free to ask I'll try to answer them when I see them)",

The problem is -- his visa is apparently toast if he can't get a job after graduation. He still hasn't gotten any job offers, and he's getting nervous that he won't be able to stay in this country once May comes.\n\nSo, last week, he brought up legal marriage. Just on paper. I mean, we wouldn't be marrying ONLY for him to stay here; I do like the guy. The problem is, I don't feel comfortable marrying someone I've only been dating for 3 months. Even if it's only legally, I feel weird. What if our relationship ends during our \"marriage\"? What about taxes, legality? I'm not familiar with all the rights he'd gain after we get married. Plus, my family would flip shit, and I depend on them financially.\n\nAbove all: we've only been dating 3 months, and we haven't even said we love each other. I know it's not a \"real\" marriage, but this is a big commitment, and I feel like it requires a lot of trust.\n\nHe pointed out that I wouldn't actually lose anything, and even if we don't work out, we'll just divorce and he'll go home. Which... I guess is true? We don't have kids, we don't own a house or anything. Plus, it would improve his entire life... I just don't want to do it...

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay for my girlfriends dogs surgery",
      "description": "So a couple of years ago my gf (22f) moved in with me (23m) in my apartment, it is pretty small but OK for 2 people. I work and make decent money but nothing to break the bank, she works in mostly cash-in-hand pub work and therefore doesn't make a lot of money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo about a year and a half ago my gf got a dog. Now I really don't like dogs because I was bitten pretty badly as a kid and had a kind of irrational fear of them. I wasn't scared of the dog she got because it was a small pug. I told her when she got it that I am not looking after it, I am pretty busy in my life and really don't have time or any love for this animal. I really don't like this dog living in my apartment but I love my girlfriend so I don't moan. The thing wrecks my head, the constant snorting and wheezing, the begging for food, the constant need for attention drives me up the wall. I use the \"give a shit\" scale with my girlfriend when deciding which battles are worth fighting, so these things don't affect me enough to argue about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon after she got it, the dog started having health problems. As someone has never owned a dog I didn't realise that these animals had so much issues (I looked it up and its common for those breeds of dogs). Initially I thought its because she never walks the dog and it is stuck in an apartment all day with her, so any illnesses she gets she would give it to the dog. I looked this up online too and its a load of bullshit, essentially the breed of dog has so much issues because it has been bred to be mentally deficient so that they are \"cute and docile\". Thing is honestly one of the ugliest things I have ever seen. The dog has had surgery about 3 times so far and the money involved is insane. I have always refused to pay for them as I don't see it as my responsibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo down to the issue that has me and my gf fighting, the dog needs surgery on its face for some respiratory issues or some shit. She came to me crying saying she couldn't afford it but I said why did you get a dog like this if you couldn't afford it. She called me an asshole for not caring about her dog but I just told her to go fuck herself. She left the other day and took her dog with her, now she is staying in her parents house. I assume she will guilt trip her dad (who doesn't make much money either) to pay for the dogs surgery, she has done this before when I refused to pay. The other day two of her friends were texting me calling me a wanker and said they were going to tell people I abused my girlfriend. I am not worried about this because they texted me so I just kept the messages. But this did make me question a couple of things and what my gf said about me behind my back. Haven't broken up yet but feel it's inevitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally I am just wondering who is the asshole in this situation? I don't know if the dog could die but I don't think it will, still I don't feel it is my responsibility to take care of it. Even though it lived with me for a year and a half. ",

      "description": "Okay, this will make a lot more sense after you've read this (duh).\nSo get ready because I won't make a \"tl;dr\" ;D\n\nBackstory: \nTwo days ago my company installed new firealarms  in our office building. \nIn January we began building a second office complex right besides \nour main facility. That new building has no firealarms installed yet.\nI later figured that you can't hear the alarms from the main building there.\nWe're also renovating the main building (where I &amp; said co-workers work). \nSince Monday the toilets in our complex are being renovated so we can't \nuse them.\nFortunately the toilets in the new building work fine, so we just go there\nfor now...\n\nEnough backstory? Good.\n\n--- Here we go... ---\n\nSo, this happened about 4 hours ago. I was working on my desk\nand minding my own business when suddenly the firealarm went\noff.\n\nAt first I thought: \n\"well, the firealarms were just installed, maybe it's just a minor malfunction.\"\nHowever we took the alarm serious and evacuated the office building.\n\nWhile we were on the way out I noticed that two of my (female)\nco-workers (let's call them Abby &amp; Shelly) were not in our \"evacuation group\". \nI remembered that both of them went to the restroom literally 5 minutes before the\nalarms went off. It takes a couple minutes to get to the toilets in the\nother building so I figuered they'd still have to be there. Since there are\nno firealarms in that new building (and there's only one way out) they\ncould've been in great danger.\n\nThere was no visible smoke or fire, which was good. I didn't see \nAbby &amp; Shelly on the way there or around the restroom so I opened the door...\n\nAbby stood right behind the door and looked at me in shock, while Shelly\nwas washing her hands - she too looked shocked.\n\nI told them without further ado that there might be a fire in the building \nand the alarms went off. I also told them that we have to get out of there.\n\nThey both got very angry at me for opening the women's restroom without\nany warning. And they kept telling me that on the entire way out. They said\n\"there would be consequences\".\n\nWhen we finally got out Abby and Shelly went for a group of other women\nand told them \"what I did\". But the group didn't really understand why\nthey were so angry, after all, I only tried to help...\n\nWe all got to take the rest of the day off...\n\nMoving on...\n\nIt turns out someone left the kettle (water cooker) in the break room on \nwhich resulted in an electric bypass. The kitchen counter and some chairs\nburned down. Gladly the fire fighters stopped the fire before it spread in\nthe building...\n\nAnyways, if you've made it to down here let me know what you guys think...\n\nEDIT: Can't believe this got so much attention.\nSo my boss phoned me this evening and told me \"Abby &amp; Shelly\" spoke to him about the \"incident\". He too told me that their reactions were absolutely insane. He actually complimented my \"bravery\". \n\nThank all of you for responding to this post. That's why I love Reddit.",

      "description": "I'm 28F living with my boyfriend 26M for about six months, dating for two years. We're both very independent so living together was a bit of a bumpy road at first. It's gotten a lot better, but whenever I feel like all our issues are resolved, a new one always seem to crop up. This time it's about toilet paper.\n\nI think everyone knows at this point that women use more toilet paper than men due to anatomy differences. I also am on a medication that causes some pretty unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects, so that also ups my usage. My boyfriend has noticed that the toilet paper is being depleted much faster than he was used to when he was living alone, and apparently this is *unacceptable*.\n\nSo, he wants me to start paying for my own toilet paper because we use more. Sorry, but I think that is horseshit. We make about the same (50k &amp; 55k a year) in a not terribly high cost of living area. We're not balling, but we're very much comfortable. We split household expenses 50-50 and alternate who pays for groceries every time we make a big grocery run. And I just think that it's incredibly petty to single me out over *toilet paper* and make me pay for my own. He likened it to how I pay for all my own D&amp;D and gardening supplies and he pays for all his own audio equipment, but it's not a hobby? It's a toiletry. And I am sure if I looked into it I would find things that I chip in on that he uses more of. It's not like I refuse to pay for his ice cream when it's my turn to buy groceries even though I don't eat it.\n\nSo AITA? Yes, I use more toilet paper than him. I will concede that it is significantly more. But I don't appreciate him acting like I'm sucking all his savings dry with having to buy more toilet paper.",

      "description": "Mobile... etc. \n  I had been living with my grandma but she passed away this new years, and I had been living with her during my college breaks. I was home for the break and working forty plus hours at a high stress job with unpredictable shifts. My uncle (who was the benefactor of some of her property) came in while I at work from a double and began throwing things away, somethings that were even my property. We're talking several hundred dollars worth of stuff and he said he would pay me back. He hasn't done that. Long story short, we got in an argument and he hired me a babysitter (I'm a legal adult) to watch me while I was there. (Fight was about me 'not clearing' my work schedule with him). I moved out and proceeded to be told that he would no longer be be following our grandma's wishes for some property that she wanted for me. \n\n\nHe invited our family members during this argument to watch and they proceeded to harass my stepmom before she had surgery. I told them that I would never speak to him as long as I felt I didn't need too and told them that my uncle had bullied me for years. (Lgbt isn't his cup of 'godly' tea) (he's upper class and I'm not, idk if that matters). I few days later after I left for college, they proceeded to harass me saying that I've split up the family and my grandma wouldn't have wanted this. I blocked all of them and their numbers.\n\n\n Nevermind that half my family doesn't speak to one another. So am I the asshole for going against my grandma's wishes? (It was in the will that she wanted us all to along)",

      "description": "I was trained to leave my shit at the door the second I step onto the dance floor. From the time class, rehearsal or a performance begins until we pack up and leave, Iâm all about work. I canât help but feel like I'm wasting precious time if say, small chit-chat turns into a 3-minute gab fest when we only have two hours to get the choreography down before showtime the next day.\n\nThe choreographer herself is a chatterbox, usually about trivial stuff, but I quickly learned to ignore anything sheâd say that wasnât related to the task at hand. A couple times I even started to engage in these trivial conversations with the purpose of interrupting myself just so we could get on with it (a useful tactic to cut the convo short without being the asshole abruptly cutting someone off).\n\nAt some point we took a couple minutes to block the space with chairs. During this time she was her usual chatterbox self. Then out of the blue, she mentioned that she used to suffer from anorexia. Then silence. The rest of us stopped what we were doing and looked at her. There was nothing she said a few seconds prior that segued into such a heavy statement. Her face was blank, so for a few long seconds, none of us knew how to react. Did she want sympathy? Was she feeling regret? Or was she casually just sayinâ?\n\nFinally someone said something to console her. Then someone else did. I did too, but in a half-assed way, not because I didnât care. But because I was in work mode and destined to finish the choreography. In fact I remember while everyone stood around silent and awkward, I was the only one setting up the rest of the chairs. On top of that, I walk with a very determined, very heavy heel stomp, which in a very small, very echo-y studio, makes me stand out. So I probably looked like the total asshole who didnât care.\n\nI thought about saying something in private to her the next day after the show, but then she mentioned the same thing to one of the dancers who joined us last-minute. Same blank face from the choreographer, same reaction from the dancer. So I just ignored it.\n\nStill, was I the asshole?",

      "description": "Here's some context:\nEnglish is my second language, sorry for mistakes\n\nMy mom is very---ego centric. She loves to be the centere of attention and throw people under the bus when she's accused of something. She has a very hard time accepting any form of responsibility for her actions and doesn't allow me to have any kind of privacy. She'll peek into my room while I'm changing or snoop through my belongings and yell at me if she finds something she doesn't like. She tried molding me into the child she wanted. When i started becoming my own person, she started being verbally abusive. My dad is unaware and thinks we just don't get along.\n\n\nShe rarely pays attention to me or my dad for that matter. She's always worried about what her sisters are doing, despite them all being older than her. There have been times where she comes home from shopping and jumps right on her cell phone, not making me or my dad anything for dinner or even saying hi. My dad works very long hours and it frustrates me she doesn't make an effort to do anything with us.\n\nShe's also gotten into some pretty nasty fights with my dad over the years, all of which my mom started. I got caught in the middle of one a couple years ago and got a black eye. Unfortunately, domestic/verbal violence has always been an issue in my life and nothing will fix it (cps can't do anything), no matter how much they both claimed they changed. I can hear them arguing at night when they go to bed. \n\nI don't know if they're still in love like they claim to be and it's selfish of me to wish they'd get a divorce. They've been married for 17 years, which is longer than I've been alive. There have been times were they genuinely did seem happy, but I'm not sure if i can say that anymore. I told him this weekend when we were waiting for the cable guy to show up that sometimes I wish he was divorced so I could feel less tension at home and we could move a few towns over to escape her family (that doesn't like him and I). He asked if i truly felt that way and I said yes. I've been their child marriage counselor for years. I just feel it's time they do something about their marriage and stop taking it out on me.\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n",

      "description": "This is definitely a much smaller AITA than some on here, but its driving me bonkers. Context: I've lived with my boyfriend for over a year. He owns the house and pays the mortgage on it, but all other bills are split evenly... Except for groceries. Originally the plan was to take turns, which worked for a while. \n\nHowever, its deteriorated to taking quick grocery runs just to grab what we need, and since I'm the one who cooks most often (I eat keto so its easier for me to make the food) I'll typically be the one who gets groceries for dinner that night. Also among my purchases are modified versions of favorite snacks that fit my dietary needs (like Atkins bars instead of regular granola bars, or Halo Top instead of regular ice cream), which are generally more expensive than normal items.\n\nMy problem is that my boyfriend eats all my special foods instead of the plethora of things in the house that aren't keto (example, he has his own ice cream but will chow through a pint of Halo Top). I asked him to stop and his response is that he thought \"we shared things equally.\" I wouldn't mind as much if he occasionally bought these things, but he doesn't. \n\nRecently I bought some keto approved snack cakes online and he immediately wanted some. I told him I only bought coconut flavor (he hates coconut). I actually got a variety pack. He caught me eating a lemon one and blew up about it because I lied to him, and we could have shared but I was being selfish, and that I was being a jerk about my food. I just dont wanna spend a bunch of money on pricey keto foods and have him eat them when he could eat regular food. AITA?",

      "description": "Hi all,\nSo this all started a few days ago when I discovered that there wouldn't be anyone in my house this weekend. I texted a friend of mine saying he could come to my place if he wanted  and he said could he drop acid, I said yeah maybe.\n\nCome Friday, he has invited 2 more people, let's call them J and S, and S is taking acid with my friend, let's call him A.\n\nI realised I had a lot more schoolwork to do for Monday than I thought, and I have major state exams in a week. I told A that he can't hang at my place this weekend, to which he flew off the rail about, saying I can't just do that and that he only needs to go to mine for the duration of his acid trip. I told him calmly that my house is not a fucking drug den, and you shouldn't come if you only wanted to do drugs there. He was telling and shouting. \n\nAfterwards, our mutual friends who were there said they thought I was in the right, and the A was out of line.\n\nNow He is ghosting me and being distant. I an slightly concerned for his growing relationship with drugs, as is our whole friend group, as all his weekend seems to revolve around Is LSD.\n\nSo, AITA or not? He is not usually like this, and I really want to fix this because we are scheduled to go London together soon.\n\n",

I donât really spend money on anything other than rent, car payment, cell phone, and internet. So my mother lives an apartment and is behind 3 months rent. I gave her $5100 to help her pay off her rent and other debts throughout the year. But recently I found out that she didnât pay her rent debt or any other debt. She bought a new stove, washer and dryer and fridge with the money. There was nothing wrong with them cause my other family members are currently using them. Now she constantly calls me saying she needs money to pay her rent even though she spent the money I gave her. This has always been a problem with her once she gets money she spends it on luxuries not necessities. Anyways my family whom I rarely talk to. talk shit on me for not giving her money to pay her debts. I have the money but I donât want her to repeat the cycle Iâve been seeing her get in. Like I want to help her but to throw away another $5100. ",

I confessed to her a long time ago that I have feelings for her, but she responded that she only saw me as a friend.\n\nI have another friend (M46) who is going through a divorce, and has been crashing on my couch.\n\nShe just got back into town, so now heâll have to get a hotel room since Iâll need the couch and sheâll be taking my bed. She got in last night and the three of us hang out and they got into a very deep conversation about his divorce. When I reminded him that he should be looking for a hotel room she said it was too late at night for that and he should just stay here.\n\nI said there wasnât room for him and she said he could sleep in the bed with her, and that it wouldnât be a big deal.\n\nThis struck me as really odd: Iâm going to sleep on the couch while she sleeps in my bed with another man? One of my best friends no less?\n\nShe said it was okay because she knows he doesnât have the same feelings for her that I do, thatâs why he should sleep in the bed with her and not me. She said I was making a big deal out of nothing and to stop being weird.\n\nSo I slept on my couch last night but not really, because I didnât get a wink of sleep. I donât think they did anything, but it was just the oddness of it that kept me up. Is she right and Iâm just making a big deal about nothing??? I really feel like I have to say something and insist my friend get a hotel room tonight, AITA for doing that??",

      "description": "Iâm in my first relationship surprisingly, mostly because I have social anxiety and Iâm very very shy and self loathing, so when my boyfriend asked me out I was elated.\n\nBasically, weâve been dating for a little more than a week since our mutual friend got us together, and heâs really sweet and nice though a bit hard to relate to since heâs popular and pretty confident. I know that my boyfriend has been attracted to me since 9th grade (weâre seniors now) though, so itâs exciting. \n\nThe problem is that, since Iâm shy,  Iâve only ever really had internet friends besides my two decent friends at school. Basically, one of my Reddit friends I got along with really well, and I added him on Snapchat and Twitter, which I only use to lurk since again, I donât really have friends and my school friends and I only really hang out at school and text sometimes. Iâve been talking to him a lot since then, and we share a lot of memes and stuff, itâs fun.\n\nMy boyfriend added me on Snapchat and saw that I had a 267 day streak with my internet friend, and freaked out since my internet friend is the only one actively on Snapchat besides my last snapchats from about 20 weeks ago. My boyfriend asked me who it was and I explained that I met my internet friend a while ago. He asked if Iâve ever flirted with him (and I have) so I said yes, and admitted that weâve mutually sent nudes back and forth a lot. My boyfriend got SUPER mad, even though I havenât flirted with my internet friend at all since weâve been together? I even told him that I have a boyfriend now and internet friend was all for it since he knows how I struggle to even just get friends. \n\nI donât want to drop my friend just because Iâm in a relationship now, and when I donât flirt with him he really understands me still, we have really fun conversations about our similar hobbies and he gets me a lot since he has social anxiety as well. I also know a lot about his life now, his friends, his family, his pets, and crushes and stuff so Iâll feel a bit heartbroken if I end our friendship, especially since I donât know if my relationship will last. My boyfriend however, is insisting that I stop talking to my internet friend since I can just âtalk to him insteadâ. Itâs not the same. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to end my friendship with my internet friend? ",

      "description": "Throwaway account because my girlfriend is also on reddit and regularly checks my profile. :)) (sorry for English&amp;formatting,  Iâm on mobile)\n\nThis is going to be pretty long but itâs also a way for me to write down my feelings and share my thoughts to someone. So if youâre interested: \n\nTo start off, me [17M] and my gf [17F] have been together for almost 2 years. \n\nFrom the beginning we had a very strong connection and the same opinion about pretty much everything. Stuff is great and we genuinely both love each other to the moon and back. We are both each other first bf/gf ever.\nBut since a couple of months ago I donât love her like I used to anymore. And Iâm not really sure why but I will try to explain the small things here. There is no ârealâ reason, just a some small things and a strong feeling to brake up. (Which I canât really explain)\n\nI want to break up with her but I donât know what to tell her because there is literally no reason to break up and I still care a lot about her. \n\nMy gf is the sweetest girl I have ever met and does so much for me that I cannot ever return. I had a hard time with my parents divorce and she was always there for me. \n\nNow why I want to break up with her: \n1.    She is one year younger then I am and next year I will be in uni, which is only about 20minute drive from where we both live (Belgium is a small country) so we can actually still see each other a lot. However I will be living a totally different life in uni while she is still in high school. \n\n2. I (tall dude of  1m95 or 6â4â) donât find her that attractive anymore (physically). I used to be in love with her body, she is very âroundâ you could say in the âgoodâ places and very small (in length). (About 1m60 or 5â4â). This body type used to turn me on like crazy. She is however not skinny, which I previously didnât mind but she has been gaining some weight in her legs and belly recently. We used to have a lot of sex but Iâm kind of turned off by her body as of lately. She is aware of this actually and is exercising and watching what she eats but still, I donât find her body attractive any more. \n\n3. A lot of girls started showing interest in me. I know this is a terrible excuse to say but it is true, before her, I never had a girlfriend, never talked to other girls in a serious way. I am suddenly getting a lot of attention from other girls for some time and I would like to âexperimentâ more in my life before I want a true partner for ever. \n\nLastly I want to say that I know for a fact that my gf still loves me like crazy and will not ever see it coming if I suddenly break up with her. Her friends always tell me how happy she is with me and it breaks my heart to hear that while Iâm contemplating to break up with her for some little stuff she will never see coming.\n\nSo Reddit, would I be an asshole for breaking my 2 year relationship over this ?\n(Sorry if not suited for this sub) ",

      "description": "Backstory, my ex and I were together for 5 years.  She had a dog prior to our relationship.  Once we broke up, she gave the dog to me, because of her busy schedule.  Iâm totally happy with the exchange, I love that dog.\n\nThis week though I was pet sitting my coworkerâs 3 month old puppy who is already bigger than my current 10 year old dog.  I asked my ex if she would be willing to watch the dog this week, so the younger dog wouldnât hurt the older one on accident.  She agreed, but was hesitant because her Bfâs cat is a dick who actually attacked his momâs dog and almost killed it.  She planned to keep them separated.  \n\nOne day before the dog was suppose to be returned to me I get a phone call.  The mom (yes, my ex and her bf currently live with his parents).  Accidentally let the dog out of the room.  My dog has deep scratches on her head and neck.  She was so traumatized that my ex asked me to pick her up and bring her home.  She shook the entire night out of fear.  Her pain doesnât seem to be getting better, so I plan on taking her to the vet in the morning.  \n\nWIBTA to ask them to pay for the vet visit?  I feel like itâs partially my fault, like I shouldâve just kept my dog and the puppy and dealt with it.  But at the same time howâd they not manage to keep the animals separated?  The cat even tore the dogâs food bag to pieces.  Not quite sure what to do. ",

      "description": "I'm about to graduate with my bachelor's degree. I'm actually graduating a year early, so the expected schedule for ceremonies and whatnot has been thrown a bit off. After thinking about it, I decided that I didn't want to walk for my graduation (go through the whole ceremony bit, see some speeches, walk across the stage, etc.). My reasons:\n\n1. I have a final exam the day before graduation, and I have exams semi consistently the week leading up. My apartment lease ends the day of the ceremony, and I'm moving to another city. This means that I can't easily move out before graduation day, but I do need to be completely moved by the end of that day. If anyone has ever been to a graduation ceremony, they know those things are LONG. From a completely practical standpoint, I don't know how I can both spend at least half the day at a ceremony and also have time to completely move. \n\n2. My mom lives several states away and works in an education adjacent job (so May is a busy time for her too). She also doesn't have a lot of money to spare. She would have to find the money and time to come to something that I \n\n3. Frankly don't care very much about. I care about the degree and I'm proud to graduate, but I also don't like my school very much and college has been hard and shitty for my mental health. It'll be good to be done, and I don't need to sit in an auditorium for 5 hours to prove that I made it. \n\n4. Also, I don't want to spend the money for cap, gown, yadda yadda. \n\nMy dad feels strongly about me graduating. He was the first in his family to go to college and it was important to him that he was able to send his kids to college as well, so I knew that the degree in general mattered to him. However, I didn't realize how much the ceremony specifically mattered until I told him about my decision. He called me ungrateful for the time and money he spent raising me, told me to \"suck it up and go\", and said that it broke his heart that I had no gratitude at all. \n\nI understand where he's coming from, but I think that this is my decision to make. I told him I'd be willing to do something else to celebrate (dinner, etc.) And that I get my diploma and officially graduate regardless of ceremony. I'm also hurt at the way he chose to immediately lash back (if you didn't want to spend time and money on me then you shouldn't have had a kid?)\n AITA?",

      "title": "AITA For Feeling Like My Girlfriend (Essentially) Cheated On Me?",
      "description": "My (now ex) girlfriend (Anna) and I had been dating for about 5 months when our relationship started having too many pointless arguments. One day we had a discussion as to whether or not we should continue dating but we were both conflicted because we were still in love despite the recent problems. Because of this, we decided to take some time to think, and planned to meet later that week to make a final decision. \n\nOn the day we planned to meet, I called Anna to see when we could talk and she replied that she was going to a party to get drunk and probably wouldn't meet with me that night. I asked her not to get drunk so that we could talk after the party, and she agreed. But sure enough, later that night she texted me saying that \"The guys at the party say I'm too drunk to talk to you.\"\n\nI called Anna and told her that I felt like she was standing me up, and that if I didn't see her that night than we were done dating. She insisted we weren't over yet and would talk another day, but continued to refuse to meet up. I told her we were done, said goodbye, and hung up.\n\nI didn't hear from Anna the next day but that afternoon a mutual friend called me and told me Anna was \"super depressed and scared.\" And told me I should go to her house to check on her. I went because I still cared about Anna and I was worried about her. When I got there Anna was crying and started hugging me and kissing me and telling me how she still wanted to be with me. She never told me why she was so depressed but I could tell I was making her feel better so I spent the next few days with her. During that time, we hung out, had sex twice, and mostly just enjoyed each others company.\n\nDespite the fun we were having, the way she stood me up when we were supposed to talk really bothered me, so I finally insisted we talk about our relationship. During that talk, Anna never told me why she wouldn't meet up that night, but eluded that something happened. At that point I bluntly asked if she had sex with someone that night, and she told me she did, but not until after our conversation on the phone. (She didn't use protection either) I told her how hurtful that was to me, but that I wasn't surprised because she cheated on her last boyfriend. (Which is true) She got very upset when I said that and insisted she wasn't in the wrong for her actions. I understand that I ended things with her on the phone that night, but I feel like the way she acted like nothing happened when I saw her the following day, telling me she loved me and wanted to be with me, and having sex with me, was wildly inappropriate. Had I known that she had slept with someone else I certainly would not of spent the following week with her. She purposefully kept that a secret so as to not upset me and avoid making me not want to be with her. I ended everything with her after that. So, am I the asshole for feeling like I essentially got cheated on?",

      "description": "Ill try to simplify this. So my ex gf of 4 years broke up with me and I was naturally going through a very tough time accepting the loss.  About two months pass by and I begin to come out of my shell again and I became closer to a friend's ex. It was easy to open up to her because she understood my loss to a certain extent as she had gone through the same a few months prior. \n\nI must stress that I had no intention to move on so quickly, but at some point in time we just ended up falling for each other. It was difficult to resist. Now here's where my friend comes in. Even though he was the one to break up with her, he started acting very toxic towards her because he didn't want to accept that she was done talking to him. He figured that he could put her through a rough break up and then go back to being friends willy nilly in a few weeks. \n\nBecause of her rejection his behavior became erratic around her, so when I started getting closer to her I found it very difficult to tell him about it because I feared how he'd react. One day he asked me to \"force her into a room\" so he could talk to her by force one on one. The dude even had the audacity to say \"I've been having violent tendencies thinking about her lately\". \n\nNeedless to say, his behavior was getting out of control and opening up to him about us was impossible. One day he found out and his reaction was obviously very upset. He doesn't speak to me anymore and has deleted me off all social media. The guy feels betrayed. Some of my friends started acting weird around me since then and some have tried telling me I'm wrong for breaking \"the bro code\".\n\nI want to make it clear that I understand his feelings, who wouldn't feel upset in that predicament. The guy obviously still has feelings for her, but he tried to convince everyone he didn't care anymore. I really didn't intend for it to happen this way, i just landed here after a tough break. Maybe it started as a comfort zone, but it's love or whatever you wanna call it I guess.\n\nAm I the asshole for dating my friend's ex?",

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n(Iâm in mobile so excuse me for the poor formatting)\n\nA few months ago my friends cat  passed away. She loved this cat, it was her best friend of the whole world. Sheâs had this thing for about 10-12 years, it went with her when she moved out from her parents place and everything. \n\nThe cat was kinda cute, small fluffy orange thing. I donât like cats, hate them. Theyâre nowhere near as loyal as a dog, they claw everything and everyone, littler box in your house?! No thanks. I much prefer dogs but oh well.\n\n\nAnyway, when the cat died three months ago my friend was devastated, she cried and cried and cried. A week after the cats passing I asked her if she wanted to hang out but she declined saying she didnât want to go out.  I then asked her the following week but got the same response. A few days go by and I stop by her place, she lets me in and seems fine.\n\nWhen I walked in I saw a jar on her shelf in her living room next to the tv, taking a closer look it was the cats ashes with its name, age and some weird message on it next to a photo of her and the cat. I was immediately weirded out by that, why would you want a dead animals ashes in your home?\n\nShe did get better eventually but it was clear as day that she missed the thing. Well, last month was her 19th birthday and I thought... why not get her a cat? Iâm a good friend and itâll make her happy so she wonât be as mopey. I stoped by the shelter a week before her birth and got a cat that looked something similar to her old one. By the time of her birthday I stopped by her house and her boyfriend was there.  I put it in a box (with holes) and have her the gift. When she opened the box she starts crying. I thought I did something good. Clearly not. She gave the box to her BF and went into her room. It being awkward I left.\n\nFast forward a few days later I get a message from the BF saying how that wasnât cool that I got a cat for her. He said something on the lines that she didnât want a cat at the moment. \n\n??! What? \n\nI told him that itâs not like a person died. He didnât seem to like that answer and told me not to come over for a while. I said I wanted the cat back but he said no, heâs looking after the cat. I paid for the cat, is she doesnât want it then put it back at the shelter for someone who does want it. He proceeded to call me an asshole and a bitch. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for calling out my transphobic friends",
      "description": "Context: So I was friends with these 3 girls for around three years, they were friends long before I came in, and they ignored me/treated me unfairly compared to how they treatedÂ each other, but I always brushed it off. I recently came out as trans to them, and they've beenÂ transphobicÂ and homophobic, 'forgetting' to use my new name and always lashing outÂ wheneverÂ I called them out, listing off their gay/trans friends and saying it's hard to adjust, which I get, but compared to my other friends who take forgetting my name a lot more lightly and apologize and we joke and it's alright. But we were always sorta okay and had big ups and big downs up until recently.\n\n\nWe had to do a group film project with four other people, and two of the girls (let's call them Ashley and Kate) were in the group with me, and all was good.Â \n\nThe first problem was casting, when they gave my role to this rude dude James when he first mentioned that he might be interested in filling that role. The reasons they said I couldn't be that character (ex. I'd smile during a serious scene, Id laugh) all showed up in James as well, but without anyone saying anything.\n\nThe second time I saw a problem was much less serious, but still a bother. We didn't have 'assigned seats' but we'd have places where we'd usually sit, and people mostly respected that. Some days I'd find one of the girls in my seat before I got there, and I brushed that off, but there would be days where I put my belongings there, go do something in a separate part of the classroom, and come back to see that my seatÂ was takenÂ by one of the girls. I'd call them out, and the one who had the most problems with me (let's call her Peyton) would tell me that it's just a seat, and I should move (the other two obviously agreeing). And me, thinking I was overreacting, always did. Whenever they'd go off and do something, and I took their seat, all three told me to move, since it was just a seat, and I would. Small but important detail.\n\nSo fast forward weeks later, filming's done, everything seemsÂ to beÂ calm, I thought \"oh we're done with that, so I won't have to deal with that.\" I was completely wrong and this is where everything basically snowballed.\n\nWe were about to watch it in front of the class, and I was sitting at my seat next to Ashley and Kate for a while, I stood up, and not even four steps away Peyton speeds over to sit in my chair. I walk back, done with what I had to do, and asked her to move, since I thought she was joking around. She pulledÂ the wholeÂ 'its just a seat' thing on me and since this was different from the other times, I argued my case. She wasn't budging so I just sat on the table, since it was before class. She was like \"oh my gOD\" and told me to stop being stubborn. Ashley and Kate backed her up, and I thought I'd lose this time. Eventually, Peyton stood up and left my seat, 'done with my crap' and I was like \"cool thanks man\" and I blink and suddenly James is in my chair. He tries to defend himself saying \"you weren't sitting in it\" even though he sawÂ the entireÂ scene go down. I just kept sitting there, and my other friend offered me food, so I stood up and went to go get it and when I came back James has put his arms over the desk to try to prevent me from continuing to sit on the table. He was on my last nerve and so, after many warnings, I sat on his arms.Â \n\nKate, who wasÂ previouslyÂ sitting next to me just said \"oh my God.\" And left to go sit by Peyton. Ashley was still in place and to the right of James, there sat an empty chair. All four of them were now yelling at me to just go sit in the chair, but I said \"well why doesn't JAMES sit in the chair\" and after refusing to move off James's arms, he moved and I sat down in my chair\n\nAfter class they were all four mad at me, so I just left for my next class. Since I didn't have any other classes with them, I didn't have to talk to them for the rest of the day.\n\nLater on the same day, I was given a pop figure and since I knew Peyton liked those things, I sent her a text saying \"just got your Christmas present!\" since this was in December.\n\nShe texted back saying \"Thanks!\" \"Still mad at you though\"\n\nI sent out a \"why\"Â \n\nHer: \"The seating arrangement you had a problem with. The fact that you have gotten to sit next to Ashley for the past 3 weeks and I want to sit next to her and you flip.\"\n\nMe: \"It's not about the seats.\"\n\nHer: \"You even refused to sit in the seat next to that seat when James sat down\" \"The way you acted about it was childish\" (I mean, the childish part was true, but I didn't say that.) \"What is it about then?\"\n\nMe: \"And it's about you guys not acknowledging what I say and treating me unfairly. And what James did was a jerk move.\"\n\nHer: \"He probably did that to defend me\" (No he didn't, during the entire time I sat on the table he never mentioned Peyton or her being correct) and then she went on about how she thinks my other group of friends (who treat me a lot better and use my name instead of myÂ deadname) werent a good influence and rubbing off on me in a bad way.\n\nDuring this I was out and about, so after seeing that text I went back to what I was doing and didn't look back on my phone for a while. When I did itÂ was revealedÂ aÂ shitstormÂ went down.\n\nIn myÂ group chatÂ with all three of them, we sent memes and joked, but out of the blue Peyton started sending screenshots of our private messages and calling me out in front ofÂ the wholeÂ group chat. I didn't see when she initially sent the pics, so Kate responded \"hey, *my name* is in this chat\" (which I guess means they trash talk me inÂ group chatsÂ without me) and they started talking trash about me in that chat. So when I did read through the messages, I pleaded my case, bringing up all the stuff from before, and I tried to come to a good conclusion with them. After saying how they don't treat me fairly, instead of countering that with any argument, I look at my phone to see:\n\n'Kate: \"Throw yourself a goddamn pity party.\" '\n\nAnd after waiting to see if Ashley or Peyton would say anything like 'that'sÂ not cool' with no results, I left the group chat.Â \n\nThis all happened on the day before winter break, so during the entire break I didn't hear anything from any of them, and for the first week back, we just never talked toÂ each other, despite having to sit next toÂ each otherÂ for 3 classes.Â \n\nA week after that, weÂ sort ofÂ got familiar again, I started talking with all three of them, albeit very light-heartedly, and I thought things were heading in a good direction.Â \n\nNow, two of them have me blocked and I don't talk to any of them, except Kate since we are in student council together.Â \n\n\nNot much I can do now, but I just wanted to know, am I the asshole here?\n\n",

      "description": "Boyfriend and I have been together almost a year. IMO heâs a flirt, but he would say otherwise. He has a habit, for example, of saying âhi, beautifulâ or âhey, gorgeousâ to women. I pointed this out and he basically made a joke of it and was like âWell what should I say, âhi, ugly?ââ And I was like you could just say hi! Or call them by their name if you know it!\n\nHe then goes on about how compliments make people happy and heâs just trying to be nice. He does always compliment people. But I pointed out that he rarely does the âhey [fill in the blank]â thing with men - only women. Like heâs NEVER said to a guy âhey handsomeâ. I pointed this out to him and he was like âwell that would be weirdâ. Ughhhh. \n\nAm I making a big deal over nothing here? Is it too much to ask that my boyfriend not call girls beautiful/gorgeous in front of me all the time? \n\nI should also point out that we are a gay couple so thatâs a big factor in why he doesnât see any issue. Thing is though, I am his first boyfriend. Iâm 25 and heâs 22 and before this all of his partners were women. So I think maybe heâs bi, but I donât know. He doesnât really identify as anything. \n \nThanks in advance for any feedback. \n",

Today there was a group of girls who were very loud and annoying but thats whatever. They were kind of running around and throwing an apple around, which I didnt care, you gotta let all that energy out if you're just sitting in class all day. But then it rolled across the hallway and hit me. Id like to mention it hit me in the balls and I dont think she was aware of that. It was rolling slow so it didnt really hurt but it is an uncomfortable feeling to be sitting there and suddenly feel something tap your balls. Anyway I picked it up and she reached her hand out for it but I expressed my anger by tossing it down the hallway. They went back to playing with it and it hit me again lightly and this time not in the balls. This time I was pretty fed up because not only had that happened but they were SO loud. So when she came over to get it again I set the apple down and stomped on it and it exploded and made a mess. Then I told her \"thats your mess, clean it up\" and she did.\n\nTL;DR  a couple of girls were playing with an apple and it hit me twice (lightly but it was annoying) so I stomped on it and made her clean it up",

      "description": "This is very fresh and something I've been pining all over all day long because I honestly feel like shit how I acted. Thursday night is the big \"party\" night in our college town so a group of friends (all girls and our gay friend) went out to a club. We managed to secure a table in the back which is awesome because we had a place to sit down between dancing as well as set down our drinks.\n\nWe'd been sitting down for about an hour when the most obnoxious group of five or six guys sat down next to us. I can't even describe them because they didn't neatly fit into any one stereotype but they started getting super crude with us the moment they sat down. Some of the \"greatest hits\" of the night were telling our gay friend \"don't stare at my ass or you'll lose teeth,\" telling me \"you'd be fuckable if you smiled\" and finally openly groping on of my other friends. Of course this stretched on for about an hour and they spilled several drinks, screamed, fist pumped, wrestled around like children and were just generally obnoxious. When they groped my friend, I went and got the bouncers who also got the police and kicked all of them out. \n\nAs they were leaving one of the guys came over and literally passed me a hand written note. I told him to go fuck himself. He said \"please read it\" and turned to walk away. I told him again to go fuck himself and threw the note on the floor. He told me that he was sorry for the whole night and turned to leave. I tapped him on the shoulder as the bouncer was behind him and told him once again what shit I thought he was. At that point he left. \n\nAs a joke one of my friends picked up the note and we thought we'd have a big laugh reading it. When we unfolded it, it had two $20 bills also folded on the inside. The handwriting was hard to read but best I can make out it says:\n\n\"Hey I'm so sorry for the way my cousin and his friends acted tonight. I am embarrassed beyond words. I am new to town and don't have many friends so I decided to see what the town is like. I will never make this mistake again. Please treat your friends to a couple drinks on me. PS. I think you have a great smile.\" \n\nHe didn't leave a number or anything so this wasn't some lame attempt to neg or hit on me and I truly think he was just trying to be nice and make up for his \"friends.\" I feel like shit for not only telling him to fuck off but not letting him leave with his dignity intact but also throwing his note on the ground. \n\nAm I the asshole here or did I just react to what I thought the situation was?",

Hooray.\n\nAt the pizza place everyone unsurprisingly started to say, \"OP you have to go next time!\" I just simply responded with \" I really don't want to.\" They kept trying to convince me to but I kept saying no. Everyone continued to talk about snowboarding and it made me super anxious and uncomfortable. I looked worried so my mom called me over.

      "description": "Long backstory ahead.\n\nMy friend and I are both 3rd year highschoolers, everyday our school has a special classes for general work and activities, and that includes class competitions that we're both apart of. What the competition entails is bringing in the most food for your classroom and whichever has the most wins a special breakfast for the class. After all is decided, all the food the school donates is then given to charities.\n\nMy class is one of the two most competitive classes for this, and last year we just barely lost. The most common way to get food is to stand outside grocery stores and request them to buy the needed food. Last year my friend convinced me to do a total of four shifts, I hated it as we were standing in the cold at night for two hours, good cause but it was tiring. \n\nMy friend texted me asking where I was as he was just about ready to do the second, and I had no clue about it due to lack of communication. When I explained that I couldn't come as it was in the opposite direction from another friend's house I was at and too short of notice, he simply said 'Fuck you' and held that grudge for awhile after, ignoring me (The grudge lasted through the rest of the hours he would do until we cleared it up, understanding it was a genuine miscommunication on both parts).\n\nNow to the point, he's been egging me on to do the service with him to get food donations for awhile this year. I haven't said it directly but I have shown I'm not eager to. I'm not in opposition to charity work in the slightest, but it was very draining and cold especially this time of year. And additionally I felt that he was being harsh last year instead of wanting to communicate with me when I was trying to and I'm afraid of it breaking out into drama with him again.\n\nHe said today that if I don't do the work with him, I need to bring in my own groceries to donate or he won't hang out outside of school with me. I can assume this means the silent treatment at school as well for at least a few weeks. I feel the need to state how this charity work shouldn't be used as a punishment against me, but for his own good intentions. I'm thinking of bringing my own groceries to donate, but if I do I want to make it clear that I didn't do it to remain his friend but actually take part in the charity work, not even for some stupid breakfast.\n\nSo AITA? Am I in the right to not want to do hours with him, and stating how I don't want to contribute out of his threats to our friendship? \n\nOr should I just do the hours with him? Am I making too big of a deal out of what happened close to a year ago?",

(Also Iâm on mobile so sorry about formatting)\nIâve been dating my boyfriend for 10 months now and overall everything is great. He has some jealousy and insecurity issues that we have slowly been working on together and he has gotten better. However, something he does all the time (like every time my phone goes off or he sees me texting) he will ask me âwhoâs that?â Like every time. Itâs always bothered me when people do that because my mom did it a lot when I was growing up and it just feels like a small invasion of my privacy. \nThe thing is Iâm always texting the same 5 people. Either my family group chat for 4 close friends that I have had for years. Well, I know many people only do this out of habit and curiousity and not to be intrusive, so I havenât brought it up with him that it bothers me. Anyway, today I get a text from my sister and of course right away he asks who Iâm talking to. Iâm already having a bad day and feeling tired so I almost snapped at him. Instead I took a deep breath, pinched my fingers and said âmy sister, Babeâ. This really upset him for some reason causing him to roll his eyes at me and huff off. I hate seeing him angry at me but honestly I never ask to see any of his messages or ask who heâs texting. This isnât just asking either. If we are laying in bed and he sees a text heâll ask what weâre talking about, look over my shoulder, and comment on our texts. I know all this stems from being cheated on and trust issues in his past but it still bothers me. Am I the asshole for getting frustrated when he asks? Would I be an asshole for talking about it with him? Also if anyone has any suggestions about HOW I bring it up to him in a mature and gentle manner I would love to hear them.  ",

      "description": "A buddy asked me a fairly obvious question and I answer with an  'Isn't it obvious' kind of \"Yeah?\" \n\nWell, he blows up at me and says  \"Fuck off bitch. Why don't you go to your fucking class?\" I'm pissed but I don't know what I did wrong so I leave. I  want to tell him to stop being a dick but maybe he's having a bad day.\n\nWe decide to meet up for a talk. He apologizes for that morning. We go on to talk about why it happened. Apparently  he's been holding a grudge against me for 6 years. I don't even recall this event between us. He had asked me a question and I didn't want to give him the answer.  This pissed him off and he's held it against me ever since. I don't know if what he said was true but he was angry at me.\n\nHe goes on to accuse me of always trying to undermine him. He says that come of my comments here and there are meant to bring him down. He says  I'm not supporting him and that I always act better than him. He calls me a 'know it all' and says that I've never stood by him.\n\nI  have never once, as far as I recall, ever wanted to hurt him in anyway. I have never wanted to see him fail and more  often than not, I took his side even when I disagreed with him in certain situations because I thought that was what I should do as his friend.\n\nI don't try to demean people. I want people to come to me. I want to help people because it makes me feel wanted. So when he accused me of trying to bring him down, it angered me.\n\nWe talk for a little while longer and he tells me he never trusted me and  that he wishes we weren't roommates or in the same clubs.\n\nI feel used. I was just his crutch until he found other people.\n\nI tell him how I feel and how I never once said anything to  purposefully hurt him or bring him down. He doesn't seem to care.  He plays on his phone while I talk. I bring it up and he puts his phone away. As I keep talking, he gives me those \"Ehhh...\" faces. I let it go because at least we're talking. I leave hoping things turn out better.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for giving off the wrong impression? Am I the asshole for still being mad when I think about how he was acting?\n\nI'm eating lunch and while I look through my phone. I find his fb messenger and I see that we are no longer friends. I really want to tell him what a big fucking child he is. \n\nDid he unfriend me after he blew up at me and called me a little bitch? That's not okay.\n\nOr was it when I poured my heart out (I cried a little when I was telling  him how I feel because it just happens. I don't know why.) and tried to  fix our friendship? Did he unfriend me while we were talking and I was trying to explain how I never said anything to hurt him or was it after?  Does it even matter? \n\nAm I the asshole for ranting this about the fb thing to our other mutual friend who we are close to? Should I let his accusations go?",

      "description": "Please be warned, as youâd expect from the title this gets pretty fuckinâ dark.\n\nFor a period of at least 4 years, my relative X (aged 16) sexually abused his younger sister Y (aged 8).  The court convicted X of a slew of offences including rape, forced imprisonment, indecent assault and distribution of pornography to a minor.  After 2 years in a facility for juvenile sex offenders, X, now aged 18, is in the process of being released.  \n\nFollowing Xâs arrest, my mother and I found out that there is a history of sexual abuse on her side of the family that spans multiple generations.  Weâre basically Just Melvin, Just Evil. \n\nIn the 1970s, X and Yâs grandfather abused his son (their uncle).\n\nIn the 1980s, X and Yâs uncle went on to abuse his sisters, including X and Yâs mother.\n\nX and Yâs grandmother was fully aware of the abuse in her family, but did nothing.\n\nOver 30 years later, X was convicted for abusing Y.\n\nX and Yâs grandfather died years ago and by all appearances that branch of the family remains close knit.  Y is now 10 years old and the last time we talked she expressed nothing but love for her brother, X.  X has been welcomed back into the fold complete with a cover story to hide where heâs been for the past 2 years and why he canât have contact with his sister.  The victims of the 1980s have forgiven their brother for the abuse and their mother for covering it up.\n\nI declined to spend last Christmas with my family as I knew X (as well as his uncle and grandmother would be there).  My mother and siblings did attend and had a great time, which makes me wonder if Iâm being, well, an asshole.  Iâm in no way the victim here, and worry that Iâm essentially judging them for having forgiven those involved which is the last thing I want. \n\nAITA for wanting nothing to do with X?\n\nAITA for wanting nothing to do with X and Yâs uncle and grandmother since his abuse and her failure to address it happened decades ago and they have been forgiven by their victims, who are now adults?",

      "description": "I am 22(M) and had just been dumped by my boyfriend (27) - I will say briefly, we left with love and the situation happened due to self doubt on the other's part.\n\nShortly after, I told my friend (22F) about it, and that I would need space and likely wouldn't reply to messages for a while. I felt I needed to say this because my friend suffers severe anxiety and feels as if people hate her if they don't respond.\n\nShe said she was sorry for me and that she understood, but the next day she was texting me various things, but towards the end of the day she texted \"Do you still want to be friends, or are you going to ignore me forever?\". \n\nI had no idea how to reply to that in my current state, so I continued to ignore it knowing she would continue to get worse if I didn't, but I just had no idea how to approach it.\n\nDaily I would get a text pleading for a response, but it just became harder for me the more she said. Texts varied between \"does our friendship mean that little to you\" and \"this is making my anxiety worse\".\n\nAfter two weeks she texted that she tries to support me when I'm upset and then she gets nothing.\n\nI was annoyed at this as it is usually me responding to her struggles, and I keep my struggles private (would share with my then boyfriend, as well as psychologist, as I felt they could offer significant opinions, I did not share with her due to her being overwhelmed by her own life), this move striked me as manipulative, so I responded calling it out, clarified why I wasn't replying and why it dragged on for as long as it did, as well as why I was on social media but not replying (I was contacting a support group for advice, I showed her pictures of this to try alleviate her anxiety) I said it wasn't fair to rely solely on me for her happiness, and that it was unfair to expect me to always be available, when I'm currently emotionally not. I then pointed out she does the minimum, she will just say words so that she can say in the future she supports you, so she can expect support back, at this point she said she was hurt by what I had said, and she won't be seeing me again, and that friends don't get to pick and choose when they are there for eachother, and she again said she always tries to support me when I'm in a bad place, like a friend should.\n\nAfter that we are no longer friends, I am doing better myself but was wondering about my own actions during this conflict.\n\nAdditional info: I live with Chronic pain, my symptoms onset when I finished High School, and this person is the only person who stayed in contact with me.\n\n\nI had been experiencing more physical pain for a few months which the other person knew of, which requires rest and affects my mood and energy.",

      "description": "Hello guys, this will be my first AITA post, so bear with me if I don't follow the traditional format. \n\nSo be me, (20M) who is currently going to Medical school and have a girlfriend you've known since high school\n\nOkay so me (20M) and my girlfriend (19F) have been dating for almost 10 months now and we both love each other very much. We tell each other everything(as I had hoped) and we always have each others back. It all started during around September (3 months into our relationship) when we used to work together (I won't disclose where we worked for privacy.) I noticed that shes been acting different and different around me. After weeks of trying to get her to open up to me, she comes out with saying something on the lines of, \"I used to be a drug addict and I was afraid to tell you.\" I didn't react to much to it because she's no longer a drug addict and I was assuming she was a new person. I basically told her that It's okay because she's a new person and she should just move forward. At the time I didn't realize it but that was the first lie. Fast forward a couple months into the beginning of March (in between that part, she has been begging me to have kids and there has been some shit that I honestly should have left her for but I didn't because I was starting to love her too much, we both agreed to move on and apologize to each other about it) and her nervousness is becoming way too noticeable. Like shes shivering and she gets pissed off way too quickly. I had no idea what could be the issue, so me being the good person that I always try to be, I try to support her and tell her its gonna be okay. To my surprise shes told me that she never really stopped doing drugs. She said that shes been an addict even before shes met me. Its only now that she can't control her urges. Obviously I was upset because she hid something like that for months now and she has been asking me for a child for so long now while under the influence. I don't know about you guys, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that being on a severe drug with a child is not a good idea. She was very apologetic and was crying to me. I've told her I will do everything I can to support her. She has done a lot of things to me, some of them are unforgivable and I honestly don't want to bring it up. This was the thing that finally made me want to break things off. What should I do Reddit? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Should i break up with my girlfriend who has lied to me for months and has been doing some serious drugs that could risk her life and a potential child. \n\n**Would I be the asshole for trying to break things off?**",

      "title": "AITA for not staying at a more expensive hotel, thus \"ruining\" the family vacation?",
      "description": "On mobile, standard formatting apology and all that.\n\nA few months ago, my family (mother, stepfather, brother, and stepsister+husband+kids) decided we would take a family vacation to a popular theme park. I do not know stepsister very well (but i do like her and the family) and this is the first vacation we will be taking together. I made it very clear during planning that my family (spouse and child) would not be able to front $500+/night for a special hotel, but that our price point shouldn't stop others from staying at said hotel as we're all going to end up at the same place during the day anyway. We proceeded with some minor planning and i decided it would be best if my family stayed across the street in a cheaper hotel. I made that very clear as well.\n\nAs the vacation booking is getting closer, my stepsister and parents have decided they would like everyone to stay at the more expensive hotel because it keeps the family (especially the young kids) in one place, and expensive hotel is where stepsister and family/parents would like to stay. I told them i would love to, but we really can't make that work financially. I was pleaded with a bit, but eventually everyone backed off when i think they realized that no, i wasn't just being \"stingy\".\n\nYesterday, i received an offer from stepsister that her family would pay the difference so we could stay in the nicer hotel with them to keep the young kids together. The difference is at least $2,500. I nearly shit myself. $2000 is about what we're paying for the entire weeklong trip. I barely know them. I know they are well off, they've bought my child expensive gifts in the past, but certainly didn't expect this. It's clear this is a \"no strings attached, we just want to have you come along\" type of offer. I stammered a very polite \"oh thank you so much, but we couldn't possibly accept\" type of response and left it at that.\n\nThis morning i get a call from my mother who says \"stepsister said they offered to pay for you to stay at super expensive hotel and you said no, so now we all have to stay at your poor person hotel so the kids aren't separated\" (paraphrased, but know that is the gist of it and my mother is truly an asshole). I explained i was uncomfortable with accepting that much money from them, and that it shouldn't stop the others from staying in a different hotel. She told me i was \"ruining everyone's vacation\" and that i should be ashamed of myself. Spouse says that if the tables were turned, we would offer them the money as well and not think anything of it, so we should accept. I haven't gotten a chance to see stepsister (I'm seeing her this weekend), but I worry she will be resentful for making them feel like they can't stay in the nice themed hotel because we are not as well off.\n\nNow my parents are mad at me, because i'm \"too prideful\" and apparently forcing everyone to stay at the Cockroach Inn where they'll be drugged and kidneys stolen.\n\nAITA?",

She started talking about some people she follows and I went to investigate.

As we were talking about it at our local hobby shop, this guy, let's call him Harry, over heard, and asked if he could join. I tried not to give and answer, but my partner, oblivious and excited to start a new group said yes without thinking.\n\nNow here's the background on Harry, and why I really dont want to spend more time with him than I already do. Hes autistic. The autism isnt the reason why I dont like him, but it's an explanation for his behaviour. Harry gets very inappropriate, and tells really inappropriate stories at the wrong time. He once told me a story about his 8 year old cousins accedently analy fingering each other, with other people around to hear (for context I work in childcare, but I would never repeat those stories).\n\nHe also does some very attention seeker things, for example, placing a book on his head to get us to ask why it's on his head, so he can explain its priceless etc etc. His actions may also drive away the other 2 players, since they were very keen when we were talking about it, but looked very reserved when my partner agreed for Harry to join.\n\nAITA for not wanting this guy in our d&amp;d group for these reasons? I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, so I can understand how hard it can be to control your behaviour sometimes, but I honestly don't want to spend anymore time with this guy than I have to.",

While I stayed with another friend at the bar, Nina and another friend went around, Nina said she wants to hook up with someone, just to win a bet (I already was confused by this behaviour because Nina always said she couldnt just make out with a person she doesnt know, but I still thought: Why not, when she is having fun).\nSome time passed and me and my other friend tried to find the others, when we finally found them Nina was in the arms with a random man and I thought \"Yes, she just won the bet, good for her!\" But then Nina told the whole group thats acutally her boyfriend and that they have met last September and became a couple really fast.\nAnd dont get me wrong, I am so happy for her that she finally found a man that meets her expectations and makes her obviously so happy! I also felt that when she introduced him to me, but I was still kind of sad, because Nina didnt tell me anything (I know she isn't obliged to do so).\nNow I am at the point that I am of course more than happy for them, but I dont want to tell her when I meet someone in the future (it just seems wrong to me now and I defintiely cant explain why).\nTell me, if I am an asshole for feeling kinda sad. I really need opinions on this. ",

      "description": "So, I (22F) picked up skateboarding in the last couple of months. I'm a beginner, so I tend to just skate at a smooth pace on empty streets and sidewalks (without a helmet), nothing too crazy.   Recently, one of my co-workers (who is over 50) said it was cool, but then asked if I had a helmet. I told him I did at home and I just use it when I'm trying to learn how to ollie. He shrugged his shoulders and gave me a disapproving look. The following week, I was at an event when another older guy starts asking me about my skateboarding and my helmet to which I gave him the same answer. He kind of sneers at me, makes a comment how dangerous it is, but I just brush it off.  I lost my cool on the train the other day when some senior male citizen looks at skateboard, made some compliment about it, but then asked how come I didn't have my helmet with me. Frustrated, I angrily stated, \"You old guys need to giving a crap about my non-existent helmet! I'm a safe skater and can handle myself!!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my defense, I was just really annoyed how some people are intrigued by my skateboarding, want to make casual conversation, but then chide me for not wearing a helmet all of the sudden. I don't mean to make any generalizations, but it sounds like these people tend to be older guys that are too nosy and fearful of skating when they don't know me at all. So, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Last night I went on a date with a guy I met on an app who also had a few mutual friends. We got along great and ordered beers at the local bar. During the date itself, we got along great. We had similar college experiences and had good rapport. We told a lot of funny stories about school and life and we had a really good time talking in general. \n\nWe go back to his place nearby and watch my favorite show. I cuddle with him a bit and it was fine, but I noticed he didn't have the best breath. He then makes a move on me and I try to go with it. See, his face was attractive so it wasn't as bad for me, but I'm not super tolerant to bad breath so it was hard to get through anyways. \n\nI had not had sex in months so I decided why not, and we do. The first time was with his shirt on, the second time he took it off. He was more overweight that I thought. Before, in clothes, he looked like the type that was just stocky but in the athlete way. I went along with it and I enjoyed the sensations, but struggled having chemistry with HIM. I felt bad. He also had to take breaks during since he did not have good enough cardio to continue for that long. \n\nI'm a former athlete and my job still requires me to be in pinnacle shape. I have a hard time relating to someone who lets themselves go and have a hard time being turned on by non-athletic bodies for some reason. I've tried to override it and pay attention to personality, ambition, protectiveness, etc. a lot more, like other women do. But I could never get over physical attraction as a necessity. I feel bad about it because if I were a man I'd be labeled a shallow douchebag. \n\nHe complimented me a lot and said how he was glad I came over to spend more time with him. And on one hand I was happy to end my dry spell, but on the other hand, I regretted it. \n\nHe asked for a second round and I said no, I was tired. That was true, since I've worked out for 3 hours that day, but I didn't say that I wasn't feeling it. He said \"please\" and I shut it down again and grabbed my things and left. \n\nToday he asked if I wanted to hang out again, and I said no. I mentioned it was weird he said \"please\" after I said I was too tired. But I didn't know how I should have went about this situation - not being attracted to someone. \n\nAITA for rejecting someone because he wasn't as in shape as I expected him to be? AITA for valuing physical attraction and sex this much in a relationship? ",

Whenever I suggest a date? We go.\nHe is never too busy or else wise occupied. \n\nThis seems dumb to complain about, but it seems like he has abandoned all of his hobbies to come hang out with me, which is sweet but... jesus it kinda feels like he is putting all of his worth into me, if that makes sense? He is so willing to just drop it all to come when I call, I feel a lot of pressure.  He doesnt have any close friends he hangs out with more than 3 or 4 times a year.\n\nAs an example, I casually invited him over to my place tonight, but said \"I know we have a blizzard coming tomorrow afternoon, so please dont feel like you have to, but if you come, bear in mind you getting back home tomorrow .\" And he IMMEDIATELY says \"Yup! Worth it [re. The blizzard]\"\n\nI'm flattered he wants to spend so much time with me, but it's kinda stressful. Does that make sense? I think he has some emotional attachment struggles based on his past, and I want to sit him down to talk about this, but I first want to know if I'm out of line.\n\nSo, AITA?",

The problem is my friend is one of those guys who is to nice and won't be mean to anyone.\n\nWe eventually pushed him out because non of us could stand him.

      "description": "When my girlfriend was in high school, she had a ânegative sexual experienceâ with a âfriendâ that she adamantly refuses to even consider the possibility of it being sexual assault. If it wasnât already clear, from the way she has talked about it, I would have considered it blatant sexual assault. Apparently itâs ânot a big deal,â but she always wants to talk about it preceding, during, and after sex.\n\nIâm so confused because sexual assault is actually *really* big deal, but she is so flippant about it. Maybe I am just misinterpreting the experience, but why would she want to relive and talk about it so much if it were such a minor thing?\n\nBefore we started actually talking about what we would like sexually, she would have oddly specific situational requests. It wasnât like anything too weird, but âas you may have guessedâ it was was an attempt to recreate the experience that she keeps talking about (this was before she told me about the experience, so itâs not like I was too stupid to connect the dots).\n\nObviously that got shut down real quick, but that was when the constant requests to talk about the experience started. I donât know how to describe how wrong it feels to be having a sex with someone while they describe *in detail* what is essentially a story about them being raped as a teen.\n\nEven after putting an end to that, she almost always wanted to talk about the experience at least once preceding/post sexual encounters. Admittedly, I wasnât very communicative, and kind of beat around the bush by saying that I would prefer if we minimized talking during sex.\n\nLast week, I finally told her to just stop, and I that find it really weird for her to try to get me to relive with her the experience of getting sexually assaulted when there are clearly unresolved feelings.\n\nAs you may have imagined, that went over poorly. She spent the whole day crying in a friendâs dorm. We kind of made up, but not completely. Additionally, sex is absolutely off the table for probably a very very very long time.\n\n",

Last time I went over there, I had to move because I was siting next to a container of moldy oranges and it smelled so bad.\n\nBut my main issue is with her kids. She has a 7 and a 3 year old. Sheâs very much a âtv is the babysitterâ type of parent. Whenever they fuss, she just gives them a juice box or those Cheeto balls that come in the barrel. She doesnât change their diapers often enough. I go over and both their diapers (yes the 7 year old still isnât potty trained) are saggy and loaded, and she doesnât change them for hours, even if itâs obvious theyâre crying because theyâre soiled. She doesnât comb their hair, so their bangs just hang in their face and they have trouble seeing. She yells at them and tells them to go away and stop bothering her when sheâs busy with someone. Sheâll use drugs around them and not care, even after they were both born premature and both show cognitive issues due to her doing drugs during both pregnancies.\n\nThis has all really been bothering me lately, especially because Iâm technically a mandatory reporter since I work in health care (we work in an old folks home). I decided to tell my therapist and asked her what to do. She wanted me to give their last name but Iâm not ready to get CPS involved (Iâve seen them do good, but Iâve seen them make things much worse so Iâm hesitant). Now my therapist is upset with me because I wonât give their last name and I regret saying anything.\n\nAITA? I feel like if I wasnât ready to do something about it, Iâm not ready to tell anyone about it. I shouldnât have said anything I feel like but itâs weighing on me so much Iâve felt sick to my stomach just thinking about seeing her at work today. ",

      "description": "This has some background, and happened a while ago but I'm still wondering about it. It might just be an \"everyone sucks here\" kind of situation.\n\nWhen I was 18, I was sent to the emergency room, and later a psych ward, for attempted suicide. Since it was a 911 kind of situation, I had pretty much just the clothes on my back, and my phone. No wallet, nothing else. The day after I was admitted (which was two days after I'd been brought to the hospital) my mom, who I was living with, came in to tell me that I was not welcome back in her house. Obviously, that sucks, because I had no ID, no money, no way of accessing my bank account, and most shelters and stuff need you to at least have an ID. \n\nAfter time passes, I'm released from the hospital. I need my stuff, at least some of it. I remember that there was a window I would crawl into if I forgot my key before I was kicked out, so I go to my (former) home, crawl in the window, grab some things (my wallet w ID and bank card, my passport, some changes of clothes/underwear, etc.) Nothing that wasn't mine, and leave. (It might also be important to point out that I had been buying all my clothes since I got my first job at 13, so she didn't even pay for any of my belongings I took)\n\nMom finds out that some of my stuff is missing, and calls my phone to FLIP OUT. Screaming about how I broke into her property (which, to be fair, I did trespass, but I didn't break anything and IMO it was kind of essential for my survival) etc etc etc. \n\nWhat happened afterwards doesn't really matter, I was homeless for a while, eventually got an apartment, am living a happy and fulfilling life now. But I've been thinking about this for a while, was I in the wrong? ",

      "description": "For context, we're both gay dudes. \n\nWe met around nine years ago when we were still in college and worked weekends away the same place. \n\nI had no idea he was gay until we had to share a bed after a party, which somehow ended in a steamy makeout session. \n\nAfter that, and after we stopped working together, we met around five times in the next five years and all those times but one we ended up having sex. \n\nNearly all contact was started by me. He's a very busy person and most of the times would take a day or two to respond. Also, not all our talk was sexual  most of it was catching up with how the other was doing. \n\nCome two years ago when I finally moved to my own place.  I invited him over and yes, we banged. Since I didn't have curtains yet, wet made do with bedsheets. After the sex, I made an offhand comment, in my mind a joke, about how he had taken advantage of me. \n\nA full year passed. I checked up on him a couple times, but he never checked up on me. Close to one yeast after I moved, I though of inviting him over, and messaged him inviting him over ending with \"I already got curtains ;-) \"\n\nI got from this a long series of messages in which he said that he felt that I only seek him for sex, that I only contact him when I want an easy lay and that my comment of him taking advantage of me harry hurt him in a moment when he was feeling vulnerable and that he had felt I was taking advantage of him and then blamed him for what had happened. \n\nNow, I admit that sex was a big part of wanting to meet with him, but considering that I was the one keeping us in touch and that he seemed okay with it all the previous times, I was thrown off. \n\nI tried to explain that but I couldn't get it through.  He finally left the conversation telling me to show my curtains to someone else. \n\nAt first I thought to wait a full year without contact and then message him showing him that without me making effort he would never keep in touch with me, but a couple months later I decided it would be petty and pointless, so I quietly unfriended him.  I don't know if or when he noticed, and he has made no effort to contact me. \n\nYet, I feel I did something wrong, or at least something that hurt someone I appreciate, but I can't exactly understand what. \n\nSo... was I the asshole?

      "description": "Before this relationship started, I did a few cam girl sessions. My boyfriend new about it and decided to go after me anyways, but after we got serious he said I couldn't do porn anymore. I agreed because I knew it made him upset, and I'd do anything for him at the time. Keep in mind I only ever did cam videos on chaturbate where I just stripped and made mad money. And it was mainly for the money, but I can't say I didn't enjoy the desire from thousands of guys. \n\nFast forward in our relationship and things are going great. I'm under the impression there is no porn in the relationship though, so when he mentioned he gets off to porn I got extremely upset. I didn't lash out on him, I was just visibly hurt by it. The next day we had a talk about how it made me uncomfortable and his response was \"every guy does it\" \"it's natural\" and he refused to ever stop. \n\nSo I told him if he gets to wack off to all the porn he wants, then I get to do cam videos again. He got really offended after I said that and said I was being completely unreasonable. He said he would never allow me to do cam videos again and it is in no way comparable to watching porn. I told him watching porn makes me uncomfortable the same way me doing cam videos makes him uncomfortable. Well if he's giving his sexually energy to random women through a screen, I want to receive money and desire from random men through a screen. He's neglecting me and women like to be desired, so camming is a girls way of fulfilling that. Just like how watching porn is a guys way to fulfill his desires for other women. \n\nI ended the relationship, so I guess he's an ex now. But I still keep thinking about this exchange and don't know if ITA? Also don't think threatening is the right word. It was more of a compromise I came up with so we could both do our thing. It seemed unfair to me that he could dictate what I did with porn but he refused to listen to my boundaries with porn. ",

When I ask her why she lied to me she tells me it was because of the alcohol, but I don't think alcohol can make you do that without a real reason behind it. She knows nothing about what she did, but somehow she does know that she didn't do anything wrong or cheat on me. I'm sceptical about this, because how can you be sure if you literally know nothing about your whole night. \n\nShe has always been a very loyal and trustworthy person and had no reason to lie about this, since I have been trying to motivate her to go more outside and do stuff with friends. I'm not mad at her for having fun and I want to trust her really bad, but first lying and afterwards somehow coveniently losing all memories about it just seems a bit too suspicious.

TF is a very loud and extravagant person who is sort of an attention whore (she was a little more tame at the time).\n\nHere's when things start going downhill.\n\nAs time passes, TF slowly becomes louder and just more difficult to tolerate. She just screams and yells constantly for no reason. I was sort of tired of her shit. She sort of does tons of annoying shit for attention and I really don't like being associated with them simply because muh clique happens to include her.\n\nOne day, I leave with a friend during lunch and when I come back towards the end of it two things have happened:\n\n1) TF has come out as non-binary\n\n2) TF wants to be reffered to as a new name, which happens to be a shitty pun based off her original name (which the clique made up on the spot)\n\nI respect her decision to transition but I just sort of wait for the name thing to blow over. A day passes, still yells at me for slipping up at not calling her the correct name. After a week, still there. I personally believe she is just doing this fort attention and Im already pretty tired her shit so I go behind her back and sort of talk to 2 extremely close friends. One agrees and believes she is an attention whore while the other takes side with TF and calls me transphobic. I reply with something along the lines of 'im confused' and she says  \"well TF is more confused\".  I don't really talk to her for a bit and we sort of pretend that conversation never really happened.\n\nAnother person is the clique starts yelling shit on the group chat that both me and the first friend are transphobic, because apparently the first friend reached out to her and she responded with the same \"she's more confused blah blah blah\" shit. Nothing really happens, bc I don't really want ot break off from the friend group because I have some really close friends in there.\n\nTwo months pass and one of the people of the friend group and TF show up and ask if I can start using her/she pronouns for a week to see if TF likes them or not. Not knowing the intent, I say no and don't really think much about it. The next day, I found out TF is now female. I don't really like it but ok I'm fine with it.\n     \nsorry i can't continue much more bc character limit. she starts wearing really revealing clothing but I'm still nice to her but I secretly dislike her.",

I love him but I know deep down that itâs just not going to work out, especially because I found myself having feelings for someone else.\n\nIâm always terrible at breakups and I draw out the process way too much. So I want to dump him, and all I can think about is that itâs the day after Valentineâs Day and everyone is going to think Iâm such an asshole. Weâre long distance so we didnât get each other anything and we didnât celebrate but still, culturally, seems like a pretty shit date to do it. The fact that we didnât celebrate yet almost makes it feel worse.\n\nThe worst part is he loves me so much and heâs already at an extremely stressful time in his life and I know this will only make things go much worse for him. Part of me thinks I should wait until his life is more stable so I can be slightly more confident that this wonât throw everything off track for him. Weâve broken up briefly before and it ended with him binge drinking and crying himself to sleep. I donât want to do that to him again.\n\nWould I be TA for ending a 2 year relationship right after Valentineâs Day?",

      "description": "Sorry in advance if this is all over the place!\n\nI've been having issues with this guy I go to college with. To start off, I'm 17, he's nearly 19, and I'll give a brief rundown of stuff happened in the past that half relates to this:\n\n* He constantly self-deprecates, constantly mentions his mental issues, his alcoholism, not eating/sleeping, his apparent IQ of 148, and how heâs smarter than everyone in our group. He drains the life out of any conversation, makes it about him and his woes. Blamed me for his mental issues first time I rejected him.\n* Told me (whilst with someone else at this point) that, when on about crushes I had, that I wouldn't work with them because \"wasn't ready for a relationship\". Then proceeds to try and get with me a few weeks later.\n\nBackstory: Me and him hooked up a few weeks ago whilst he was on a \"break\" of sorts with his now-girlfriend. I got freaked out and mental health just dropped for me, we didn't work out as a couple, clearly, and I've been a little distant to him since, but not greatly so.\n\nOkay. Me and him had a disagreement last Sunday (31/03) about me \"\"whining\"\" about being single despite people having expressed interest in me. I had mentioned I felt like a rebound to him, and he ranted about that to me in DMs. (This felt warranted to me, given he hopped from liking one person who he didn't even know, to me, to someone else he didn't really know and then his now girlfriend). After him being self deprecating again, I told him I was sick of his emotionally blackmailing and manipulative behaviour, which he tried to say he wasn't, he was just speaking his mind (at the same time saying, exactly, \"i'm sure i'll hate myself when i've sobered up a bit\"). This went on for a bit and I had to mention \"you aren't the only one in the group who hates themselves\" and I can't handle things as well as he thinks.\n\nI ended the conversation after that. Haven't spoken to him in person since. I found out that yesterday, when I was off school, that he's called me emotionally manipulative to my two friends, in a conversation that didnât relate to our disagreement. I raise it with the guy today and he said that me calling myself a rebound was emotionally manipulative, and he didn't intend what he said to be manipulative, to which I said intention doesn't really matter, the impact was still there. He won't tell me anything else that I've done to be manipulative, just that, even though I asked multiple times to know where I was being manipulative. Still nothing about it.\n\nSo. AITA for calling him emotionally manipulative?",

But Iâm just  wondering if itâs any of my business, and if Iâm being too sensitive?\n\nTo sum it up, Iâve known that he likes rape, bondage, hentai, and foot fetish fantasies. I donât really care about that, a fantasy is a fantasy. What DOES bother me, is I found out my husband paid $150 for 3D porn of a child actressâ character being tied up and put in sexual situations. Sheâs supposedly âan adultâ in the pictures, according to the person who made it. I feel shocked and disgusted and confused. I donât know what this means.\n\nHe also is requesting to pay a lot of money for fake nudes of a girl he knows. I am so hurt and disgusted and creeped out by this. \n\nHeâs also looking at gay porn and has a fetlife account??\n\nI also found out he pays a lot of money for porn, which whatever, do what you want with your money, but Iâm afraid he has an addiction. \n\nI should mention weâve barely had sex in the past year. This is kind of my fault, but he also doesnât really initiate much. He does complain that we donât have sex enough, but we havenât seriously talked about it.\n\nWould I be the asshole for bringing this up to him? I know porn is highly personal and a fantasy and can be a deep rabbit hole, and I feel like such an asshole for snooping but a lot of this is concerning.",

      "description": "Tuesday night I left work and was heading home around 6pm.  I called my boyfriend who wanted me to come over (about an hour and thirty minute trip by subway and train).  For a second I agreed, but then realized I had parked my car in a day lot near my apt and had to move it.  Going home moving it and getting to my boyfriendâs house would take well over two hours.  \n\nOn top I didnât have clothes packed.  We argued and he blamed me for poor planning.  On this call I also reminded him I had to go home and take my mom to cataracts surgery and follow up so was leaving Wed night after work.  \n\nI also made plans with a friend to see a theater show Saturday night while i was home and asked him if he wanted a ticket.  He didnât want to go.  He said heâd been planning to go upstate to get materials for his van and was planning for us to go apple picking etc. starting Saturday afternoon.  \n\nThursday night he had a boat expo to attend and Saturday morning he was in a clean up party at his boating club.\n\nAnyway, we both got mad, and we didnât text each other.  The next evening i wrote an email saying I was upset with how he was blaming me for us not spending time together and criticizing my furniture etc etc.  No response.  I emailed I love you later on.\n\nThe next day I waited but by late afternoon I texted again a few time.  No response.\n\nFinally I said Iâm worried and he wrote âNot interested in emailing or texting.  You need not worry about me.â\n\nThis happened once before where heâd only talk on the phone no texting.  I know if I call him he will answer.  But why should I have to go by some arbitrary rule in 2018?  He could also just call me too.  \n\nAm I the asshole for not giving in? ",

      "description": "Long story short, after over a decade of marriage, my sibling's partner moved out \"to figure things out,\" and then immediately started an affair, which they are not even bothering to hide. Heartbroken, my sibling, after trying to get them back for a couple months, eventually started the paperwork for their divorce. \n\n\nIt's like a switch flipped. My sibling is full on 'revenge tindering' their heart out. They are super into all the matches they get, and is essentially just bringing home a bunch of new lays every week. \n\n\nThey have split custody of their children and the kids are still reeling from everything that has gone down. As far as I understood, the kids are unaware of the reason for the divorce as well as their parents seeing new people now (they're all pre-teens).\n\n\nI told my sibling to use this time (before the divorce is final) try to take things slow, take stock, process everything that's happened and make the kids' wellbeing priority. Sibling has a strong tendency to avoid uncomfortable thoughts, conversations etc. and has always hopped from one relationship to another (as in before getting married) - I don't remember them being single for any significant lengths of time.\n\n\nI understand the hurt and betrayal they are feeling, but feel that this isn't the healthiest way to deal with their situation right now. My sibling thinks I should keep my mouth shut, they are just having fun, and besides, this is good for their confidence. AITA for telling them to slow it down and focus on  their kids?

      "description": "This all began starting about 3 months ago. My friend (lets call him jerry) Sends me a message on discord asking to play video games. I have no reason to say no, so i start a voice call and jerrys mic is broken. I say: \"I don't want to be in a call, your mic is broken and making weird noises\" I then hang up. Jerry then says: \"Why doesn't anybody like me???\" (he doesn't have the greatest reputation amongst my friend circle) And then i have to go do something, jerry immediately makes some snide remark something along the lines of: \"yeah because playing with (Friend1) and (Friend2 instead of me is soooo important\" And i genuinely have to leave, so i just do and forget about it. Fast forward a week later and he gets in a group call with me and 2 other friends, and he instantly starts an argument about how nobody likes him and how hes being so nice and perfect to everyone. We all disagree, and apparently jerry has been starting drama over the simplest thing for a very long time. (I'm going to spare you the details up until now) And now, he sends me a message about 2 weeks since the last drama and he says pretty much this: \"Hey, its been like a year since we last hung out. Can we please call and play games for a while? Ive been trying to play with you for so long and i really want to be your friend\" And i say this in return: \"I've been trying to tell you not so harshly, but i guess i have to do it bluntly; I do not like being around you because you try to start drama with literally every single thing anyone says\" And he starts going on this long rant about how im a bully for not wanting to be around him, and i keep replying saying that hes the one starting drama, and he keeps saying \"BULLY BULLY\" To me making valid arguments. Eventually, he blocks me (after saying some kinda nasty things) because i apparently am a horrible friend. AITA?\n\nTL;DR Friend calls me a bad friend for not wanting to be around him because he blows everything out of proportion, ends up blocking me over it. ",

I donât know who these people are so why should I listen to what they have to say I donât do it rudely I just say sorry Iâve gotta go and then walk away.

      "title": "AITA for being upset at seeing my fiancÃ©e making out with my friend to \"say goodbye\"?",
      "description": "Everyone at this party was ~24. New Year's at my friends was winding down and some couples started swinging. My friend's boyfriend went upstairs to have sex with the host. Friend became chummy with someone's husband, and were intimately snuggling on the couch. I was around to witness this because I was mopping the host's house (the floors were disgusting).Â \n\n\nIt became time to leave, so I kissed (cheek-to-cheek, how I often say \"hi\" and \"bye\") my friend and the guy she was with on the loveseat. Grabbed my belongings, and walked past my fiancÃ©e on top of these two as she was saying goodbye. I spanked her as I walked by because her ass was in the air and it's sorta a way to say \"let's get going.\"Â \n\n\nI step outside and begin getting my car ready to leave and about 1.5 minutes later, my fiancÃ©e has not yet come outside. I walk back inside to see her still on top of these two, but I hear kissing. I walk over to see her making out with my friend.Â \n\n\nTo be honest, I was repulsed. The guy my friend was with was greasy and disgusting, and I see my fiancÃ©e on top of him, making out with the girl in his arms, his hand on her leg and his face inches away from them as he watches them snog. I was speechless, and pulled out my phone to take a picture. I felt like I wanted her to see what I saw. I had left the flash on, though, so the initial flash (not the flash for the picture) caught my fiancÃ©es attention and she looked up. I nervously dropped my phone when the actual picture took, so in a way I'm thankful that I didn't end up with a picture of this scene I have cemented in my memory. It made me very upset, and I just walked away speechless.Â \n\n\nSome important INFO: my fiancÃ©e and I have been together 8 years, and we have had threesomes and foursomes in the past. However, we have a very clear understanding that we do those things together. I've turned down other people's advances with \"sorry, I can't do that without my girlfriend here.\" I think a lot of this pain I felt stems from the fact that she did this without knowing I was present.\n\n\nFiancÃ©e claims it just happened, and that my friend started the situation. She was also rather drunk and emotional when the situation occurred. She claims it meant nothing, and I completely agree. I know it didn't \"mean\" anything, but to me she engaged in sexual behavior with someone without my presence. Insult to injury that the slimeball guy she was on top of was (of course) rather into and enjoying what was happening between the two women on top of him. I hate knowing she gave him a show.\n\n\nI understand that society sees two women kissing as more socially acceptable than two guys, but I can't help but feel bitter that, had our roles been reversed, it would not have been acceptable at all. We're both bisexual, so this situation happening between me and another guy would not be crazy. But since it's between two girls I'm supposed to enjoy it and be happy about it. That makes me bitter about this as well.Â \n\n\nI want my fiancÃ©e to apologize sincerely and understand why this has me upset, but she seems to believe that it's not fair for me to place any blame on her for this situation. Ultimately, I know this doesn't matter. It really was just something that happened and did not mean anything. So am I the asshole for being upset and confronting her about it?",

      "title": "AITA for telling a woman and her disabled daughter to back off?",
      "description": "First off all, I apologise for my use of the term âdisabledâ. Itâs brash, unspecific and general, but Iâm afraid I have a severe lack of knowledge on different syndromes and disabilities and I am unable to specify which disorder her daughter lives with. It does not appear to be a physical disability. \n\nA bit of background: Iâm a customer assistant at the local shop where I live. Iâve worked here for over a year, and Iâm generally praised for my communication skills with our customers and I often receive positive feedback from customers themselves. I like working there and I like the customers (apart from the odd few, but yâknow, retail). \n\nOur shop is very small and only ever has 2-3 people working a shift at one time. This means we get to know our customers on a reasonably personal level. This woman and her daughter come in to the shop often as they live nearby. They initially made a point of getting to know everyone by name, which I appreciated as it was friendly. But they continued to get closer. The mum will come in with her daughter (who is around 24, and a very sweet girl, but is very attached to her mum and will do anything she says), and will say to her daughter âoh look, _____ is working, to give him/her a hugâ. This happens very often and not all staff are comfortable with this, particularly some of the males, but we are all often afraid to say no. \n\nFurthermore, the mum began asking, on her daughters behalf, if we could add her (the daughter) on Facebook/WhatsApp so she could have friends. One of my colleagues felt too awkward to say no and now the daughter messages her 24/7, comments on all of her Facebook posts, and proceeded to find all other social media through her Facebook. She posts statuses saying â_____ is my best friendâ and tags my colleague. The mum will also say âthereâs your best friendâ or even âthereâs your sister/brotherâ to her daughter and point to members of staff, and I even heard her refer to my boss as her daughters dad. This makes the daughter believe she is much closer to the staff than she really is. \n\nHer mum has begun to walk straight into the office at work, which even the customer assistants are not allowed to do, because she believes her and her daughter are on close terms with our staff. We are all far too uncomfortable to tell her no for fear of discrimination. Her mum is also very touchy with staff, for example, stroked my bossâs beard and told him he needed to shave. The next time they were in, her daughter did the same, because she has obviously seen her mum do this and assumed it was appropriate behaviour.\n\nToday, they came into the shop, and told me they liked my hair. The mum asked me if I could come round to their house for a âgirls dayâ and do her daughters hair. Her daughter became so excited and asked for my phone number to arrange this. The mum said sheâd make lunch and take us out afterward. I understand that it just be hard for her that her daughter doesnât have friends, but this is not the way to help her make them. I very so awkward and under a lot of pressure, that I claimed I was super busy over the next couple weeks. She asked for my number and my rota of shifts so she could see when Iâm free, and I finally broke and told her to stop. I said I wasnât comfortable with her behaviour and that she needed boundaries. \n\nShe was angry and upset and Iâve felt guilty about it since, but she makes me so uncomfortable that I immediately become anxious when they enter the shop.\n\nAITA?

      "description": "My brother and sister-in-law just recently had a baby. She was born on January 24th and they are very great parents. My only problem is that neither one of them have a job. The \"job\" they had was a bullshit excuse for a company a friend of a friend made that made them COOs but didn't pay them for 6 MONTHS. They still have no money and are relaying on family or friends. They are just lazy in my opinion. They both left their jobs to go to this \"company\" and then never questioned why they weren't getting paid. They both almost refuse to get a job because of the baby actually being here now an they have had to get money from people to buy them food and pay their bills because of this. On top of this they want to take legal action against the guy for them not getting paid.\n\nI know that the whole family has been on their asses and have been telling them how dumb they are being so I have been quiet and just let them come to me if they need to rant or whatnot without me preaching at them. \nSo WIBTA of I tried to get them to realize how dumb they were being and talked at least one of them into getting a job? I'm not sure what I would say yet (I would keep my cool and not blow up) but I don't want them to feel like no one is on their side.",

      "description": "This happened a couple years ago but it was brought to my attention that the woman is still mad. \n\nMy mom married a guy I hate when I was 17. His family lived in Indiana, and it is about 9 hours of driving to get there. My mom and stepdad insisted we go down there for a visit during the summer I turned 20. I am now 25. I agreed to go simply because I hadnât seen my ânew unclesâ in a year.  \n\nWell one evening my mom and I were sitting outside talking about shaving our legs (not sure how we ended up there, honestly). We both agreed that we usually just do a light shave instead of shaving everything (upper legs, bikini area, etc) unless we are going to have sex. We were laughing about it and my âstep grandmaâ came outside to smoke. \n\nSome info on this grandma. She was already mad at me for not calling her âgramma Karenâ (no joke, thatâs her name). I didnât call her that because?? I was 17 when she became part of âmyâ family. I already had a grandma. She was mad enough to make it clear I wasnât welcome to stay at her house with my mom and siblings. Instead I spent the week at a nearby motel. \n\nSo anyways she hears my mom and I laughing and asks what weâre laughing about. My mom tells her we were talking about how lazy we are and donât shave all the time. \n\nKaren immediately gets annoyed at not my mom, who is married to her son, but at me. She rounds on me, saying âdonât you have a boyfriend?â\n\nAt the time Iâd been with a guy for three years and lived with him. So I told her yeah. \n\nShe then asks me why Iâm not shaving daily for him. I ask her why do I need to? She says I should be trying to look nice for him. I tell her that my boyfriend doesnât care if my legs have hair on them, heâs aware that women grow hair there. \n\nShe looks ridiculously disgusted by me. Sheâs giving me a nasty look and then says âdo you at least make him dinner every night?â \n\nAt this point Iâm nearly laughing. It was 2013 and are you kidding me? Why would I make him dinner nightly? So I tell her no way. Sometimes I make dinner for both of us but no way in hell do I make him food every night. She asks me why not, and I tell her because he is perfectly capable of getting off his ass and making himself some food. \n\nShe says, âWow, Iâm surprised he hasnât left you yet.â\n\nTo which I responded âfuck off karen.â\n\nI ended up catching a plane home the next day because I didnât want to be around her. I havenât seen her since. \n\nRecently my mom told me that Karen is still mad I never apologized to her. I donât feel I owe her an apology. AITA? ",

      "description": "Both of us are 22, been friends for years. She mentioned to me a few weeks ago that she was sexually assaulted in the summer and I was really devastated for her and it was just really shitty thing to happen to women I know. I asked her what happened and if she went to the police she said no and she'll tell me one day. Well she told me last night what happened to her in the summer and basically she was at a party and her and a guy were all over each other all night and they were both very drunk. She said he asks for a blowjob and they go upstairs and he KO's and she still blows him . She said she was very drunk still but less compared to him because she wasn't blackout drunk like he was. After she finished she went back down and left with her friend and started crying and saying she got taken advantage of etc and her friend told her to call the police but she didn't. She was crying when telling me all this and really believed she was taken advantage of somehow.\n\nAfter she told me this story I made her tell me like 3 times so I understood everything and its exactly what I described above, I then sadly told her that wasn't sexual assault and if anything she sexually assaulted him because he was KO'D and she noticed he was and still got his dick out and blew him. She got so mad at me and said it was a few of her friends said it was etc. She stormed off and hasn't spoke to me since.\n\nAITA Here? ",

      "description": "Basically this is how it goes:\nIn Thai class (screw this shit) we have a project to work on that counts for a good percentage of our grade. Since this is a big grade, our teacher lets us choose who weâre with, and thereâs a massive free for all.\nAfter a few minutes, it boils down to me (Siegerkranz) and this dude weâll call Somchai (really common Thai name). The reason why weâre probably the outcasts is that we sort of canât speak Thai for shit (I can to some extent, not sure about him).\nI realize this and think dammit, and I kept thinking about how to avoid this situation. Meanwhile, Somchai just assumes weâre partners and tries to tell me what to do. I try to ignore him and focus on my possible options, which are:\n\t1) team up with Somchai and most likely end up carrying him, although he may be a bit helpful (optimistically)\n\t2) take this one on my own \nI was about to go with number one until Somchai asked me âhey Siegerkranz, can you send me your class notes? I didnât write anything down.â Suddenly, all the alarms started ringing and I was like, âfuck this.â\nI then walk up to the teacher (letâs call her Krit) \nSiegerkranz: hi, I donât have the group \n*Somchai overhears and walks over *\nKrit: oh if thatâs the case, you can work alone \nSomchai: hey wait, I thought we were gonna be partners \nKrit: *looks at me and him* then you two can be partners\nSiegerkranz: actually no, Iâll do this alone *walks off*\nSomchai: wtf, fine, Iâll do this alone too\n\nAnd I thought that was the end of it until earlier today (Iâm writing this at like 11PM). Before I left for remedial classes (we have a lot of those here), my brother told,e that Somchai came up to him and told him how gay I was (wtf thatâs literals what he said) for not partnering up with him.\n\nTLDR decided that bring an idiot alone is better than having another idiot in my hands, and he got upset about that ",

      "description": "So first thing's first, I'm a 16yo \"gifted\" high school student and I've lived with my mom all my life. Since I was a kid, my mom has always been highly critical of me. My weight, my grades, my shyness, everything. She loves comparing me to her when she was a kid, how she got straight A's all the time, how she was a model when she was my age, how she graduated High school when she was 15, etc. I've never heard her say a single nice thing about me. Even when I'd come home with straight A's, she wouldn't congratulate me she'd just ask why they aren't 100s. When I developed bad allergies a few years ago and had constant congestion, she'd always call me annoying and ask if my peers found me annoying as well. I distinctly remember her telling me that I should never tell my friends about my feelings cause then they'll get annoyed with me. This isn't even bringing up her racism, homophobia and transphobia, and the physical abuse I went through as a kid.\n\nMy breaking point kinda came a year ago, when she let my useless brother come down to live with us again... and bring 4 other people including a baby. I won't get into too much about them (read 1st post on here if you want to know), but me and my brother's girlfriend, Gertrude, don't exactly get along. \n\nEverytime me and Gertrude would fight, she'd take her side. Even in cases when I'd do nothing wrong. (Ex. A TV repair man came to the house one day and asked if he was at the right place, I asked Gertrude's daughter (13) if she knew, and her mom got mad that I didn't ask her, then proceeded to gossip about me in the next room. She's 35 btw) I'm sick of it.\n\nLately her newest kick has been telling me to give up in my dream of becoming a vet, or even going to college for that matter. Just yesterday she told me that I wasn't going to be able to make it to my dream Uni because no one would want to room with me in an apartment, on account of how lazy, nasty and annoying I am. \n\nI've told her months ago that I plan on leaving her forever and cutting off all contact with them once I go to college, she and my useless brother called me a selfish and manipulative asshole for it. Even my very supportive Aunt told me not to do it. I want them out of my life and I don't know what else to do. So Reddit, AITA? \n\nTLDR; My abusive mom thinks I'm an asshole for wanting to leave her for good and cut off all contact with her. ",

She looked really hurt so I just sighed and helped clear the table, I did however get really pissed when she shooed my brother away when he tied to help as well. \n\nAfter my aunt and her family left, I yelled at my grandmother and told her that I wouldnât help her clean anymore unless she asked my brother for help, she cried. A lot.\n\nHonestly I regret the way I said it to her, but I donât like being treated like a maid, simply because of my gender.

      "title": "AITA For causing a sickly girl to drop out of college?",
      "description": "I know the title makes it sound bad, but hopefully my side of the story will make sense once I explain it further. \n\nI am a student majoring in Video Game Production at a fancy tech college. This happened at the beginning of my junior semester there. I'm going to abbreviate her name to A for the sake of the story. \n\nThe class I was in required a group of 4 to make a game prototype with 2 working levels in 12 weeks. This isn't an easy thing thing to do, especially when you're balancing 3 other classes. We had to make all of our assets and code, and are not allowed to outsource. I am most comfortable in a leadership position, one where I can facilitate tasks and manage time, so I can help pick up slack wherever needed. I organized my group of 4 before the class started, and was very happy with my partners. All were very hard working and talented, and trusted me as a leader. Our second class comes around, and A walks in. She missed the first class, and our teacher defaulted her to our group. After talking with her, we were happy with it. She said she was an artist, and you can never have too many of those. Better yet, she can make and rig characters! So, we asked that she create a very simple character ready for week 3. \n\nWeek 3 rolls around, and she is a bit behind. She promises to have them next class, after the weekend is finished. We say that's fine. Every 4 weeks we have to give a presentation and update the class on our game's progress. Our teacher didn't love our idea, so A started making weird promises that were never discussed. 'We are going to have platforms the player can spawn while the player is in the air', 'we are going to have some great voice actress do our narrative work.' The rest of our group was just kind of dumbfounded. We had a clear vision for the game we discussed in a group meeting prior that she missed, and none of her promises were included in our ideation nor fit our theme. \n\nAnyways, she missed week 4-6. When she showed up, the teacher asked what was wrong and apparently she was seeing a specialist about health issues a few states away. A promised our teacher that she was in touch with us, and sending us assets. She wasn't. I sat her down and talked to her, she broke down crying and saying she was sorry and going to start helping more.\n\nFinally, week 8 rolled around, and she wasn't there. I went up and informed the teacher of the situation, and said the rest of us were working way too hard to put someone's name on the project who wasn't helping in the slightest. A showed up week 9 and had a talk with the teacher. After class she sent me a few messages describing what she was going through. It sounded tough, she couldn't breath correctly, and asked me to please vouch for her to the teacher. \n\nI didn't. I told the teacher she hasn't given us anything useable in 10 weeks. He was aware of her health issues. After that, A didn't show up week 11, 12, or to school ever again. I felt bad about this, but honestly, if she isn't healthy enough to work then she won't survive our cutthroat industry. And it took us a lot of sleepless nights to make up for the work she never did. \n\nTLDR: Sick girl was too sick to work on our group project, so I tattled to the teacher like a snitch full of stitches. She never showed up to school again.",

He stopped seeing her completely, and we stopped talking completely when she was 6 months old, haven't heard from him since. With her getting older, I decided I want to go back to school because I'm struggling very much financially and it's effecting her. I can't afford basic things, but have been managing to hold on by a thread some how. I decided to pursue child support. I guess he got the notice in the mail, because a couple of his friends have gone out of their way to tell me that I'm not being fair. That \"he doesn't make that much money, we've been fine without his help so far\" and that I'm just \"being a vindictive bitch\" because he has a new girlfriend and they want to move in together. I didn't even know about that, and I truly do not care. This isn't about his girlfriend, and if she makes him happy that's wonderful.

      "title": "AITA For Telling My Cousin's Girlfriend She Is No Longer Welcome In My Home?",
      "description": "This is a question I've been asking myself for almost a year now. The shortish version is that my cousin met his current girlfriend through my ex-partner. She lived out of state and came to visit my former partner a few times while my ex and I were a couple. She stayed with us in the house I owned and shared with my ex. On one of this visits, towards the end of my relationship with the ex, I helped set up my cousin and his now-girlfriend up, thinking it would be a fun breezy hookup for them. I didn't really expect it to go anywhere, given that she was out of state. Still, I gifted my cousin with a plane ticket to visit her, knowing he wanted to travel more and see if it could be a real relationship. She broke things off during that trip, but they stayed in touch. This continued as an off-and-on noncommittal hookup situation for about a year.\n\nAfter my partner and I broke up, I assumed she would be squarely on his side, given their long history. However, things took a strange turn when she flew in to visit my ex at his new place. They had a big falling out, and he was apparently very dismissive of her. She ended up on my porch crying and needed somewhere to stay, and of course I said she could crash at my place. Things picked back up between her and my cousin (who was also my roommate). She extended her visit twice, changing her plane tickets, and ended up staying for almost a month. It was a long stay, but we were all getting along and my cousin seemed happy. I was relieved that she seemed to believe my side of what happened in the breakup, and it meant a lot to me that she wasn't buying the whole \"crazy ex-girlfriend\" stuff my former partner was spreading around. She helped around the house and gifted house plants and other little gestures of appreciation as a guest in my home.\n\nShe continued to come to visit more frequently as her relationship with my cousin intensified. Slowly, things between all of us started to degrade. From my point of view, she became very possessive of him and seemed threatened by me. We went on a weekend trip the three of us, and I was apprehensive of accepting the invitation because I didn't want to be a third wheel and was still having a hard time with the breakup stuff and didn't feel like I could really talk about that or process it around her. It was a really bad week for me, but I bottled it up and tried to just get through her visit.\n\nI went on the trip against my better judgement, she and I got into a huge fight, and she essentially expressed the opinion that when she was in town, she wanted my cousin's entire focus to be on her. She felt he shouldn't even check in with me if he thought I was having a hard day or a tough week. Whatever I was going through could wait until she was on a plane headed back out of town. She also berated me for not expressing enough gratitude for booking the AirBnB we were staying at and said she thought I'd been rude to her all day.\n\nThe next day, I did my best to make up and lighten the mood. I bought t-shirts for everyone and tried to smooth things over. After she left town, however, I didn't really speak to her much after that trip. I felt like it was clear that she thought I was just in the way, just a means to an end. I am not a very confrontational person and don't always have the best boundaries. I felt like I couldn't really bring this up to my cousin, because no one reacts well to hearing bad things about their BF or GF.  I also didn't want to confirm her apparent belief that she was right to be possessive of him by rocking the boat. I just wanted to keep a good relationship with my family/roommate and tried to keep my head down. \n\nEventually, my cousin begged me to fix things with her, because he was afraid she wouldn't visit him again if she and I weren't speaking. I said I would try to make up with her, but that he needed to leave me out of their relationship. There was one more big breakup somewhere in this timeline that seemed final, but when they inevitably got back together suddenly it was from 0-60. She had been planning on moving back to her hometown, but suddenly they HAD to be together. She scrapped her plans to move home, and they decided they were going to move to a different city together instead. \n\nThat's how she ended up living in my house rent free for several months, without anyone actually obtaining my permission. It was less that they asked if it was ok, and more that they semi-announced she was coming through for another visit on their way to their new city. She showed up one day, set up her work-from-home business in my dining room (keep in mind, I worked from home, too, at the time), her side hustle on the living room table, and sort of took over the house. The only thing I had a chance to veto was that she not bring her multiple dogs along, as I have two cats and it's not a big place. My cousin tried to guilt me and manipulate me into saying yes to the pets, but I stood firm on that at least. \n\nWhile they were doing their on-again-off-again thing, I was having a bad year. I was not only dealing with all the lingering breakup crap, I was laid off from my job. By the time she defacto moved in, I was working three jobs to make ends meet. My stress level was sky-high. I was working three jobs to keep a roof not only over my own head, but over the heads of my cousin and his freeloading GF. She never paid a lick of rent. The hostess gifts and help around the house stopped, too. She had quit a very high-paying job somewhat impulsively to make the move, and the implication was that she was too broke to chip in. Every cent they made was being saved so they could set up house in their new city of choice. I didn't feel emotionally safe or comfortable in my own home with her there, but I also felt I couldn't really kick them out. They didn't have anywhere else to go.\n\nEventually, they did make their way to their new city and set up house. However, they left a LOT of stuff on my property, and promised to come get it soon. Over last fall and winter, they did come and get it one car load at a time. At one point, she came through with a moving van from her old home out of state and was theoretically going to get the last of it. She made a sort of half-hearted attempt, collected mostly just her things, and left behind a lot of my cousin's things, claiming there wasn't room in the truck. Mostly it seemed to me like she didn't want to deal with it. \n\nOn all of these multiple trips back to town to pick up their things, they never checked with me to see if the timing would work for my schedule. I'd just get a message saying \"Hey, we're coming on such and such date.\" Dealing with a series of unpredictable drop-ins is a lot, especially when you're working three jobs and have an insane schedule. On another occasion, my parents were passing through their new city and dropped off a big car load of their things, mostly just to help me out. She hid in the bathroom while they unloaded all of it and didn't thank them before they left.\n\nOn the last trip to get their things, months after they moved out, I was preparing to move out of state myself. I had piles all over the house of what to pack, what to sell, what to donate, etc. There were contractors working on the house too, getting it ready to rent. I left a note for my cousin and his girlfriend on one pile explaining that this was the entirety of what there still was for them to collect and that it all had to go, because I was about to rent the house out. \n\nI left the note because I had to fly out of town to a funeral, and wouldn't be there when the cousin + girlfriend came to get their stuff. I left the contractors with access to the house while I was gone so they could finish the job on a tight timeline. I trust them, they're good guys who have continued to work for my family, and my dad was going to be around in case they needed anything. \n\nThe contractors misunderstood the note and thought I'd left that pile for them. One of them took the items (maaaybe $300 value in total) to his workshop. When my cousin + girlfriend arrived, they saw their stuff wasn't there and called me. I realized immediately what must have happened, called my contractor from the funeral reception to confirm, and made arrangements for all their things to be returned. \n\nI apologized to my cousin for the inconvenience and said I was sorry he'd have to come back to town to get everything on the following weekend as the contractor was at another gig and couldn't get away to bring everything back. My cousin mentioned calling the police to file a report just in case, but I asked him not to. The situation didn't warrant it from my perspective, and I didn't want the cops showing up to my home while I'm out of town. I felt bad about how everything had played out, but thought I had it all sorted. \n\nMaybe twenty minutes later, my dad called and wanted to know why the cops were outside my house. I said I didn't know. He went to investigate, and discovered that my cousin's girlfriend had called them, and wanted to report the contractors for taking their stuff. My dad explained to the police officer about the mixup, vouched for the workers, and said the whole thing was a big misunderstanding. The cop confirmed that the property owner wasn't present, that the value of the missing goods was relatively small, and said it seemed more like a civil than criminal matter. The girlfriend wasn't having that, though. She insisted that the contractors must have used my note as \"an excuse to take whatever they wanted.\" Never mind that if the house had actually be robbed they would have likely made off with my television, laptop, camera, jewelry, etc. \n\nWhen I returned home from the funeral two days later, every single item had been returned, and the contractors apologized profusely. I was just grateful ",

      "description": "So I became friends with Sara through my bfJake. Jake and I have been dating basically since we started college a couple of years ago. He has a roommate named Dan who had been dating Sara since the beginning of the year. Dan is who I have my issue with.\n\nDan used to be head over heels for another girl last year before any of us met Sara. Her name was Kimberly. Dan and Kimberly dated a bit but she cheated on him, and always found a way to get him back. However, after Dan met Sara he stopped associating with Kimberly so much. Kimberly kept trying to talk to him despite him having a new gf, and I remember one night him leaving the apartment to talk to Kimberly outside in her car and tell her to stop contacting him because he was with Sara now. I remember being surprised, because Kimberly always had a hold over him, and I felt strangely proud of him for doing the right thing.\n\nRecently Dan broke up with Sara and Iâm not sure why, it had nothing to do with Kimberly I think he just wanted to be single. Sara wanted to meet with me as she was upset and wanted to vent. In an attempt to make her feel less like she meant nothing to him, I said âno, he cared about you, I mean after all he even told Kimberly to leave him alone because you two were datingâ, thinking I was bringing up a point that she knew. Well - she didnât. She had no idea they were still in contact, and that he had apparently hidden it from her. She confronted him and now heâs pissed at me. He says he had told me and Jake not to tell anybody about his contact with Kim (which I do not remember him doing at all) and that I had âmessed with the wrong personâ. I told him it was an accident, that I thought she knew and wasnât trying to betray him in any way. I tried apologizing over and over (this is my bfâs roommate, I canât have him hating me and I do feel bad), but he doesnât accept.  Despite the fact that this info was told to the girl heâd just dumped, and that what I told her about him telling his ex to leave him alone wasnât even a bad thing (Sara wasnât mad she was more just surprised/caught off guard), he is still treating me like a villain and being outwardly rude and cold toward me. \n\nI donât know what else to do. In my eyes it was a mistake and I didnât know I was revealing anything bad, but I did apologize. AITA?",

What's this guy's name? What's that guys name? The app answered correctly for each one, he was still pretty confident the app is fake, but one thing that made the guy a bit scared was when my friend gave him the phone, told him he could ask whatever he wanted but me and my friend already had a plan that surprisingly worked, my friend would write answers and I would stay next to the guy and tell him he could ask the app my questions, and he did, he was now convinced the app was some kind of ghost trying to communicate.\n\nHe was religious and believed in ghosts, he also believed ghosts could murder whoever they want\n\nThis is where I thought of an idea\n\nI started telling him fake stories about how if you ask this app more than 3 questions it would go after you and your family, he started being worried, then my friend, who overheard us, decided he would make the answers threats towards this guy's family.\n\nSo now, me and my friend, intentionally go sit next to him, and we ask the app a few questions, we read the answers loudly so he can overhear us.\n\nAt this point, he started trembling, tears started forming in his eyes, and he just loudly started crying, we started telling him it was fake, but he refused to believe us because he thought we were trying to calm him down.\n\nOur teacher heard the cry, and was dead worried, she asked us what was going on\n\nLuckily our teacher was very open so we just told her everything, she then tried to calm him down but it was no use, he just kept on crying for half an hour saying things like \"I don't want my mother to die\" or \"they can take me but not my family\"\n\nWe never thought it would get this far, we even thought he was just pretending he was scared (cause sometimes the app would just not answer at all) half of our classmates were saying that we took it way too far. So AITA??\n\n\nTL;DR : some guy believed that ghosts exist and could go after people, we intentionally prank him with an app, he believes it and ends up crying\n",

I feel that he strongly prioritized his new wife and her kids who he started dating 3 months after. My two sisters struggle with him too so itâs not just me. \n\nLogically I know he did his best but I just feel so incredibly angry towards him a lot of the time. I find him incredibly domineering, somehow self centred despite providing financially (I know how insane that sounds) and consistently incredibly difficult to interact with. I have limited contact with him for this reason. We were a very close family before she died. Iâm in my late twenties and I feel stupid as fuck that Iâm not more over this.",

Over the course of a year to two years \"Dave\" and I would alternate buying multiplayer games to play together on my account, saving money.  \n\nAbout 5 weeks ago he made a comment, kind of a low effort, offensive statement to someone in our friend group (Ben). Of course, Ben was offended, but Dave was even more offended that his comment wasn't just blown off. Over the following week, Dave went nuclear and cut all of us off, completely changing friend groups, repeatedly asking when Ben was going to talk to him again.\nA week ago I noticed that I never saw Dave on xbox anymore, so I checked the rounds. He had removed and blocked me, Ben and the other member of our friend group, on all social media platforms.\n\nI took away his privilege to my xbox account at that point. I am fully aware that some games in that library were money spent by him, totalling maybe 250 dollars, but that shouldn't give him the right to my full library of 180 games plus the ability to abuse my linked payment method (never was abused). \n\nAITA in this? He and I were friends for about 14 years and he went full nuclear over a comment HE made, that didnt directly involve me at all.",

We only met once, where he left left a rather bad impression on me.\n\nEarlier I saw that he uploaded a status saying, that he needs 600â¬ for surgery for his dog.\nA few minutes ago he messaged me saying, that his dog has cancer. My reply was an, admittedly rather cold, but what am I supposed to say, \"Oh..\"\nWhile he has not asked yet I assume that he will request that I help out in raising the money.\n\nAs stated before, we only met once and aren't even friends. He only has my number, because I used to be and still am bad in social situations and just went with it when he asked.\nHe is mid to late 30s, when we met I was 18 or 19. The day was rather unspectacular aside from me having a bit of a breakdown while I was there.\nHe approached me, wanting to comfort me, I presume, but I knew that would only stress me more in that situation. So I told him to not touch me. It might very well have been too quite to hear, but regardless him hugging me did not make anything better and left a rather bad impression on me.\n\nAfter that day he'd message me every now and then, being very keen on meeting me. It was rather creepy, however he would also have been totally fine with me bringing someone along, as long as I was comfortable. I am really sure that he meant well and had no bad intentions when messaging me after, but him telling me weirdly personal-ish stuff and out of the blue calling me \"little witch\", continuing to do so (/using this ð§ emoji in messages, including his response to my \"Oh..\") after I asked him to please not, just don't make him seem like someone I want to involve myself with.\n\nI do have money to help him out a bit. By no means am I rich, but I do have some disposable income.\nHow a money transfer would be handled I don't know, but I am not interested in personally meeting him again.\n\nI bet he meant well when trying to comfort me and I really give him the benefit of the doubt that he had no ill intentions in asking me to meet. He for sure loves his dog and I really don't want him [the dog] to die of cancer.\nBut due to my previous bad experience I would prefer no contact with him going forward, which supporting him in such a manner would likely entail.\n\nSo yeah. I feel pretty shitty for not wanting to potentially donate to helping a pet stay alive, but I think I explained in quite a bit of detail, why I am feeling rather uncertain about how to act, if he asks.",

      "description": "I'm living with my brother and my dad. Both of them are quite the outgoing type and staying at home without anything to do is rather mind-numbing for them. On the other hand, I'm a super introverted person that has just been recently diagnosed with panic attacks and just general anxiety, especially in public places or around large groups of people. Naturally, this leads to a fair share of conflicts. \n\nMy brother desperately wants to leave the house to do something, while I want nothing more than to spend my weekends relaxing at home. I find school rather tiring and stressful, and so the weekends are pretty much the only chance I have to relax. If we're going around on long road trips and such like my dad wants to, then I can't relax and it'll only end up piling up on the stress I've accumulated throughout the week. I've told my brother and my dad that they could just go without me since I'm totally fine with being home alone. I figured this would be the perfect solution since they would still get to go, while I get to stay home. My dad, however, said that the whole point of going out of the house was so we could spend time together as a family, so leaving me at home would defeat the whole purpose (though my brother would probably disagree since he doesn't seem to mind leaving me behind.) My dad also said that another reason he wants me to leave the house is because he wants to help me overcome my anxiety and get me used to large crowds, though I don't feel that that would be an effective method.\n\nLastly, I would just like to add that my brother is old enough to drive and has his own car so he could probably get out of the house himself if he wanted to, and that I am currently seeing a therapist about my anxiety so forcing me to go out into crowds of people probably isn't necessary.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Hi guys!\n\nTo give some backstory, Iâve been best friends with the same person since we were children. We always supported each other through our own hardships and emotional struggles throughout school, but after some serious outbursts she moved away for a few months. After returning (the month after we graduated high school) she was a totally different person. She was very self-centered and narcissistic. I maintained the friendship hoping that she would become her old self with age.\n\nA side story, I was abused by my high school boyfriend. It took me over a year to come to terms with and begin talking about. My âbest friendâ was the first person I told. She acted sympathetic and helped me through it a lot. I felt like my old friend was back and began hanging out with her more frequently. Then I found out she was in a relationship with my abuser. This relationship began after I told her about the abuse. I was devastated but couldnât let go of my childhood friend for whatever reason. I distanced myself from her because I was afraid he was using her to get information about me, and he would frequently drive by my house when I wasnât home.\n\nThey broke up, and she met her current fiancÃ©. She has barely spoken to me other than to ask me for favors (food and driving her places) and just recently asked me to be her maid of honor. I donât know why, but I just broke down. I cried for hours, and my other friends encouraged me to remove her from my life. I listened to their advice and declined her offer and blocked her on all social platforms.\n\nIâm now starting to question my decision. It has been over a year since she broke up with my ex boyfriend/abuser, and I feel like my random block was unwarranted now. AITA???",

      "description": "I work at a tech company so the employees are relatively young, like 90% are between 25 and 35 (Iâm 30). Recently, a bunch of people have been having babies and going out on parental leave â all fine by me, no issues, to each their own, etc etc etc.\n\nHereâs where I want to know if Iâm off-base: in the past few months, a ton of the people on parental leave have been randomly dropping by the office with their babies. They roll up unannounced with enormous strollers and basically cause a huge distraction â people gather around them, feel compelled ooh/ahh, baby is passed around, etc. We have an open plan office where noise is already a huge problem, and these incidents disrupt the entire floor. During the most recent visit, I saw the two parents changing the babyâs diaper on the floor of the open office, partially blocking the walkway. \n\nI guess my position is that the office is a place for work, and that itâs rude to cause a major disruption, especially unannounced. We have a large kitchen area separate from the working area where noise isnât an issue, so if they really wanted to visit their teammates / show off their baby they could have people meet them in there. I donât have an alternative solution to changing diapers on the office floor bc there arenât changing tables in the bathrooms (because this is an office building used by adults, not babies), but I just feel like I shouldnât have to see actual human shit while just trying to go to my next meeting. \n\nThoughts? \n\nThoughts?

      "description": "Background\n\nAbout 11 months ago, I booked an 11 day trip for my wife and I, using points, to Bali and Singapore. Itâs first class all the way, literally, first class airline seats and the hotels are 5 star. It took me about a two years to earn the points and it was meant to be my 5th anniversary gift to her. We had a daughter a year and a half ago and before she got to big to remember, we were going to leave her with the grandparents for one last couple adventure before she left for university. \n\nIt was also something special for me because I am a huge plane geek and I booked the flights and routes so maximize the chance to experience long-haul flights on planes I wouldnât otherwise fly. \n\nThe Issue\n\nMy wife has Chronâs and about 4 weeks ago started experiencing a bad flare. Like bad! She finally agreed to go to the hospital last week and was admitted for 4 days. It turns out she was skipping medication doses because she was worried about getting cancer. This made me angry but I also understand the fear. There is an increased chance of lymphoma but itâs very slight and it doesnât matter if you take one dose or 10, its the same risk. She didnât believe me when I told her what Iâd read, she did believe her uncle thats a surgeon, who set her straight this week. I digress. \n\nThankfully she is fine. A small meds adjustment, a heavy dose of antibiotics and a âdonât ever do that againâ talking too from the doc and she was discharged a week ago. I am grateful to have her home. I hate an empty bed and I was truly scared. \n\nAs a result of the flare, her doctors are telling her not to travel for a few months (up to 3) until sheâs cleared of any new inflammatory markers. \n\nGiven the way I booked the trip and our insurance, I can cancel and recoup 90% of the fees and taxes I paid to book. \n\nThe Argument\n\nI still want to go and today I asked her if she would mind me taking a male friend instead, who will cover the fee portion of his ticket. My family will still help with our daughter so my wife can have a break as well while Iâm gone. \n\nShe said âabsolutely notâ and we had an argument. No yelling but a lot of frustration. Her point is that it was supposed to be for us and itâs not fair. My point is that I have already booked the time off, it will take another year to find open award space and that she did this to herself by messing with her meds. \n\nLastly, and I would never throw this in her face, but I earn 95% of our household income and I need a vacation! So, yes, I feel entitled to one, even with just a friend of mine. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to go and arguing wit her about it?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my parents to stop tracking my location?",
      "description": "I am a third-year college student (20F) who goes to a college about 1 hour from my parents. Because I have family in the city my college is in, I stay with them over the school year and visit my parents during breaks. It is worth noting that the three family members I stay with are elderly -- one is mentally ill (schizophrenia), one has early-onset Alzheimers, and the other has significant hearing problems.\n\nWhen I was in highschool and living with my parents, they tracked my location via phone. It seemed fair to me at the time. They continued this into college.\n\nMy college schedule (work, school, etc.) doesn't allow for too much free time. The free time I have is usually spent hanging out with friends, usually at their houses or elsewhere. I do try to spend time with them when I can, but since one seldom remembers my conversations, one can't hear, and the other isn't very social, our time together is minimal.\n\nSometimes my boyfriend and I will be spending the day together and I end up staying over at his house overnight. I prevent my parents from finding out by switching my location to my family member's home despite not being there. Occasionally, my family members will call my parents and claim I'm not home. When they hear this, my parents check for my location and start barraging me with calls and texts telling me to go home. When I see them over break, they chew me out for being dishonest and irresponsible, saying they can't trust me and that this is exactly why I need to be tracked. Sometimes I am actually home, my family just doesn't realize. \n\nMy parents told me they \"don't really check\" the locator unless my family calls them and says I'm not home. When I questioned why they don't just tell the people I live with to not worry about me and that I'm okay, they never really answered.\n\nI don't think they understand that I AM being responsible (safe sex only, don't stay over if it compromises my academic studies, etc.) and their berating only makes me resent them. I don't understand why they're doing this. Everyone else I know is able to do all these things and their parents don't track them or anything. I do all my schoolwork, I go to class, and my grades reflect that well. I've never put anything before my schoolwork and I make sure I work hard at what I do academically. I seldom drink, and it's never to the point I'm blackout drunk. I don't do drugs or go to big parties.\n\nI understand that you want your kid to be safe, really. But I don't think I'm a kid anymore. I think they should trust that I can deal with my own life and they don't need to hover over me like this. Where I am should not be their concern, especially if I can handle myself and know how to be safe. I just wish they'd get off my back about things like this.\n\nAITA for wishing they'd stop trying to figure out where I am all the time?",

      "description": "The damage is done and I've already ask but I'm really conflicted honestly\n\nI'm going to see a friend in hospice, it's about a 4 hour trip and I plan on going round trip in one day. Upon telling a mutual friend of mine and my dying friend, she asked me to come pick her up about halfway (but I would have to go out of my way to get her) and she would \"of course throw in gas money\". I said sure and asked for $15 which she agreed to.\n\nI just found out the toll for the bridge I have to cross to get her, a bridge I wouldn't have to cross if I was going right to the hospice care facility without getting her, is $10.50 alone. I plugged some info into a trip calculator and found out for the round trip, gas, highways tolls, and this bridge toll would be a whopping $65. I was going to make the trip anyway, so I'm of course not going to ask her to pay for a big portion, but does half seem fair? Especially considering I was going to make the trip anyway?\n\nI asked her for $30, a little less than half, but I feel like a dick considering I already asked for an amount we agreed on. Is the fact we're going to see a dying friend even relevant?\n\nI know most people use this subreddit to feel justified when they obviously aren't the asshole and you guys should absolutely drag me if that turns out to be what I'm doing",

      "description": "So recently me and my long term long distance girlfriend broke up. Long story short she cheated on me with my best friend of 12 years. When I got back home for a holiday I met up with her, and noticed how damaged  and sad she was. \n\nDuring a night out, she turned to me and told me she thinks she needs help. She had started doing coke and that day had bought a bag, by herself, for the first time. \n\nNow to contextualize this, she had never touched drugs before this, but had been doing this for about 6 months. When I asked her how much she was doing she said about once a week. Which to me, is probably less than the actual amount.\n\nNow I was really worried, so I spoke to mutual friends, and they agreed that she was being very self destructive and more so than we had ever seen. She was lying to these friends and the other ones also live overseas so would not be around for very long (i.e. I had no one who would be around to support her)\n\nSince she had no real close friends living here, and her new boyfriend won't talk to me, I felt like the only people I could tell about her potential issue would be her parents. Also a point about her new boyfriend, he uses drugs, but I know he doesn't have problems with them. I've seen him use for years and always been able to separate himself from the drugs. I was worried her being around that environment will only show her how 'drugs are fine'. \n\nI did so and she obviously freaked out and has mentioned she never wants to talk to me again. I totally understand that, I am just worried that I might have done the wrong thing. I was just worried she was going to destroy her life. I hope her and her family work through this and get it sorted out. ",

Up to this year I've never gone out with friends, been invited to small group parties or have even had friends up to the start of high school.\n\nEver since I got a bf my parents have been making jokes about us, kissed bf and parents saw \"oh I thought you were just friends\"  \" making kissy noises all the time\" \" slightly implied sexual jokes (nothing super serious)\" \" watches movie and with kissing scene ohhh it's just like you and your bf\" ect. This gets on my nerves and makes me anxious. Not only that, but for the first time in years I've been truly happy and myself and I'm scared of a breakup even though my bf is happy he found someone who isnt troubled and can give the emotions he gives back as well. (alot of passionate emotions and respect) \n\nI snapped today at my parents about their jokes that my dad has been making all morning and throughout the day. I've told them to stop countless times now they are angry at me for being so rude. \n\nI dont really stand up for myself because i just get a wall of yelling and self defence. NOT ONCE have my parents apologised when a fight was their fault they are scared to admit they are wrong. Now their playing the victim card. \nSome info about me: \nI'm a good kid, no fights good grades quiet dont talk back or get into trouble, dont lie or stay out late(like I've had any reasons to) and I have a part time job to pay for school lunches, school activities and anything I want to do outside of school. Now I'm also paying for my ow car Insurance. \n\nI'm being told I'm the asshole who can't take a joke (several hundred of the same ones) and that I won't survive the real world because everyone's an asshole. On top of this I'm told I'm spoiled for being allowed to hang out with friends and be with my bf, they haven't said no to alot of things, but they use the fact that they let me do something as a way to scold me when their unhappy with something minor such as dust not being wiped off a shelf every 3 days. I will  acknowledge the fact they yes people have it worse off, yes we are pretty well off, yes they aren't the worst parents in the world and I'm most defiantly the the world's best kid, but am I an asshole for not wanting to be harassed by the same joke over and over again and calling them out for it?\n\ntd;lr : parents joke about my relationship life and I snap and tell them to stop, they play the victim as always.",

His dad is wants to get him baptized in a Catholic Church, and I disagree.\n\nFirst off, Iâm not religious whatsoever. I went to church when I was younger and I always had a hard time believing in God and religion as a whole. I find it really cool that people can believe in something that it has a powerful impact on their lives, but itâs just never been for me. My sonâs dad has never been very religious either. He never goes to church or anything like that, however his parents go to church and all their other grandchildren are baptized. I feel as if he is being pressured by his parents to get it done.\n\nA couple weeks ago he told me he is planning on getting our son baptized. I told him that should be a decision both of us make. He told me that he needs to be baptized and that he knew Iâd disagree. I would never not allow my son to be religious if thatâs what he would like, and Iâd never discourage him from getting involved in church, but I want him to be able to make that decision on his own. I told his dad that if he gets older and he chooses to get baptized then fine, but I disagree with doing it when heâs so young that he doesnât even understand what it is. \n\nIâve asked a couple people what they think and Iâve gotten mixed reactions- some people think itâs reasonable, and others think that Iâm being too harsh by not allowing his father to make this decision and that itâs not even that big of a deal to get baptized.\n\nAm I in the wrong here? Should I just let him get baptized and let it go and let him make his own decision to stay in the church when heâs older?",

      "description": "My SO (54M) took our only truck this morning, even though he knew I was taking the afternoon off to ride my horse. Heâs been working on fixing up a fishing boat he bought. He is self employed and can take time off whenever he likes. Heâs spent at least 20 hours on that boat this week.\nI work for a corporation and have been overworked for sometime. My dad also died in Oct. and I feel tired and sad sometimes. I really was looking forward to getting out on my horse and the weather was beautiful and warm today after snowing/raining all last weekend. \nHe informed me he needed the truck this morning and said I could pull my horse trailer with his work vehicle. He unhooked the truck and took it. He left a hitch on the trailer. \nGot in his suburban at about 1 pm. It had NO gas and the light was on. Quickly drove to town and filled it up. Got home and put the ball on the suburban. It was the wrong one and too tall for me to get the ball under the hitch. Thought maybe I could ride from the house to a nearby arena instead. Nope. Closed for an event. \nCalled the SO three time and no answer. Texted. No answer until an hour later. He had the ball I needed with him. \nIâm seriously pissed and donât feel like even talking to him. Itâs not the first time heâs left a vehicle on empty or taken the truck when Iâve had plans. Just feel like heâs a completely selfish ass. ",

      "description": "Okay, so this happened awhile back but I was recently reminded of it and my rage boiled to the surface. I need some clarity or im gonna be bothered by this forever.\n\nA little background. I had a coworker who, despite having the easiest job on planet earth, was a lazy fuck. Always showing up late for work, always bitching, always putting work on to me. The last part was INFURIATING. I genuinely want to get along with everyone I work with, you see these people more than you see your family.\n\nBut this fuck pushes me to the limit. Like, whenever I have work to do on the weekend, whenever im sick, I man up and do the job. I sacrificed I dont know how many weekends and holidays, yet this bitch was always asking our boss to call me in for help after hours or on the weekend, and I hardly ever complained.\n\nHOWEVER, he pushed me in the worst way. We had a day where I was dealing with 12 separate orders of chemical trailers (im a chemical inspector) and I was swamped with paperwork. This dude had the worst habit of offering to pick up lunch for everyone in the office so he could leave the office and not do work.\n\nHe also hated me and never offered to get me lunch, asking everyone what they wanted but me. Idgaf because I either bring my lunch or I skip lunch to get the work done, since im not a baby that needs to be fed every 2 hours.\n\nWell, on this day when im swamped this fuck comes to me and says, \"Hey Yourgaylol, it looks like you need to head to the office and move 30 boxes of retained chemicals (we were moving retain rooms), I need to pickup lunch before it gets cold.\"\n\nI was silently fuming. I then said, im kinda busy right now. Could we do this later. He said everyones lunch was getting cold. Then, he says that I should have my trainee (oh btw, in the midst of all this im training someone) do my actual job even though hes been on the job for a week while i go to the office to move boxes.\n\nMy trainee, wanting to be a good sport and make a good impression, agrees even though we're dealing with sulfuric acid and benzene and all manner of nasty shit, not to mention the actual cost to the company if 40k worth of product gets fucked.\n\nSo he basically wanted me to let a greenhorn run the show so I could move his boxes and he could eat a warm fucking lunch.\n\nI then said, \"You know what, no. Your lunch is your deal, you need to do your own job\", or something like that. He fucking explodes, and says \"Why are you acting like you dont work here\".\n\nMotherfucker, after all the hours i put into that job you want to repeat that. I said fuck off and went back to work.\n\nThis bitch calls my BOSSES BOSS. Fucking corporate, to tell on me. He says im being lazy and not lifting the boxes. The bosses boss call me, I tell him that captain fuckface can eat a cold lunch and that I personally either bring my own lunch or I dont eat lunch until the work is done. I also tell him its insane that he wanted me to risk my trainees health so he can eat a warm lunch.\n\nHe agrees, and my coworker ends up lifting the boxes. However, to this day he contends that im the asshole because I wouldnt lift the boxes while he was selflessly getting lunch for everyone (except me).\n\nThats the worst part, him thinking I was in the wrong. It drives me nuts. So tell me, was I an asshole?",

      "description": "Recently, my fiancee, A, left after cheating on me. About a week ago I met B online and we've really been hitting it off, including having a successful date together. I share poetry on my snapchat story, just for \\~ a e s t h e t i c \\~, and much of it is poetry I've written about A in the past or I wrote about the breakup. B loved the poetry, and asked me where it came from. I told her I wrote it myself, and he asked what they were about. I gave a pretty vague answer, something along the lines of \"a bad breakup with my fiancee\". She asked me if I was still attached, and not wanting to lie to her I told her yes, but that I wasn't trying to get back with A and that I was done talking about it. She proceeded to repeatedly ask me about it and get upset, so I explained to her that talking about A brought up a lot of negative emotions and I didn't want B to think that I was obsessed with A or that B was not good enough for me. She's relatively conservative when it comes to concepts about relationships and love, and has never been in a relationship, so her stance is that I could never truly love B if some part of me still loves A. I argued that I can love more than one person. She continued to ask me things like \"how long were you together\", \"why did you get engaged so young\", or \"do you still talk\". I've answered each question frankly, usually with just \"four years\", \"because we felt like it\", and \"no\". However, she's unsatisfied with these answers and asks them every other day. Should I give her a deep dive on my entire romantic history, regardless of how much pain it causes me? Or am I the asshole for not telling the whole truth?",

      "description": "**Background:** I have been in a relationship with my current girlfriend for a little over 3 years. For the last year and a half, we have been long distance due to my work and her going to college. I generally think of her as being faithful and I value our relationship highly.  \n\n\nSo my girlfriend told me that her new friend came over to hang out, but ended up staying the night because they were too tired to go home. My girlfriend admitted that the friend asked if they could cuddle, and though she claims to have been uncomfortable with it, she did anyways. My girlfriend eventually went to bed and left the friend on the couch.   \n\n\nMy girlfriend told me that she was a little uncomfortable with the friend coming over to begin with and that the cuddling/ staying over made her even less comfortable. As she told me this, I was unhappy at the fact that this friend stayed over and that they cuddled on the couch because I see this as a pretty intimate activity, even for friends. I would like to trust my girlfriend and believe that she wasn't interested at all, but it still bothers me. I also feel like the way she told me seemed to convey guilt which probably isn't a good sign? Anyways, I was a little mad, so I wasn't really talking as she was looking for support over the fact that she felt uncomfortable from the whole situation. Now she is mad at me, saying I acted weird by not being comforting to her.  \n\n\nAm I the asshole for not being immediately supportive to her after all that happened?  \n\n\n**Tl;Dr:** Girlfriend's friend came over and they cuddled. I don't like that this happened, and she's mad that I am not consoling her after this, since the situation made her uncomfortable.",

      "description": "Sorry if this is too long but I wanted to give a background to my feelings\n\n\nMy mom and dad got divorced when I was pretty young however I handled that well and I was fine with the idea of loving them both differently. I mostly lived with my mom and went to my dad for the weekends and honestly that was also fine by me.\n\nAfter a while my dad started seeing this women who was represented to me as his âfriendâ and MY âfriendâ also. And please note that during the time I wasnât capable of determining what was the difference between friendship and relationship. Therefore for the the longest time I thought they were just friends.\n\nFast forward to the day when my mom pulls me aside and starts talking about how my dad is actually in a relationship with this woman and that they like each other since they never bothered to explain it to me. And honestly I was pretty shocked but again I was ok with that also because I knew my dad was bad at explaining and expressing stuff and during the time I liked her girlfriend.\n\nSooo again fast forward to when I am around 13 my dads girlfriend tries convincing my mom to tell me that her and my dad are getting married but my dad is bad at talking so that she wants her to do it. As a result my mom gets irritated and tells them that itâs them that they are getting married therefore my dad should be the one explaining this to me. So my stepmom cones back home and a few hours pass, then we all start playing this game while its my dads turn to play she starts explaining how theyâre getting married and etc. And my initial thought was happiness although it was a bit awkward that it was her telling me this and not my dad and that my dad just kept playing the game without really saying anything.\nLike during the time I didnât care and instead I just asked when was their wedding because I obviously wanted to attend. And she said it was a week later. During the time I didnât know how to respond to that because I was shy and also was reluctant on how to show my feelings so I was just like âohhh ok but my school starts next week...â and she was just like âYeah well itâs not going to be crowded anyways it is going to be small and boring.â\nAgain I say NOTHING.Because honestly I just want to be nice. However then she starts talking about how her family actually doesnât know I even exist because where she cones from it is NOT ACCEPTABLE to marry a man who already has a kid.\n\nI realized how fucked up by this as I grew older and actually started to understand what was actually happening. However me and my mom moved to another country and I saw my dad like around a week a year as a result. \n\n2 years ago when I visited him we all had a fight because his wife was trying to hide me from her mom when all I was trying to do was to get my stuff and get out of there. But yeah so we all got into a fight his wife tried to pull me back into the house and ran after me when I left the house crying just to look good for my dad which good me even more mad. However again after 2 months my dad visited me and we solved our shit but I havenât talked to his wife on the phone or anything since.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago ( I am 16 btw) he called me on the phone and we were talking about my life and what he was doing casually and he basically just told me that his wife was 7 months pregnant which I just replied with âOhh great Im happy for you!â Then after when he hung up. I just started crying because initially I didnât want a step sibling at all.\n \nTl;Dr : My step moms family doesnât know I exist, she did not want me in her wedding therefore planned it in such way and my dad shows little to no reaction to this and tells me that her wife is 7 months pregnant on the phone. AITAS for not being ok with this and support him?\n",

The place I moved isn't really a big city or anything but i'm close the beach and there is still much to do. Now, every time she plans to come see me, instead of just staying at my house for a long weekend shed rather spend hundreds of dollars on a hotel or VRBO. The first time she came to see me she rented a place on the beach. The second time she insisted we meet up at Myrtle Beach since its a vacation spot only a few hours away from my home. When we were in Myrtle beach she complained of trailer parks and kept saying how she likes the West Coast (SoCal specifically) sooooo much more. This btw, makes me feel like a piece of shit. \n\nNOW she wants to meet up in Las Vegas. I'm still pretty young and make enough to live and go on short vacations with my SO a few times a year. When we go away we pick somewhere we can drive and bring our dogs with to save money, I really cant afford a plane ticket, hotel room, food, and money for activities. \n\nI really wish she would take her vacations with her husband and leave me out of it. I'd be happy if she could just come to my home and do activities like a normal human. I'm actually kind of offended, did I not move to a good enough area? I don't live in a trash house or anything.  I'm happy here and if you don't want to visit me because the place I live isn't good enough, that's great but fuck does that make me feel like shit. I should mention, we didn't grow up wealthy and by the times my parents split my mom had it really rough. She didn't make shit, now she has a decent job and a husband that makes enough. I feel like since she's become upper middle class she thinks she's high class or some shit, which I am definitely the opposite. I don't care for materialistic items whilst she spends $70 on a bottle of perfume and buys coach purses. She's VERY judgmental. OH and she CONSTANTLY asks me when my bf is going to propose. It's like she reminds me that my bf of 4 years hasn't popped the question yet, I mean shouldn't she be asking him when hes going to propose? Last time she said something (end of December when she was driving me to the airport) she asked me again and I went off. I kindly asked her to shut the fuck up and it makes me feel like shit that she feels the need to remind me that he hasn't asked yet. \n\nOh, I also visit home once a year. I fucking hate going home. I hate being interrogated. I hate how cold it is in the winter. I hate feeling uncomfortable at the home I used to call home. I hate her husband. \n\nAm I the asshole for not really wanting to see her anymore? I believe she wants the best for me and I do love her but she drives me crazy and she makes me feel shitty for not choosing a place like San Diego or Seattle or NYC to move to, instead I chose a cute little town that doesn't have outrageous traffic &amp; outrageous taxes etc. I'm happy and I wish she would just be happy for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Background: \n\nI go to school full time during the week and work weekends. 4 months ago I got on tinder as a way to meet people in a casual setting because my social life is awful and I wanted a way to de-stress a little from graduate work. \n\nIt was great for a bit and then I met who would be my current girlfriend. I've always been very explicit when I meet anyone by telling them I just wanted casual dating at the moment (e.g. going out, sex, no commitment). But, we started exclusively spending time together every weekend and she then asked me if we wanted \"date\" and not see anyone else. I was hesitant but I figured it would be fine if things stayed as they were (See each other here and there on weekends).\n\nFlash forward 2 months later and I realize this pretty much feels like an actual relationship. The time commitment is way higher than I thought and she has a lot of emotional baggage that I don't feel prepared to handle. She wanted me to visit her family on thanksgiving and I suddenly realized I mean a lot more to her than she does to me which REALLY makes me feel like the asshole cause either way i'm hurting her at this point.\n\nI feel pretty guilty but I thought I was explicit. Maybe not enough, and maybe I sent the wrong signals by agreeing to be exclusive. AITA?",

My roommate(one of my girlfriends and Iâs best friends) and another mutual friend said they were leaving to get Burger King. My girlfriend and I were trying to do the deed one last time before she left to head back to her school today. As soon as he left I texted him, âHey text me when youâre headed back, and take your time eating we kinda need some alone time.â\n\nHe didnât reply but I knew he saw it, so my girlfriend and I got right to it. And in the chaos of it, my phone went off which I didnât notice. He said he needs to come back to get his notebooks to study. Then he said they were at the door. I didnât see it going off until my girlfriend and I finished. I texted him apologizing and saying you can head back to the room. \n\nHe then said, they bailed because the bed was squeaking and we were kinda loud. I was mortified but just said alright well come back whenever.\n\nHe then sent in a Snapchat group that I was in with some other friends a video of him out the door where you can *CLEARY* hear my girlfriend and I going at it. It was meant to be a joke but we didnât take it it well.\n\nMy girlfriend is relatively new to sex(she lost her virginity to me not long ago at all) and gets really anxious about things like sex. So she freaked out and started crying. So I freaked out on my roommate and cussed him out pretty bad and said if he comes back in the room anytime soon Iâm clocking him in the jaw. \n\nWe made up and everything is okay now between us, but now weâre disagreeing to if I overreacted or if he seriously just crossed a line.\n\nAm I the Asshole here guys?",

      "description": "I'm using a new account because this still hasn't leaked at work I was the one who did this and my reddit is known to my coworkers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, This last week I got a coworker of mine fired for misconduct. I don't feel bad but my coworkers are now up in arms saying who ever did this is an asshole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my ex-coworker used to be a good friend of mine. I met her when I got a job here about 3 years ago and we hit it off. We were extremely close friends and I had misplaced trust in her. One thing she liked to do was take photos of us together and post them on snapchat and facebook. I never thought much of this and thought she was just sharing what we did like a normal person would do. I was wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a month ago a man randomly reached out to me. He claimed he was my \"girlfriends\" brother and that he had finally tracked me down. Through a long back and forth it turns out that my coworker has been pretending to her family and friends back in her home town that I was her boyfriend. She had a second facebook with her original name on it and had constructed a weird narrative in which I was her boyfriend. She claimed I was \"old fashioned\" and didn't use social media to cover up her lie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is fucking creepy, right? I documented and archived everything and corrected the record with her brother before reporting this all to HR. I didn't feel like confronting her (I honestly didn't feel like talking to her at all) and distanced myself immediately. She picked up on this quickly and started to post on her second facebook that I had broke up with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHR immediately transferred me away from her and kept us apart at all times. I'm guessing they told her what was going on as her facebooks disappeared over night and she began avoiding me like the plague. It was to late though as this monday she was fired for inappropriate behavior. From what HR and others have told me she will never be working in the field again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHR has kept this as quite as possible and has not leaked any details to anyone. The only thing my other coworkers know is that another coworker reported her for misconduct out of work and she got fired. Most on them are angry about this. The current opinion is that who ever did this is a spineless asshole who just ruined a girls career for \"nothing\". I'm never going to come out about this and have asked HR to never mention me because of this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole here? I feel what she did was wrong and she deserved it but am I wrong?",

      "description": "Throwaway.\n\nI met a girl at an event I was helping out with, and we had a pretty good conversation (surprising for me, since I'm normally an awkward gal.) It was all going so well and I thought I'd made a new friend, but then not even an hour into the conversation she asks me if I'd like to join a 'motivational course'. I'm like oh cool, that sounds good and then she tells me it costs about Â£1,000.\n\nLike, dude. How can you try and sell a Â£1000 program on someone you've literally just met? I felt like I've been MLM-ed. Not only that, I'm a student, so I don't have that kind of money around. I jokingly say this and she goes 'oh it's cool, you can pay in instalments over a year.' So great, I get to go into debt?\n\nNow, to be fair, she seemed like she was genuinely pushing a motivational course (for those who think it might be some sort of MLM thing) because she could give quite a lot of details on the course (unfortunately I've forgotten the name) and what they have to do on it and how its structured. She also seemed genuinely passionate about it. But it just really soured everything for me- I thought that either there's some kind of benefits for her to recruit others, or else this is some kind of culty thing that they're recruiting for. So later, I deleted my number off her phone when she wasn't looking, because she said she was going to contact me 'so we could go together'. AITA? I feel a bit like one, because it was her phone and I did willingly give the number, and I felt like I should have been a lot more upfront about not wanting to join the program instead of just going 'mm-hmm, interesting.'\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He isn't 18 anymore - but he might as well be with the shit he pulls. He has goals and is smart... but still a total mess.\n\nIn general my enjoyment while being with him has just gone way down. I feel like a jerk or somehow shallow because I know he loves me... and sometimes when he says he loves me I don't know what to say. I want it to work out... I really do. I want him to be successful and for us to be successful, but I have been finding it hard to picture that recently.

      "description": "For some background, I have a terrible relationship with my father. Because of some of the things heâs done, we speak very rarely and itâs always strained. A lot of my memories growing up revolve around him lying and my very early memories of his lies stem from him telling me heâd quit chewing tobacco, only for me to find out later that he was still doing it. Bottom line: I heavily relate chewing tobacco to my father and his lies. \n\nI have been with my boyfriend for almost a year. When he and I first started dating I knew that he and his friends liked to chew tobacco. As we got more serious I told him that I know I canât tell him what to do but that I am really against chewing tobacco. I said I didnât care what he did in his own time but asked that when he is with me that he please not chew tobacco. We had a long conversation about it where I told him about my dad and I also told him that I am just grossed out by it in general and would prefer not to see him doing it. He agreed not to do it around me and even said that what I was requesting and my logic was âvery reasonable.â\n\nSo last week we were going out with a group of our friends on Friday night and in our group message one of the guys jokingly said the outing was âBYOCâ (bring your own chew) I separately said something about it to my boyfriend and he got pissed at me. Said that he âlikes to do it when heâs drinking with his friends and if he feels compelled to, heâs going to because itâs his body and his choice.â He also said that he doesnât understand why Iâm still against it because âI know him better now and know that heâs nothing like my father.â I got upset with him and said that just because my feelings for him are stronger now doesnât mean Iâm okay with him doing it, honestly it makes me wish even more that he didnât do it. I was also frustrated because he had already agreed not to do it around me and is now going back on what we agreed. He can literally do it ANY other time when Iâm not around. I never give him a hard time about this or even ask if he still chews (at one point he said he was trying to quit).  He eventually agreed not to chew that night and we resolved it but his initial comments are still bothering me and causing me to think I might be making an irrational request. So, AITA?",

      "description": "I know, I know. Without any context it sounds like a very dickish move, but hear me out. \n\nMy sister had been dating this guy, letâs call him Rodrick, for about 3 months. He was a cool guy, but I always liked fucking with him despite him being 3 years older than me (heâs a freshman in college, my sister is a senior, and I was a sophomore in high school), and it was never a big issue. \n\nMy sister is a whole different story. Sheâs a major introvert: which may have been why her idea of fun with her friends was fucking with her little brother (me), cause she doesnât know how to be a normal human being. (Side note: it was RARE for her to have friends over, everybody liked her and Iâd consider her âpopularâ in school standards, but she still didnât like confrontation, good or bad)\n\nFor as long as I can remember, every time she had friends over, or somebody she looked up to, sheâd turn into a major ass (with no repercussions). One example, which was when I was in 4-5 grade, her, an 8th grader at the time, locked me in her room with herself, me, her best friend, and her friends little sister. This little sister (my age at the time) liked me, but the feeling isnât mutual. My sister wanted me to kiss this girl but I refused, so she decided the next course of action would be to power-kick me in the nuts then run downstairs laughing with her friend (sheâs been a soccer player since she was like 4 by the way so you can imagine how much that hurt). \n\nAnd thatâs just one example, other things would be opening the bathroom while Iâm taking a crap while her friends are over, or busting into my room and fucking everything up then leaving, anything that would be embarrassing to me, or any friends I had over. The other part, the whole âno repercussionâ thing, is that sheâs never gotten in much trouble for these things, because my mother has no clue how to handle it. Keep in mind my sister only does this shit when her friends are over, when theyâre gone sheâs actually a decent person. So usually, my mom just says âdonât do that againâ, and moves on, which pissed me off more than anything.\n\nHowever, this time is different. Now itâs her boyfriend, and itâs the first time heâs coming over to visit our extended family. Usually when heâs over itâs the same old opening the bathroom door and being a general nuisance while Rodrick stands there thinking of what to do, but usually playing along with it. Anyway, the family get-together is going nicely, so far my sister hasnât done anything, so I expected to get out of it. The next day comes, and my relatives are getting in their cars to leave. Weâre outside in my neighborhood, Iâm surrounded by like 8 close relatives, neighbors are outside, Rodrigo is saying goodbye, and my sister decides itâs the perfect time to pull my pants down. \n\nUsually, this wouldnât be that bad, but she went IN for it, like underwear and all. Next thing I hear is Rodrick laughing, so I pull my pants up, turn to him, and say something along the lines of âYou know what Rodrick, fuck you, and fuck your girlfriend, itâs your fault she does shit like this.â Then turned and walked back into my home. \n\nOf course, like usual nothing really happens to my sister, this time I was the one who got the heat for it. But now she doesnât do much to me. \n\nOne thing Iâve thought about is that the only reason I did was I did was because it was her boyfriend, not some cute girl that went to our high school. Still. Am I the asshole for cussing Rodrick out instead of my sister? \n  ",

      "description": "Yesterday on my way home, I was following behind a school bus that had a sign in the back of his (or her, not sure of the gender) window saying âno kids on boardâ. The bus swerved a little bit out of the lane and then continued along just fine. It approached a T shaped intersection with 3 stop signs. The bus and I are going on the top of this T and thereâs typically no one ever at this intersection in any direction when I come through.\n\nI was surprised to see that he applied brake for a very quick second then continued through the stop sign like it didnât even exist.\n\nI got the whole thing on my dash cam including license plate and vehicle number and not sure if I should share it or not with the school district.\n\nOn the one hand, there were no children on board at the time (also didnât see any in any of the windows in addition to the sign), and there typically isnât anyone at this intersection, so itâs not like they put anyone in danger *at this moment*.\n\nHowever, I do consider this to be dangerous driving. The brief swerve before the stop sign makes me feel like the driver was distracted and didnât see the sign which is dangerous driving either that or figured no one was around to make stopping necessary. Me, Iâm not a school bus driver and I was alone in the car and I stopped at the stop sign because thatâs the law and even though no one appeared to be there, I never know if someone will gun it through or be hidden somewhere. I donât know if he would or would not have done this if children were on board, but this makes me feel like theyâre not a great driver and deserve whatever disciplinary action would follow as a result of my sharing of the video.\n\nIâm a little conflicted here and curious on your guysâ thoughts. Would I be the asshole (wrong) to share this video or should I just âmind my own businessâ here and refrain from being an âassholeâ by not sharing the video?",

      "description": "Hiya. We're both 19. I come from UK, him from Ireland, and sometimes when I say something relatively serious he'll respond with a joke, which are usually funny but also often exhausting when I just want to have a conversation. We've talked about it, it's fine really, he knows it's not the most satisfying thing for him to do. \n\nHe has anxiety or something and is kind of afraid of being too real, or at least tries to get away from it instinctively, so I can understand why he does it. However, it often left me with no response available, because my mind can't switch track away from serious that quickly, and sometimes I do honestly need to talk about the thing (in which case I do just repeat it and he does actually answer). This led to me not even trying to respond if he does it, with my dual logic being that it also might teach him to be a bit more serious. \n\nStill, I feel cruel or at least impolite without at least giving him a pity chuckle when he does it. \n\nTLDR: BF responds to serious queries with dumb responses. I ignore them to teach him a lesson and because I can't thing",

      "description": "So i made a call to a new phone service this morning. I was taken care of by a nice lady who took all of my information for me and mailed me a sim card to activate once it arrived. She told me that even though it was her day off she would come into work to activate it for me. So she told me she would call me in two days in order to verify i recieved it and to go through the process of activating it. \n\nso later on in the evening i start work (graveyard shift) and i get a message from her on facebook, explaining that she shouldnt contact me but she just wanted to make sure i could contact her when i recieved the sim card, and we could go from there. I messaged back and said i appreciate it, and thanks. \n\nThen she told me she thought i was nice, and that i should call her, which was strange and i said no i am at work. She apologized and said she didnt want to get me in trouble so she would just talk to me later. And she said gnight, big hug! \n\nSo she knows i am gay and have a boyfriend because we talked about him during the call. But he is really creeped out about it. I mean she has everything from my home address to my social, i mean she shouldnt have it but i gave it to her for my account.  \n\nSo some people at my work say its not a big deal and i shouldnt turn her in. And some people say otherwise. What do u think reddit?\n\nSorry for formatting, mobile",

I'm not from a big city at all and you wouldn't encounter many homeless beggers in my town so I wasn't sure how to react when this happened. I was in London to see a game and just see the city again, I'd been there before but not in a few years. My friends and I were on the tube and this young man wrapped in a blanket came and did a prepared speech about his situation and how much money he wanted so he could shower etc. Where I'm from, we're told to ignore anyone who comes up to you and asks for money because they could be anyone trying to scam you. And I had a very small budget for this holiday so I couldn't and wouldn't give money to this man. So I did what I was taught and just looked away and ignored him and he got annoyed and said \"you don't even have the decency to look at me? Is no one going to look at me?\" And he just moved on in a huff and then made his speech to more people further down the tube. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Our toddler daughter is in day care a few days a week at a day care.  Itâs a ânormalâ business.  By that I mean itâs not at someoneâs house, not at a church, not run by a non-profit organization.  Itâs just a business with probably 5-10 adult staff on-hand at any time.   Theyâve opened up a second location recently and seem to be doing well.   The parents are happy and they have great reviews online.\n\nMy wife and I love the daycare.  They do a great job, itâs clean, well-managed, modern, safe, etc.   However, I feel at times they play on the emotions of some parents.  They sent home a cookie dough fund raiser book to raise $5000 for a new playground.  Theyâre asking families to each sell 5 units of this cookie dough to raise money for the playground.\n\nMy wife immediately was all excited about it and wanting to go to the neighbors and family members to sell some.  Iâm like whoa, take it easy here.  I donât feel comfortable trying to guilt neighbors/family into donating to a for-profit business.\n\nMy wifeâs argument is that itâs just what you do with kids and thereâs going to be many of these fundraisers through our childâs life.  My counter point was, yes thereâll be many of these and it makes sense to do it for things like raising money for youth sports, school trips, non-profit orgs, etc.  But this is for a business.    I tried to use the example, of the little restaurant down the street the wife and I like.  If the restaurant wanted to add an outside dining patio and asked us for money for that, it would be weird, right?  Wife agrees.  But then she would not see how what the daycare is doing is the same thing.\n\nFrom my wifeâs perspective, because thereâs a kid involved, itâs just what you do.  And our kid will be using the playground.   Thatâs great our kid will be using the playground, but we always pay like $200 a week to them, theyâre doing great, and opening new locations.  Why do I need to donate money to them on top of that?\n\nAITA for thinking this is pretty ballsy by the daycare and not wanting to guilt my family members to pay for this?\n\nMy solution is maybe the wife leave the fundraising forms for cookie dough by the coffee pot at her work if people really want cookie dough that much they can order some, but leave it at that.  No personally asking people to do it.\n",

      "description": " Okay, so about 2 years ago my parents got divorced. Although my siblings were taking it pretty rough, Iâm pretty much an emotionless shell by this point, and also Iâd seen it coming from miles away, so it didnât phase me too much. We set up a system where my mom has us for half the week, and my dad has us for the other half. It was going pretty well for the first few weeks, until my dad got a girlfriend. Both my siblings and I are not particularly fond of her, nor she of us, and she has a few fairly bratty kids of her own, though I donât know them too well.\n\nMy dadâs planning on buying a house with her and probably getting married. Despite how much I oppose the idea of my parents remarrying, I don't care too much; I donât see him often anymore, as I tend to mostly stick with my mom.\n\nHowever, as of about a year, my mom has acquired this online boyfriend through a mobile game she plays. Sheâs always talking about how great he his, despite never actually seeing him in person. This is where the real issues start;\n\nIâm pretty overprotective of quite a lot of things, and I really donât think my mom is making the right decision. First of all, she knows literally nothing about this guy, except for what heâs told her (who knows if itâs even true). Second, Iâve had friends and heard stories about people catfishing to the extent of proposal; For all we know, this âboyfriendâ could be a 300 pound dude living in his momâs basement, and not the rich dream-guy my mom believes he is. And third, Iâve been too scarred by other traumatic stories of abuse and the like from online suitors to even give the idea of my parents remarrying a second thought.\n\nIâve tried to discuss these topics and more with my mom, but every time I speak even *slightly* ill of her âpartnerâ she gets very upset and shuns me for the rest of the day, as sheâs doing right now.  I often feel like Iâm being very selfish and I should just let my parents live their lives, as Iâll be moving out in less than a year (hopefully) ,but what about my siblings, who are all younger than me?\n\nAs sad as it makes me to upset my mom, I canât shake this incredible feeling of unease every time I think about it for over 10 seconds.  Worst of all, sheâs constantly exposing her personal information to this guy, such as where we live, the names/daily activities of all her kids, etc, and it really freaks me out.\n\nI donât know what to do. Am I the a-hole in this situation, or am I simply overreacting? Iâve asked for advice from my bishop, church leaders, and even my teachers, and they all tell me my mom should facetime this guy or cut it off. Once again, Iâve tried to explain it to her, but sheâs so blinded by what she thinks is love that I canât get through. Even on good days, my siblings or I will be talking to her, then as soon as she gets a phone call from her âboyfriendâ, she completely shuts us out to talk to him. Any advice yâall could give would be greatly appreciated.",

      "description": "A few months ago, one of my (32M) neighbors Jim with whom I share a bedroom wall with got a nice new TV for his bedroom. Since then, he has it going almost every night all night, from 10-11 PM to 6-7 AM. It sounds like it's directly up against that wall we share, which has minimal noise insulation to begin with. I measured it with a sound meter app (which I realize isn't the end all be all in terms of accuracy) and it tends to run about 42-50 dB on my side of the wall. I'm a relatively light sleeper and I've been losing sleep because of it for weeks. To top it off he occasionally comes back from the bar with friends to party well past midnight and is blasting music when his roommate who pays almost all the rent is out of town, though admittedly that has slacked off as of late. I've also been woken up a few times to screaming matches between him and his girlfriend, or him and his roommate who is letting him live there. I really dislike confrontation with neighbors especially when I know he's at least verbally violent and am concerned what will happen if I escalate. I've asked multiple times for the bedroom TV to be off at reasonable night time hours (11 PM - 7 AM) or use headphones. The last time I tried to ask, he cussed me out from across the wall \"I can't FUCKING listen to the FUCKING TV? JESUS FUCKING CHRIST\" and then turned the TV up a little. I'm going batty, I'm a working adult who needs his sleep and I feel like I'm not making an unreasonable request.\n\nWIBTA for bringing up the TV noise to management?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my mother I don't love her",
      "description": "  \n\nI [21F] have always had a rocky relationship with my mother [late 40s]. Ever since I can remember, her behavior towards me can suddenly switch from caring to abusive and negligent. (Straight-out ignoring me, attacking me physically and/or verbally as a way of '*parenting',* using sensitive/personal information I provided to her against me, blaming me for not doing things that are (generally speaking) the responsibility of a parent, and more.\n\nI used to doubt about what I felt about her, but I always tried to convince myself of forgiving her, since I've been raised to love parents unconditionally. I was a responsible kid, going to school by myself starting from the age of 6, babysitting my little brother, ... I didnât know why I deserved to be punished.  \n   \n \n\nWhen I reached puberty , I started hating her for how absent she was. My brother was violent, yet she didnât teach him to stop, and she would never cook for us, resulting in me getting an eating disorder. (She then tried to enforce anorexia onto me.)\n\nOne time on my way home from my best friendâs house, I had an encounter with a strange man (which I cannot describe, because it violates the rules of this subreddit)  \n Luckily, when a group of people walked by, I jumped between them and escaped him.\n\nWhen I got home in shock, having possibly escaped a kidnapper, my mother whipped me, because she âhad been so worried about me being lateâ.  \n   \n \n\nBecause she confided in me about my dad cheating on her, I felt bad for her and kept forgiving her.\n\nMy mother stopped physically punishing me when I was 19, but she became even more mean. \"You are just like (random family member) : selfish, entitled, asocial...â She even ditched my brother and I in the middle of Vienna when on vacation, because she thought I was laughing at her behind her back? I found her an hour later, eating at a restaurant.\n\nEventually, my mother filed for divorce &amp; I started spending more time at my boyfriendâs and less time at home. Sheâs nice to me after sheâs missed me, but later starts lashing out again.  \n I've accepted the fact I donât love her, but I wouldnât tell her, because itâd just do more harm than good.\n\nYesterday, she kept ignoring my questions, I told her that I would like if she could stop acting like I didnât exist. She sighed and saying that I always complain, because Iâm bitter and asocial. I told her it was because of our strained relationship &amp; told her everything. Then she tried to justify physical punishment on kids. I accidentally let it slip out and said : \"**I would never hit my child. What you're describing is not my real personality towards the World, it's just how YOU see me, because I don't love you.\"**  \n \n\nI knew I fucked up but she immediately went to her room.\n\nMaybe what I said mentally fucked her up even more, plus the recent divorce makes me feel bad for hurting her. Iâm worried she might hurt herself. I've been thinking of apologizing, but I don't know if I should.",

      "description": "i just want to start by saying this is a very stupid situation and exactly why children shouldnât have children. \n\nmy friend, weâll call him T, (21) knocked up one of his friends bc there was a possibility she couldnât have children in the future. about a month or two ago, (sheâs about finished with her pregnancy now) she posted on facebook asking if anyone wanted to meet her at the bar for drinks. mind you she was very pregnant at this point. \n\ni read the comments, all people telling her she shouldnât drink while pregnant, and sheâs goes âIM ALLOWED TO HAVE ONE GLASS OF WINE!!! ITS HEALTHY!!!â So i message T and ask if he knows that sheâs drinking and he informed me that sheâs been smoking cigarettes too. i got really worked up inside but just decided to mind my own business. \n\nfast forward to today, i see on facebook that their baby is weeks behind where it should be in height and weight. i messaged T and asked how everything was going and he tells me about how his baby is missing marks, and that it upsets him when she drinks and smokes and that heâll never forgive her if their baby has a birth defect. \n\ni asked if he said anything about this to her and he said no. so i start preaching to him about how theyâre creating a life, a person who is going to grow into their own being and how hard it is to take care of a baby, let alone one that is disabled. he just tells me that he âshouldâ say something to her but i donât think that he will. \n\nim also a mother, and thatâs why (i feel) this upsets me so much. but i also sometimes donât know boundaries. none of this is even my business but theyâre young and have no idea what theyâre in for with a child, so i want to give them as much advice as i can, but am i being a pushy asshole? \n\nTL;DR: my friends baby mama is drinking and smoking while pregnant, their baby is suffering, am i the asshole for pushing him to at least try to make her take care of the baby sheâs growing?",

      "description": "This is very current and still playing out... but here are the details.\n\n  \nI am gettin married in August and having a July Bachelor party in one of my favorite places... Colorado. My best man and I have been planning the party for months. Getting reservations at restaurants, finding airfare, doing research on things to do and very importantly... booking an AirB&amp;B to accommodate 10 guys for a whole long weekend. Since the lodging was going to be over $2.5k for the 4 nights (in breck), we didnt want to make the Best Man front the entire cost for all 10 guys... so we took this as an opportunity to see who really was going to come, and asked for around $250 per dude (split evenly). Within a day, all 10 people paid the best man via venmo and he paid and booked the house immediately. Please note... this was back in like November.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen a few weeks ago, one of the friends... who I knew would have been the guy to do something this, hence asking for the money early in the process... told me he wouldn't be able to go because he wouldn't have enough money (yet bought a new ATV a few weeks back that adds to his collection of 2 motorcycles, 2 boats and now a race quad, plus tons of CC debt). I thought... ok thats fine, at least we have his money for the room so I don't have to ask every other person for even more cash. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this past Saturday night comes along and I get a text from him at 9:30pm saying \"Yooo, is there anyway I can get that money back that I sent (best man) since Iâm not going to the bachelor party anymore? I neeeeed it to pay down my cards.\" I responded with \"Sorry dude but that was kind of the point of getting that money in advance. We already paid and booked the room for all of us.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSparing you the time of reading all the back and forth texts or hearing the details of the 20 minute phone call of me trying to explain why I will not be giving him the money back for A, B and C reasons, am I the asshole in this situation? Should I be giving him his money back? He's a good friend and a nice guy but damn... he was not very polite about asking for it back. When I told him no... he threatened to find a way to dispute the transaction between him and my best man and told me \"Doesnât really matter to me whoâs pocket my money comes out of, ill just take it back.\" and \"You pay me and (best man) will pay you back...simple.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd advice is appreciated! Thank you in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Also this story is long, but I'll try to keep it short.\n\nTo sum up the 'special Ed\" part, this guy's been in special education class for most of his life and was put into normal classes only recently. He has trouble controlling his anger and doesn't always understand the flow of conversation, meaning that he sometimes cut people off, regardless of whether they were talking to him or not. He also says things that are very private or embarrassing to others and thinks it's funny. I find it annoying, but I know he can't control it.\n\nI had a boyfriend at the time, and I told him so. Despite this, he proceeded to ask me out. I played it off as a joke and rejected him as softly as possible. He didn't take it very well and was pissed. I tried not to think much of it for the rest of the day.\n\nI later broke up with my boyfriend for reasons that could probably be given its own post. As soon as this guy hears about it (same day) he asks me to homecoming. I tell him no, this time explaining that I just wasn't ready for a relationship and that I didn't want one. Didn't take that well either and started to cry. One of the staff had to take him because he wouldn't get up when the bell rang.\n\nAbout 2 weeks later he asked me out a third time, and I was so done with it. I exploded on him, telling him to stop asking me and that I would never date him. It was so mean and harsh, I know, and I feel bad looking back on it. He was furious and left.\n\nHe still tries to talk to me and once started to ask, but I stopped him and left.\n\nWas I too harsh? Should I have given him a chance?\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "AITA for not going into work today?\n\nSo, I just started a new job at a store a couple of weeks ago. They post a schedule outside of the office weekly and it runs from Thursdays to Wednesdays. \n\nWell, I worked yesterday and took a picture of the schedule really quick on the way out to check later and see what time I worked today, but a quick glance showed the schedule was reprinted and that my shift would be moved to Friday, which is tomorrow. Cool.\n\nWhen I got home and took a closer look at the picture they had the wrong name written down. Since Iâm new, the other schedules had a default âPNAâ marked out with my name written on, which is Amy. I notice that the name says âAshleyâ. Theyâve been pretty bad at training and theyâre a bit dismissive, so I assumed the scheduling guy literally just got my name wrong, otherwise I just wouldnât be on the schedule. But maybe thereâs another new worker named Ashley and they forgot me on the newer print, or I donât have any shifts, and he just didnât put me in to make room for her? \n\nSo, when I noticed, I called and asked to be connected to âTâ, the scheduling guy. The cashier who answered said he wasnât in. I asked how to contact them and they said theyâd tell a manager to call me when he was in. Well, this morning I called again and got the same response. So, at ten today I literally went in and asked where T was and they said he still wasnât in. I went to a different coworker and asked who else there was to go to for scheduling, and she said it was just T and there was no other way to contact him.\n\nI wonât go into it but the environment among employees is vicious, they have complex sales and computer software with inadequate training, and theyâve scheduled me for double-shifts despite company policy for part-time workers, which I didnât sign up for. This all adds to me not really caring as much anyway about management being pissed off and considering firing me, and Iâm applying for some other jobs in case they call and fire me. They havenât called and itâs been almost three hours since the shift started, whosever it was. \n\nBut with all that aside and through objective eyes... I want to know if IATA. \n\nTl;dr: AITA for just not going to work today? My name isnât on the schedule and I canât reach the person who oversees scheduling.",

Anyway, my friends roommate mentions in passing that he has two tarantulas and if I'd like to see them.\n\nNOPE. Fuck that. He laughs and is like okay whatever. A few minutes later, I'm rolling another one when I feel something brushing my neck, I have semi long hair so I did my regular brush off motion when I felt the big ass spider. I fucking flipped out. Grabbed it and tossed hard. The poor thing bounced of the cable top box and behind the TV stand. We spent 20 minutes trying to get it out, ended up having to move the stand and found it crawled up in a little ball amongst the mess of cables. Needless to say the roommate is very upset and thinks I way overreacted. AITA? ",

      "description": " Iâm graduating college in April this year and my best friend of 10 years and I have always dreamed of going on our grad trip together. My boyfriend and I started dating about a year ago and in the past few months Iâve casually mentioned a couple of times how Iâm excited to be travelling this summer (he knew we would be apart, this isn't the issue). To my memory, Iâve never mentioned who I would be travelling with- I hadnât set any plans yet, just a vague knowledge that I wanted to do a month-long grad trip and meet up with friends in different countries.\n\nHe graduated a while ago and works a full time 9-5 with limited vacation days so we both knew travelling together for that long was never really in the cards. The past few weeks, my best friend and I have messaged a few times about our trip, very broadly figuring out when we should depart/return and shooting ideas back and forth about where to go. I hadnât brought any of this up with my boyfriend as nothing we had mentioned was concrete. \n\nLast week, he brings up with me that heâs incredibly unhappy at his current job (which heâs talked to me about before) and that he wants to quit and take some time to himself to travel, get some certifications, and look for a new job. He brings up that we should travel together. I realize he doesnât know I had been wanting to travel with my best friend since we were preteens. I tell him this and that heâs more than welcome to join us as weâd be meeting up with more friends along our travels. Heâs immediately upset that Iâve never mentioned this to him (I honestly didnât realize) and he thinks itâs absurd that I had already âmade plansâ without him and to him, inviting him seemed like an afterthought. \n\nFrom my perspective though, I hadnât known he would be able to travel, and therefore telling him the ins and outs of our trip planning would have seemed like rubbing in the fact that I was going somewhere he wasnât. I would obviously have told him once plans were a little more concrete, but walking him through the planning stages just didnât occur to me as he already knew I would be going. \n\nNow, when I try to bring up planning for the trip, he just says things like âwhatever, just go without meâ. Soâ¦ AITA?",

      "description": "Last week, a friend (we'll call him Khan) and I made plans to grab burgers after work today. My girlfriend works 10am to 6pm and my friend I work 3pm to 11pm. I should note my girlfriend is not a big fan of this friend due to shady stuff he has done in the past but I've always maintained that he is my friend no matter what due to the kind things he's done for me and especially because I knew him before I met her. She knows I would never stop being friends with him and would not react well to any kind of ultimatum.\n\nAnyways this morning my girlfriend calls me crying and sobbing from work saying her great uncle has passed unexpectedly from natural causes. She never had her paternal and maternal grandparents around and this gentleman and his wife filled that role in her life. She was especially upset because she was planning to visit him this weekend and kept putting off visit him the previous two weekends. I told her that it wasn't her fault and to spend the night at my place so she wouldn't be alone. She lives with her parents and siblings so typically when we spend the night together shell come over to my place. She sounded a little comforted and agreed.  Usually if she stays over, she'll come when she gets off work and I'm home around 12AM. \n\nWell after I started work, I let her know about my plans with Khan as I didn't think it would be a big deal to mention and didn't say anything about it prior. The latest I would have gotten home was maybe 1am, I could probably be home around 1230. She became extremely upset saying she needed me and was very upset about her great uncles death as it's the first death she's experienced of someone in her immediate  family. She accused me of putting Khan first, something she has said a few times before, and asked me to reschedule my plans for tomorrow. I told her that I would still be home with her after getting the burgers with Khan and that it felt like she was forcing me to make a choice between the two of them. I feel she's just jealous of Khan and is manipulating  the situation to make me sound like bad guy here. If I had said I'm going to McDonald's on my own I doubt she would have  any type of issue  with that. The argument got out of hand and I told her to stay at home for a while because I'm sick of her getting upset everytime I spend time with Khan which only happens every few weeks. Am I the Asshole?\n\nTLDR;Girlfriends uncle died on the same day I happened to make dinner plans with my friend. Shes never liked my friend and I feel she is taking advantage of the loss to force me into cancelling my dinner plans. AITA?",

      "description": "Iâll try to be as brief as possible but there is some background info I think is relevant to understand. Also, apologies for bad formatting, Iâm emotional and typing on mobile.\n\nAbout 18 months ago, my parents announced they were getting divorced. My mum had met someone else and was leaving my dad. But the whole story was that my parents were swingers and in an open relationship for 10+ years. My Mum wasnât really that into it and met someone who also wanted a monogamous relationship, so I donât really blame her for her decision. My dad however spun a story of infidelity and betrayal. My dad and his family are extremely religious, so it was never allowed to come out that heâd been sleeping around for so many years. Only us kids knew the truth and we kept the secret, knowing my dad would be absolutely destroyed if the truth came out. My Mum is much stronger, and even though she copped a lot of shit for âcheatingâ and walking out on my dad, she took it and also kept the secret for his sake.\n\nAt the time, right before the divorce announcement, my long term boyfriend and I were talking about getting engaged. But when everything happened, I knew the last thing my parents could deal with was a wedding, so we postponed our plans. Fast forward 18 months, the divorce has been finalised, my Mum is still with the man she left my dad for, my dad also has a new girlfriend, everything is much calmer. I proposed to my boyfriend a couple of months ago, and we are planning to get married mid 2020. I wanted to give my dad time to get used to the idea that heâd see my mum at the wedding, as heâs been very angry and depressed and struggling a lot. My mum wants them to be friends, or at least be civil, but not my dad. He says he could not cope being in the same room as my Mum, that the pain is still so real that he wouldnât survive seeing her.\nYou can probably see where this is going. So I ask my dad, âWhat about my wedding? I need you thereâ. And he pretty bluntly stated he wonât come if my Mum is there. I said I refused to choose between them when this is their mess and theyâd have to figure it out but they both have to be there. But my dad goes on to say that there will NEVER be an occasion where he will ever be in the same room as my mum, including weddings, the birth of grandchildren, funerals etc. \nSo my dad asks if weâd consider having two weddings on two seperate days. One where he and his family are invited and one with my Mum and her family. He also offers to completely cover the costs for the second wedding (though I donât think he even slightly understands how pricey weddings are these days, even on a budget.) I immediately refused because I donât think he understands how much work goes into planning a wedding, itâs not just about the money. And one of them would still be the ârealâ wedding and how was I meant to decide who would come to which? But my dad has basically stipulated that this is the only way he can bear to come, because he wonât cope seeing her and he is worried they will fight if they are both there and ruin the wedding anyway. \nI really donât want to do two weddings, everything about the idea feels wrong, but my dad has said to just think about it and has somehow made me feel like itâs MY choice if I want him involved in my wedding or not.\nAITA for not wanting 2 weddings even if itâd make my dadâs life easier and mean he can be there?",

He mentioned to me a few weeks ago that he was interested in becoming shift manager when one of the previous shifts announced that he would be quitting. So he starts being friendlier to our head manager as a way to weasel his way into being promoted. Meanwhile, we are still both working our asses off day after day. K gets more and more responsibilities and I get access to our storeâs Instagram via our head manager. So a rumor (eventually confirmed by the head manager herself) starts floating around that another shift is getting fired soon. Being a broke college student, I immediately get excited by the idea of a possible promotion. So I ask another shift (Lets call her C) what kind of responsibilities they have and the next day she (without me knowing) refers me to the head manager! So the head manager comes up to me and is like âOh hey ****! C told me that youâre interested in becoming a shift manager! I think you would make an awesome shift, letâs see what kind of responsibilities you can start picking up!â So in summation, K, who has been working towards becoming a shift for a month now, is mad at me because our head manager has been favoring me ever since I (indirectly) expressed interest in becoming a shift a few days ago.

While we we're good friends in high school, we now we live quite far apart, but we keep in contact through text and the occasional phone call, see each other when ever we're both in town, etc. Anyway, he dated this girl, Anna, for a year or so until they broke up - two years ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was friends with Anna while they were dating, although never super close. However, recently I began talking with Anna again, and this even escalated to the point where we hooked up last weekend while she was in town. To be clear, I have never talked to Chris about this, and given what I know about him, I am almost certain that he would be upset - he has blown up about minuscule things in the past and likes to hold grudges. As a result, I've decided not to tell him. However, I was explaining the situation to a few people who know both me and Chris, and they all seemed to unanimously agree that I was in the wrong for sleeping with his ex - something I legitimately hadn't expected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally think that, given the circumstances of their breakup, there is nothing morally wrong with my decision to sleep with his ex, given that they broke up 2 years ago.

Anyways she has started having guys over yea guys random dudes that we dont meet and showers with them and then they end up \"falling asleep and stayying the night on accident\" she makes it seem all innocent like oh my friends coming over to watch Netflix or do homework. But I mean come on I'm not fucking stupid. I'm apparently an asshole for even considering telling the dude to get out now that I'm home after working grave hard shifts and such. My room mate lives in the loft above the living room she doesnt exactly have a door or a wall separating the living room but she put up a tapestry and she knew about this before moving in. But she is constantly taking over the living room and getting mad at me and my girlfriend for being up at like noon which is bullshit because our room mate agreement says loud noises can start at 1030 a normal time some one should be up in the morning. \n\nMy issue is if shes going to be acting like this then I should be in total right ti tell her no.more guys unless we meet them.and they need to leave at a time. The living room isn't a place you go to listen to a girl get fingered. \n\nMy girlfriend on the other hand thinks I'm being to much and our room mate who is an adult should be allowed to act like this with boys. And have them over. I just thinks shes missing the part of WE DONT KNOW THESE DUDES. \n\n\nAM I the fucking asshole? \n\nI'm not here at night .like i.said earlier I work grave yards and i just dont feel comfortable with a strange dude in my house when I'm not home. \n\nTldr: girlroommate is taking advantage of room mate agreement to have strangers stay the night with her in a nsfw way. I think her boys should leave before I'm home or I should meet them. My girlfriend thinks I'm an asshole for thinking this. ",

No need to pay rent or even for laundry detergent. Thing is, they keep asking me to clean my room and make my bed (I'm a somewhat disorganized 27 y o) and I suspect that they go into my room on the premise of picking up cups (water cups I drink out of and leave on my nightstand, no leftover food or rotting meat sitting on plates that can be smelly- I'm no animal.) \n\nIt makes me uncomfortable that they go into my space when I am not home. It's nice to stay with them and I dont want to be ungrateful, but it feels like an invasion of privacy and like they are sneaking around to do it. I leave in four days but I dont want this to happen every time I visit with them. Maybe next year I'll visit for a week and stay with friends.",

The other two roommates have their own private bathrooms inside their bedrooms.\n\nOne of my roommates (who has their own private bathroom inside their bedroom) has his gf spend the night literally every day. She has a key to the house, sheâs here when her bf (my roommate) isnât all the time, &amp; uses the âcommon areasâ frequently, uses the WiFi, electricity, kitchen, etc. I donât care about any of that tbh.\n\nMy issue is that she keeps using my bathroom. I already have to share it with another roommate but idk why she wonât use her bfâs bathroom solely.  This causes issues mostly bc she uses my bathroom to shower &amp; etc in the morning when I need it to get ready for school. I also have a disability that causes me to use the bathroom more then normal.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I asked her to stop using my bathroom &amp; showering in it? &amp; instead asked her to use her bfâs bathroom inside his room?",

      "description": "My (26F) friend's (30M) family is attempting to contact him about a bill for a storage unit that he failed to pay off (\\~$700). His mom payed the bill and is threatening to have his stuff auctioned off and keep the money. \n\nMy friend struggles with bipolar and drug addiction and the only means of contact they have with him is through me as his phone is turned off at the moment due to his inability to maintain a job due to his mental health and lack of stability. He's attempting to get help with his bipolar and addiction through counseling with a local behavioral health center. I've known him and his family for over 20 years and am very close with his mother, sister, and step-father, and know from the way they've spoken about him and their experiences with the lethal combination of mental health and addiction that the way they've been trying to get him to seek help all these years hasn't been productive. \n\nHe has a history of emotional abuse and neglect from his mother and he loves his sister but she seems to mostly go along with what his mother says. It's been really hard to build up his self confidence and get him to a place where he feels like a normal person- if only some of the time. At first he was hesitant to trust me, I think because I was suggesting the same route as his family (to get help) but I feel like I'm finally on the way to gaining his trust. \n\nOne hurdle to this is his family is always calling me to get in touch with him, and I feel like every time I see him and mentions that his family wanted to get in touch with him it pushes him further, so I've stopped mentioning when his grandmother calls (she tears him down every chance she gets and lays on the guilt pretty hard). His sister (who was my childhood best friend and still continues to be) only really calls me to talk about him. I know she cares about him and only wants what's best for him, but I think her opinion of what that is is discordant. \n\nSo about the storage unit: He's been behind in paying it off and asked his mother for help, which she initially blew off. He was resigned to let everything in there go to auction when mom payed the bill and got the keys. She wants him to pay her the money or she's going to let all his things get auctioned. His sister, who called me today and relayed all this to me, is trying to get in touch with him to find out if he wants her to get anything for him while she's searching for family treasures. \n\nI don't know whether I should tell him the situation because I'm afraid he 1) won't be able to handle the stress of his mother's pressuring and 2) will want to go to the unit and get all of his things- that he doesn't have storage for, and come under more stress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.

      "title": "AITA for not letting go of things that my brother did many years ago?",
      "description": "I'm 20 male and my brother is 18. Basically many years ago I used to be bullied verbally but never physically in high-school, I didn't have friends and was alone most of the time, being told that \"no one likes me\" whenever someone gets upset with me. Which was probably due to my lack of social skills and inability to relate to them, also I do believe my personality back then wasn't fun to be around, so all these added onto me being segregated. The thing is, when I was in year 9, my brother entered the same school as me in year 7, and he was pretty social and already had a friend group on the first day of school. I was excited because I finally had someone I can actually be friends with, but the thing is, pretty soon my lil bro caught on about my status in school, and he wasn't friendly with me at school, just ignored me, which I understood, because he has his friend group and it'd be like some yr9 kid playing with yr7s, weird. Anyway things didn't really get much better for me, but then at home whenever we got into disputes or arguments, or whenever my brother was upset with me, he used the same line, \"no one likes you, you have no friends.\" Which kinda hit me hard, and there's nothing I can say back to him when I hear that. It's like a \"finish him\" move in mortal kombat, haha. Well anyway, it kinda hit me hard that not only did I have other people against me, but the one kid I thought who would be with me, was against me. He became a bully in his sort of way and im supposed to be the older bigger brother. This continued for a few years. My parents always told me that I should learn to tolerate words, because they're just words and that in life there are gonna be people out there who are bullies and that I should learn to handle it. So whenever he said anything, I just had to ignore it, but it just hit me every time, and it affected my mental health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was years ago about like 7 years ago, but I hated him ever since, and I avoided him, just doing my own stuff. But over the years he had changed, he stopped being an asshole and he's far better than he once was, but still I don't like his personality because he is all about himself and is selfish and just plain rude. And he did apologise once, when I brought it up to him before, but then he proceeded to say that it wasn't fair that I was keeping something that happened ages ago over him, and that I should forgive him. But quite honestly I just can't, it's not like I hate him or anything, and we do interact a lot, but idk his attitude feels like he isn't sorry at all for what he did, he acts like it never happened and doesn't show any regret. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it took years for me to recover from my depressed mentality which I believe he and school had caused, but last year I finally felt like I was no longer depressed. And that's probably when I should have let it go, but honestly, I just don't like him, and my family expects me to be all brotherly with him and forgive him. But I just can't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole for not letting things go, for not forgiving him for something he did when he was just a teenage kid that took years for me to recover from?",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to go for a thru-hike alone, without my girlfriend?",
      "description": "Recently I've developed a good interest for backpacking and camping; hiking trails. In my excitement I've told my girlfriend about my plans, which involves hiking around 10-15 miles per day for a couple of days strait in order to finish a section of a trail I selected. \n\nShe was excited about the idea, but didn't feel like she is capable of walking that specific distance every day. I didn't really dare to tell her I wanted to do this alone, since she sometimes is really afraid I want to do these things just to be away from her, when in reality I really just want to do these things because I think they're interesting and challenging. So what I did was try and alter the plans so she would be able to join me, where I dialed back the distance walked every day and included a hotel stop along the way. The hike would be spread out over one week in total, and she felt like she would maybe be capable of this. Since she told me this I've spent some time on searching for good gear, with which we could do this together. \n\nFor context, we've lived together for 1 year now and shared one big vacation together and several other smaller trips. We've recently bought a car and are planning to go on a road trip with just the two of us in summer. I'm really looking forward to spending that time together. \n\nWhen I get excited about something I really dig into it and I've spent a good portion of my time last week reading into proper hiking gear for two people. My girlfriend thinks I am diving too deep into it, and she is doubting my wish to want to do the hike this year. She was trying her best to change my mind and give me alternatives, which didn't involve thru-hiking (which I really want to do). On my end, I'm really excited and almost feel like I can't wait a couple of years before I undertake such an endeavour. \n\nMy girlfriend thinks me wanting to hike alone is an early sign of me wanting to break up with her, which I don't agree with, it's just something I really feel like I would want to do alone. Being in nature, away from civilization, for a certain period of time - being alone and having to rely completely on yourself, that just feels right to me. \n\nMaybe I should have been honest from the start, and tell her I really wanted to do this alone. I recognize that, but I am just wondering if the idea of wanting to hike alone makes me an asshole to begin with? Is it weird to take a one-week holiday alone when you're in a starting relationship? Especially in order to do something that is really going to challenge me on a very personal level? I don't have a good reference point to compare myself to, so I'm really wondering what other people would say. \n\nTLDR; I want to hike alone, my girlfriend doesn't want me to and thinks of it as an early sign of me wanting to break up with her. \n\n",

I told him of course and that Saturday we had traded. I come to school Monday wearing them and find out that they're actually not Aaron's shoes and are some that he borrowed from another friend(I'll call them ashley). ashley says they want their shoes back and I say that I'm willing to return them but I'll need my shoes back.\nso the next day I come to school wearing different shoes with the soldiers in my backpack. I go to Aaron for the shoes and the Jordans are muddy AND THE SOLES ARE MISSING. so I say i'm not giving the soldiers back until He gets me a new pair of 3's. \nsince then I have been completely shut out of the friend group and getting spammed with texts from our whole group saying that I'm a dick and that i shouldn't have traded with Aaron if i wasn't willing to risk the shoes being destroyed.\nso...

      "description": "I (23M) have been sharing a flat with Alice (F19) and Bob (M19) for about two years. I was in the flat before with some great mates that left the country to continue their studies (we're all college students). I've lived here for 4 years so I like to call this my home. Financially independent just last year. I have great plans to eventually rent this flat on my own and for it to become my residence for the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitally my new flatmates were cool and understood that things around the house dont get sorted by themselves. They were 18 years old when they came to the big city, both only childs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut soon they stopped \"giving a shit\" about stuff around the house. Cleaning, shopping and finances. Their parents still pay for rent and their share of utilities so that's not an issue, but I have to take care of all the other stuff. This has been causing me stress. I avoid comming home until late so I wont't have to deal with the mess. I have asked them to please try to clean after themselves and be more careful, to no avail. I am not a clean freak but overnight dirty dishes do me in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the other week the flat owner called me as our contract is about to end and he wants to know if we'll stay. I told him I would first speak to my flatmates. I went to one of them (Alice) and told her that it was \"either them or me\" but somebody would have to leave. She was totally unresponsive and stared at me blankly so I just said, alright, \"I'm leaving\". I said \"I can't keep living like this\". She left my room without a word and that was all I heard about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was about to start looking for a new flat, but a third friend Charlie who also knows Alice and Bob message me three days ago telling me that he heard on good account that Alice and Bob were celebrating with joy my leaving. Quoting \"that autist is finally out of this flat\" and had started auctioning my room to their friends. This has not sat well with me, especially the insults. Alice and Bob don't know that I know this, but I felt very angry that they would act in that way after me basically giving them no trouble with my leaving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a bit of thinking, I called the flat ower to tell him that I was interested in continuing but that my flatmates were absolutely disastrous and were not taking good care of his flat. I offered him to continue only with me and not renew Alice or Bob. He has all but agreed to that deal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlice and Bob are on their third year of college, finding a flat will not be an easy task in the current market. I told them the flat is theirs so they are making their plans. I am keeping very quiet about this, and will not say anything untill one month before the end of the contract so they have time to move out. I could have taken it not so personaly, but I love this flat and I didn't really want to leave. I am also filled with joy and released vengeance. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "To give a little backstory, my girlfriend (who Iâll call Ann) and I have been dating for almost a year now and weâve been going pretty smoothly. I introduced her to my friend (who will be called Bob) who introduced her to his boyfriend (who will be called Jim,), everyone got along well. One day I get a text from Bob  saying that Ann and Jim are over at his and asking if I want to come up as well. I reject the offer as I was pretty ill that day, he sent me a few images of them having fun together, she texted me a few times. I had gotten a text later from Bob showing a picture of her T-shirt pulled downed a bit showing her bra, I texted her asking if she was alright and she replied that Jim and Bob were poking her breasts and ass and that she felt a little uncomfortable (in case anyone asks, they were bisexual).\n\nFast forward a few months, Jim and Bob have broken up and we all, more or less, cut off contact with Bob and Jim and Ann are best of friends. Now Jim personality is very flirty and that can make me a bit jealous at times, though Ann never flirts back. I was texting her one day and I ask her âWhatâs up?â And she replies âIâm on the way to [insert my hometowns name]â I ask her whatâs sheâs gonna do here as she hadnât texted me beforehand to ask if I wanted to hang out, she said that Jim and her were gonna hang out and asked if I wanted to come along, I responded with a simple âYes.â They both come of the bus and I greet her with a hug and say hello to Jim (who had also came on the bus) and they two immediately got to talking, I just kind of floated around feeling a bit like a third wheel. We eventually got to the town centre and I told them that I was gonna run home quickly to get a coat as it was a bit chilly and for them to wait there. When I returned we continued walking around. Fast forward to the end of the night, I got into a small argument with Ann about drinking, she felt like I was a bit too restrictive with it (I donât drink) and basically didnât want her drinking because she doesnât handle it well. I stormed off back home. I apologised next morning through text and admitted that I had been a massive asshole. \n\nFast forward to about a week or two ago, I had, more or less, come to the conclusion that Jim didnât like me very much, I talked to Ann about this and she kinda confirmed this. We basically talked about Jim for a while, and that I especially disliked him for showering her with compliments. She revealed to me that after I went to get my coat, they had talked about me (he had basically said that I seemed a bit insensitive), and after the argument over alcohol he had encouraged her to break up with me (she didnât, luckily), and I have grown to have a big disliking of him. Am I an asshole for wanting her to stop being his friend?\n\ntl;dr - My girlfriend best friend poked her ass, flirts with her, dislikes me and encouraged her to break up with me.",

      "description": "It was the middle of my freshman year of high school and I thought my friends from 8th grade would want to to continue to be friends and one kid even said sure. I asked them to hang out and they were always busy as usual. I've never been great with social queues and hints  and they were busy when we were still friends. My mom said they moved on and I wanted to make sure so I asked. They said yes. I was in a very fragile state after recently coming out of a mental hospital and overcoming depression and it could come back. I was depressed somewhat and very angry at my parents for sending me to the hospital and not listening to me. When walking across the street I got extremely lonely as they were the 2 friends I had to hang out with. (The kid who still wanted to be friends moved on in this event as well as another). Due to this I instantly became suicidal and debated stopping and letting myself get hit. I didn't. But I was so close to and I was right in front my house. I overcame my depression completely and am no longer super angry at my parents. But I hate and would like to severely beat up the kids who moved on mainly for making me suicidal (I was still suicidal that night and cried. A lot) and hate them more than Hitler. No exaggerations. I've heard I'm not an asshole yet but I will become one if I stay this way. Every time I see them I freeze up with anger and can't help but think about how much I hate them. I don't know what to do either way.",

It was very rough going for a few years (we came close to failing, like most start ups, which means I came close to losing my life savings, but the business finally got traction and has done really well lately, much better than I expected. I now make way more money that I ever imagined, so much that Iâm in the top 0.1%, make millions of dollars a year, and have a net worth of tens of millions of dollars. I live relatively modestly (I didnât grow up rich) and have more money than Iâll ever need.\n\nMy business has over 50 employees, and I pay over $1 million each year in federal taxes, which is as much as the average household pays in 100 years. Iâd like to think that Iâm benefiting society by being an entrepreneur, by creating dozens of jobs, and by paying millions of dollars in taxes, but I constantly read about how wealthy people like me are like blood sucking leeches who prey on the middle class. \n\nI pay my employees what I believe is fairly, with starting wages for entry level employees at over $17/hr, I provide health insurance and a retirement fund with matching funds, as well as paid time off. That having been said, my company couldnât exist without my employees, and I make over 100x what I pay an entry level employee.  Iâm certain some of them struggle to make ends meet while I never have to worry about money again. Am I the asshole for not paying more of my companyâs earnings to my employees?",

She is using a route which she has been warned has 80% chance of miscarriage. She refuses to try other routes with better chances. \n\nIâve been to hospital appointments, covered for her in work, been there 24/7. A month ago my dad was hospitalised. He died on 1st December. It was very sudden and we had no clue he was ill. Iâve taken the news really badly and been off work.\n\nSince then I feel like whenever she gets in touch with me itâs with a really superficial âhow are youâ and then as soon as I answer she sends me long texts about how hard sheâs finding IVF and coping with the unsuccessful pregnancies. She rarely follows up on anything I say about how I feel. Today, we were supposed to meet for coffee. Iâm going to the hairdresser which is the last thing I want to do but am trying to get back to normal. I messaged her at 9.00 am re confirming the time of my appointment and checking she still wanted to meet. She ignores me til 2pm (having read my message basically as soon as I sent it) and then sent me a message about how hard she is finding it doing tests, wonât be coming and to âenjoy my hairâ.\n\nItâs hard to describe how angry this has left me. I was literally with this woman every step of her treatment but now when I need some support itâs just not there.

      "description": "Background: My roommate (Weâll call him Cole) is a nice guy, but there are a few serious problems I have with him that I tried and failed to resolve. He snores *so* loud, I wear earplugs and noise canceling headphones sleep and every night for several weeks either couldnât get to sleep for several hours or was woken up and couldnât get back to sleep. He also smells awful, heâs always cooking very smelly foods in the room and that combines very poorly with his BO and mildewy towel. It got to a point where the first thing everyone noticed upon entering the room was the smell. I brought both of these issues up with him politely numerous times, but it seems like theyâre both just out of his control.\n\nSo last week I moved into my two best friendâs room as a triple since their third roommate recently dropped out. Iâve been sleeping great and we all get along spectacularly. I didnât tell Cole at first, but a few days after the move we ran into each other and he asked if I had moved, and I said yeah but just because my friends dorm was in the same building and they had an opening, and that was that. Just to clarify, Cole and I are not friends. We only communicate on things related to our room.\n\n\nToday I went back to my old room to get a notebook that I forgot there when I moved for a class I had in a few minutes. Two of my old neighbors (weâll call them Lauren and Alice) stopped me and asked if I moved without telling Cole. Lauren already knew all the reasons why I had moved, Alice did not know. Lauren told me that Cole had stopped by her dorm wondering if I was okay and if she knew why I moved. She didnât tell him but suggested that I did. I kind of laughed at this and mocked the idea that I tell him I moved because he smells bad. This made her very upset and she got pretty angry at me calling me all sorts of awful names for moving without telling him. Alice jumped on the bandwagon too and started saying âitâs common courtesyâ and telling me that I have no respect. They wouldnât let me get a word in, so I kind of angrily told them that âIâm not gonna talk to you guys about this but thanks for the inputâ and walked off because I had to get to class.\n\nAITA??",

      "description": "The backstory for this is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. I went to a comic con a few months ago in chicago. My girlfriend bought the tickets for me and got me the chance to meet Chris Evans and I was beyond excited as hes my favorite actor portraying my favorite superhero.  After I took the picture with him and cried of excitement he was part of a panel with Lee Pace (Ronan from GOTG) and Karen Gillan (Nebula from GOTG). \n\nDuring the panel I got to ask a question and I asked if Captain America could beat Lee Paces character from the Hobbit movies, Thandruil. Chris said \"I'm gonna lose a lot of these fight cap doesnt bring an inate sense of super power and strength to the table. He's got a lot of heart hes got a real clean moral compass but for the most part-\" and I cut him off and said \"hes kind of a bitch?\" After a big reaction from the crowd and the lady interviewing the actors I apologized profusely and made a couple of jokes but it ended there and they moved onto the next question. I felt embarassed all day and felt bad about disrespecting him because meeting him was such a big life moment for me but my girlfriend said over and over he knew I was joking. \n\nA couple days later the panel got posted to youtube (I can link if anyone is interested) and there were comments saying that I was way in the wrong and I'm the type of person that contributes to the anxiety Chris has talked about having in the past. Since then everyone in my family and many of my classmates have seen it and I have gotten over the embarassment of it but still can't shake the feeling I was too rude.",

      "description": "I wouldnât post this here but I really feel like Iâm in the right and my coworkers have told me Iâm wrong, so Iâd like opinions from people who are removed from the situation. Also, my apologies for how long this is.\n\nI started at a company about 2 years ago. The people in it are very close knit and almost everyone knows each other. When I started, I was on the younger side at 22 (ages range from 21 to 60s). Immediately a man in his 30âs started to come onto me pretty strong. These advances always happened at social events and when there was alcohol involved they were honestly foul.  \n\nAfter several requests for dates and many inappropriate pick up lines on his end I just lied and said I had a boyfriend which apparently was the key to stopping him. \n\nA year later I was recounting this experience to a friend and she said âwhy do you think I avoid him? He did the exact same to me and (another girl at the company).â This fact didnât surprise me but the fact that no one talked about it did surprise me.\n\nI started asking around this year and it turns out he does this to many young women who have just started to work here. Always new employees, always under 25. When I asked my more seasoned coworkers for advice they said I was overreacting to call this harassment and that heâs just âlonelyâ and trying to find someone. I ALSO found out that he lied to people and told them that we did go on the dates he propositioned me for (pretty funny in the present day because now Iâm out as gay to pretty much everyone I work with). \n\nNow on to the present situation: last night he showed up to a social event with one of the new employees as his valentines date. It makes me nervous to think that she might go through the same thing as many women before her. I want to at the very least warn her of his past behavior so that she can make a decision on what she wants to do. But my coworkers tell me the past is in the past and I shouldnât mess with what could be a potential relationship. Since they actually did go on a date it could be true that heâs not harassing her but it feels wrong for her not to know. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I potentially ruined a relationship and warned this girl about this manâs behavior?",

      "description": "I live in the northeastern US. My boyfriend and I are both Caucasian. \n\nMy were at a local brewery the other night when an African American woman struck up a convo with us. At first, she seemed normal/friendly but quickly became pretty aggressive. She began lecturing us, quite sternly, about the poor state of race relations in the US, how blacks are oppressed, the situation with Gucci manufacturing a blackface sweater, so on. She also took it upon herself to tell us that everything we learned about POC (people of color) in school is wrong and then began a history lesson, going on for another 15 minutes.\n\nThe thing is, although both being super white, my boyfriend and I did grow up in very progressive communities and received thorough info on the history of POC and their history the US specifically. Some schools down South quite literally try to change history and seriously misinform students about POC in America. Thatâs not the case up North, and especially not the case where we went to high school.\n\nFurthermore, I went on to study history in college and received a degree. So everything she told me I already knew, but felt super uncomfortable with the idea of trying to tell her that and shut down the convo given her demeanor. I didnât want to start an argument or be labeled a racist.\n\nItâs not that I disagreed with her at all. Everything she was saying was totally correct and Iâm usually all about staying woke and spreading knowledge and whatever. But I canât help but to feel extremely ticked off that she targeted us for her tirade when we were just trying to have a fun night at the brewery. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Hey guys. On throwaway here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context: I (23f) have been living with a host family for the past four months in a foreign country. This host family had to go through a rigorous selection process with the program I'm currently working with to host me, so it's not like my presence here is any surprise to them. I pay them each month a more than decent amount for food and rent. In a few months I may have the chance to move out, but that's not an option right now. \n\nThis host family has a fourteen year old boy who is usually home in the early afternoon every day. He does not have any friends that he hangs out with and he has no hobbies but watching YouTube and Vine compilations and listening to Bebe Rhexa and Ava Max, usually the same couple songs at least once or twice a day. \n\nBecause of my job and our location in a relatively isolated village, I am usually in the house at the same time as him every day. There is only one cafe in town, and it is not a good place for studying (it's covered in cigarette smoke and has no outlets for my ten-year-old laptop), so I usually try to do work in my room. This, however, has been rendered impossible because my host brother has rigged a stereo system to play his videos and music on thee wall adjacent to my bedroom's. Over the past four months I have tried giving him headphones, explaining that I need to study, and trying to bribe him into being quieter. Sometimes it works, but it's largely dependent on his mood, and the agreement never usually lasts longer than an hour or so.  I've taken to wearing earplugs all day and night in my house and leaving for two or three hour long walks to avoid the constant barrage of sound. I've mentioned this and a few other scuffles we've had to his parents, who are usually not home until very late at night and leave very early in the morning, they wave it off as puberty and shrug. \n\nWell, today was raining. And I've been stressing like mad about the GREs and my lack of mathematical ability. So when my host brother came home, powered up his computer and started blasting his YouTube like usual, I went out and asked him to put in the headphones I gave him. He refused and when I asked why, he said, \"Because I don't want to.\" When I told him that I didn't want to have to listen to his videos, he responded, \"Well, that's not my problem.\"\n\nGuys, I went ballistic. Full-on freak-out, F-bombs every other word. Any time I could ad an adjective, it was an expletive. Four months I've been dealing with this kid's crap and it just all came to a head. I spent a good five minutes detailing just how f\\*cking disrespectful he is as a human being. I have never in my life spoken to another person like how I spoke to him. \n\nCurrently I'm hiding out in my room. All is quiet on the western front now, so I suppose that's good at least. His parents still haven't come home, but I'm waiting for when they do and we all have a really fun family get-together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My (24f) youngest brother (21m) is the baby of the family. Meaning he has gotten away with a ton of stuff I, the second oldest of four, couldn't dream of getting away with.\nOf course, now we are older, so he should get himself together right? Wrong.\nMy mother constantly tells me that I should tell him to clean the kitchen, or do his homework (we're in college), or watch what he eats (he's like, almost 300lbs, but hes tall af) etc, etc. I do all these things all the time, so when my mother sees me busy with these things she yells that I should tell him to do it too.\nOkay, so I used to. But all my constant nagging just triggers him so much and he berates me, calling me 'little girl', or tells me to shut up if I tell him something more than twice. He gets hostile, so I *have* to back off.\nAs for me, I absolutely **HATE** getting berated or yelled at (especially by him, it hurts me so much I can't stand it (ngl I've cried waaay too many times because of this kid)), and I *actively* do anything I can to avoid it. So, lately I haven't been nagging him as much and he leaves me alone for the most part. My mother screams that I should, and she tells me I'm 'ignoring him' and calls me 'mean' and 'selfish' if I don't (which also pains me).\nI am being selfish because I don't want to be chewed out by either of them, and I think there might be some validity to my mom's side of the argument. My brother isn't exactly the type to get stuff done (I'm not either), but I'm older, so some responsibility falls on me.\n\ntl;dr I don't tell my brother what to do much anymore because he hates my nagging, my mom hates that I 'ignore' him, and I'm basically terrified of confrontation.",

      "description": "I just made this account because this has been eating me away for DAYS! I literally had to get this out of my system. \n\nSome background- I (F21) have been dating my current boyfriend J (21 too) since we were both sophomores in high school. We are both in our junior year of university (Our birthdays were in January FYI). We also have plans to get married soon. We have a group of friends who we hang out with all the time; theyâre all guys and Iâm the only girl. J and I almost never do PDA. Also, we never tell anyone weâre dating unless they ask because of an incident that happened in our senior year of high school. If you didnât personally know us, you would never know J and I were dating. Not to toot his horn but my boyfriend is pretty good looking and always has girls crushing on him. All of this is crucial for our story. Moving on. \n\nI made a new friend (Who we will call L) in one of my classes in the fall. We both hit it off and became really good friends. She would come over to my apartment for sleepovers and I would go to hers for the same, we went to parties at my bfâs frat together and all those things girls do together. \n\nLately, L had been telling me about a guy she had a crush on since she first came here. I tried asking her who it was, she wouldnât tell me. After a lot of persuading, she agreed to describe her crush. When she finished describing her crush, I was so excited for her. I thought she had a crush on one of my friends (who we will call M) who just so happened to be looking for a girlfriend! Plus, he was really good looking and a perfect match for L. \n\nI started to invite her to our group outings so L and M could hit it off and eventually date. I was happy since I thought my plan was working, but L kept on hovering around J for some reason instead of M. I didnât pay any mind to it. I knew my boyfriend loved me and he would NEVER cheat on me. I was fine with him being around girls. And I knew L would never go after him because she had a crush on M. \n\nOne day, L stops talking to me. She blocked me on all of her social media except for my number. I tried calling and texting her and asking her if I did anything wrong. She always left me on read or never picked up. I was devastated because I really liked having a girl around for once. \n\nThis is where the drama happens. Iâm with a couple of my friends in a cafe when L comes in and throws a (thankfully iced) drink at my face. Everyone around us was shocked. L then started to yell at me. \nâYou knew I liked J and you went after him! I thought we were friends! How could you betray me like this, wenucry! How could you!â \n\nTurns out, L had a crush on my bf, not M. She thought I was also trying to set J and her up. One of her other friends had saw J and I kissing and showed L a picture she took of it. But L never told me who her crush was. She just described him. And, no offense, weâre all Asian and M and J have similar features, so the way she described him made me think she was talking about M. \n\nSo, AITA for âstealingâ away my friendâs crush?",

      "description": "Hello, please be gentle, I'm struggling.\n\nI'm in the process of recovering from (relationship) OCD and I've recently reduced my meds meaning I've had a surge of intrusive thoughts. I've been practising not responding to them for a year and as a result, I now can no longer trust my gut instinct - if I react negatively to something, I am convinced it's because it's my OCD so I let it slide. I really want to know if I was snappy because I'm irritable, or if this is actually a snappable offence. \n\nSo the incident. \n\nBoyfriend and I had plans to go to his (our) friends house for tea after we'd both finished work. He was already there when I arrived.\n\nOur friends are a couple, Sam and Julia, and when I arrived and sat down, Julia asked me how my sick pet was whilst she was preparing food. I start talking about it, it's been a bit of an ordeal, vets, money, thinking he was dying, and my boyfriend just starts talking to Sam about the board game he's brought? So I briefly stop talking because I find it hard to concentrate when other people are talking, and carry on, only for boyfriend and Sam to continue talking about the board game. \n\nI turned around and said \"I'm talking, can you not talk over me?\" and his reaction was an indignant \"alright!\", and him and Sam continued quietly in the corner.\n\nSo instantly I apologised, thinking \\*oh my god I've done it again, I've oriented to an intrusive thought, him talking over me was fine, why have I done this\\*. \n\nBut as time went on, I just felt like shit, and I left 2 hours later. I wanted to explain this to him, but also didn't want to bring it up when really... I just want to know if I was overreacting. There's no point in talking about this incident with him now, but if the same thing happens in future, I can at least know whether my reaction is appropriate or not and can work from there.\n\nTLDR AITA for snapping at my boyfriend for talking over me?",

      "description": "So I'm typing this on mobile so I apologize for any autocorrect weirdness.\n\nI work in a company I really like and would like to stay in. My position is stressful, 60 hours a week. come in early and leave late kind of stressful. I've been in my current position for about 7 months. But I have been doing 60 hour workweeks for about 3 years now. I dont get much time to spend with my girlfriend, play games with my friends or really do much else. It's go to work. come home, goof off for 2 hours then sleep. I also only get Tuesdays and Saturdays off, so that doesn't help.\n\nI'm part of a department that has 5 people in it. Four techs, which I am one of and a supervisor. The supervisor is a mixed bag, she brings in starbucks for everyone and tries to be sociable. The other 4 text, get drinks together, take care of each others' cats, etc. They'll sit in their office and chat and sometimes get away with minor stuff I'd get in trouble for.\n\nGiven how much time they spend together the other 4 are close. But while I'm always nice and kind, I do want to go home, spend time with my own friends, girlfriend, etc. Not be at work or meetup outside of work. They are all girls and I'm the only guy if that matters.\n\nI feel as though my supervisor has let her personal feelings interfere with the way she treats us. My position has a lot of turnover because while the overtime is nice, it is excessive and we're not paid to deal with the stress.\n\nThing is, a friend of mine from another department about a month back stated that a position in his department would be opening up. I would go from a 60 hour week to a 45, also 3 day weekends. Their department is physically next to mine so if l did transfer I would likely still see my old co workers.\n\nI've already met with the new guy who would be my boss and he seems like a really cool guy and I'm excited to potentially work for him. Here's the big thing though, my department has really high turnover, in the last year thre have been three different teams that have come and gone. Because of this, replacing me might prove to be challenging, however they might be able to find another one of their friends and complete their Department of friendship or whatever.\n\nI've yet to mention this to my boss, and I'm pretty sold on moving to the new Department only because having that free time and the less stress would be life changing for me at this point. However I don't want to say anything until I know for a fact it's going to happen. My buddy in the new department is kind of nudging that I should be saying something because it could be hard to find someone new, but I want to wait until I have a concrete answer.\n\nSo, sorry for the long winded post. Obviously I'll work hard in my current apartment all the way up until the very end, but Would I Be The Asshole if I only gave two weeks notice only once I knew for a fact I was transferring?\n",

      "description": "So in AP Bio we were doing a lab in a group of 4- Sam, Will, Josh, and I. Sam has a crush on this girl, let's call her Maya, in our grade. He knows I used to hang out with Maya a few months ago. We were waiting around for the lab to complete, so we were just taking about random shit, and Sam asks me about Maya. Now, Sam has a completely idealized view of Maya and sees her as perfect. I get it, I've felt that way in the past about Maya as well, since I was crushing on her *hard*. But as soon as I actually started hanging out with her, I realized my impression of her was way off. She acted nice and sweet, but in reality....\n\nAnyway, Sam asked me my honest opinion of her and how to get her to like him. I just replied he doesn't want to do that. Then, I said this:\n\n'Now, from the outside she looks cute. But she's wack: she's religious to an extreme, and she feels guilty after we do *anything*. But at the same time, she's clingy. She throws a tantrum if you don't give her all your attention. She doesn't want you to have female friends. She looked through my phone. In short, she's basically not girlfriend material. I made a mistake hanging out with her.' \n\nWill and Josh nodded along and chimed in saying they heard the same thing that I was saying. But Sam just got mad and said I was 'sexist' and 'shaming her'. \n\nWas I? Aita? ",

      "description": "This literally just happened so Iâm curious to know whoâs the asshole in todayâs fight. My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a breakfast sandwich from this little bakery. Street parking in this area is always full so after a drive around we parked at the back of the No Frillâs in the area for the 5 minute run. We get out of the car and start to walk towards the bakery (across the street from NF) and this loud woman gets out of her car and yells, âThis is for NO FRILLS CUSTOMERS ONLY!!!!!â\n\nTo preface, this parking lot was half empty, absolutely no one was waiting to park, and this was at the back of the lot. In no way a reserved or handicap spot. My boyfriend was startled, because who wouldnât be for getting yelled at right in the morning. His immediate defence was to say âOh, okay sorry!â and started walking back to the car to move it. Now, this woman had no idea if we were grocery shopping afterwards, had no idea we were just going to grab a sandwich and head back. Fuck this stranger, I thought. She doesnât know what weâre doing. I said, âBabe, just ignore her- letâs get going!â\n\nThe woman did not like this. She said went on and on, âyouâre a very rude person you know that?â I laughed because I think sheâs ridiculous. My boyfriend then got upset with me and said, âWhy are you trying to win with this woman?â \n\nI was not trying to win and to be honest his lack of tailbone of a random person trying to mother us was annoyed me. Weâre almost 30. You donât move your car because youâre not playing by some soccer momâs rules. We live in a huge city where every day there are going to be weird people like this that to me are not worth a second of our time. Who cares what this woman thinks or does in the five minutes we're gone. Letâs grab our goddamn sandwich and go. \n\nHe demanded we get in the car and go park elsewhere afraid she would somehow be the reason we'd get a ticket. So we did. But now weâre fighting on our differences in opinions on this. AITA?\n",

      "description": "My three siblings and I live with my loving parents in a decent house. I'm the second oldest but the most successful in terms of having a career and making money. (Side note: This doesn't really affect my youngest sister since she just started college and is working on getting a job.) \n\n My dad owns a small business and it doesn't do the best all the time and times can get tough for him when it comes to bills. My sister isn't currently working due to her last job being too stressful and my older brother works with my dad and pretty much lives paycheck to paycheck. My brother always talks about how he's going to look for a better job while he's in school but that has yet to happen. I'm always the one who my parents AND my siblings come to first when they run into financial trouble. It's been three years of my sister having the excuse \"when I get a better job I'll be able to help\" and my brother waiting to graduate college so he can do the same as her.  Now my sister is jobless and her new excuse is that she can't offer any help until she gets a job. Keep in mind that during these last three years of me being in my career, I've loaned my family thousands of dollars for vacations, bills, school payments, etc. So just this week I get another text from my parents asking for help and the usual stuff. I felt it was time I told my siblings that they need to do a better job on trying to find a job. I instantly told my siblings that I was not complaining about having to help our parents and was more frustrated that I am the only one who can afford to do so. I told them that if we all chipped in each month, it wouldn't be better off on my end so I wouldn't have to dish out large amounts at once and it would be nice for our parents too. My sister instantly pulled the jobless card and how she had to leave her last job due to stress. I showed little to no remorse due to how long I've heard those excuses for. She then told me that I shouldn't be complaining about helping a family that has done so much for me and pretty much told me I have no right to be annoyed. She did not like the fact that I told her to get any job and try to help as much as she can. This whole conversation turned into a huge fight and it got into her calling me selfish even after every thing I have done for her and the rest of my daily.  There is a lot more but this is pretty much the gist of it. Keep in mind that I am an aggressive saver and trying to save up so I can move out and purchase a house. A lot of the times I offer my financial help, I am digging into my savings.\n\nSo am I the asshole for being frustrated about this? Should I have not said anything to my siblings and just continued to support my family until my siblings are able to?",

      "description": "Me and my housemate own two types of cereal that are very similar. Even the packets have very similar designs with similar images and colours on them etc.\n\nA couple weekends ago I was out with friends and really overdid it. I don't remember most of the night or coming home, but when I'm that drunk I get the munchies. \n\nWoke up the next day with a raging hangover and that feeling of \"oh shit, I hope I didn't do anything stupid\". Turns out I sort of did... I ate my housemate's cereal instead of mine and made a mess of the kitchen. \n\nSo I'm in the kitchen cleaning up and my housemate comes in along with my two other housemates. I tell him that I was out the night before and I accidentally ate his cereal, apologised and offered to pay him back/buy him new cereal. He loses his shit, calls me a thief and an asshole etc. Other housemates are just standing there awkwardly and staring at me while this is happening. I decide the best thing to do is to just leave and let him cool down so I walk down to the shop and buy him some new cereal plus some chocolates. I leave it outside his room with an apology note.\n\nNext time I see him he's sitting at the kitchen table working on his laptop and I ask if he got the cereal and chocolates and he replies, \"Yeah thanks\" without looking up. Doesn't say anything else or otherwise acknowledge that I'm there so I just get food and leave. I figure he's still pissed at me and he'll hopefully cool off in a couple of days.\n\nNow it's been nearly two weeks and he's still giving me the cold shoulder. When we run into each other he doesn't acknowledge me or even make eye contact, and replies with abrupt one word answers if I talk to him at all. The atmosphere in the house is awkward, my other housemates don't really seem to know how to react to the situation. Tbh it's bringing me down a little especially as we got along well before the cereal incident.\n\nTl;dr went out with friends and got too drunk, came home and ate my housemate's cereal. Apologised and replaced the cereal but housemate is still angry.",

      "description": "TL;DR: Am I the asshole for not wanting a relationship with my abusive mother who has cancer? \n\nMy mother has borderline personality disorder. My whole life has been filled with psychological, verbal, and monetary abuse, all until last year, when I decided to stop caring for her (she was living with me, not working, not doing housework, and I had to pay for everything). I moved out on my own in a 1 bedroom apartment (perfect excuse to not have her live in with me) in July 2017, and cut all ties off. This constant abuse caused severe depression and anxiety, from which I am still recovering. \n\nUntil last September, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I put some limit to our interaction by having my sister be there every single time as a buffer, in order to keep my anxiety at a reasonable level (my sister understands the situation, and don't mind being in the middle, because she suffered the same abuse to a lesser level.)\n\nThis month, my mother tried to pull her usual manipulation, this time on my sister, to get money out of her (she receives some special illness welfare, and her boyfriend works full-time with a good salary so it makes no sense that she needs $250. I live in a free healthcare country, and since she's on welfare, her medication cost her nothing).\n\nMy sister and I realized that even ill, she hasn't changed at all. Now, I want to cut ties again, because I can't deal with all her abuse, and risk my own health. \n",

      "description": "  \n\nAITA for wanting my roommate to help clean the bathroom we share?\n\nBackground: I have been rooming with one of my friends from college since last September and the synergy between the two of us has been fairly strong until it comes to cleaning. Now, I'll be the first to admit I am a bit of a neat freak. I enjoy cleaning and when things are clean but feel I can refrain from imposing my neat freak views on others. My roommate is a little more relaxed/indifferent on the subject. Up until today, I have been the only one to take the time to truly clean the bathroom (scrub toilet, shower, floors, etc). Now I don't mind doing the cleaning but I wouldn't mind him offering every once in a while. Two weeks ago I asked if he wanted to learn how to clean the bathroom to see if I could get him to start cleaning every once in a while (more than just cleaning up after he grooms himself at the sink). This attempt bore no fruit. He took my offer as a passing joke and wondered off to his room to lounge. I decide to get a white board calendar to lay out a conservative cleaning schedule (nothing too much IMO). The schedule was laid out so that the bathroom would be cleaned every two weeks with both us alternating every two weeks. Two weeks passed and it was his turn to clean! The day passed and no cleaning had taken place. A mutual friend was over and I was discussing the matter with him. I realize I should have confronted my roommate instead of complain to a third party but you live and learn. Apparently the mutual friend brought it up to my roommate later on. When I returned home from work today, my roommate confronted me about the matter. He told me that if I wanted him to clean I should have just asked him. He went on to say that my cleaning standards where a lot higher than the average person and that when I had asked him prior, the bathroom didn't need be cleaned (it did, trust me). Now, I don't think my standards are to terribly high but maybe you guys can set me straight. Maybe I am truly a cleaning Nazi. What I usually do when I clean the bathroom:\n\nÂ· scrub/wipe the toilet\n\nÂ· scrub the shower\n\nÂ· wipe down the counter and the sink\n\nÂ· clean mirror\n\nÂ· sweep/swiffer wet jet the floor\n\nÂ· take out the trash if needed\n\nMind you these tasks collectively take all of 20-ish minutes to complete and none of them are physically taxing. Plus, a quick google [search](https://www.merrymaids.com/blog/quick-tips/how-often-to-clean-bathroom/) on how often a bathroom should be cleaned suggests once a week regardless if it looks likes it needs to be cleaned or not. My roommate believes that if it looks clean it doesn't need to be cleaned. Now to be fair he scrubbed the toilet and washed the bath mats today but it has been like pulling teeth. I shouldn't have to request a grown adult to help clean bathroom he shares with someone else. Am I truly asking for too much? If so I want chill, but at the moment I don't think I am asking too much.\n\nCheers!",

I recently (as in November last year) bought my first \"real\" car with my own money, an Audi A4 2010 with \\~167 000 km (\\~104 000  miles).  I bought a manual car because it was a good deal on a nice looking used car, I'm used to manuals from my previous beat up car and because I believe manual cars last longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where my problem begins, my brother is just turning 16 this year and at that age is when you start student driving here in Norway and you get the classic L sticker for your car. My mother nor my father has a manual car of their own and they think i should let him learn how to drive a clutch in my new (used) car. I do not like the prospect of letting him do this  because I don't want him to ruin the clutch or something similar. Since the car already has a good mileage i feel like him using for a couple years learning to drive clutch will wear it out fast and that's something I don't want to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, WIBTA for not letting my younger brother learn to drive manual in my newly bought car?",

I usually keep quiet about my disagreement to preserve our relationship, but lately it just comes off as delusional to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are times that I just want to tell her that her energy healing practice isn't real (or a placebo at best). What she does on her own time doesn't affect me in the slightest, so I feel like I would only be bursting her bubble.

      "description": "The other day i let my girlfriend look through my phones pictures, she wanted to send pictures of both of us to her own phone. However, she managed to come across old photos of me and my ex and she got very pissed off, not because she didnt know they were there, Ive been quite open about them before, but because i hadnt deleted them. I never touched these pictures because\n\n 1) i couldnt be bothered to comb through all my photos looking for pictures of my ex\n\n2) because i never liked the thought of deleting photos as they are reminders of the past and memories at the end of the day personally. \n\nHowever this has caused her to believe that Iâm still not over her and worries her a lot. Granted ive been very aware that my girlfriend is not fond of my ex in the slightest, so I know that any sort of reminder to her would piss her off, but due to how personal photos are, i never took her feelings about them into consideration. \n\nDont get me wrong, Iâve deleted the pictures now, but WIHBTA if i kept them or is it really as bad as it seems?\n\n",

      "description": "It happened a while ago, but it still bugs me.  \nThere was a guy, I knew. He was a step father to my ex.\nHe was an extreme alcoholic, who would steal from his own house and family (wife and kids) just to have money for alcohol. His daughters saw him at his worst. He got kicked out of house by wife multiple times after he lost his job due to alcoholism and left her alone with all life expenses as well as some debt. He was not a bad person per se, he clearly lost to his inner demons. Yet as a result he made everyone around hate him, including his daughters not wanting to see him anymore.    \nAt some point he has commited suicide. Suddenly everyone started behaving as if he was a saint or martyr. As if he was a pure good, just put in unfavorable situation that overwhelmed him. They started taking blame for everything that happened to him despite the fact that it absolutely wasnt their fault. They even tried to help him while he was alive but he refused to see the issue.  \nAnd so I have told my ex, that he has brought it upon himself. That his story was sad, as he wasn't bad guy but I do not feel bad for him as his own actions led to this. He refused their help and she should not guilt herself foe his death.  \nShe was the only one I told that. The hell that broke loose... Was extreme. Until the very end of relationship few months later she did not forgive me.\nAm I the asshole for my approach? I tried to be understanding, but at the same not let my ex fall into the spiral of guilt and sadness.",

      "description": "So this story is a bit strange. This all starts with Nail clippers, and a bad day Which is too long to pun on here, so I'm gonna start with the clippers. We have 3 Nail clippers in our house. I'm 16, she's 14, btw. Anyway, I need these nail clippers and I've been looking for them for a week. Yesterday I need a Sharpie as mine dried out and as I open her drawer there they are. All 3 of them. I take all 3 and leave the room, enraged. I had asked her about their location a few times during the week and she kept telling me she had no Idea where they were.\n\nI cool down a bit and after she gets home from school after her practice. I bring it up with her and ask why she didn't give me any and she started to cuss and shout about how I disrespected her privacy and how I shouldn't have taken any of the stuff in her room, while simultaneously telling me to go kill myself. So I thrust 1 clipper in her direction and tell her to get out of my face because she disrespected me. Later I can hear her going on Instagram and snapchat, calling her friends and telling them what an \"Ugly little S**t\" I am, how I don't deserve a life and all that. I walk into her room and ask why she's taking the piss out of me. She said that she wasn't and that I invaded her privacy again. She threatened to tell our parents about me being in her room, but I took her phone. After all the sh*t I took today, I couldn't take anymore. I think I go overboard and tell her she's a spoiled b*tch who's a waste of space on this world. After she grabbed her phone again and I leave the room, like five minutes after that She starts she tries to take me out of the room, but I'm mad at this point and take her phone out of her hands, and throw it out a window. She screamed at me and went to go get it. It was also snowing, so she took a while to get to the area where I threw it. \n\nShe runs inside crying and runs straight into her room. It's fine, nothing happened to her phone, but I feel guilty about what happened. Am I the asshole for going overboard on a bad day and making my sister cry?",

      "description": "Ltl, ftp, on mobile.\n\nSo my (28F) brother (24M) has a friend (call him Jack(24M)) with a drinking problem that we (my family) have known about for a long time and have tried to give him help to stop it. My brother and Jack are close, and naturally Iâm friends with him too due to us all being in the same high school &amp; him always being over.\n\nThis weekend Jack got drunk, as he always does. And I slept on one of the couches in the basement, and he slept on the other. I got to bed at around 3? Maybe 4? And from what I understand they went to sleep at around 6. \n\nAt roughly 8AM I woke up to Jack urinating on me.\n\nIâm not a light sleeper. But thank god Iâm up at around 8 regardless of when I go to bed. According to my family the blood curdling scream I released was enough to wake the dead with fear. If it wasnât for the fact that the dogs we own were sleeping in my parents bed they wouldnât have believed me while I was freaking out.\n\nI had a massive panic/anxiety attack due and spent roughly an hour sobbing in the bathroom (I have PTSD due to being attacked 10 years ago and it was a major trigger)\n\nIâve cut the friend out of my life, essentially. Heâs no longer allowed over/to spend the nights. None of my brothers friends are allowed to drink when theyâre here. And Jack has to pay my mother back for the couch being professionally cleaned.\n\nIn all of this I feel really bad for Jack, but he remembered everything when he woke up (he went right back to sleep after the whole thing), so I also donât feel bad at all. My mother thinks Iâm overreacting and being an asshole by not wanting anything to do with him, but even seeing him when he left caused me to freak out &amp; since it happened Iâve been very.... not well, mentally. \n\nAm I the asshole because I donât want to have anything to do with Jack? Or am I being too hard on him? \n\nIdk Iâm still in shock I guess.. \n\nJust want to clarify Iâm not looking for advice, I just want to know if Iâm the Asshole or not in this case of not forgiving and forgetting",

      "description": "So I know this is going to sound like a SHP, and I know many are going to call it that anyway, but this is really my life. From a young age I have always been freakishly tall. I was 6'0 at 14. I am now bordering on 7 feet at 22. My growth has slowed down considerably, which I am thankful for, but throughout my life I have been struggling.\n\nI know a lot of guys want to be taller. In reality, you feel very strange around your friends when you're growing up, and your family photos when you're a child make you look like a monster with a childs face and a mans body. I am also very shy despite what people think and I was verbally bullied at times based on my height and lankiness in highschool. I have to eat a lot of food to put on weight. I eat almost 4,000 calories a day to maintain my average build.\n\nNow I have started working out to increase my self esteem and I eat almost 5,000 a day. I weigh 320 pounds more or less. I can't go on many rides at theme parks and there are many activities I miss out on. Driving is terrible unless im in a larger pick up truck with cab space, which is very expensive. I don't have too many friends.\n\nWomen are also intimidated by me. I have a nice face on my profile but when we meet up they are very taken aback and quiet. They don't enjoy being around me. That all changed when I met my girlfriend who is 5'10, but has been amazing to me.\n\nWe have been dating for almost a year and have only been able to penetrate her a few times. My penis is too big for her she says. I measured it at fully erect and I am bordering on nine inches when hard, a little less. The thickness is also an issue since I can only get myself \"in\" maybe an inch or two before she starts complaining.\n\nWe have settled into her giving me oral sex, which I do enjoy somewhat and but that she REALLY enjoys. She is very enthusiastic to put it mildly, and she also expects me to be as enthusiastic when I give her oral sex which I also dont like that much but I do it to make her happy.\n\nHowever as a man I have a deep desire to penetrate a woman, its just a natural feeling. And whenever I sort of lead things that way she rejects me. She has allowed me to rub against her and other things but thats it. \n\nNow everything has gone to a head and she has flat out told me that she does not want me to fuck her, and I am very angry and hurt. I realize that I am not a \"normal\" man and I don't want to hurt her, but I don't know if I can keep living like this and be happy. I don't enjoy blowjobs nearly as much as she does. I don't enjoy handjobs at all, I don't like rubbing against her vagina as its not the same and sort of emasculating.\n\ni also know that she has been penetrated by her smaller boyfriends, but she wont allow me due to my size, which also hurts.\n\nI still think there are other options for us to maybe try penetration, but i am angry that she has shut the door entirely. I am almost thinking about breaking up and trying to find someone else but i do love her.\n\nAITA for being angry that my gf wont try penetrative sex?",

I dont even do anything that much, but because im attracted to some harder drugs( like molly, coke) she freaks out. Ik i shouldnt be doing it yah wtv , i personally feel like doing stuff like that every other weekend isnt that bad. They only fights weve ever had have been about my drug use and its frustrating both of us. I feel shitty cuz i keep telling her im gonna stop when ik deep down in my heart i dont want to, and she kinda knows that to. Two days ago i got drunk and snorted adderal, and i was gonna tell her when we met up this week but one of  her friends told her and now she thinks  I was lying.  Its really shitty because asidrs from this its really a perfect relationship. She keeps saying how its like im choosing drugs over her but its really not that, i dont see ehy i should have to choose. Right now i just got off the phone with her and I  feel fucking terrible cuz ik me doing it stresses her out and causrs her trouble, and i dont know what to do. We're still together but with new years coming up I know im going to be tempted and its going to be another fight.... i love her but unless one of us budges its just gonna get worse. \n\nEdit : I broke up with her...

But recently sheâs just been plain manipulative and evil to me and trying to turn anyone that gullible enough to buy into her bullshit stories about me against me. When I was living with her she would just take 60% of my school refunds and use it on herself which annoyed the hell outta me. Now sheâs emailing me since I blocked her on SM and my phone hounding me about this FA tax info. She also called other relatives of mines telling them to tell me to give her my FA info for her taxes. From what I learned is that she doesnât even need my FA to file her taxes. It just gives her a good deduction so she can get more $$. Havenât responded to any of her emails. Donât think I plan to either. \n\n\n\nFor people that donât know what The N in mom is, itâs stands for Narcissistic. ",

Amy's body and Liza's too once she was 10... \n\nI'd moved out of home 7 years ago and I was honestly really slack in keeping contact with my family as I moved far away for school and work. I came back to visit just under 6 years later and situation I came home to find my parents were allowing Amy to be physically abused (to put out a sliver of it out there, they would use her allergies to torture her into compliance) so I do what in necessary and get Amy and Liza put in my custody (if you want the whole story I might put it in Entitled parents but that part isn't what this sub is for)\n\nNow, for the title of my post. A few weeks ago, my mum contacts me though facebook, asking to meet me and only me for a talk. I oblige and met with my mum. She explained she was divorcing my father and cutting ties with his family (the side of my family who was allowing this to happen.) She explains that after she got pregnant with me she felt forced to marry my father, how she never wanted that life for my sisters and how she wanted to mend her relationship with Amy who still has an array of issues from her treatment and I gave her a flat out no, she would never see Amy or Liza again and if she tried, I would get a restraining order as everything I've heard from Amy showed that my mum never even felt concerned for her health or wellbeing during the time I was away. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to keep her out of my sisters life?",

      "description": "The other night my boyfriend and I were drinking some wine and he was trying to tease me and tell me to drink more to catch up with him. I said I was good at first, and then he said \"Pussy.\" It caught me off guard and I asked if he was being serious and he just laughed and said \"dont be a pussy\". \n\nI was deeply hurt and offended by this, because in my mind, pussy is a misogynist term when used in the context of an insult (ie meant to insunate weakness, since it is equating female genitals with weakness). I tried to explain to him that using the term pussy to mean coward is no different than using the word gay to mean stupid, or throwing around the N-word so casually. \n\nHis defense was that he had never considered it to be derogatory before, and he has heard several people, including women, use this word and call him a pussy. He said it's so normalized in slang in our culture that he didn't really think it was that big of a deal to use it. He also said he had never had anyone call him out for using the word before, and that my reaction was the first of its kind he'd ever seen. He also felt I overreacted by being offended by the word.\n\nWe had a conversation about sexism, feminism, and racism and eventually he apologized and said he understood why I was offended. But I am curious if I did in fact over react and if I shouldn't have been so hurt by it (mainly because he is not the type to usually use language like that either). \n\nAITA? \n\n",

Ok so with the me too movement and the accusations against people like Neil deGrasse Tyson, I realize that I may not know exactly what creepy behavior is like. So I am worried that I hurt someone without knowing.\n\nBasically I met up with this girl on tinder. We met at my apartment and we shared some weed. We both got rather high. Eventually we started cuddling which led to rubbing and eventually making out. I constantly was asking her if she was comfortable throughout. I then reached my hand lower and started to rub her crotch. She moved my hand away. I didnât put my hand there again. After we continued to make out I asked her if she wanted to go further she said no and I said ok. I called her an Uber and she went home. She said she had a good time and wanted to meet up again later. I tried to text her and we did for a little bit, but for some reason or another, she stopped responding.\n\nIt could be because school was starting for her and she became too busy, but I was worried that it could have been the unwanted crotch rubbing (even if it was for like a second).\n\nPlease tell me, was this sexual assault and extremely creepy behavior? Am I overreacting to this? Iâm not really sure how to think about this.",

I had ended up just agreeing with him, just trying to keep the peace between us (we were good mates (2 good years of friendship) but he didnât care).

      "description": "My now husband and I got married 1.5 months ago. We had 6 people on each side of the bridal party. This wedding took 3 full years to plan and prepare for. When I got engaged, most of the bridesmaids were very single, including Anna, the \"star\" of this story. Two of them were in long term relationships. I wanted to just give the two partnered bridesmaids plus ones. Anna seemed offended by this, because my wedding was then years off, and she was actually dating her now husband at the time (though it was casual. \n\nI eventually got pushed by my mother to give all of them plus ones. Anna actually continued to date that guy, and married him four months before my wedding at two months pregnant. She brought her new husband as her plus one (who I never met prior) and convinced one of the other bridesmaids to take her friend as hers (when she KNEW we didn't like him). \n\nShe was hugely pregnant, and didn't refrain from showing it off. We're both fairly young (25) and in my husband's culture, getting pregnant before late 20s/30s, married or not, is basically a teenage pregnancy and drew ATTENTION. She also has a vibrant personality and has a way of eclipsing everyone around her. Her husband is also very tall and incredibly attractive, which drew a lot of attention.\n\nAll anyone spoke about or of was Anna's pregnancy and her attractive husband. Even in the line, people were asking about that \"electric woman\" and of her pregnancy/marriage/life. When they got up to dance, all eyes were on them. Anna's friend ended up hooking up with my brother, outing him as gay and causing a huge scandal.\n\nI ended up leaving midway through the reception in tears, and never attended the next morning's brunch. Anna and her entourage left early the next morning and also didn't attend. I can't even look at the pictures without crying and desperately want a do over.\n\nI'm not a bridezilla, but this was beyond the pale. It felt like a celebration of Anna's marriage. I'm sorry, but I put so much planning, effort, and money into this while someone that got pregnant without a thought and married spur of the moment reaped the benefits. \n\nI honestly feel like Anna owes me a wedding and did all of this as revenge for me offending her years ago. Am I wrong?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to be around my husbands family as much",
      "description": "Long post \nHonestly I donât know if Iâm the asshole or not\n\nBasically, my husband (31) and I(25) have been together for a few years, but just got married this spring. We have two daughters and we are pretty damn happy IMO. Except for when it comes to his family, particularly his sister. \nHis sister (27) and her husband (31) are the type of couple that literally thinks their shit doesnât stink and they know everything about everything and they always the smartest in the room and everything revolves around them. And his sister treats his mom like shit, itâs honestly disgusting. \nWell I got along with both his sister and her husband until my husband and I got married. And then I donât know if his sister got jealous or something because she and my husband were pretty close, she was even his best man. But all of a sudden she just started treating me like shit too. \nHer and her husband drink all the time, definitely borderline alcoholics, and they pop pills and do occasional cocaine. Yet when I started to drink at a party his family was hosting, his sister got in my face and basically told me that I wasnât allowed to drink. And when I ignored her she started treating me like a i was disobedient dog that she was trying to train. The next weekend we had our annual float trip for my husbands family, and once again, everytime his sister and her husband came anywhere near me the insults started again. At one point that started using my name instead of the word poop/shit (âI took a giant Raehbot this morningâ) it was completely childish but still upsetting. Later on the float trip, my kayak crashed and I got really hurt. I could barely walk. When we all got back to his moms house, I pulled out my sandwich I had brought with me, because his mom never cooks anything I can eat, and started eating my sandwich before I limped to bed to try to sleep in massive amounts of pain. And his sister just laid into my about how rude it was that I brought my own food. His mom told her to leave me alone but that was my final straw, I told my husband that he needed to say something to her. Because she clearly doesnât care what I think so me saying something to her would literally do nothing except make it worse. My husband never said anything to her.\nAbout a month later is was my birthday and I was really excited because my birthdays had usually sucked (my mom is straight out of a r/raisedbyanarcassit post) and my husband was planning a party for me since it was my first birthday as his wife. And then his sister who knew about my party for a couple of months, planned a last minute float trip the day of my party so that people wouldnât come to my party. I told my husband that he had to say something. So he sent her this long message that basically said âI donât really want to send this message but Iâm being forced tooâ and needless to say it did basically nothing. The next time I say her about 2 months later, her husband was out of town with work and she was pretty tolerable. So I tried to just drop everything. A few days later her husband just randomly posted on Facebook insulting my husband, calling him unclean and a bad dad. My husband did literally nothing to deserve it. And it was out of the blue. And I defended my husband. Which made his sister and her husband both lay into me insulting me, etc etc. and I told my husband that I was done with them. I wasnât going to be around them anymore. Not forever, just until I either got an apology or until I stopped fuming with anger at the thought of them. \nIâve spent most of my life dealing with unfair and cruel behavior because of my mom and Iâm not going to take it from a spoiled entitled sister in law and her equally as bad husband. I need a break from them for my own mental health, and everyone Iâve talked to is on my side, even my mother in law.\nAnd the other thing is, I love my mother in law and i love spending time with her but I hate going to her house because I donât eat pork and everytime we go visit her thatâs all she cooks so I got a full weekend or longer with barely being able to eat and it makes me sick. I can bring some snacks for myself but not much. So I want to spend time with her, Iâd just prefer she come to us so I donât have to starve myself. But still I suck it up most of time and still go to her house for the big events and go hungry. But Iâve taking a little break from going there so I donât have to see his sister and her husband. We have only missed one event, which I told my husband he could still attend but he chose not too. \nBut now all of a sudden he is mad at me for keeping him from his family. ",

      "description": "Backstory: brother is a self-admitted alcoholic and addicted to being high. He was going to AA for awhile but relapsed and started drinking again. \n\nLike the title says, for my upcoming birthday I reserved one of those bike/trolley pubs for some of my friends. We did a private reservation versus joining a mix group of people. This means weâre paying for the whole trolley, regardless if all the seats are filled or not. \n\nAt the last minute a couple had to back out, leaving 2 extra seats. I was discussing this with my boyfriend and he suggested inviting his brother. I said I didnât think it was smart to put his brother in this situation, given his background. Boyfriend agreed but also said he feels badly thatâs weâre excluding him. We hang out with his brother on a regular enough basis that typically I wouldnât hesitate inviting him to my birthday, so thatâs not an issue. \n\nI donât think itâs very smart to invite someone battling alcoholism to an event thatâs catering towards drinking for a few hours, even to just be âincluded.â  I donât think itâs responsible to even put someone in that situation. \n\nAITA for choosing to exclude him from this?",

      "description": "For context, I'm in my 3rd year of university as an Accounting and Finance student and was at a point where all the following students enroll in a course where a 4-staged project constitutes over 60% of the total course grade. \n\nBecause the project is extremely difficult to do alone we get assigned 3 random group members, 2 of which in my case were decent but 1 was just unbelievably dumb and lazy. \n\nAbout 2 months into the project the lazy ass claims he has been diagnosed in pneumonia, which I call bullshit on but give him the benefit of the doubt as long as he provides a proper medical report, so I can claim to the administrator that any shortcoming in the project was due to the fact we were short on 1 team member. \n\nSurprise surprise the lazy ass gets all defensive about this and just says \"we should believe him\" and therefore also cover his part of the project, to which I very bluntly claimed fuck no. \n\nSo while we did do his part (we had to submit a completed Project) we sent evidence of the group members laziness, the amount of work he contributed and his supposedly false claims. Needless to say the lazy ass got a 15% overall in that course. \n\nSo now the lazy ass is trying to shame me publicly just because I was unwilling to compromise based solely what he claimed to us. On top of this he claims I cost him his scholarship, which I really do not see as being my problem. \n\nWhich now brings the question, AITA? \n\ntldr; group member claims false illness, no one in the group compromises based on my decision, group member ends up failing the course horribly and apparently losing his scholarship. \n\nSorry for the bad English, it's my 2nd language.

      "description": "Okay so this is kind of complicated. I'll try to summarize best I can.\n\nMy friend and I were in a short relationship, and we weren't that obvious about it, so I don't even think our other friends really knew. It wasn't a very serious relationship. One day he has this heart-to-heart with me and it results in us breaking up amicably. We're still really good friends.\n\nThe thing is that he probably thought the break up was mutual because he kind of hinted that he would stay with me if I asked, but I acted like I was fine and sort of encouraged the break up because I knew he wasn't really into it anymore. But actually I was crushed and didn't want to break up; I just didn't want him to feel bad because he's been really good to me.\n\nAnyway so like a month later I find out he has just started dating one of our mutual friends. I thought I'd be fine with it but I wasn't. I had prepared myself for him to get with others, but I think I was just messed up over it because it was this specific friend I was insecure about when we were together. He always seemed to favor her, and I even sort of asked one time if he was interested in her. He assured me he wasn't, so the fact that he ended up dating her anyway just made me damn insecure. I want to tell myself that he just happened to change his mind in the time we broke up, but I can't help wondering if he had wanted to be with her all along and felt trapped by me.\n\nAnyway I don't hate that mutual friend or anything, she doesn't know about the whole thing and she's a super great friend. I'm actually really happy for her. They're really good together. Better than I ever was with him, which is kind of bittersweet for me.\n\nI didn't want to tell him I was sad, but honestly when I found out (she had casually mentioned it to me), I burst out crying. I thought I should tell him, since it felt like something I shouldn't hide, so I did.\n\nBut now I sort of regret it and wonder if it would have been better if I had just kept it to myself. It's not his job to make me accept his new relationship, and I know he feels super shitty after I told him. I feel like an asshole for stressing him out over this.",

This all happened in Biology class, my last class of the day. I was messing around with a rubber band. I put it on a corner of a table and stretched it back until it broke, and it went flying. Well, you see, it hit someone, and I directly looked at who it hit. It hit this girl I don't know well. Now, I'm not the confrontational type of person, I'm incredibly shy and anxious so I acted like I didn't see the girl. Later, the teacher sent us out to different stations to look at onion cells and how they look after, during, and before Mitosis. I got paired with 2 girls. Little did I know, the girl i hit was housed right next to the station I'm at. She notices me and immediately starts talking to me. (G for girl, me for me, obviously.)\n\nG: Were you the one who hit me with the rubber band?\nMe: *flustered* Y-yes...\nG: *in a rude tone* You didn't apologize to me.\nMe: (At this point I was tired, flustered, and depressed so I was experiencing plenty of emotions) *I guess in a tired, but un-meaningful tone* Look, I'm sorry that I hit you with a rubber band, it was on accident. (At this point I tried to explain how the band flew across the room, she then cuts me off)\nG: *in an even more pissy tone* How would you feel if I slapped you, and didn't apologize? Rude little boy...\n\nAt that point I didn't say anything else.\n\nClass went on as usual, and I thought about posting here, and well, here I am.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA??\n",

I joined the USCG over a year and a half ago so I could go to college without obtaining massive amounts of debt, obtain a steady paycheck and serve my country. After Iâm out I want to be a police officer. I was told when I got to my unit that I would be set up with an educational service officer to start online classes, but that was never handled by my superiors as well as not having time too with our mission . My roommate who I was forced to live with was smoking and selling weed out of government housing, and when I finally worked up the nerve to say something about it I was entangled into the investigation, piss tested, and interrogated without any proof of me doing anything wrong. To top it all off, we went without pay all last month because of the government shutdown. Itâs not that I donât like my job, itâs just the USCG hasnât held up theyâre end of the bargain.  Iâm tired of being 800 miles away from my family and fiancÃ© doing a job I have no way out of.                 TLDR- I want out of the coastguard early, because they havenât held up theyâre end of the bargain for education and pay. ",

They show no love towards her, they barely invite her to their functions and yet she's expected to host here and there and puts out one hell of a spread. They show up. They drink all the booze they take inventory assess the situation. They asked a lot of really personal questions and then they lie if not to be heard from again until they want to come over and mooch some more. So I tend to grill for drinks relax keep quiet and I leave them alone. I'm not awkward around them just more like anti-social. It's a quarterly Endeavor that results in fake conversation. They don't really care about us and have never shown otherwise. They're second cousins and there kids and spouses and such. So does this make me the a-hole for being silent?",

Weâve known each other since childhood and I have no second thoughts on moving in with him. \n\nMy best friend Becca [f22] asked if she could move in as well and I didnât think it through before saying yes. We went 2 months thinking all four of us would be living together. I then realized that I feel like if I lived with Becca we might fight and it would eventually lead to us not being close anymore. We are both each-otherâs emotional support system and rely on each other for a lot things. Well I texted this to Ryan and we came to the conclusion that I would just tell Becca that she couldnât live with us. \n\nWell this is when the story gets interesting: Becca was on my phone and happened to read that text before I told her. She was upset (obviously) but didnât say anything to me. A few days later she got on my phone and actually put in my passcode to go reread the texts again. She eventually told me that she read the texts and that finalized the decision of me not wanting to move in with her. She said she understood and was fine with it but I definitely feel like there is some built-up disdain. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to move in with her even though we have been best friends for years? \n\n\n",

      "description": "A little long but I wanted to document the whole conversation for context and to get accurate judgement from everyone.\n\nI had a broken lawn mower that wouldn't run that I got from my mother. I posted a classified ad at my workplace on our internal posting site and had a hit the same day. We met a few weeks later in person to make the sale. When we met I told him it didn't run and I didn't know why. I pointed out a the control module for the self propelled function was duct taped because I took the bolts out. He asked a few more questions and then gave me $50. I helped him load and then we go our separate ways.\n\nAbout 45 minutes later I get a text from him saying the control module has a few broken plastic pieces and that bolts won't hold it to the handle. He sends me a few pictures and I look them over. I give him a call immedialty to talk to him about it. After a few minutes I realized that part from the picture was broken and that I didn't mention it in the ad or when we met. He also tell me the speed control selector won't turn to allow the operator select different sel-propelled speeds. I told him I was sorry but I didn't realize that was broken at the time I sold it to him. I asked him what he wanted me to do about it and he said he wanted $20 back. I said no. He freaked out telling me that I he will be \"watching out for me\" when I post stuff on the internal classified ads at work and making sure to tell people at work I am a dishonest seller. \n\nMy though is he bought a mower that he knew before hand that didn't run. He was expecting to do a little work to the mower so a couple extra pieces to fix isn't that big of a deal. I was asking $75 and came down to $50 for him. I also traveled 20 minutes to meet him in the town we work in. \n\nAITA here for keeping the $50 instead of giving him $20 back? \n\nInfo: Troy Built 725ex 190cc Self Propelled Mower. My cousin bought it for $450 6 years ago. ",

      "description": "Apologies for long post.\n\nMy father was physically abusive to both myself and my mother, my first memory is of him hitting me. After they split he only made one swing at me when I was 15, but acted really creepy towards me, including following all of my buses home from college on his bike without me knowing, and checking me after I showered (up to when I was a teenager) to make sure I was âclean enoughâ, once making me shower four times in a row because I didnât meet his standards. (Him calling me âfaggotâ every five minutes was mild in comparison.)\n\nMy mother became increasingly overbearing - walking me to and from school (when I was a teenager), and even as I got older I wasnât allowed to dress myself, choosing my outfits every morning down to the socks. As I matured it became more and more of a burden. She didnât have very much luck with men, and when she eventually got rejected, used me as a kind of emotional leaning post, telling me itâs my job âto make your mother feel betterâ. I was always happy to cheer her up, but constantly taking care of her when she got dumped seemed almost pointless, as she never let me cry to her like this, telling me to âman upâ. Just before I turned 11, she got a job as a catering assistant at my school, originally I thought nothing of it but she eventually got contact numbers for all of my teachers, and spoke to my head of year regularly to make sure I wasnât âcausing any troubleâ.\n\nShe later got with this guy (weâll call him P) in late 2013, and very quickly moved in with him, taking me with her. Right from the beginning P only let me eat one meal a day, locked me in the house while nobody else was in, blocked me from the Internet (when I had assignments due) and made me shower in cold water (I was a âdrain on resourcesâ). He took my TV away, as well as my phone and laptop every night. Mum never stepped in, and when P eventually kicked me out, spent the entire night crying and begging HIM not to leave her.\n\nI eventually found out that when she moved out with P, she took all the money from my savings account (in early 2014). I also happened to find out that they got themselves into Â£20kâs worth of debt by taking out loans they couldnât afford to pay back, ending up with a county court summons. (Not helped by Pâs refusal to get a job for over a year). I firmly believe that they only wanted me there to help them pay their rent and bills.\n\nI donât blame my mum for whatâs happened to her, but I donât think I can ever forgive her for just standing by while my mental state got worse and worse.\n\nI live in a house share a few miles away, but Iâve secured a place at a university even further away and I plan on moving near there, and changing my number and email address without telling them. I feel awful for even thinking about it, but itâs my last resort and I feel the only way that I can actually be happy.\n\nTL;DR: Parents were dicks, mum stole money from me and wouldnât support me, I want to cut all contact with them",

      "description": "So today is Valentineâs Day, and there was a nice kid who decided that he wanted to get roses for everyone so no one felt left out. Now, he meant EVERYONE. There are nearly 2000 student and staff here, and he bought real roses for about $1 each online. \n\nThis seemed fine, until he went around asking for donations and admitted to me that he had to borrow money. And this was where I began to express my concern. I worried that this kid was going to get 2 Gs deep and not be able to do anything about it. Heâs a senior almost on his way to college, from a less fortunate family.\n\nNow, I went about expressing my concern the wrong way, because I hadnât fully thought out my words. I ended up saying, âHe couldâve done something more beneficial with that money. Maybe he couldâve looked after himself instead of getting all those roses.â Like an idiot, I tried to correct myself but really only made my position look worse. It ended up sounding like I didnât think this kid was being nice just to be nice. \n\nAfter the misunderstanding I was frustrated that I couldnât get my point across and that came off as bitter or unappreciative. So I just went home. I really do feel like the asshole, I also think I need to shut my mouth more often.",

So when her boyfriend is here I don't feel like staying in the living room because I'm 10 feet away from them and can hear every thing they say. \n\nProblem is her boyfriend is here a lot. Like sometimes 2 weeks straight and then leaves for maybe 4-5 days and comes back staying for a week or 2. He works in my city but lives an hour away so whenever he has shifts he stays here.  \n\nI haven't lived with someone in a serious relationship before so I don't know how having SO's around works.",

      "description": "So I met this F(22) Girl on tinder, and we hit it off really well, she lived a couple towns away from me and we met up not too long after talking. We didn't necessarily have plans to do anything, we just were going to hang out, drive around and talk. So I picked her up and we went to Walmart, I kind of let her call the shots. I wore really nice clothes that I really enjoy wearing for this first date. \n\nSo we went to Walmart, and she started picking up silly string, glitter, paint, and whenever I asked her what she was up to, she would tell me not to worry about it. I wasn't a big fan of surprises, because I felt like either she was going to fuck the inside of my car up with this shit, or do something.\n\nSo we went to the boardwalk, and hopped the fence to get onto the beach, mind you I'm still following her lead, so she just starts giving me some of the stuff she bought, and before I can object, she starts throwing paint all over my nice white shoes, my nice white dress pants. at the time I decided fuck it, and I fought back, we fought with shaving cream, paint, glitter, silly string. after that we look like idiots with paint all over us, it was very uncomfortable but kind of fun. However I'm not going to lie I still am just a little salty that my one good outfit that I recently bought was ruined.\n\nIt was a nice first date, after we kind of clean ourselves off at Walmart, we were a little clean and we had sex in the back of my car. After we finished I decided to drive her home, but she got really clingy really quick, which is fine, she took the shirt that I had to take off so it wouldn't get too much paint on it, and she held onto it and wouldn't let go, she wanted to take it, and I wasn't for it. \n\nI proceeded to sternly tell her I'm tired and I want her to go home, it's like 4am. So when I got home, we talked and it was a nice time, a week later I decided to hang out with her again at her house, which was nice but I work overnight so I came to her house without any sleep, and I needed to be at work again in the next 12 hours or so. When I'm getting ready to leave, and I'm wanting to go home so I can get some sleep, she begged me to stay, like on the verge of tears, begging me to stay and cuddle her and sleep with her, I really just wanted to go home so I told her I don't want to stay and I left.\n\nThat was the last time I've seen her, and I've been talking to her on Instagram for a while now, and one weird thing is that she started following a lot of my friends. She wants something really serious, when I don't. She's making it very weird for me, so yesterday she texted me telling me that she had a mental breakdown at school, and her schizophrenia was acting up, she told me that she was getting institutionalized, and she wanted me to reassure her that I would stay, I told her I'd still be here. But honestly I want to leave, WIBTA if I cut ties and blocked her on everything?\n\n",

Lately, when I open the fridge, the smell wafts out and sits in the room for a fair bit, and because itâs winter, I canât open a window. Itâs pretty bad, and I think the culprit is her tub of yogurt thatâs been sitting there for at least 3 months. \n\nI didnât want to just go in and throw away food that isnât mine, so I decided the best route is to tell her. So I began by saying that I think something may have spoiled in the fridge. She then said âAre you saying this because you want me to check or...?â To which I said that I only had wine and pop tarts in the fridge, so I donât know what it is, and implied lightly that whatever rotten food is in the fridge isnât mine. She said that sheâd check, but seemed really standoffish and maybe a little offended. I donât think I said anything wrong and she may have been in a bad mood, Iâm really not sure. Is bringing up that someoneâs food may have spoiled offensive?\n\nAITA for telling my roommate that her food may have spoiled in my fridge?",

The mountain also has ruins at the top. We had some free time so me and my friends go to the ruins. C sits down on some ruins and puts down his bag. I think it would be funny to steal his bag and put it somewhere safe. I take his bag and he runs after me. (Remember we are just kids, I thought we were playing) I lose him and hide the bag on a safe ledge that is quite large and isn't over the edge of the mountain. He shouts at me. Someone else steals bag and then friends take it in turns to run with it. Gets to a friend who then loses C and hides it somewhere hidden. C cannot find his bag and shouts at us. He then finds the bag. We go back down towards the meeting place. \n\nC: GIVE ME â¬10 FOR STRESS FEES *in serious tone*\n\nM: no way! That's ridiculous, I didn't hide your bag there!\n\nC:*shoves me while going down a steep path*\n\nM:*shoves him back*\n\nA fight ensues.\n\nI go away to other friends after winning as he is crying.\n\nAfter a while, F1, F2 and C come to where we are. \n\nF1: If you don't give C some money for stress, I'm going to tell, I'm going to tell!\n\nM: No!\n\nF2: alright then apologize!\n\nI then refuse and we negotiate until we come to the agreement that he apologizes to me for pushing me and I apologize for the bag and the fight. I agree to apologize for the bag, but not the fight. They deny and threaten to go tell the teachers.

      "description": "TL;DR: first semester freshman (18M) at my (20F) uni./church has been physically violent towards women (including me), stolen alcohol from church sponsored events, and attempted to break into a locked cabinet that he didnât have permission to open. AITA for wanting to tell his family and possibly our priest before he possibly escalates?\n\n~\n\nIâm a student at a university in the US south and am very active at a church that operates just off campus. Itâs a really active environment and we have around 200~300 really active students, with more joining every semester. \n\nAt the beginning of the Spring 2019 semester a young man whoâs related to a couple alumni of the university and the church started his freshman year, weâll call him Tom. I know his family fairly well and theyâre a super interesting bunch. They were all homeschooled their entire lives in a fairly small town in Texas, which effected them in different ways. Tomâs elder sister and brother are fairly well adjusted, if a little awkward occasionally. Super sweet kids. However, Tom is a much different story.\n\nIâve known him a couple of weeks now, and while he was pretty nice at first (kind of awkward but in the way that kids just going into college are), but since the semester started he has apparently lost his entire mind. \n\nThe second week of school, he figured out that a group of people at the church had a group Nerf gun (one of the big dudes, high powered) and asked me where it was. Someone else who was in the room with us told him it was in a locked cabinet, and I told him that I would not be telling him where the key was because he had literally zero reason to get into the cabinet or mess with something that was emphatically not his. He did not like this. He took out a bunch of LOCK PICKING TOOLS and begins going to town on this cabinet. Iâm telling him to stop, the guy sitting with me is YELLING at him to tell him to stop and he goes until he gives up. Strike one. \n\nLast week, someone left their keys in a room and Tom made to steal them. At this point, I knew his gambit, so I grabbed the keys before he could with the intent of returning them to their owner, a friend of mine. This kid fucking LATCHES onto my hand with his little claws and begins to attempt to claw them out of my palm. I should mention that I am by no means a small person, and Iâm pretty strong, have long limbs, the whole shebang. He is desperately trying to get these keys as I am telling him (as calmly as I can) to stop touching me and to let go of me immediately. Eventually, the keyâs owner comes back and Tom admits defeat, letting me give back the keys. I quickly realize, however, that Iâm bleeding from a scratch on the crease of my thumb from his nails or the keys. I mention this, he gets concerned and I ask him if he realizes that his actions have consequences. BIG MISTAKE. I go to clean my hand so I donât get blood on my clothes, he storms out yelling about how he âdoesnât want to deal with this.â\n\nTwo days ago, Sunday, was the final straw. I was chilling in a chair in our community room, and had not acknowledged him being in the room at all, in fact I was working on my computer and talking to some people next to me. He walks over to me and picks up a chair, hoisting it like heâs going to bring it down on my head. Someone in the room tells him not to and he puts it down because he would not be winning that fight. He immediately stomps in the space between my feet on the ground. Problem: he had no idea where my feet were because I had a fuzzy blanket from my lap to the floor, and he could have easily brought his foot down on mine. \n\nThese are just things heâs done to me or in front of me, other things Iâve heard through the grapevine are that he stole a bunch of beers from our Super Bowl party on Sunday (heâs 18, this is a church) and that he got into a physical fight with another girl at the church. Admittedly, she beat his ass and had him pinned to the floor, but he initiated the fight. \n\nI asked a few of the guys around the church to talk to him yesterday (including one who is dating his sister), but Iâm worried that wonât be enough. \n\nOur faith is very empathetic that the duty of a man is to protect and care for the women in his life, that love is gentle and kind, and that physical violence except for self defense is a no go. I donât care what you think of our faith, but I add that so that any readers will have insight into my thought process and why I might be concerned (I mean other than the obvious physical assault, theft, and attempted cabinet B&amp;E). \n\nMy concern is that Tom doesnât know or respect anyone at the church to actually listen to them.\n\nI want to escalate this to his sister (a current student), his parents, and maybe even our priest, because I think that his behavior, if unchecked, will get him arrested eventually. Or the shit beat out of him by someone who just goes ape, whichever comes first. \n\nSo, AITA for wanting to escalate small things up before they become big things? Like actually hitting me in the head with a fucking chair?",

      "description": "I am using a throwaway with no identifying information. \n\nI just graduated school and am between jobs. My significant other is the breadwinner of this relationship and is currently working 10 hour days.\n\nI have a known sleep disorder brought on by multiple medications and also anxiety. I have a very hard time falling asleep and staying asleep. I have been keeping a bed time and an alarm in the morning so I can stay on some sort of schedule while I look for work. In the mean time, I am keeping up on everything in the household. Doing all the cleaning, cooking, laundry, and whatnot. \n\nMy SO sets their alarm for 4:30 am and lets it snooze for an hour before they will get out of bed. I usually wake up around this time to pee and then try to go back to sleep while the fog is still kind of over me, so to speak. But I canât sleep when the alarm goes off every nine minutes.\n\nNaps are not an option for me. I am trying to be supportive of my SO but my sleep is one of those things I take seriously because I know what itâs like to go without. I am currently up at around 5am writing this in a crying rage because I canât go back to sleep and Iâm just so tired.\n\nI tried to find compromises with my SO and they told me âwhen you work, Iâll put up with your alarmâ. However, I did work for a long time and my alarm was never the problem. So that kind of hurt.\n\nAITA for wanting my SO to find some way to wake up thatâs not an hour long affair at 4am so I can stay on my established sleep schedule? ",

People could barge in the gym all the time if members opened the doors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell here I am, about to leave the gym on a cold, rainy morning when I see an elderly man with a cane approaching the gym. We make eye contact for a solid 20 seconds. Half of me was like, \"Damn, I shouldn't open the door for him, he'll have a membership card to open the doors\", while the other half argued, \"Jesus Christ man, it's fucking freezing outside! Open the damn door!\". Too afraid to make the wrong choice, I hastily retreat back into the gym. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10 seconds later, he enters the door and, to my demise, rips me apart and scolds me for not opening the door, feuding that a guy like myself should have some decency to open the door for an elderly man.\n\nAITA for not opening the door for him?",

      "description": "Alright based on this title, it seems obvious that Iâm a girl, but Iâm actual a guy. Anyways, December of 2017, I went to India with my family, cuz my parents are immigrants and my maternal cousins stil live in India. \n\nFor this first few days, one of my favorite cousin was in a different city because her mom was getting an operation for a tumor. She came back later, and me and my older male cousin walkled to her houes to pick her up. (Itâs about a 5 minute walk). On the way back one of her friends noticed her and wanted my cousin to hang out. She went in for a few minutes, and apparently her friend thought I was hot. Thatâs the first time that ever happened, and I know that there is no way in hell someone in the US of A would say that to me. NGL the girlâs in India have a low expectation. Anyway I get home, and there is a follow request from her on Instagram, and this is supper bizzare cuz I donât even know who she is. My cousin said under no cicumstances to let her follow me, but I decided to humor her. I had some fun just screwing around with her, purely teasing but thatâs a whole different fiasco.\n\nMoving one, some of the poeple in India have the funnist usernames (This will be important later) . There pretty far behind on fads that have happened in America. For example, fidget spinners were just introduceted therer last year. Some of the names are super edgy because of this but Iâm not gonna expose anyone here. \n\nIts been over a year, and recently her friend wished me happy birthday, which was odd because I hardly talk to her. I go to her account, and her follow ratio is fucking crazy. She has about 300 dudes following her and only follows one tik tok star from India, who recently passed away. I go full stalker mode and go through her follower list, and I find one of the funniest names of all time. The kid lives in India, and my cousin knows him, so I sent him a follow request and he accpeted about a day later.\n\nOh. My. Lord. Heâ s completely fresh of the boat, and would probably get bullied to hell in some of the public schools in America. HIs account is a gold-mine of what we would call cringe. I show him off to some off my family friends as my own personal jewl, and recently my best friend and I have had a competition to see who can get the most affection and the best response from him. My friends is currently in the lead. He kinds scared him by saying he wants to commit suicide and needed help. By far the best response.\n\nAnyways, now ALL my friends know who he is and I have begged them to add him to our group chat, but they refuse. We keep commenting on his pictures just saying stuff like I want to kiss you, I love you, you are beautiful, just the usual joking stuff. \n\nNow to my surprise, my best friend made a geroup chat including him and itâs the greatest thing that has happened since Manchester City won the league last year. Weâve been kind of leading him on, pretending we are his friends, and heâs cool about it, but hereâs the kicker. \n\nOne of my friends is an absolute dick to him. He despises him, because he commented on all his old posts. He did that to my friend to, whos been posting since 2014, and we got a kick out of it. BUT this other dude is being a complete prick. Heâs told him to fuck off cuz heâs been having a wank and has been trying to intimidate him. NOW by Indian buddy started following a joke jock at our school. THe jock thinks heâs some sort of musical genius because he uploads rap songs to his soundcloud, and when my friend follow him, he did the exact thing you arenât supposed to do. He commented on all of his old pictures including the one about him breaking up with his ex. And this dude is pretty pissed. I havenât heard from my friedn for a while cuz Iâve been busy with school and stuff. But Iâm genuinly kinda scared of what happens to him, because for the record the girls in India are a hell of a lot different and nicer than the one who reside in this beautiful country. \n\nSo am I the asshole, for potentially making him feel bad because some of the people that I have introduced to him have been super hostile towards him?\n\nThis is one of my first posts and itâs been on my mind for a while, sorry for the phrasing :)",

His father was an alcoholic and kind of just asshole-y in general, but heâs not the reason for my post. His mother has always been extremely neurotic: high strung, always frantic, very very very set in a routine, socially awkward, paranoid, easily angered, etc etc. I love her dearly regardless of her quirks, but I cannot even imagine having to live in the same house with her for 18 years.\n\nThe other night my fiancÃ© and I are talking about something crazy she did, which lead to us talking about the crazy stuff she did when he was younger. He referenced excessive cleaning and counting her silverware nightly. I asked him if he ever considered that she (and her very similar sister) could be high-functioning autistics, and he said he never really thought of that before, but 100% agreed that all of her personality traits pointed to it. I told him as soon as I met them it seemed obvious to me. I was very careful and gentle with my words, as to not seem pushy or insulting. The conversation ended but not at all on bad terms.\n\nThe next day when he got home from work he mentioned that heâd been thinking a lot about what I said and that it hit him hard. He said he felt very guilty about getting mad at her so often in his youth if she really had a disorder. I told him I hoped that I didnât come off too strongly or upset him in some way and he said I definitely didnât, I just made him think. Regardless, I feel bad that I just potentially completely changed his view on his relationship with his mother. AITA?",

She cried on the phone and I feel bad,  but living with her even just for a week drove me to hurting myself and raised my suicidal tendencies (in contrast of how utterly happy I am when I live alone) \n\nShe's clingy, hovering and a control freak. Everytime I said I planned to move country to further my career she always said 'what about me', 'who will take care of me if you live far away'. But at the same time, she always ask me for money because she's been unemployed for a long time,  and the only way for me to give her money is to search for bigger income and opportunity overseas. \n\nNow she visited me a lot already.  Everytime she did we always fought with each other to the point of tears because of our differences. I grew up poor so I always tried to save money, she grew up mostly rich so for example she likes using my money to buy *a lot* of food and useless things for me, but in the end it's too much and spoiled. She did a lot of things like that. She tried to control a lot of things in my life like the time i sleep and the time I take a shower. If I don't follow her words she will be mad. \n\nShe does that based on her love for me, I know. She's a soft old woman, she cared for her children, take care of my apartment when she visited normally, cook for us,  etc. And I love her a lot.  But I just can't stand living with her because I feel like I'm not free and it does bad things to my mental health. It's like she's still caring for a teenager or a child instead of an adult that I am. \n\nam I the asshole for doing this? \n",

      "description": "Ok. Ive been dating my girlfriend for nine months now. We are living together in a shared apartment. I make more money than her as shes unemployed and a full time student and im already working. So the bills are probably about 70/30 split.\n\nShe needs extra money sometimes for books so I pay for them. I also help out on her car note when I can. I do this because I care for her, but lately, the past month, ive been feeling like she treats me badly.\n\nAnother aspect to this is I have a form of gigantism. I was 6'3 at 14 and am 7'2 right now in my late 20s. I am close to 340lbs. I had a tumor when i was young thats now gone, and i have signs of acromegaly.\n\nThis has had a negative impact on my life. Im not able to have really normal relationships and its hard to connect with people. I cant do many physical activities due to joint pain. I am actually sort of introverted so I was actually verbally bullied somewhat in school. Physically twice when i was attacked by two separate groups of men because of my size. \n\nStill i am an adult now, and i have moved on to a career i enjoy in welding. But i am somewhat still self conscious about my body/face and my girlfriend knows this.\n\nWell we were drinking a week ago and she told me that \"i was lucky to have her\". I agreed. But she kept going, stating that i was very lucky and she could get any guy she wanted.\n\nI was upset by this and we had an argument where i pressed her about what she meant as she never said this before, and was very supportive. \n\nShe eventually said that she could do much better than me. When i asked her if she meant my looks she said \"what else?\".\n\nWhen we sobered up i told her to not expect me to pay for her books this month. She said fine, but shes also telling her friends that im being controlling. They told me this. She thinks im using money against her in a fight we had when drunk.\n\nIdk, i just feel weird about everything now. Kinda depressed as well. AITA?",

      "description": "My SO went out last night and specifically told me she wasn't going to drink. She came home way later than she ballparked before leaving, I'm understanding of that.  Turns out she got hammered and now is having a very rough morning and wants me to leave work to come home. A little back story is she lost her job recently because she took klonopin and whiskey before work and couldn't finish her shift so never went back. This causes me to have to work every weekend until she finds something else. I haven't had a day off in 3 months. When she asked me to come home I told her I couldn't leave right now. I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for not being willing to help her since my view is this is her problem not mine. She knows I don't like when she drinks especially since she willingly stopped taking her bipolar medicine and got mad when I was \" in her business\" about her medication. ",

      "description": "Throwaway for reasons. \n\nI got worked up and grew furious this couple days towards my friends. We have a group chat and yesterday i posted a simple food I made, just a sandwich with canned tuna, nothing much. And i was pretty proud and excited of it. I was excited and eager to share it because I have been battling a pretty grim depression for almost half of my lifetime. I can say that iâm better now and that being in therapy helps. \n\nBut last month somehow it started to got worse and where once I could get up and cook pretty much a proper dinner, i end up couldnât even sit properly for more than 5 minutes. Its like all the life energy was gone. But yesterday i was getting better, and i could get out of my room and assemble a sandwich albeit just a bread and a canned tuna with tomatoes. It was my first real meal after weeks of eating craps. \n\nMy friends know about my depression, they have been somehow supportive. As in, theyâd ask me how am I doing a few times a week. \n\nBut I didnât know what I did. Maybe I annoy them to their edge that when I posted the very simple sandwich I made and being proud of it, they kinda make fun of me. Saying stuffs like âis that a sandwich? I thought it was my dogâs foodâ \nâdamn it RobustFish, how can you be proud of that thing? I work six days a week 7 hours a day and you dont see me bragging donât youâ \n\nI donât know if im seeing too much into their texts, and if i do please tell me so that I can apologize to them for being too sensitive. \n\nI know that being friends with a depressed person is hard, and sometimes I could come out as super annoying. But I was furious after their mockery that day. I pretty much lashed out in the group chat and I admit I say a lot of harsh things to them. \n\nI told them that if they were in my position theyâd pretty much give up on the first day. I also told them that I may be an incompetent human but at least Iâm not as obnoxious as they are. \n\nTldr: i just wanted to know if i am the asshole for getting angry at my friends when they mock me for posting / bragging about a sandwich i made. If I am reading too much into the situation please tell me too. ",

      "description": "My (M21) girlfriend (F20) and I  have been dating for a few months and things I have been going smoothly. As good as relationships tend to be in the âhoneymoonâ phase. Recently she mentioned how a guy from work, Jim for conversation sakes, wanted to hangout with her and maybe go on a double date with us and his girlfriend. I inquired about Jim and eventually she admitted he was a guy who she was considering having a threesome with. He has asked her multiple times before her and I met to have a threesome with his girlfriend and him.   According to my girlfriend nothing came of it. She says theyâre just friends and their only contact is at work. \n\nWhen she told me all this I told her I didnât like the idea of her being so friendly with Jim and that I wasnât a fan of the idea of going on a double date. She thinks Iâm this way because Iâm jealous or donât want her to have male friends. I have defended myself by saying that itâs not that I have anything against male friends. Itâs the fact that this guy wanted to have a threesome with her and she still thinks itâs okay to be friends with him now that weâre dating. You might call me old fashion or conservative but I would prefer she didnât associate herself with Jim and basically would tell him that they should keep their relationship as professional. I should also point out that my girlfriend as mentioned us two having a threesome with another girl and I have denied that idea. Again Iâm old fashion. So  AITA for making this request or should let her continue her relationship. \n\nThank you ",

      "title": "AITA For making my boyfriend stop talking to his best friend for good",
      "description": "This has been bugging me for years. Thank you to anyone that reads it through. \n\nMy boyfriend [M20] and I [F20] have been dating for four years. Iâve known him for over six years, and even before we were dating we were best friends. He is diagnosed bipolar depressive and I have diagnosed anxiety/depression. \n\nMy boyfriend âShaneâ and his friend âDonnaâ have been friends since middle school, but only truly became friends in Highschool after they were put next to each other in class and Donna vented to Shane about how she was raped by her uncle because âshe just had to tell someone.â Since then, she was one of the closest friends Shane has ever had. He talked her out of/saved her from suicide about four times. \n\nNow, I used to really like Donna. There were no problems between the three of us, no love triangle or anything, until Shane broke up with me at one his lowest points. He felt awful, was undiagnosed, and I was the only change in his life, so he thought he had to leave me to get better. \n\nHe later figured out that he had made a mistake. Three months later, we got back together... But in that time, he was lonely. So he dated Donna.\n\nIt ripped me apart. I would go into detail about how that sucked but thatâs not the point here. \n\nWhen Donna found out that Shane and I had gotten back together, she lost it. She sent her friends after the two of us and continuously harassed us at school and on social media. They even got teachers involved so both of our grades suffered. \n\nEven with all of the harassment I couldnât be mad at her. I was just in her shoes. So I sought her out twice, one on one, to ask her if she was okay and if she needed anything. She opened up to me about her friends treated her and thanked me for my concern. When I asked her to please stop harassing Shane (she was stalking him, going into his classes, throwing things at him) she said sheâd stop. \n\nIt didnât stop. But we got good at ignoring it. \n\nFast forward a few months to the end of our senior year. Our graduation speeches were given based off auditions. I auditioned, she didnât show up. I got accepted to deliver my speech at graduation. Donna and many of her friends were not. \n\nThey didnât like that. They did everything in their power to âdefameâ me or âdebunkâ me. They did a lot of awful things. It really upset me. So when yearbooks came out, I looked at their quotes. Donnaâs said something like âwow that was a mess,â and for some reason that really triggered me. âThe mess is all your fault,â I thought. \n\nAnd so I made one of the biggest mistakes in my life. I took to social media.\n\nOn Snapchat, I posted a picture of her quote with the caption,âF*ck you, youâre valedictorian. Shut up.â\n\nThis mistake resulted in: a social media campaign to take my speech away from me, multiple threats to jump me, stalking me around campus and following me to my classes to berate me, organizing an event where almost the entire school wore black in solidarity with Donna. \n\nNo one believed my side of the story until later. In the end my speech was taken away. \n\nDonnaâs friend Janice was the one that started it all, but Donna did nothing to stop it. She wrote her own speech and published it for everyone to see, throwing in subcomments about what was going down. \n\nI was devastated. Shane was equally if not more upset because when Donna was questioned about the âbullyingâ in a meeting between the two of us and school faculty, she crocodile teared her way into their hearts and blamed Shane for everything, making him out to be a cruel, manipulative monster. I told him all of what she said about him. \n\nThis event truly scarred me. It made me realize how fleeting relationships and trust are.\n\nAfter graduation everything was fine, but a year later she was back again. \n\nShe was suddenly back in town, calling Shane and demanding to see him. He freaked out and came to my workplace to hide. She had been looking around our apartment complex for our apartment. Afterwards she went to his momâs house. Then his dadâs house. I watched his phone light up from her calls. \n\nThen, I made another grave mistake. I told him it was okay to talk to her, and that if she could own up to what she had done to us and apologize they could have a relationship again. I didnât want to take away his chance to rekindle a new friendship with his once best friend. The hope in his eyes got to me. \n\nThatâs not the way it went. He became secretive and distant. He would always be on his phone texting her. When I wanted to know what was going on he would give me very simple answers. I tried to communicate how I was feeling time and time again but he wouldnât listen, so at night when he was sleeping Iâd go through his phone. \n\nSome of the conversations were fine. Theyâd write PokÃ©mon fanfics and discuss the movies and books they liked and how each otherâs days were going. Cool. \n\nSome of it was definitely not okay. She was dependent on him like a lost lamb. Everything she did, she needed his approval and would constantly seek affirmation from him. He wouldnât give in because he knew what she wanted, but she would not let up. \n\nThe thing that got me most was how often she called him âmijo.â She would also constantly talk badly about me, saying that I was a âpoisonâ and that he should break up with me. \n\nWhen I was open with him about what I was doing, he almost exclusively talked to her on Snapchat afterwards. Oh no.\n\nI did everything I could to change things. I tried acting like nothing was happening. I went to therapy for six months. I talked to him about how I felt. He would open up to me more when I asked, but would stop because I would get visibly disturbed when he mentioned her. I just couldnât help it. I understand that I was giving a lot of mixed signals, but it was all too much for me.\n\nThe last day of the 2017, I finally got to have a heart to heart talk with him. I told him that his relationship with Donna is toxic and that I could see he was miserable talking to her, but that he also couldnât stop because she was his best friend. He was afraid sheâd kill herself without him. I told him it had to stop, that I couldnât take it anymore and I was getting suicidal myself.\n\nHe agreed. \n\nHe called her and told her that he couldnât continue his friendship with her, that she was toxic and truly hurting our relationship and he didnât appreciate how she talked about me.\n\nAs any mentally unstable person would, she didnât take it very well. She blew up his phone with calls, blubbering and sobbing voicemails, texts, Facebook messages, snapchats. \n\nThen, on January 1st, 2018, Donna was at our door. She wanted to talk to Shane. Shane came over and told her all of the same stuff he did the day before, then asked her to leave. She didnât. He asked her to leave again, told her to drive safe, and shut the door.\n\nWe sat back on the couch in a stunned silence. Then we heard whimpering. Looking out the window, we saw her dangling from the top of our two story apartment. She also smashed her phone. Shane rushed outside to stop her from trying to âkillâ herself (I donât think she wouldâve died from the jump, probably just broken some limbs). She sobbed in his arms and clung to him. He looked up at me stone cold and told me he was going to talk to her to calm her down and walk her to her car. Bystanders were in shock. They checked to make sure we were all okay. \n\nIn hindsight, we shouldâve called the police. \n\nWeeks later and nothing had changed. I was the lowest I had ever been. \n\nNothing really did change until she made another suicide attempt in her dorm room across the state. This time it was bleach, I think. She told Shane that her roommate Janice (yes, the Janice from earlier) stopped her and he called the local police there and sent them to her dorm. She was now under constant surveillance and was made to go to regular therapy appointments.\n\nThings got better, but they still werenât great. He didnât want to stop talking to her until he was sure she wouldnât off herself if he stopped talking to her. \n\nI would rollercoaster from better to worse when it came to their relationship. I would still try to bring it up and try to make her a casual topic but I never could. Sheâs caused us so much heart break, so much pain. I couldnât cope very well.\n\nA year went by and the 2019 New Years came around. I got more and more anxious each massing day. On New Yearâs Day I was a wreck. I clung to any part of good in my mind to keep myself from going off the deep end. \n\nA week after the New Years and I would have night terrors of Donna. I would watch her try to jump from my two story apartment. I would ask her to leave us alone. I would relive every sleepless night and every painful memory. After a week of that it escalated. In my nightmares I would furiously kill Donna and then myself, then wake up feeling relieved and terrified. I hated her. \n\nI told Shane. \n\nNeedless to say, he was very disturbed. \n\nI told him that Donna absolutely had to go. I couldnât do it anymore. I couldnât get passed it. For the first time, he didnât gaslight anytime in the conversation and solemnly agreed. \n\nAfter he did it about a week ago, he came over to see me with the most heart broken look in his eyes. It looked similar to when I told him I would not allow Donna to attend our wedding when we tied the knot. He laid in bed with me for about ten minutes, then left. We havenât talked about her since.\n\nIâm finally free from her now but I also feel guilty. I told myself for years that I wouldnât break up their friendship, but I did. I love Shane and heâs the person I want to spend my life with. This has been one of our only problems. But itâs a huge problem. He was addicted to this toxic relationship and no matter what kind of pain I went through, he wouldnât choose me over her. Thatâs all I wanted him to do. \n\nSo",

      "description": "This did not happen recently but in early 2017 when I was a junior in high school. It has recently come up a few times and want to get judgement from y'all. It may get a little cringey since its high school stuff but nevertheless I will continue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my friend (lets call him G) and I met in middle school when we were both new. He was the only dude that would talk to me so we instantly became friends and are still friends to this day. But one day this girl comes up. Now during the previous semester (end of 2016), I had decided to myself that I would either ask out this one girl or ask her to the school dance by the end of the next semester (lets call this girl K). It was to my surprise that in my first class of second semester she was in this class and sat next to me. But this was a special two week only course so that meant that for eight hours a day for the next two weeks I would have to sit next to K, and my goal was that much closer to being completed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the two weeks, me and K began to talk everyday and even after school. On the field trip we sat next to each other on the bus there and back and we did all the other things to high school kids would do. At the same time, my friend G was also talking to her. This never raised any suspicions because, well I was ignorant at the time. But I tried to make my advances more clear with K after this. It was a common consensus in our friend group that I liked this girl and they would even tease me about it--common high school stuff. About a month before the dance  G confronts me and tells me that I need to ask K to the looming dance or that he will. This struck me because I did not think that he was considering trying to go with this girl even though I was well on my way to doing the same thing. But I responded to him and said that I was going to ask her and at that point I thought he backed off from this girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day comes for me to ask K to the dance, and we sit next to each other (I did not plan on asking her now) in assembly. She turns to me during assembly and flat out says, \"When are you asking me to the dance?\" at this point I froze because I was so shocked and barely whispered out an IDK really quick. It got kind of awkward after that but it was fine. Last class of the day I was working with G on a project in a quiet room when I broke him the news. I told him that K had asked me when I was going to ask her to the dance to try and insinuate that the race was over. He said something along the lines of, \"Wow, oh damn. Well how about you ask another girl instead?\" Now this set off an alarm in my head because he would usually be the one to say go for it or seal the deal. But instead he told me to go for another girl. He acted all weird about it and the conversation stopped there. After school K stopped me and said that the whole dance thing was a joke and to forget about it. I told her ok but I knew something was up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then messaged her when I was home if she wanted to go even after what she told me at school. She said no and explained that she probably was not going to go anymore (!!!!!). I thought nothing of this and carried on. The next day was Saturday and I woke up to a bombardment of text messages all saying the same thing. G had already asked K to the dance the previous day and thats why they had acted all weird about it. To add on to that, they had both agreed to not tell me and keep it a secret. So even after I told him I was going to ask her, and after he knew I liked her, he still went on with it. That weekend I ignored both of their messages and pretty much any messages sent to me in total. That next Monday at the lunch table, my friends roasted me about how G had taken my girl and asked me why I was so butthurt about it. After 10 minutes of this ridicule, I pulled out my phone and blocked G and K on all social media platforms and I abruptly left the table. After this I did not speak to G until 7 months later well into our senior year of high school. I did not speak, or even look at him during this time. Which was pretty hard since we had many classes together and sat next to each other. We didn't hang out at all, and my friends would try to get together with us separately so me and G wouldn't have to be around each other. Eventually I ended up unblocking K but not G. Then I found out that they hung out all the next weekend, then the next, then eventually they started dating. Now every time after this I looked at either one of them I was overcome by pain since this was truly the first girl I ever really liked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow me and G are on good terms, as close as ever, go to the same University together, and even rooming in an apartment for Sophomore year. At the time of this story, he tried to communicate to me that he felt as though he had done nothing wrong and that I was acting like a  baby. But now currently, he has realized his mistake and apologized multiple times. So AITA for blocking him and cutting off all communication after he dated behind my back the girl I liked?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "For context I've been socially awkward my entire life, but was at my worst in the seventh grade (13-15 years old). I didn't really understand boundaries both physical and verbal, or how to make friends. I had been bullied a lot over the years, to the point where I was suicidal but I somehow thankfully survived and have an incredible life now. My social skills have improved tremendously over the past few years, and while I still don't act properly in every situation I now have made a good group of awesome friends who let me know when I'm being weird, and have helped me learn how to behave properly. But before then when I was being bullied I was constantly told that I was A) retarded and B) that I shouldn't be in a grade school but actually an institution or program for mentally disabled children and that my parents were paying my school lots of money to keep me enrolled in it. This became common knowledge and everyone basically knew me as the \"special kid\" that was there only because of my parents, even other parents believed this and I would catch them saying things like \"it's a disservice to keep him here when he needs to be in an institution.\" I even started believing this due to my poor grades and stopped believing my parents when they told me it was just a rumour spread around by some mean kids. I truly thought I was retarded with anger issues and mental health problems my parents wouldn't tell me about, I was in a really dark place. While playing some magic with my friends this weekend my one friend \"John\" let me know that all those rumours had originated from him. I was shocked, he was a good friend of mine whom I'd become close with in highschool. I asked him why he would spread those vile rumours about me and he just responded with \"I didn't like you in elementary and thought you were actually retarded.\" And then he just kept playing like it was nothing. He wasn't sorry in the slightest, I pressed him for more info and he just told me it was a long time ago and I should just drop it. I don't think he realizes how much those rumours fucked me up, there are still times where I see the parents of old classmates and they talk to me as if I'm slow. I hid a noose in the changeroom of our school gym for over five years, and he brushes this off like it's nothing. So am I the asshole for wanting a little more of an apology from this guy? Sorry for such a long post everyone, this is actually my first post on Reddit and I just needed to rant for a bit so I appreciate all those who read it.\n\nTldr a friend of mine spread rumours that I was retarded back in elementary school and won't apologize for it now since we're adults and it happened a long time ago. Also got annoyed with me  and told me to drop it when I pressed the issue further.",

Part of me feels like Iâm doing him a favor but part of me thinks I should have just told him the whole truth.

At no point did they sound distressed. \n\nThis isn't the first time I've done this, and whenever I casually mention it to my husband he is *appalled* and accuses me of ignoring/neglecting them. He feels I should be leaping out of bed the second they make a peep!\n\nI mean, we have two video monitors (one pointed at each crib). I can see that they aren't in any danger. I can hear that they are content. \n\nI don't feel like a neglectful parent, but what do you guys think? AITA here?\n",

I politely walked up to the owner and had the following exchange:\n\n( O = Owner of the pup, F = Friend and ya know Me = Me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Excuse me Ma'am would it be okay if i could pet your dog?\"\n\nO: \"Oh Hello yes of course you may!\"\n\nso i happily start petting the dog and making small talk about sighthounds and then i think \"Hey my mum would love this dog\" So i proceed to ask\n\nMe: \"Would it be alright if i were to take a photo of her to show my mother?\"\n\nO: \"Sure!\" \n\nO: ( to Banana, the dog) \"Banana sit girl\"\n\nAnd while banana was interested in my food she wouldnt sit but i still snapped some pics, and the woman even offered to take a photo of me petting her but i said it was fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the issue, after i walked away and thanked the woman, i was in a great mood so i sent the pics to my group chat and talked about me seeing this dog, i receive this message in return\n\nF: \"tbh its weird you took a picture of someones dog\"\n\n(She then mentioned how she would be pissed off if someone took pictures of her dog)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo im just confused about how its weird when i asked the owner and she said it was okay, But Am i an asshole for taking a picture of someones dog?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n( I would attach said dog pictures but now im not sure i should even have them) ",

      "description": "Iâll try keep this brief. Thereâs a TLDR at the bottom. \n\nMy boyfriend, Brian, and I have a friend. Weâll call this friend Thomas. Weâve been friends with him for years, having met in high school. At the risk of sounding self serving, weâve supported him through a lot. I got him a job at my work when he said he hated his own job. Both the boys play football and so Brian has driven them to training every week a two hour round trip, always refusing to take a penny from him because âIâd have been driving that way anywayâ. We stayed up with him all night when he said he was depressed, drove him to doctors appointments and made sure he was taking his medication. We cancelled out dates to hang out with him if he was lonely or low. We did all these things because he was our friend -  and who doesnât want to support their friends? We loved him like a brother. \n\nHe recently decided he didnât like working with me, and applied for an overseas job, 6 months away then 6 months back. This will become relevant later.  \n\nAt the end of summer he got a girlfriend, letâs call her Jenny, having complained for a long time that he was single and there was no good girls left. We were thrilled for him, and arranged a double date to get to know her. While there he was rude to us, acting very strange. He wouldnât speak to us the whole night, and as I drove everyone home he sat and texted her in the backseat instead of talking. We later found out he thought we acted âabove himâ and constantly âinterrupted him while he was talkingâ. His new girlfriend Jenny told us all this, but finished her message with âIf Iâm being honest, you were the opposite all night, always leaving space for us to tell stories, and weâre so welcoming - I donât know where heâs got this fromâ. \n\nI felt awful regardless, and pleaded with Thomas to make up. Eventually he did, saying he âwas still disappointed in his so-called friendsâ but he was willing to try trust us again. \n\nHe had begun falling out with everyone, dramatically leaving group chats, bombarding us with messages about who was âfakeâ and how he count trust anyone. Heâd always been a sensitive guy, but this was more extreme than ever. We tried to reason with him, but he was always stubborn. \n\n2 weeks later we were hit with the bombshell that Thomas had tried to cheat on Jenny with a mutual acquaintance of him and Brianâs. He had messaged this girl, asking her to meet him, âmy girlfriend doesnât have to know. Youâre so sexy babyâ etc. She worked out he was in a relationship, and messaged Jenny - telling her everything. \n\nJenny was devastated, and Thomas was volatile - blaming the girl _he_ messaged for âruining his relationshipâ when he was the one who messaged her asking for sex.\n\n He told Jenny he âcouldnât live without herâ and there was no way he could go on. We were furious with him, however we were worried, with his history of poor mental health, and collected him from his house. We set him up on Brianâs couch, driving him to school the next morning. I asked him if I should take him to the hospital, if he really thought about suicide, and he said he hadnât - he just thought it would make Jenny stay. \n\nWe found out later from the girl he messaged that he messaged her again, saying he hoped she was happy, sheâd âruined her lifeâ and that his friends âhad to take him to hospital because he was so depressed about itâ. We did no such thing - he lied to her to make her feel bad. \n\nThomas and Jennyâs relationship never recovered, and theyâve been separated for a month now.\n\n\nAt the weekend Thomas had a leaving party for his new overseas job. Brian and I had plans, an event his parents bought us for Christmas, but said weâd try show up later. Our plans ran on much longer than we anticipated, and by the time we were done it would have been too late to show up as I was working at 8am the next morning and wouldnât have arrived at the bar until 1 - the bar was in a town 45 minutes away. We messaged him saying we were sorry, that we didnât plan on the event lasting as long as it had, and that we would take him out before he left for his new job. He ignored the messages. \n\nTwo nights ago he messages Brian, calling him all sorts of names. âI was talking to Sarah (the girl he messaged looking for a hookup that ended his relationship). She said you took her side, fuck you how could you do this, thanks for being a friendâ\n\nWe were confused, we deliberately didnât take sides - but his relationship ended because he tried to cheat, of course we didnât condone that?\n\nWe explained as such, trying to calm him down, and he got angrier, saying we were fake friends and he knew we just couldnât be arsed with his party, that he was leaving and didnât care about him, he was cutting us off completely. We responded saying âwe loved you like a brother. Safe travels, please look after yourselfâ. \n\nI was in tears, feeling like Iâd been dumped, confused as to how it happened. I felt so guilty - but confused as I hadnât actually _done_ anything as far as I could see. \n\nHowever, now looking back, Thomas was always take-take-take from the relationship. Never interested in hearing how my week was, never giving any emotional input back, just always asking for us favours and to sort out his messes.  Weâre all 21, and I donât want to play these juvenile high school games any more. \n\nTLDR - friend has a history of shitty attitude. Heâs lashed out at us for no reason, accusing us of all sorts, and tried to ghost himself from us. \n\nWIBTA if I let him cut me (and Brian) off? If I didnât fight for our friendship despite it lasting 5+ years?\nTIA\n",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to return to a music festival where I was arrested?",
      "description": "A little backstory here first: \n\nI went to a music festival two years ago with some of my \"festival family\" friends - people I have been really close to who travel the festival circuit annually. You can find a large chunk of them at any commercial festival in the US. Regrettably, I had a little too much fun and made some childish mistakes. I was arrested and charged with a felony for drug possession. In the end, I did a hell of a lot and the charge was dismissed. Then, I paid for it to be expunged. \n\nIt was really difficult for me to overcome for obvious reasons. Additionally, I began my first semester of law school the fall after that summer. Since then, I have dealt with limitless family and friend backlash. It was a whole ordeal, and maybe rightfully so, but eventually I handled and sorted it out. \n\nFast forward through all of it, and one of my friends who attended this festival with me asked if I wanted to return. Honestly, I thought it was kind of a joke and was playfully like \"lol yeah no fucking way.\" I genuinely believe he felt bad for me for what happened, but it wasn't really his problem, and he never *really* cared I don't think. He's also an older festival veteran, maybe like 50 years old, whereas I'm in my 20s. Anyway, he took this like really hard. He demanded to know why I couldn't go, said he told all of the group I would be attending and they're excited to see me, and that I was incredibly lucky for having the whole incident basically wiped from my record - so I'm essentially squandering my blessing in the criminal justice system by refusing to return to the festival.\n\nFirst, this response felt overwhelming. I mean, not to be dramatic, but the experience overall near ruined all music festivals and shows for me. They were a big part of my life and I've lost a lot of interest in that scene, moreover, I'm super safe with everything I do now. I stay away from people doing things and involving themselves in situations I wouldn't like to be caught in again. Specifically, I never  want to return to this particular event. I told him that, and that it felt like a horrible, painful idea to go back. I never even intend on going back to that state tbh, there's absolutely no reason. In fact, I phrased it, \"I can't go back,\" and he really chewed my ass out for saying \"can't.\" \n\nI thought after the severe tongue-lashing that it would end. But over the course of another month, he continued to be pissed off. Moreover, he got other people to reach out to me. Suffice it to say that I feel incredibly guilty. I feel guilty that I \"got off\" and other people can't. I feel bad I let all my friends down. And I feel wore down honestly. Is it really such a big deal to go back, I'm confident in myself that I'm **never** going to be involved in those activities again, so I could just stay far away and clean from the potential issues. Also, I just feel like everyone is kind of upset with me and thinks that I'm suck. I mean not to sound lame, but I don't want this great community of people who I love to hate me because I can't (or okay - I don't want to) return to this one festival. My feelings don't seem to be enough though. People are offering to buy my tickets, drive me there, fly me there, do anything, and I'm starting to just feel like an asshole, haha.\n\nI guess I could be completely overreacting to the situation and I could just go back to please everyone and save our friendships.

Boyfriend (45) and I are just happy that we found each other and are so in love that we would be happy with even a drive through wedding right now.\n\nA friend of ours (who has known BF for many many moons) has been kind enough to offer up his back yard in the country that has an outdoor kitchen and in ground pool for us to have the event. This is perfect for us as we don't want a big, white church wedding. The event is actually shaping up to be more of a cook out/pool party with simple \"I dos\" thrown in the mix. No wedding cake, no flowers, wear your jeans, have a beer, backyard hangout around a wedding. Because of this we have decided to keep the guest list to under 20 people.\n\nGuest list break down because this is why I'm asking AITA:\n\nGroom\n\nBride\n\nGroom's daughter\n\nGroom's 2 grand children\n\nBride's daughter\n\nBride's son\n\nBride's mom\n\nGroom's 2 best guy friends\n\nBride's 2 best friends (1 is the guy that wants to get lucky)\n\nFriend and his wife (they own the house where this will be held)\n\nAnd that's it! Like I said.... more cook out/pool party than anything. \n\nWhen I told all of this to my best guy friend (known him since kindergarten/ family friend etc) he and I then wind up in this conversation...\n\nHim: Hopefully there will a single lady there for me to meet and go home with.\n\nMe: I told you who was going to be there. I don't even know any single ladies to invite.\n\nHim: Well you have time to make some new friends.\n\nMe: Yeah between work, grand kids, my kids etc I will get right on that.\n\nHim: Well I won't come if there is not going to be any single women. \n\nMe: Then you may not want to come.\n\nHe then sends a very lengthy text about how I owe him because I have known him even longer than I have known the man I'm going to marry and how mad he is and thinking that he just won't come anyway.\n\nSo, AITA since I don't want to add or really even know how I would add to my guest list for my wedding?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR Guy friend I have knows since kindergarten is mad and may not attend my wedding because I do not know a single lady that would be interested in him that I could add to my very short guest list.

      "description": "I am currently 18 weeks pregnant and am kind of at an impasse with my fiancÃ©. He really wants to know our babyâs gender beforehand. I really would prefer to wait and be surprised when the baby gets her. Neither of our reasons are really âbetterâ than the otherâs - it really seems to be a matter of preference, but I donât know how to compromise. Part of me feels like since Iâm the one carrying the baby I should have the final say about a gender reveal, but Iâm not sure how logical or fair that position is. Another part of me acknowledges how, as the father, his opinion matters a lot and maybe I should compromise and just let the doctor tell us at our next scan.\n\nHeâs offered to have the doctor just tell him, and swears heâll keep it to himself. I donât think thatâs possible. He really wants a girl and I feel like, if nothing else, Iâd be able to gauge the gender just from his reaction.\n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "Mobile, not native language, spelling errors blabla...\n\n\nFirst of all, this is jn highschool and isnât anything major, but Iâm still not sure if Iâm at fault and would like some outside opinions.\n\nA couple months ago 2 of my friends (call them John and Lisa) started dating and at the time John was one of my best friends. Lisa an I also got along well but I was much closer with John. During their relationship I noticed that the way they behaved towards eachother didntât change. They seemed like their relationship wasnât going anywhere. At the time i didnât really care and was only concerned about the fact that if they were to break up, I would have 2 friends who will be very awkward when together. \n\nAfter about 2-3 weeks me and Lisa started talking more. We talked about all sorts of things and sometimes about their relationship. Now I am the kind of person who calls people honey and send hearts (even to my male friends) to make jokes and to tease people. \n\nSo I also did this to Lisa, thinking John would understand as I always do this, especially to him. But after a while Lisa tells me John had been complaining that we sending each other such affectionate texts, while they were in a relationship. Now, they had been together for about a month and Lisa had told me she was beginning to get fed up with how John never did anything with the relationship. They were basically just friends but in a relationship on paper. \n\nMe and Lisa had become good friends but then one time told me she wanted to break up with John because she thought it wasnât going to lead anywhere and they had become pretty fed up with each other. I gave her some advice and told her she should take time to think about it and then decide if she was going to break up. I also told her she should do it in person because I knew Johnâs previous relationship ended badly because someone broke up with him with a quick text.\n\nI had a talk with John the next day and he told me he still wants to stay with her. I also asked him if I should stop texting his girlfriend, but he told me âNo ofcourse not, I would be a bad friend and a bad boyfriend if I forbade you talking with my girlfriendâ. I was relieved but that didnât last long.\n\nAfter a few days John tells me that he broke up with Lisa and that I should go get her. I asked him what he meant by that and he told me I knew what he meant. So, of course I got pretty mad at him because I trusted what he said, and told him that I hadnât any intentions of going after his gf.\nI told him i was sorry they broke up and ended the conversation.\n\nA few minutes later Lisa told me they broke up, and that it apparently didnât go well because she got pretty mad at John when he texted her to break up, exactly the way I told her his previous relationship ended. She demanded he at least to be called and after an awkward phone call, they had broken up.\n\nAnyway, after this me an Lisa kept being good friends but me an John started to drift apart. Exactly what I had feared.\n\nYesterday someone told me I had fucked John over by trying to steal his gf, which gave me the reason to make this post. \n\n\nAITA and did I cause their breakup?\n\n\n",

Also I should add that due to my friend having bad anxiety, she hasn't gotten her license yet.\n\nSo this morning I'm two minutes away from my friend's house, a good half hour from my house, when I get a text from her saying that her fiancee is back and I don't need to pick her up. Cool, but it would have been nice to get some kind of message that I wasn't needed as a taxi service anymore. \n\nIt might seem little to not that many people but I see it as rude to not tell me that I wasn't needed and left in the dark about wasting time driving a half hour to her place only to get a message saying I wasn't needed anymore. So I got mad and asked in a calm voice with a tinge of anger, why I wasn't told that I wasn't needed this morning like when she got up instead of the two minutes before I reached her house.",

I saw crap that effin sucked. Subscribed to titty models in Twitter, snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, tumblr.. lots of them. All over his phone. His direct messages are all clean. Too clean. So now im yelling, threatening to leave, and convicting him of being two-faced and a liar. I even scared both our cats while yelling. Now I  locked myself in the bathroom. Am I the a hole for saying ill be cool about it, and then hella blowing up? AiTA for being disgusted? Am I the a hole for not wanting to trust him anymore? I cant even look at him without thinking that theres more to him than I thought. It hurts to feel like there are two separate entities of a person you love. A person you trust, and lust for, only to be doing God knows what while subscribing to so many sexual accounts. To be a guy must be so easy. \n\nMiddle finger love.",

      "description": "First things first, I have been the asshole in my relationship with my sister in the past. I am fully aware of it. I have been a bad brother in the sens that I was too involved in her love life, I hated her then boyfriend (now fiancÃ©) and I still canât get along that well with him. Back then, I was watching her every move and at its peak had caused her to go into a panic attack. I have been a bad brother and I know it. \n\nIt got so bad between us that she literally told me to leave her alone and not get involved in her life ever again, which I did.\n\nDue to that rupture in our relationship on the one hand, and me losing my job and questioning my own life choices in the other, I suffered from sever depression and had developed a suicidal tendency. If it wasnât for a good friend of mine, I wouldnât be here telling you this story. It took me a lot of effort (and therapy) to get out of that mind state. \n\nNow that time has gone by (2 years) she is slowly trying to reconnect with me. She is getting engaged in six months. But I donât want to reconnect with her. We hurt each other so badly that I donât see us ever going back to the relationship we once had. \n\n\nShe is trying to get involved in my life, sheâs asking my if I have a girlfriend and if I am mentally ok!? I donât want to talk to her. It took me so much time and energy to come out of my depression. I just want to concentrate on being happy on my own. She thinks Iâm lonely and depressed. I think I just donât need to be in a relationship right now, what I need is time to heal and find my true self. But she doesnât seem to get that. \n\n\nAlthough i donât approve of her life choices I am happy for her. But that doesnât mean that I want to reconnect with her and open up to her. I believe that our relationship will never be the same again. But she still thinks otherwise. And I am sick and tired of her attempts to reconnect with me.\n\n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting to reconnect with my sister!?",

Now, we have another coworker, S, and S doesnât do karate and is only there as a sales person. \n\nWhen A noticed that S wasnât in the group, he made another group chat with S in it (theyâre dating, which is probably why he did that).

Iâve changed a lot since this happened and I donât know how to make it right. should i give up? should i keep trying? \nheâs constantly in a bad mood, donât want to have intimacy because he says i ruined it for both of us. and i donât blame him. but itâs hard. idk what to do. \n ",

We took 2 of the same classes, but he was behind me in credits bc the semester prior he was put on probation for failing 2 classes. \n\nAcademically, he did ok while we were dating. I set up study dates for us to make sure he would do the assignments because if I left him to do them himself he wouldnât do them. We got into a few fights about it but we were able to make it work. \n\nAs it was getting to the end of the semester he had skipped a week and a half of classes due to him playing video games until 4am and sleeping the entire day. We argued and eventually broke things off. \n\nHe was put on probation again due to his grades not being up by the end of the semester. Surprisingly, he was still enrolled at my university Fall semester 2018, I offered to help him with the classes he was taking bc we decided we wanted to stay friends after we broke up. But he ended up getting a new girlfriend and distanced himself from me. \n\nA few days ago I was scrolling through Facebook and saw that he changed his education from our University to the local community college and in the comments he told one of his friends from home that he had been kicked out of our university. \n\nI had to laugh because we broke up bc I was ânaggingâ him too much about school but then his ass gets kicked out. Thereâs a part of me thatâs just like âI told you soâ and then thereâs another part of me that is kicking myself because I shouldnât be spending so much time thinking about my exâa misfortunes.

He was the smart kid, and had shitty parents that took his phone and had it only on weekends.\n\nHe started being rebel since 8th grade, fights with his parents, hid his phone and the most important. He started being aggressive. We had this game, you scare someone and if you move your head away, we could hit you on the arm, first time it was light, then harder, and on the 3rd was hardest. He did this a lot to me, and when i wanted to do the same, he was moving away, so i can hit him, right? No, he wasnt scared. At one point i had a lot of bruises on myself.\n\nI came to F2 to do a group work, it was me F2 and F. We did it and played some games. I bought an can of Monster Energy and F and F2 wanted to drink it, i refused to give it to them. F started to hit me with a pillow the hardest as he could, i was telling him to stop but he didnt. F2 was recording this. \n\nNext day almost the whole class laughed at me. On a break, F and one other guy started kicking me and tryed to steal my stuff. I tryed to stop the tears, but i coudnt. We had to go to the pedagog, and had to say what happened. The teachers told me that they have seen the video that F2 recorded, and F will be punished, the punishment would be at least a worse behavior thing on a end of year paper. \n\nAfter this grade we have to switch schools, and none of the good schools will accept someone with a bad behavior. So F will get into a worse school, then worse college, and have a worse job.\n\nAITA for ruining his life or is it me overreacting to everything? ",

      "description": "So about 2 years ago, when I was a junior in high school, I dated someone who I considered one of my best freinds. We had known each other for almost 5 years before that and we both grew mutually closer, to the point where we actually able to plan half of our classes together for both semesters. She asked me out and we dated for a solid 3 months. During the time where we lived had a record breaking winter in every possible sense of the word so we didn't get to spend as much time together as we would have liked. I still ended up at the least being able to drop of her Christmas present to her home. However around February, with still a solid foot of snow on the ground, she sends me a text saying that she thinks we should separate because things aren't working out. I try and play my case and try to give her ways that I would try and improve. More phone calls making more plans when the snow finally thawed ect. But after a back and forth she finally revealed to me that she was already making plans to try and date one of my other friends. I had known this friend since 1sr grade and we have actually been drifting slowly apart in recent years but we still have that life long bond that will always be there. Since that day I have not talked to her despite her attempts of trying to say \"let it go it's in the past let's just revert to how we used to be\" and I could not stand that kind of logic. Honestly I was heart broken and the worst part is I just feel like I was blind to everything she was doing. Shortly before we had gotten together she was going through troubles with her anxiety and then current boyfriend. She had used me for emotional support then. I'll admit I was probably an asshole for being willing to be a rebound for her after she broke up with her previous boyfriend before me.but I can't help but feel she had just been using me so she doesn't have to deal with her problems. \n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for being a rebound boyfriend that then refused to talk to her after being broken up with via text.",

I've known these people for almost 4 years, to the point that they feel like siblings, but recently it seems from my perspective that everyone has started to wretch at the thought of me joining in on group activities. When I ask, however, I've been told that the things people have said to make me feel that way were meant as jokes, and either reality seems equally plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my friends have almost always thrown insults at each other in a friendly way, but I was always the most sensitive to it. I got to where I'd get genuinely angry, or even cry when it was wildly disproportional to the shade thrown. Recently, these jokes have seemed to get more malicious, particularly towards me, and this is an example of something that i remember being said:\n\n(SF = snarky friend)\n\nme: (something about the game we were playing)\n\nSF: wow are you still here?\n\nme(frustrated, feeling like i know where this is headed): yeah SF, I never left.\n\nSF: yeah, literally nobody gives a shit, shut the fuck up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor this situation with a different person, but still identified as SF\n\nme: (sends some sort of tumblr funnypost or something)\n\nSF: Would have been funny if someone else sent it...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, a few times the first SF has said \"you know we have group calls without you\" and stuff of the like, in kind of a teasing tone. stuff that really strikes some of my deepest insecurities, but I can't tell if he's being sarcastic or serious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI genuinely can't get a read on if this is actual harassment or if I'm just overreacting to something any of them would say is a joke, but I'm getting fed up with it and thinking about leaving altogether, so I'd like to see what a bunch of strangers on the internet think. Would I be the asshole for ghosting them? If something is unclear, I can provide details, but it spans such a long time frame it was kinda hard to think of what to include and what not to, so I tried to keep to more recent things.",

      "description": "Bear with me, I want to be as fair as possible to get an honest judgment and that requires giving context...\n\nI didnât grow up with a close family and have been more or less on my own with my husband and kids living overseas for my entire adult life. Iâm not the type to send holiday cards out and I never stayed in touch with anyone from my family outside of a few random messages here and there. Iâve mostly only spent time with my husbandâs family. We moved back to the states and back to my hometown a few years ago because I was having health problems during my pregnancy. Nobody lives here anymore except for my aunt and cousin. I had stayed with them for maybe a year or so when I was a child and my parents were getting a divorce. The time I spent with them was nice and I always looked back on that time fondly. My aunt and cousin visited across state lines during my first baby shower years later although I didnât get to spend much time with them. During my time overseas I sent my aunt a rosary I bought at the Vatican (my family is Catholic. Iâm not religious myself) and sent my cousin a gift card and some things from Europe when she had her first baby.\n\nSince being back, theyâve made me feel welcome although there have been a few awkward moments... At one point my aunt and cousin separately asked if they could visit and have lunch with me on the same weekend, but shortly before that my cousin had mentioned she wasnât getting along with my aunt. I wasnât sure how to approach it. I didnât want to insult anyone by inviting one and not the other, but I also didnât want to get in the middle of it or somehow cause even bigger problems between them. So I ignored the messages. I admit, I could have handled it better by leaving it up to them to decide whether or not to spend time together or I could have made up an excuse, but I just didnât think of that. Lies donât come easy to me so I didnât even see that as an option. Well, apparently the reason they asked to visit was because my sister had started chatting with our aunt more and had mentioned to them that I was kind of bummed I wouldnât get to have a celebration for baby #2 since none of my friends live nearby. When I didnât respond to them asking to visit, my aunt blew up at my sister and went on a rant about how, âNow she understands why my Dad dumped [us] for his new step-family,â and such. Basically weaponizing whatever my sister had confided in her about our family. It was weird. But after realizing what they were planning, I immediately apologized and explained I hadnât wanted to get in the middle of whatever argument my cousin and her were having. My aunt responded huffily, but overall we moved past it. They threw me a baby shower and they were very generous and I was grateful.\n\nAt some point my aunt moved to a different house nearby and offered to let me have one of their older beater cars. I asked if she was sure that was okay and eventually accepted since we figured my husband could use it as a commute car. They went out of their way to get it to me because they couldnât get it started and had it towed a few hours. We got a new battery for it and a few other parts, but could never keep it working past the first month. I never admitted that to her because I didnât want to seem rude or ungrateful. My point in bringing it up is that they have tried to be generous and I try to make sure they know Iâm appreciative. The gesture meant a lot and as they say, âItâs the thought that counts.â They invited me over for Easter and Christmas. The first Christmas was a little awkward because I brought flowers and food, but didnât realize there would be a gift exchange (my husbandâs family is a lot larger than mine so we rarely exchange gifts with any adults - just the kids).\n\nMy sister recently told me my aunt told her that my cousin feels like Iâve snubbed them. I guess because I never invite them over or something? Iâm not totally sure since nobody said anything to me directly. Again, thatâs not something Iâm used to doing. With my husbandâs family, we always meet at the house thatâs biggest and my cousinâs house is much bigger than mine. I also had a specific reason not to invite them to anything last year. Last year, I found my older brother living in a kind of halfway home. He had basically been abandoned by our parents over a decade ago when he developed a mental illness. This has always been a sore spot in my immediate family and is the reason Iâm not very close with my parents. My sister seemed to hold a grudge with them for the same reason. Long story short, we live nearby now and are better off financially these days so I let my brother move in hoping I could improve his quality of life. It lasted about 6 months, but unfortunately we couldnât help as much as we thought we would be able to. He started having violent episodes and causing a lot of damage around our home. I was/am extremely saddened about the whole situation so I was pretty withdrawn over the holidays. The entire time my brother lived with me, my sister never asked about him or how I was doing which was a surprise since we literally spent the past decade complaining about how our parents should have done more for him. Over that period, my parents showed more concern than she did. Over the last few years Iâve come to realize my sister and I have very different values and priorities, but thatâs a story for a different time... I ended up withdrawing from both Spring and Fall semesters (when my brother moved in and when he moved out). Summer I threw myself back into my classes and made A+ in all 4 courses. Point being, I was pretty busy last year between school and my brother and taking care of my regular duties as a mother.\n\nMy brotherâs mental illness is unpredictable and given my familyâs historical lack of interest in his well-being, I didnât want to put my aunt and cousin on the spot by inviting them over to a situation they might be uncomfortable with. Again, perhaps I shouldâve let them have the choice to decide what to do. I did post some pictures of us during the summer to show he was doing well (which he was, at first) and the food I had made. But I guess my aunt and cousin just took it as me having big parties and not inviting them. My sister said she tried to explain about my brother, which Iâm kind of annoyed by. My sister is the type of person that always tries to put herself in a flattering spotlight and she really had nothing to do with my brother last year and I have no idea how she tried to spin it. Sheâs very much a know-it-all âI can do no wrongâ type. Even after she supposedly explained to them, nobody reached out to me.\n\nAm I the asshole for being reluctant to reach out to clear things up? I can admit that I havenât reciprocated as much as I probably should have. Iâm a bit socially awkward and having âfamilyâ nearby is just not something Iâm used to so I donât really think about it much if Iâm honest. Iâm an introvert and usually just wait for other people to do the inviting. Theyâve done a lot for me and I appreciate it, but it bothers me that nobodyâs talking to me about their feelings directly. It kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth because it feels more like theyâre gossiping. I also feel like overreacting is becoming a bit of a pattern with them. My frustration with my sister might also be adding to my reluctance to reach out since sheâs apparently close to our aunt now.",

      "description": "Quick backstory. This all happened quite a few years ago but it still sometimes pangs me. Basically, I'd been on-and-off dating a girl for about 12 months. We had a lot of fun, but she had a major problem with snooping - on one occasion, not merely logging into my facebook, but actually deleting someone she thought I shouldn't be friends with. When confronted about this, she was apologetic and said 'yeah, I know, I get kind of crazy sometimes'. I should also add that I never cheated on her, but because of the on-off nature of the relationship, I had had some recent hookups not with her. For my part, I'm not too strict about boundaries, so forgave her after the snooping incidents.\n\nFast forward to the end of the relationship. Basically we were bickering way too much and I just snapped and said \"I've had enough.\" We talked it through, and she said we should take a week away from each other, think carefully about what we regarded as the pros and cons of the relationship, and write up a list. These lists were intended to be private, serving as essentially personal discussion notes for a subsequent meeting. I did this, trying to be extremely honest with myself. Among the things I put on the list were some pretty blunt stuff, like I had always felt she was more attracted to me than I was to her, and that I wasn't wild about her body type. There were probably some other pretty damning items on there too.\n\nSo, then we have the meeting. We're at her place, drinking wine, she's running through some items from her list, noting the things that she regards as our strengths and weaknesses. I run through my list too, being careful to filter and rephrase as I go along - e.g., talking vaguely about 'flagging passion' rather than my lapsed attraction to her. The conversation is mostly productive. Eventually, I take a bathroom break, and I leave the list on the arm of the chair I was sitting on.\n\nI get back from the bathroom, and she's sitting there in tears. *Of course* she's read the fucking thing. She couldn't help herself. She says \"I don't think I could ever be with anyone who finds me so unattractive.\" I ask her what the hell was she thinking looking at a private document. She says I absolutely knew her well enough to realise that she would do it, and why would I leave it out if I didn't want her to look.\n\n(FWIW, I don't *think* I left it out deliberately, either as a self-esteem boobytrap for her or even a test. I'm just kind of forgetful and had been drinking wine. But the human mind is a funny thing. Maybe at an unconscious level I knew it was a risk.)\n\nSo, anyway, we broke up. I normally try to stay friends with exes, but she made it very clear that she regarded leaving out the list of her flaws as an asshole move and one that hurt her a lot. So tell me reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So, long time lurker, first time poster. Also on mobile and feeling a little distressed, so bear with me.\n\nAbout a year ago I moved from Brazil to Portugal, and around that time, right before making the Atlantic crossing voyage, I made sure to visit a long time, very distant living friend (she lives 6 hours away from my parents).\n\nI'll be honest, we're not best friends, not even close. She was always kind of distant, and had already let me down or stood me up a few times in the past. The reason why she's so important to me is because she's the only contact I have left from that part of my life (my family and I lived in that city until I was 14 years old), and that was always enough for me to keep pushing our friendship forward, even when I felt it was kind of unilaterally.\n\nFast forward to the visit, I traveled to say her goodbye and there we went to dinner with a good friend of hers (I know for a fact that this third person is one one of her best friends and they see each other fairly frequently). After dinner the friend drove us home and I ended up forgetting my favourite baseball cap on the back sit of her car.\n\nFast forward an entire year, and I'm yet to see my cap again. I mean, it's really tricky to explain why this cap is so important to me. I bought it almost 10 years ago when traveling to the USA. It's basically the only cap I've used for these past 10 years. I really really really love it, it fits perfectly, it's awesome, matches all my clothes. I really feel in a way, it's part of my personality, part of who I am.\n\nI don't remember how long it took me to realize I'd lost it back then. I was pretty sure I'd forgot back in her car and I asked my friend to check with hers and eventually after weeks her friends finally found it and I asked if I could have it back, to what they agreed. The plan was really simple, my friend is neighbor to my cousin that is constantly traveling between Brazil and Portugal (we have part of our family here and there), and my friend simply need to get the cap with her friend whenever they saw each other (they didn't need to see eachother specifically for the exchange it anything, I'd gladly wait for things to happen naturally), leave at my cousin's and that's it, I would handle it from that point on. But again, it's been a year already and that never happened.\n\nAnd the thing is, I'm really really upset. And honestly, I'm upset this whole time, this whole year, and it's getting worse as time goes. From the start I don't feel my friend ever took this seriously, and I never felt she made an effort to get my cap back. I know for a fact that I did my best to make it very clear that the cap is really important to me and that I would very much appreciate if she could get it for me. I already contacted her friend directly, who confirmed having the cap and willing to give it back the first opportunity. \n\nI feel really embarrassed, but I'm getting more and more upset and this is ruining our friendship to me. I don't want to be a pain in the a**, asking week after week about it and end up behaving like the cap is the only thing that matters, but honestly, I'm losing any desire to even talk to her. At this point, I can't even honestly answer myself if I'm more afraid of losing her friendship as consequence of how I'm feeling, or if the idea of never seeing my cap again is what really frightens me.\n\nAITA for expecting her to understand that this cap is very important to me and making an effort to get it back, and feeling that I might not be able to continue been friends with her because I feel despised about her apparently unwillingness to help?",

      "description": "Today is my 42nd birthday. My husband and I have been together 5 years, married for 2 today. This has been an ongoing issue with us. \n\nWhen we first got together we had amazing chemistry and had an amazing amount of sex. However in the past 3 - 3 1/2 years it has dropped to practically nonexistent. Like around once a month or every six weeks. \n\nTo put this in context - before we met, my husband was very âactiveâ. Although we both have had numerous partners - my husbands body count is probably over 100-150 women. Iâm closer to 60ish partners. Again we were both long time, serial daters in our late 30âs who felt we met our match when we got together. \n\nWe have open communication, trust and even have fun sexcapades with other women occasionally. We genuinely enjoy each otherâs company, laugh and get along - except when it comes to sex. \n\nI feel like I am constantly asking him for sex and getting turned down. Itâs never the right time, heâs tired, heâs full, heâs driving, heâs been drinking, the show/game is on, its late, itâs early, etc. My husband does deal with low testosterone issues but has been taking medicine/shots for this issue for years. \n\nTo qualify (not to brag) - I am not an unattractive woman. (I would post a photo but Iâm using my secondary account for anonymity reasons) Many people think Iâm still in my late 20âs, I donât drink/smoke/do drugs. I take great care of myself and have a fantastic figure. Most people see us together and say we are like the real life Ken and Barbie. I dress stylishly, have a great job, am very affectionate towards him and always go over the top on his birthday. \n\nEvery year when his birthday rolls around we jokingly celebrate it for a month. In years past I have taken him on trips, bought bottle service at clubs, tickets to his favorite sporting events etc. \n\nSo this year I told him for my birthday I want sex everyday for a month. He and I laughed and agreed. But when I propositioned him on Christmas morning - he told me no, we had to get ready and my birthday isnât until tomorrow. Fast forward to 3am. I reached for him, gave him a few kisses and said - itâs my birthday - you canât say no. \n\nHis response: for fucks sake, itâs 3am. I donât even know where to go with this or what to do anymore. I feel like I am stuck in a sexless marriage. \n\nTLDR: my husband agreed to have sex with me everyday for a month as my birthday gift. The first time I asked he told me no. AITA?",

Three days ago, she asked me if I wanted to go back to the island with her, and remembering how much fun we had last time, I said yes.\n\nAfter I said yes, she told me that I couldn't stay with her and her mom, and that I would have to stay alone at a hostel, 30 minutes by bus, away from where she is staying. I have Aspergers, which means I like to have things familiar and planned. I'm not very used to traveling, and I have never stayed at a hotel/hostel alone before. This makes me very anxious, which is annoying, because everyone else seems to be able to do it just fine, but not me. \n\nI want to spend time with my friend, but the prospect of staying alone at night in a hostel with strangers makes me anxious. I feel like I'm being too much trouble and picky about the whole thing, and that she will be angry that I said yes at first, but no after she told me I couldn't stay with her. I have told her no before with something similar, which made her very disappointed. \n\nSo, would I be the asshole, if I decided to cancel the trip? ",

      "description": "So I work in a pharmacy in the middle of a big tourist place (for privacy reasons I'd rather not say where exactly). I work mostly weekends where I work from 8:30 to 5. The mornings are usually calm but after 12 people come pouring in at an insane pace.\n\nI work with two other people and we can usually handle the ammount in a good pace. In the pharmacy we get a mix of tourists and regular people who live in the neighbourhood here to get their meds.\n\nOn weekends we decided to close up 5-10 min earlier than on our actual closing time. We do this because in the last hour we get a stampede of people coming in trying to get something last minute. Some of it is just single items and other times people come with 3 different prescriptions with each 3 items on it from a different country.\nWe try out best but as you can expect we can't deal with all of them. Because of this we usually end up finishing around 5:15-5:30 because we're still dealing with customers. Time we don't get paid for BTW.\n\nSo we decided to close the door 5-10 min earlier and help whoever is still in the pharmacy (usually there's still 4-6 people at that point). This has helped because we don't have to deal with people who run in at the last minute just to browse around for 15 min (happened to me a few times) and not buy something.\n\nIf we see a person is really desperate for his meds we open up quickly to give it to them but if they're Just random tourists there to buy some cough drops or tampons we redirect them to another pharmacy that's still open. Some people get really pissy when we don't open the door at 4:58 which got me thinking:\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": " I'm going to try to tell the whole story here, so bear with me:  \nI have autism, and when I was a lot younger, around 5-12 (I am 17 now, junior in HS), It was a hell of a lot worse than it is now and my parents decided to homeschool me (now my autism is much, much better).  I was enrolled in a public homeschool program that met twice a week and I had an aide with me sometimes when I had tics (those aren't a problem now at all).   Back then, I also used the internet with no control, playing games in all my spare time and watching youtube whenever I could.  I eventually was allowed to install scratch, a drag-&amp;-drop programming language for kids which I LOVED.  Eventually, without my parents knowing, I created a scratch forum account and they caught me.  I wasn't allowed to use the computer at all for 6 months and from there they monitered my computer usage a ton more.  Fast forward to 5th/6th grade and I'm doing online school now.  Given the freedom online now, I cheated and my parents caught me when they installed more tracking software on my PC.  they made me pay $200 (a TON of money to me then) to retake the course, but this part is understandable.  fast forward again to freshman year of HS and I'm finally going to a public school, be it an alternative school with 15 students in the senior class. At this point, most of my symptoms of autism had gone away, save for some barely noticeable tics.  I got in trouble that year for abusing the school's network, almost got suspended.    \n\n\nNow at sophomore year, I feel as if my internet usage is finally justified.  I have transferred to the larger high school of 1,300 students, and I get pretty meh grades.  My parents decide to take away internet, video games, electronics until I get all B's or above in my classes (chemistry was the big one here, only got a C+).  I also am not allowed to drive because of these grades.  Over the summer, I created an Instagram, Twitter, Google, Soundcloud (I produce music), discord, and reddit account, and ALL of those were HUGE, HUGE offenses in my parents eyes (I had an incident with reddit freshman year that my parents got REALLY, REALLY pissed at).  They had always told me \"no social media\" or \"no accounts\".  Now, a lot of you might say that \"I don't need social media\" or \"it's useless\", but to someone my age it means a lot.  It allows you to interact with people at your school that you might not know otherwise, break the ice with the girl you like, chat with friends (snapchat, instagram dms) when you want, or just share your opinion, and all this is useful for someone who is somewhat shy like me.  They found out and threatened to report me to the police for god knows what and have me suspended at school, killing my chances at a college.  They think I should focus on NOTHING but school unless my grades are there.  I can only hang out with friends on Mondays (early dismissal), fridays, and saturdays (not school nights).  I also want to say that I am extremely lazy when it comes to schoolwork.  I have had high test scores that show I should have a 4.0 GPA, but I only have a 3.3 because I don't put a lot of effort into classes like chemistry or english.   \nNow in the present, just in the beginning of second semester junior year, my grades are raised and my parents are finally going to let me learn how to drive, although the SAT comes first and that's my decision (most of my friends were forced to drive the moment they turned 16 in sophomore year so the parents weren't chauffeurs anymore.  Some were also forced to get a job so they can get experience).  I also can't get a job because I don't have a 3.5 GPA for the semester, I had a 3.45.  I got a phone for the first time halfway through sophomore year, and I have recently created an account on discord (I am HUGE into programming/computer science now and It is likely my career, this is what I use it for), Instagram (I post my graphic design here and follow my friends and favorite music artists), and reddit (I ask for advice here and discuss music).  All my friends comment on how strict they are.  They haven't caught me yet here, but it's only a matter of time.  anyway, AITA for trying to get around their rules, or are they justified?  \n\n\ntl;dr: My parents are strict and I try to get around it.  \n ",

      "description": "So at the local Wally World they recently installed self-checkout machines. I use them maybe 25% of the time to check out. However, this particular store makes you pay money for supermarket bags which I think is dumb. Whenever I'm at the self-checkout and it asks me how many bags I used, I always hit zero because I know it'll charge me the extra five cents or whatever for the bag.\n\nHowever. Last time I did this, one of my friends chastised me for it saying it was wrong and that I should have paid for the bags. She said the money goes to some charity and that I was effectively stealing from them.\n\nLook, I'm a good boy when it comes to helping our Earth Mother and all that shit. I recycle, I don't throw my trash into the sea, I rinse out empty soup cans, a lot of the electronics I buy are used. Whatever 10 or 15 cents that Walmart takes from me absolutely is not going to pulling bottle caps out of seals' mouths or whatever they say it does. And if I can knock a few nickels off my bill each time, why not? They're the ones who put such an easily exploitable flaw in the system and such menial controlling taxes go against my personal libertarian-leaning beliefs. Refusing to pay for bags is, in part, a form of protest against such menial and overbearing fees.",

      "title": "AITA for not apologizing when my toddler mistook a stranger for me?",
      "description": "Today I was at the store with my 2 y/o daughter. She's a really good kid , so I rarely have to apologize for something she does or my bad parenting decisions. I often get compliments on how well behaved she is and her calm temperament, but make no mistake, she is still a toddler, so we have our moments.\n\nWe are at the checkout line and we are 2nd in line. They're two cashiers next to each other at a counter, so there is a lady in front of me (lady #1) and another lady in front of me (lady #2) , but off to the right a bit, maybe 2 feet away from us. My kid is acting up a little and trying to run off from me in the line, but no one has noticed us and no attention is being drawn. I grab her hand and she giggles a little loudly, as she thinks it's funny, then drops her toy she had in her hand. She gets down to retrieve it, but when she gets up she is very close to lady #2, and in that split second she thought she was me and hugs her legs from behind, her head landing between her legs, right under her butt.\n\nI quickly called out my daughter's name to help her realize,Whoa, that ain't mommy. The look on her face when she realized that she was hugging a stranger was priceless and a funny  honest mistake. I'm laughing and herding my daughter back over to me. this lady turns around and she is pissed. She was about 25 and she was giving my daughter a look as if she was a 40 year old slimeball who just grabbed her ass. \n\nI get not all people like kids and I respect that, but I thought she was going to hit my kid with the look she had on her face. She continued to stay turned staring at my daughter with a scowl of hatred. Now I'm already laughing, but I'm a nervous laugher on top it. So when I see this lady acting like she is about to unwind on my kid, the laughing just continues. The lady then glares at me and I cant help myself.. I keep laughing, but I glared right back. I said nothing. Normally I'm a pushover and very easy and quick to apologize for anything and everything, but the fact that she seemed so offended by a kid accidently hugging her, it almost wanted to make me see red. I hugged my daughter and then looked up at this woman who had the most ugly twisted face at this point and I just smiled and raised my eyebrows as to ask if there was a problem here.\n\nThis whole thing lasted maybe 15 seconds, but fuck that time lasted forever. Lady #1then turns around and is now just staring at me and my daughter as well, shaking her head a bit in disapproval. That gets me thinking, wow, did I just make a parenting fuck up that I should have apologized for instead of laughing at this woman and her reaction? So was I the asshole in all of this?\n\nNormally i would apologize at the drop of a hat, but the way this lady looked at my daughter with such hatred really just pissed me off badly. What do you guys think? Did mama bear mode get the best of me? I kinda fear I'm the asshole ",

      "description": "Holy shit boys do I got a Christmas story for you!\n\nSo for about a week and a half I've been talking to this girl I met on Tinder. We went on a date about three days after we matched and we hit it off pretty well. Got ice cream, went to look at lights, went back to my place, watched a movie, made out, good times. We've been talking daily since and we get along! There's a connection, yay!\n\nYesterday, we're talking and she's telling me about how shitty her Christmas has been, family issues and all the like. I joked that we could have our own Christmas with Disney movies and pizza rolls and shit (I'm a very romantic person) and she surprisingly was really down to come over. So I got ready, and picked her up from her place.\n\nI'll spare you guys most of the fine details, but we had a few drinks, started watching movies, and things got a bit frisky. Things progressed after a while, and we had our first go at things in my living room. Felt each other up, lots of foreplay-like stuff. A lot of it was rough (we are both really kinky) and it went on for a good hour. I eventually fingered her and got her off a couple of times. Good to know I can still find the right places.\n\nWe watched another movie and it was starting to get late (like 2am at this point) and I offered for her to stay the night because I was getting pretty tired and didn't want to go back out in the snow. She agreed, and we moved into my room. This is where things got really fucked up.\n\nShe obviously wasn't finished and was still really horny. She reached in my pants and admittedly I got really turned on. She gave me a handjob (and eventually a blowie) and we had both stripped down. More foreplay stuff, and I even ate her out. Well, I know that with most times like this, people expect that on the second date and you're sleeping over, you're probably gonna get laid. But I'm just not comfortable with actual sex so soon. This was apparently an issue because she REALLY wanted it at this point, and I was just not cool with it. I was happy to get her off and stuff, but sex wasn't gonna happen. I told her that. She didn't like that answer.\n\nShe got really pouty (in a flirtatious way) and I just had to keep telling her I was cool with everything else, but not actual sex. She actually ended up getting really frustrated, saying \"Nobody ever tells me no\" and \"I don't know if you've seen me, but I can get whoever I want\" and from there I just knew shit was going to go downhill. We laid there for a sec, and I offered to take her home. It was just uncomfortable at this point. So we both got dressed and I made the most awkward 20 minute drive of my life. We said maybe 10 words to each other.\n\nI feel really terrible about it and I apologized after I got home. She said a few things like \"I'm not sure what made you think by getting me going then shutting me down was okay but it wasn't\" and \"We flirted over text, you started the whole thing and then told me to get out\".\n\nI feel like I'm the asshole because I did initiate and I was down to do sexual stuff, just not... sex. I should've known that was her end goal after we started making out and she got going. I should've told her beforehand I wasn't comfortable with it and not right before. I'm just kind of lost in how I should feel about the entire situation.\n\n# tl;dr - Second date with Tinder girl on Christmas day, some drinks were had, things got frisky, I wanted to stop before sex (after getting her off through fingering/oral) but she really wanted to bang. I shut it down right then and there and took her home. Shame is had.",

      "description": "Iâm in a friend group of 3 at university. We started off doing the same course (business admin) but I later moved to marketing management because it is what I wanted to do initially and one of my lecturers encouraged me to pursue what I actually loved. (Took b.a because parents advised me to)\n\nMy 2 friends think what I do is easy âbecause itâs just theoryâ and are constantly taking about how hard their course is and how much work it involves. Itâs just so silly because we take some of our classes together (I share 2/4 classes with them and they complain about how hard those 2 are as well)! \n\nThey are constantly making it sound like am dumb for being a marketing student and until today, I brushed it off. \n\nYesterday, my friends results were released and each of them failed one subject but passed the rest. I was genuinely happy for them and celebrated with them -even tried to make them feel better about the courses they failed. \n\nToday, mine came through and in my moment of joy I quickly went to message one of them about the good news but I got a response saying âof course you got a clear pass...itâs just theory ðâ. I felt so defeated in that moment because I was truly afraid I was going to fail this semester and I just wanted someone to celebrate with. \n\nI responded by telling my friend that sheâs lucky sheâs sooo smart (sarcastically) and thats itâs possible for people to fail theory courses too (pointing out that she too was scared for 2/4 of her subjects that we took together).  I also said something along the lines of âis it so hard to be happy for your friendâ \n\nShe replied with laughing emojis and said â you can fail math courses, yes.. but not theoriesâ \n\nIâm so tired of being treated like am so dumb because they have 1 or 2 courses involving numbers sometimes. I mean so do i! One of the subjects I took and passed in was a math subject but ânoooo itâs still marketingâ\n\nAm I the asshole for saying what I said to my friend that implied she wasnât much of a good friend? Or.. am I just being dramatic about the whole thing? \n\nTl;dr -friends think course I take at uni is easy and say it shouldnât be so surprising for me to pass my exams because the subjects I take are theory.\n\n",

      "description": "I work as a sysadmin for a medium sized local accounting firm. Last year we had a security breach due to someones incompetence that shut the servers down. People got fired and the higher up's have made us secure the servers in every way, including installing remote viewing software on every work station and locking them down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnter Pam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's a 50 year old woman who is very technological illiterate. Since the installation of these new policies Pam has been a pain to deal with. For the past 3 months on an almost daily basis we have gotten tickets from her for the most mundane of things. The point of the remote viewing software is so that when stuff comes up we can deal with it remotely but Pam refuses to cooperate with us. She demands that someone (most of the time me) come and deal with it directly. This takes up to an hour of my day as I have to deal with her and her constant \"problems\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese problems consist of her not being able to watch netflix because it's blocked under the new rules or things like she does not want to have to enter her employee id in when connecting to the printer. This isn't even the worst part. Every time Pam calls one of us down, it always ends with her insisting that we're doing our jobs \"wrong\" and we need to change what ever is bothering her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the past week though, my boss noticed the amount of tickets coming from her department and the amount of time spent down there. I explained to them the issue without naming anyone. She told me that she needs us doing our jobs and not wasting time down there so they will most likely change the policy so we only answer tickets that are \"important\". From what is sounded like, she mean only things that need to dealt with NOW.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday it was all but confirmed that this change will go into effect. Well, that same day I had to go help Pam again after she sent in 3 tickets claiming she couldn't work due to an issue. This issue was she wanted me to unblock facebook. I already was already having kind of a bad day so me telling her no broke down into a small argument in which she told me that I was incompetent and that the policies \"I\" put in place were stupid. I proceeded to walk out with out saying a word and made an announcement to her department.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told them of the policy change being put into effect. That if they had problems we would not be able to deal with them immediately anymore due to \"the blatant abuse\" by some employees. Most of these people people are older and need help from time to time from us so this did not go over well and most knew it was Pam's fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy coworkers and boss said I didn't do anything wrong and only announced a new policy and why it was put in effect. From what i've heard though Pam's department despise her right now and she's become somewhat of an outcast in the 48 hours since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel kinda bad to be honest Did I go overboard?",

      "description": "Am I (23F) the asshole for telling my husband (27M) that if he could maintain his haircut, he \"would get laid a lot more\"? \n\nHe used to take very good care of himself and he was very attractive when we first met. As we've been married, had kids, and life has happened, he's stopped putting effort into himself. He has depression and bipolar, so he tends to not take care of his appearance very well or put any effort into how he looks. He will go months without a haircut or a shave. I've tried to coax him toward styling his hair or trimming his beard into different styles to help him feel better about himself and to help me feel more attracted to him. \n\nHe always complains we don't have sex enough (maybe twice a week). It's not for lack of trying on my part. He vents his stress and anger at me rather than finding a good coping mechanism by being cranky and snapping at me over little things. It's miserable to come home to after working all day to support him and our two kids. I've told him this many times and he says he's working on it in therapy and to be patient. I am patient, I haven't left or given him an ultimatum, but it really makes sex with him unappealing to me. I try to be affectionate to help, but he is always \"busy\" with something. I've given up. \n\nYesterday, though, he got his ears pierced, trimmed up his beard into a nice goatee, and today he got a nice haircut. I was attracted to him so much I couldn't stop staring at him at the grocery store. I told him when we got home if he could maintain the way he looked right now, that he \"would get laid a whole lot more\" than he does now. He got mad and said I shouldn't be having sex with him based on how he looks. \n\nI think my feelings toward it are that a husband would be more attracted to his wife is she's wearing lingerie or puts effort into her makeup and hair. I didn't feel it was out of line, but he's upset. So, AITA?",

      "description": "In science we were watching a clip from Spider-Man. In the movie clip Peter looks down and responds to Uncle Ben's question by saying,\"big changes.\" I responded by sarcastically saying \"is he gonna grab a ruler?\" My science teacher told the class that if you have to use a ruler to validate yourself you are insecure. A couple of people started to believe that I was gay and insecure for what I said. As I'm trying to explain the joke to my friend, another student from across the room started yelling that I was gay and was asking him out on a date. I ask him to stop. He keeps on going. I was going to punch him, but decided that leaving the classroom to calm down was a better solution. I told my elbow partner that I was gonna go calm down in the bathroom and  tell our science teacher where I was and why I was there. \n\nA couple of minutes later the student who  started calling me gay came into the bathroom to \"apologize.\" I told him I don't believe it because the last time he said something like this he promised me and SCHOOL STAFF that it would never happen again.( while going over the civil war he started  calling me a slave even after being asked multiple times to stop) By the time we started talking a campus monitor got us out the bathroom and started asking us what happened. \n\nI start to explain what went down and he completely cuts me off after I mention the ruler part. The campus monitor starts telling me that I should be EXPELLED FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. I asked him how is my comment sexual harassment when the joke is not directed to anyone.(he still never explained why it was sexual harassment) My science teacher had  us  talk it out in her science room during her prep period. \n\nAt this point the only thing she knew was that someone said \"is he going to grab a ruler\"  and that I left the classroom. I try to explain to her and the campus monitor starts trying to tell her that I should be \"thrown out of the school for what I said \" and that she doesn't need to know. She eventually convinced him that she can handle it with out his help. After I explained myself she made a note  to talk to the other kids parents. (The Campus monitor completely ignored what we said between each other and let him leave. She didn't call mine or punish me because I explained and apologized for the ruler joke and for  walking out)  I understand that the joke was inappropriate and I took things a little out of proportion. My question now is AITA for making a joke and somewhat arguing with a campus monitor over it?",

      "description": "Just wondering if this is normal or maybe I am over thinking things. So my mother in law and my husband have a very odd relationship. She was abusive when he was a child but he has since forgiven her and tried to move past it. She acknowledges that she favored her other children over my husband and she often took her anger out on him. She beat him and was just a generally unloving presence in his life. Because of this my husband is very protective of our 2 year old daughter. My MIL has never been allowed to babysit her. This is not our of malicious intent, we just don't fill comfortable leaving her alone with my MIL for long periods of time. But we do visit often and have stayed at her house overnight. \n\nLately MIL has taken to showing up at our apartment on special occasions and basically staying for hours. I think she believes that we will take advantage of her being there and go out on a date or something and let her watch our daughter. Last year she showed up on my birthday, our anniversary and on mothers day (we spent the entire day before mothers day with her and expressed that we were going to spend mothers day at home with just the 3 of us. She received cards, flowers, and we treated her to dinner so it's not like we were trying to exclude her). It completely ruined the mood and several plans that we had, especially on our anniversary.\n\nMy birthday was on Wednesday. I don't like doing things for myself so my plan was to  take our daughter to jump zone (a play area filled with bouncy houses) and then out to eat. My MIL texted me that she was in the area and would be stopping by. She didn't give a time frame and didn't acknowledge my birthday at all, even though I know she knew about it. \n\nI was frustrated and told her we had plans to go out. We were coming to visit her this weekend, maybe we could just hold off until then. She seemed upset and then stopped replying. We were convinced she was just going to come by anyway (which she has done before) so we ended up cutting our activities short. \n\nIs this normal behavior? Our anniversary is in May and I really don't want her intruding. Last year, she brought a card and flowers which was really sweet but she insulted my dress, we had to cancel our dinner plans and she ended up staying for hours and demanding things. Would I be the asshole if i stressed that special occasions are for immediate family only, especially our anniversary? ",

Of course it happens from time to time that I either forgot them, or I feel ill for other reasons, and my friends are always true troopers and and offer me some of theirs if they have any, even though it doesnât help as much as my normal ones.

      "description": "So basically my girlfriend is on her period and her body is very sensitive. She ate a bunch of food throughout the day and none of it ended up digesting so come around 12am she has a rock of food and drink sitting in her stomach. She ends up getting out of bed to head to the restroom because she thought she had to take a dump, but she ended up vomiting all over the floor and on herself. I saw the whole thing it was awful and smelled absolutely terrible, I should also say now at this point I have a terrible phobia of \"watery food\" AKA vomit or old food that people let mix with their water in the sink. I ended up getting her into the shower and she cleaned herself off. I told her outright that I would not be able to clean up the vomit for her.(She knows about my phobia) She ended up cleaning it in the end once she felt better. Now she is mad at me for not taking care of her when she was sick, I did everything else I could to make the experience less challenging. I will also follow up by saying that I have been prone to being sick my whole life and throw up at least once a week due to my weak stomach and since childhood have always cleaned it up myself and never expected someone else to do it. Basically just want to know if I'm an asshole.\nSorry for the slightly drug on post and my awful formatting.\n",

      "description": "Sharing from my wife's account. \nHere goes...\nI work in a high volume steakhouse as a broil cook. I have this co-worker with a bit of an authority complex. He has been working there for 4 years and broiling for 3 and is honestly pretty good at his job, the issue is he has passive aggressive tendencies. \nSo, last night (Sunday) we had a particularly busy night as the northern winter is finally breaking and we are seeing warmer temperatures. The other broiler and I were both working double shifts, him early out and I closing. I guess he was having a bad day before I got there because as soon as I walked in he made a passive aggressive statement about the close the night prior and stated my grill \"looked like shit\" with a smug smile. (Each night our stations are checked by a kitchen manager before we are allowed to leave.) I ignored him and carried on with my day. When he couldn't get a rise out of me his comments became more and more out of line with a defensive \"I was joking\" at the end of each statement. Eventually he moved onto another employee and so on. Near the end of the night he had decided to \"prank\" another employee and proceeded to throw a hot set of grill tongs at him and clipped his bare elbow, not a serious burn but enough to hurt and leave a mark. When the obviously angry employee piped up about it all hell broke loose and broil cook took a defensive stance and all three of us that had been dealing with him calmly confronted him about it and again he got defensive. This was when I blew up. I have been grilling pretty much exclusively with him for the past 3 months. I go out of my way to make his job easier because he's easily frustrated and I like a happy work environment. I let go on him with 3 months worth of anger. Lots of yelling. At this point he decided to put his hands up. No hits were thrown but I made it known if he swung they would be.(I am a recovered rageaholic and don't like fighting) Eventually a manager stepped in and took me aside and assured me I had done all I could to diffuse the situation before it got to that point but I still don't feel right. I feel guilty about it and I hate fights. could I have handled it better?\n\n\nSo, AITA for finally blowing up and not pandering to his bad behavior anymore? \n\nNote: Not looking for validation just honestly want to know. \n",

We like the same shows and sports and itâs always a chill time to hang with him.\n\nHeâs disabled from the waist down because of his disability but his parents hired a full time caretaker for him but heâs so adamant on them being a student even though thatâs where the problem comes into place.  Weâre in college so being busy at random times happens all the time.  \n\nHe lets his caretaker know that their job is to take care of him basically in the morning and at the evening before bed but doesnât really says he needs help throughout the day which is not true?? He needs to pee and eat?? \n\nThatâs where I come in.  As a friend I do not mind helping him use the bathroom sometimes or make him food but I feel like I canât relax in my apartment because it just feels like heâs waiting on me to do things for him.  Heâs also very demanding to my girlfriend.  Whenever she comes over, heâll boss her around and have her do things for him.  And itâs frustrating to see because sheâs too nice to say no but I feel bad. \n\nLast month during my girlfriends and mine anniversary he purposely told his caretaker to leave him in bed because his caretaker had to go to their part time job.  He then asked me to dress him and take him to the bathroom as I was getting ready to go out.  He was aware that we had our anniversary that day I have been planning it for weeks and he just didnât seem to think it mattered that I have to add his routine into my day.\n\nIâm just so stressed about being at home because I just donât want him to ask me to do things for him because I feel like they happen daily and he has a caretaker and he just lets his caretaker do whatever they want.  While he gets to fill in that time with me if theyâre not there. \n\nHeâs a cool dude.  I like him.  But Iâm not his caretaker and I feel like my friendship should not have to extend to brushing his hair and taking him to the bathroom every day.  \n\nTL;DR my roommate lets his caretaker do whatever he wants and makes me pick up the slack. \n\nAITA for not wanting to help him??",

My hope is that they put the dog on a leash and it's a threat I never have to go through with, but with how many times this has happened I'm starting to think that it's something I am just gonna have to do the next time their dog runs at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said it's her property (but again it has no fencing, nothing to protect the dog from running into the street, or at people walking on the sidewalk) This person is also my neighbor so it's not like I can just walk my dog a different street they live basically next door to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to protect myself and the dogs? I don't blame their dog, I blame the owner, and I don't want to do this, but i'm nervous to walk my dogs down my own street.",

      "description": "Im an amateur guitarist and singer who focuses on \"outlaw country\" songs. I routinely sing Merle Haggard, Hank Williams Jr, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and David Allen Coe .\n\nEven if you hate country (which most of reddit does i know) youd know DAC from \"Take this job and shove it\" which he wrote. I hate commercial country pop but i have a deep affinity for outlaw country as it provides a great insight into the poor american white and their culture.\n\nIt also tackles issues like poverty, race relations ( not always in the way you might think ), alcoholism, drug use, abuse, crime, ect. I like to think it was like rap before rap in how subversive it is ( Johnny cash singing about killing a woman and fleeing to mexico in cocaine blues comes to mind).\n\nAnyway, one beautiful song by DAC is \"If that aint country\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/OhEHB0a7Uyg\n\nAt around 1:39 DAC drops the N bomb in the context of them working under harsh conditions. Its difficult for people to fathom but i dont think theres racial malice, hes been known to write songs mocking racists as satire.\n\nAnyway this song is beautiful to me so I was singing it to some coworkers on a lunch break. They enjoy my playing and ask me to frequently play some of their favorites but this just came to me.\n\nWhen i reached the N bomb i censored it as \"Working like Enugu for my room and board\", off the top of my head. I just invented a character basically.\n\nThe two blacks guys there laughed at it but a white coworker took me aside after the fact and said i shouldnt drop n words in public. My reply is that i didnt but i apologize because im a go along get along kinda guy. But i was sort of miffed at the way ge came across like i was some kkk member instead of looking at the entire context. Am i the asshole?",

      "description": "Okay, so some background info\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n My husband and I have been together for 7 years. I quickly learned that he has a physically and verbally abusive father and a mother who doesn't think there is anything wrong with the dads behavior.  I have been personally called a dumb ass by him just for having a different political opinion, he is super racist and throws legit tantrums when he doesn't get his way. My husband is currently seeing a therapist to deal with trauma from his childhood.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago my husband's dad lost control and threw a glass at mom and busted her lip and messed up her teeth. They both made excuses, dad broke a restraining order and mom said the glass just hit her the wrong way. (wtf no one should be throwing glasses at your face). My husband's older sister behaves a lot like the father and she cursed me out twice during this whole ordeal. After this incident we started to only see them with other family and usually at a restaurant.  We have had many crisis situations in the past seven years.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHusband finds out that his older sister has gallbladder cancer. Which really sucks and I don't wish it on anyone. However, my Husband tells me that we have to drop everything for a week on the 11th of March to babysit his younger sister because everyone is going to help with the surgery.  This is the second time that we have been told, NOT ASKED to drop everything to watch his sister who is almost a senior in high school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to support his family in any way because they cont. to be abusive narcissistic people? \n\nThe trauma they have caused has barely been addressed and the toll its taken on my husband and our relationship has been hard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI donno if any of this makes sense, but any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

      "description": "So I am turning 21 soon and I drank two times while underage, (don't call the police). The very first time was with my bf (20M) and a group of friends at a friend's house. I took two shots of vodka, ( I know, only two shots lol), and was pretty much out after that. I remember everything, I was just more clumsy that usual and very giggly.\n\n   Fast forward to about 6-7 months later. My bf and I were watching Netflix late one night and we decide to go get some food from the kitchen. As we grabbed the food, he poured a cup of some really strong vodka, (about 140 proof), and told me that I was going to drink it. I was ok with it because I was curious about the taste. We went back to the room and I drank about half of the cup.\n\n   To no one's surprise, I became extremely giggly and clumsy. Nothing extreme, I just giggled a lot while watching Devilman Crybaby. But, after a few minutes, my bf got tired of it. According to him, it was like taking care of a child. I needed help walking to the bathroom relationshipd me annoying. I don't blame him for calling me annoying; I had an emotional cry after telling him my insecurities. But, I don't think it warranted the harsh behavior he shown me. I don't remember much, just the fact that he went through my phone and deleted memberships that I had and that he was extremely upset that he had to deal with me.  \n\n     When we went to bed, I kissed him and told him that I loved him. As I turned around, I heard him say 'f****** disgusting'. I was hurt. I wasn't a terrible drunk, its not like I threw up on him. I was upset until the next morning. I thought I got over it but i saw a text from him telling me what happened. It ended with a text saying that if I drink again, he'll break up with me.\n\nFast forward to today. I turn 21 in two weeks. I don't plan on being an alcoholic but I do want to try some of the fruitier drinks. But, I don't want to mess up our relationship, even though I didn't really do anything wrong. \n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to drink even though my bf will break up with me if I do.\n",

      "description": "Mobile user here. First time poster.\nI live in a city where housing costs are really expensive compared to the rest of the state and I have to stay in this town because Iâm attending the university here. I (19F) live with my boyfriend (20M) and our puppy and we jumped on the chance to get this apartment because there are so few dog friendly places to live in the area that college students can afford.\n\nWeâve lived here now about 10 months and everythingâs been great until recently. My puppy, a nine month old Boston terrier, loves to go on walks around the complex and stop by at the office to say hello to the employees. They all love my dog and theyâve been nothing but friendly to the three of us until this morning. \n\nWhere I live, it snows a lot and gets very cold. They use magnesium-chloride to melt the ice on sidewalks. This has caused chemical burns on my dogâs paws and the skin started falling off. This causes her pain and makes it hard to go on walks. Before anybody says, âJust buy the little dog shoes,â we tried to put them on her and she despises them and thereâs no way she will walk in them. \nToday, I talked to the apartment employees as I do every morning and mentioned very casually and in a friendly, non-accusing manner after she asked how the dog was that my dog had burns on her feet and we suspected it was due to the de-icer. She responded with, âOur de-icer is definitely not dog friendly and we wonât be doing anything about that.â \n\nI plan to talk to other dog owners in the complex and ask if theyâre having similar issues. I just want dogs to be safe and feel that if theyâre advertising their apartments as pet-friendly they should actually be pet-friendly. \nI feel bad because these people are very nice and it seems dumb to get on their bad side as Iâll have to be here at least another couple of years until I graduate. So, WIBTA if I assume a more forward and aggressive strategy to deal with this? \n\n\nTLDR; My apartment complex uses an ice melter that chemically burns my dogâs paws. I am worried that I am overreacting and burning bridges if I confront them expecting a change in what product they use on the sidewalks. ",

      "description": "So a couple of days ago I was feeling very low and told a friend, whom I'm usually seek for confort or guidance. He knows how I spiral in negative toughts to panic attacks and irrational behaviour.\n\nAt first he told me it was ok, that he would help me with some assigments I have (since that's the only problem I have that he can help with, also the trigger for my crisis wasn't the assignments), and tried to calm me. I kept on saying how tired I was and that nothing was worth this pain and other pessimist things,  so he snapped and started yelling to stop and be responsible for my problems \"many which I've caused because I'm irresponsible and a coward\" he said. Also that he didn't care about my problems and to start acting as an adult (I'm 23 with no family, so yeah I'm an adult).\n\nI started crying and left. I felt so tiny and stupid being scollded like that but mostly hurt, because I needed my friend.\n\nHe never had talked to me like that in the 4 years I've been deppressed, never. So this really caught off guard.\n\nLater he texted me that he cared more about what I can do with my problems, laughed it off and told me if I didn't want to solve it, he would still keep listening to me. No apology or anything alike.\n\nThere's were I understood his reaction was like when you try to make someone come into sense by slapping him. I logically get it, but still it hurted too much since I see him as the only person who undertands me (he went through his own hell of a deppression).\n\nI ignored the text and he kept asking if I was okay, to at least give signs of life. Just replied 'idk' to the 'you okay?' text\n\nHe kept on texting but I'm really not prepared to talk to him. I'm still hurt and actually thinking of cutting him off completely.\n\nSo, given that I understand now that he was trying to help, even in that cruel manner and that he actually is showing that he cares about me, AITA for ignoring him?",

I was not in the mood for a bad Creedence cover.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I stared at him until we locked eyes and I started to move my lips slowly and as clearly as i could so he could undertand my mimiquing \"Stop, please. please, just stop\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe opened his eyes like to big plates in awe. like he was really shocked that someone wasnt digging being unable to hear their own thoughts, He kept going tho, i turned around and started laughing in frustation and he laughed too. when the song ended he said \"well, now im gonna play something calmer, for the girl over there that doesnt like my music\" I turned to face him again and I answered him quite loudly \"you are being too loud, there's no need to play THAT LOUD AND ANNOY PEOPLE\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe answered \"well you can always go to another car\" and that made me furious. \"where im i supposed to go? theres no place to move, we are all your hostages and you are forcing all of us to listen to you\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe laughed again in disbelieve and started to play a cheesy ballad but a lot quieter this time. I just stared at him shaking my head until I got out the train.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no problem with street performers as long I have a choice to partipate or not in the performance. i think it is very rude to start singing or whatever in front of people that didnt ask for it. its the same when people listen to their music on their phones without headphones. Why do we all have to listen as well? i dont want to listen to your music, actually i think performers are worst because they expect you give them money for a service you didnt even require and its not even a service....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe in the motto \"do not inconvenience others\" specially in public places, so it really boils my blood when i just want some peace and quite and travel without suffering. and the \"He's just trying to make a living\" its not enough reason to have people hostage. He can go to a park or stay in the platform where we have the choice to engage or not\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr I told a very loud street musician in the subway to stop playing because he was being annoying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend told me I'm this close to turn into a crazy old lady, so, IATA?",

I also gave him a loan of some money. He told me that he would pay me back and not to worry about it. \n\nI'm assuming that my brother wasn't paying any of the rent and that his roommate in California was paying it all, but i'm not for sure. He never asked for any rent and I never thought to pay it, since I was picking up the tab on everything else.\n\n It's been 2 months since then and he hasn't paid me back yet, Iv'e asked a few times and he's said he cant send me any money right now. I haven't asked again because I don't want it to become a big thing. But I am low on cash right now and could use the money he owes me.",

One day I walked into class like normal, and she started talking about how we were gonna start a new unit today, WW2. There was also a parent of another student in the room, I think the kid had bad grades or something, I donât remember. \n\nAnyways, she said, and I quote, âWW2 is my favorite war.â That seemed really stupid to me, so without thinking, I blurted out, âWhat was your favorite part of the war, the part where 60 million people died?â She then went really quiet and pale-faced. The other kids in the room started to laugh, and I donât remember what the parent looked like but I donât think she was laughing.\n\nThe teacher didnât really say anything about it and just went on with the class. She then e-mailed my coach, I was on the soccer team, and called me a smartass. I was benched for the next game and my coach wasnât happy. I got super pissed at the teacher. She also said that the parent told her after the class that I was super disruptive and rude.\n\nI also talked a lot in that class and interrupted a lot, and the teacher had e-mailed my mom beforehand, and the teacher really didnât like me.\n\nIâm not asking if I was an asshole in that class in general, because I know I was. I was a little shithead in that class, Iâll admit it, Iâm just asking if I was the asshole this one time",

Iâm also a full time student in college. \nMy tiny nephew has autism as well so my Anxiety goes up when he does stupid stuff like trying to climb the fridge or jumping from the stairs. \n\nIâve also been not really well. Around this time I get really sick...like bedridden chicken noodle soup. For the last few weeks Iâve been off n on sick with coughing n throwing up. This past few weeks Iâve been feeling really bad and feel like Iâm going to throw up all the time. So I usually tell my sis ânâ law that I canât sit for about 2-3 days cause it usually takes 2-3 days to feel better. \n\nThough today I also told her due to school being stressful and sitting my tiny nephew is just as stressful I donât think I can still be his full time. Iâm still willing to sit but instead of everyday itâs like 2 days per week. Granted I sent all that by text âcause besides social anxiety I also have a hard time actually speaking my mind. But right now I feel like a buttface cause I promised and even assured her I can do this but I canât. \n\nMy anxiety is so bad that I get physically sick on my bus ride home. Itâs not motion sickness cause any other bus ride I feel fine. Itâs always after school. \n\nAnywho thx for reading I kinda know Iâm gonna be labeled a buttface.

She just can't maintain working on a regular basis and is on short term disability while working on a long term disability plan. She also has moderate OCD, so the cleaning is always done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer average days she may struggle with being fatigued and body sore. Some days are bad and I don't ever expect things to be done. But I would like dinner to have a bit of effort in it, not taking a frozen chicken breast out and over cooking it into another realm. Or doing chores while I am at work rather than wait until I am home and get obligated dirty looks if I don't immediately stop what I am doing to help her. She spends her day watching movies and documentaries and on the phone with her sisters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe cleans so much that it is actually a source of many fights. For the excessive anger, god forbid I drop a crumb on the floor or the dogs shed a hair. She will not get help for it, and the cost of cleaning supplies is getting to be too much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do ALL errands outside of the house, groceries, shoveling, get the mail, pick up meds, etc etc. I am also disabled but am high functioning. I feel like my needs have been very under met and I want to bring this up but I feel like I maybe am asking for too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has an expectation that if I am running an errand, I have to pick her up first and then go do the errand. So she can 'get outside more'. This adds a minimum of an hour of driving onto my day at least. But she will refuse to bus anywhere to meet me or go outside the house to do anything. She will go visit her sisters though. I have suggested volunteering, meeting new people, group therapies, any therapy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven when I get home from work for the day, I barely have time to sit. I look after the dogs and her cat. I make sure things around the house are done that she didn't do, and I help cook when I can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I work full time and my stay at home partner does minimal work at home and leaves errands for me to do.

      "title": "AITA For Turning my 12 year old nephew into CPS for his behavior and him being taken to juvenile detention?",
      "description": "- [ ] A long story but Iâll try to make it as short as possible. BACKSTORY: I am 41 years old. I live on a ranch with my significant other and 3 kids in a house adjacent to my elderly parents house. Iâve lived here almost all my life, except when I went away to college and when I moved away about 8 years ago which lasted only a year because my elderly father was diagnosed with leukemia so we moved back to help with the ranch as he had no other reliable help. I am the oldest child of my siblings and am adopted. My younger brother is currently 31 and is too adopted. Also my elderly parents have raised my three foster sisters whose current ages are 27,29 and 30. They have been in my parents care since birth-3 months. I still consider them family and am in contact with daily. My adopted brother is a complete mess but my mother completely covers up, sticks up for and will defend no matter what he does. He has molested my younger sisters as they were growing up. I was just made aware of this some years ago because this happened when I was away at college. My sisters told my mother repeatedly but she did nothing and continued to let it happen. My dad was a rancher and trucker so he was away and working a lot so when my sisters told my dad, my mom diminished their concerns and explained it away. Sadly as adults my 3 sisters now have emotional, substance abuse and psychological problems. As the years gone by my brother has stole anything and everything from my parents and has pulled a gun on my significant other while high and subsequently went to prison for 2 years. This incident caused a major rift between my mother and I as I was the one who called the police. My brother also has fathered 3 kids with less that desirable partners so all 3 kids have been in the care of my 80 year old mother and 77 year old father who thankfully is still with us but still has weekly chemo treatments. The only reason my family and I have stayed this long is for my dad. My mother is very domineering in their relationship which explains why my brother was never held accountable for his actions. My mom always says my brother has problems and needs help. The oldest of my brothers children is 12 years old and has anger and other psychological issues. While in my parents care, only went to school when he wanted because my parents could not get him to go. The 12 year old charged thousands of dollars on Xbox to my parents cc but was not punished as my mother just said âhe was boredâ I have called CPS dozens of times but nothing was done. The 12 year old started killing animals but when confronted, he would run to my mom (his grandma) and nothing would be done. The 12 year old had also showing signs of physical and verbal abuse towards my mom when she would not take him to Walmart or she would not do what he wanted. My mom would have broken glasses or mysterious falls all of which were explained away by her. I have no idea how long this had gone on as I was busy with my own life. Where my brother (12 year olds father) was I have no idea. I was only made aware when the abuse as it started to be directed toward my father. AITA MOMENT: One evening this past September my father came running to my house, telling me to call the cops. My husband was away at a work conference so I was home alone with my kids. I asked what was wrong and my father said â 12 year old is losing it over thereâ I immediately called 911 but we live rural so I knew it would be awhile so I made sure my kids were safe in their room watching a movie and started to walk next door with my dad. The 12 year old met us on my parents porch and started making physical threats toward my dad and cursing repeatedly. This isnât the first time the 12 year old has done this in but every time he has had an outburst my mother always excused his behavior or said she would get the 12 year old help. These outbursts were becoming more frequent and I knew they would continue. There was also a 6 year old and 2 month old (the other 2 of my brothers kids) in my parents household when this was going on. I then took out my phone and recorded the 12 year olds behavior towards my father. The police finally showed up about 45 min later but my mom said there was no problem. I had wanted to to show the police my video I had taken but I had to get my kids ready for bed so I missed my chance to talk to them. The next day I forwarded the video to CPS and the 12 year old was swiftly taken to a juvenile detention center. He is still there(about 2 months) as the authorities have been having trouble finding a place for him. To say my mom was upset was a understatement. Her anger did not bother me as much because I have let go of that relationship years ago but her behavior towards my dad is what hurts. She will not talk to him for days and is verbally abusive when he does not want do exactly what she wants. He helps her take care of the remaining two children in the house as much as he can. Why CPS has not removed the children is beyond me. This video incident happened in September and itâs almost December and my mother is still very angry. AITA for turning the video in? \n",

      "title": "AITA for asking my girlfriend to wear clothes that I find more attractive?",
      "description": "I (26M) recently asked my girlfriend (27F) if she would consider buying/wearing some different types of clothes that I find attractive. Nothing extreme, specifically I asked if she would get a pair of leggings and a one piece swimsuit. I absolutely love how these look on girls, but my girlfriend only ever seems to wear really long flowing dresses or bikinis, so a pair of leggings and a one piece would make me really happy. I should also preface this by mentioning that I in no way find her unattractive, I just think I would find find her even MORE attractive in my favourite types of clothes. I wouldn't expect her to wear them all the time, just every now and then so I can see her wearing them.\n\nAs to when I asked her, she kinda went off at me. She said no, because she said by trying to change her look I was objectifying her. She said that she shouldn't be expected to have to dress 'sexy' just to please me.\n\nNow going back to the reason I asked her in the first place, is because of how much I changed my wardrobe for her. I was not much of a fancy dresser before her. I pretty much wore geeky tees and cargo shorts all the time. She asked if I would change up my wardrobe to look nicer for her and I agreed. So now I pretty much live in collared shirts and long chino pants. I don't hate the style, but I do sometimes miss my old comfy clothes. I do definitely appreciate that I look nicer, and I love how she tells me that I look good.\n\nWhen she said no to my suggestion, I referred back to her changing my look. She said it's different because she was helping me get some much needed style, whereas my request was only about sex appeal and indulging my own fetishes. We got into a bit of an argument and didn't speak much the rest of the night.\n\nI feel bad for upsetting her, but I also don't think I was being unreasonable or offensive. Am I the Asshole?",

      "description": "My flatmate likes to skype at night, and our apartment walls are so thin it's like being in the same room. It was often till pretty late (between 11 - 2am) and she'd often wake me up or keep me awake. I have an early morning job (6am wakeup), and I sleep early, so I was really sleep-deprived. We agreed she wouldn't skype after 11pm, or if she did, then she'd do it in the spare room. \n\nLast night, I went to sleep at 10:30pm, I was feeling pretty ill and texted her that I was going to sleep, and asked if she could move to the spare room. She didn't check it so I went and knocked on her door a couple times, asking twice if she could move to the spare room. First time, she said \"Yeah.\" Second time she said that it was too cold in there and that she'd be finished soon (granted it doesnt have a heating air conditioner but it does has a small electric heater and blankets). She finished about 11:30.\n\nAfterwards I talked to her about it and she was really angry which shocked me. Apparently, this had been building up for her for a while. She said that this was my problem due to me being a light sleeper, and the whole being quiet after 11pm is a weird rule and that she should be able to skype at night sometimes and I should essentially just deal with it. She said she talked to her friends and family about it and they agree it's a weird rule (though later she told me that her mum had had the same arguments with her about skyping at night in their house). She says she's the only one having to compromise here. We worked out a compromise where she can skype sometimes, and sometimes I'll sleep in the spare room when the weather is warmer. \n\nI don't get it though. It seems totally normal to me to stay quiet at night when flat-sharing, but she talks like I'm a crazy person with issues, and that other people back her up. The irony for me is that she has rules that I think are weird (she has OCD) and I've tried to respect them, but I'm wondering if I'm genuinely in the wrong for being too strict. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Flatmate says I'm being unreasonable asking her not to chat online in the room next door when I'm sleeping at night.",

      "description": "I'm sick to my stomach of feeling like shit.\n\nMy bf works very hard to provide for his brother and for me. He is the only one who works and his brother who is older than him does not want to work and just cooks lunch and he never cleans after himself. I'm a student at college and I need much time to study, but I clean and cook and take care of our 4 animals whenever I can. I do the dishes and help him sometimes with his work. \n\nI understand he works very hard and is under very much pressure due to his work being just a total mess. He is a supervisor and has to endure manager duties and more every day. He is stressed. As fuck.\n\nSo he drinks. A lot. Because if he has a bad day (every day) he just wants to relax and not think about anything after hours of being asked every question at work.\n\nOn very rare occasions we go out because I ask to and he is on the mood. I like to go to the mall. But because he works from home and drinks a lot, his feet swell with a 2 hour walk at the mall and begins to feel anxious and the need for a drink to relax.\n\nI feel sad, because when we come home he would say oh how come I waste my only free time going to the mall with you, I could be at the beach swimming, I would love to be at the beach swimming, but your major gets in the way. When you graduate I will go to the beach to live there and if you want to come that's up to you, I want someone who will come and do everything for me.\n\nI moved from another country, without knowing him in person, so we could be together. I know he sacrificed his money and being happy alone, but I feel like a total asshole for not kissing his feet when we come home from the mall. Is the only thing I ask him to do for me. I don't want to feel like I'm getting on his way for happines. \n\nAm I the asshole for moving with him and getting on the way for his perfect life? Am I ungrateful for feeling sad or uncomfortable with comments like this? What should I do? ",

      "description": "I'm a man, been married to my wife for 7 years. We have never had a sex life, I'm talking 2-8 times per year. And usually it's just me masturbating while touching her boobs, then fingering her after. \n\nShe does have health issues. She's got nerve issues which make a lot of tasks very painful. For example, grabbing my cock and rubbing it for more than a minute cramps up her hand and it hurts for the rest of the day. So I feel bad asking for that, which is a problem because I ALWAYS initiate the sex and 9 times out of 10 get nothing. \n\nOn the other hand, she isn't interested in sex and doesn't try to do anything just for me. She won't do oral because it's \"gross\". And when we have actual sex she lays there and looks miserable/bored and that's it. I've asked so many times for her to do more that I feel like a real asshole and just try not to think about it. I don't want to force her to have sex or to do something she isn't comfortable with, but I also feel she should do everything possible to make me happy and she isn't. \n\nShe can't work because of her health. I've never held this against her and have no problem being the breadwinner. That doesn't mean she owes me sex but I feel it means she should try harder. Is that asshole thinking? \n\nI cope by masturbating a LOT. Once or twice a day. I assume she knows this. What she doesn't know is that I watch lots of porn and fantasize about cheating on her. She's asked me if I watch porn before and I said no. It would really hurt her if she knew the truth. This also makes me feel like an asshole. ",

Iâve been extremely excited about it and so has she. She put quite a bit of effort into it.\n\nA few days ago I was assaulted. This post isnât about that so thereâs no real reason to get into any details, but I havenât told my friend about it and Iâd like to just let it go. When I was in the ER I got really freaked out because somebody was speaking with the same accent as the guys who attacked me. I donât want to be racist or anything but this is all pretty fresh and I donât want to be reminded of it.\n\nHer boyfriend has that same accent. Heâs a great dude and Iâve hung out with him a lot because weâre all in the same friend group, but the idea of constantly being reminded about what happened during a night that I was previously super excited about sounds awful. I had lunch plans with my friend yesterday and I told her that I was sorry but I wouldnât be able to make it. She asked why and I told her âpersonal reasonsâ. When I refused to elaborate she said I was being insensitive and that she had put a lot of effort into these plans. She said I was being a bad friend and then she left early because she was upset.\n\nI didnât want to lie to her and make up a false story, and Iâm not comfortable sharing what happened, but now Iâm thinking that maybe I was being selfish and I should have made up a story or something.
