      "title": "AITA for threatening to sue former-friends to get back money they owed me?",
      "description": "In the past, I've had to threaten former friends on two seperate occasions to get money that they owed me and I feel like an asshole.\n\nThe first time, I was living with a best friend in an apartment but he got unofficially fired (dropped his hours to 1/hr a week to avoid paying unemployment and expected him to quit). He refused to look for a job for months so I covered his half of the rent/utilities while his parents covered his cellphone and food with the understanding he would pay me back. I kept a whiteboard that listed everything in the main room. After five months, it drained my savings and I had to move out. We remained friends but in the following months, I saw him make posts on Facebook about going on vacations, \"winning it big\" at a casino, and buying new clothes. When I would ask for the money he owed me (which was around 3k), he'd say he'd pay using his tax returns but that never happened. A year later, he stops talking to me on Facebook and responding to texts so I text him that if he doesn't pay me the money he owes me in three months, that I'll take him to court. Sure enough, a few weeks later, he paid me.\n\nThe second time, I did some graphic design work for a friend for free since it was a simple thing but she wanted a lot more work done and I told her that since she wants so much done, I'd have to charge her and she agreed on a price per hour. I spend a month making the branding, website, and advertising for her home-based business. After the job was finished, I calculated everything and it was just shy of 5k but I dropped it down to around 4k since she was a friend. I give her the bill, she said she would have to wait a few weeks but she was happy with the results. Weeks go by and nothing, just kept telling me I would have to wait a bit longer. While all of this is going on, she's on Facebook talking about big trips her and her husband are going on, and showing pictures their new house being remodeled. A few months go by and she still wants me to do more work but I tell her that she needs to pay for what I've already done before I can do more. That's when she says that she decided that I would be a part owner of her business (she has no business experience or plan), and that I would get paid when the company makes money. I tell her that I would prefer the money since I was looking at returning to college and she flipped out, saying how I didn't believe in her and how I was a horrible friend; ending it by saying she was going to block me and that she would send me the money in a few weeks. I'm blocked, waiting for the money that never comes so I send a message to her company Facebook, her personal email, and a way to circumvent the text ban, all saying that if she doesn't pay me in two weeks, that I'd take her to court. Again, sure enough, I'm paid almost immediately. four years later, her company is still in the red.\n\nTL;DR: Two former friends both owed me thousands of dollars and after waiting months, I had to threaten to sue them (even if I likely never would) to get it back, ending the friendship.\n\n",

      "description": "This happened months ago, so I’m a little fuzzy on the details, but I still think about it. It all started at the gym when I almost passed out. I’ll spare the medical details because they’re not important. Anyway I end up with this really cute nurse(pretty sure she was a resident though), and I’m head over heels, we’re talking twelve out a ten here, and we talked a bit and she was really cool and sweet. Well I being the shy guy I am never told her how I felt, other than slyly telling her she was cute... I don’t remember exactly, I just remember it being cringe. I check out of the hospital and I can’t stop thinking about her, so naturally I try to find her on the internet. I only have a first name, so no dice. Luckily I have a stepbrother who works at that same hospital(this is where it gets really cringe), and he got her last name and the next time she worked  so I could send her flowers, so I do with a cringy note attached saying something to the effect of “being in the hospital sucked but you made it suck less”, enough for her to remember me, and my phone number. Now keep in mind  about a week passed since I’d been in the hospital before the flowers got there. No response to the flowers . Now I know I’m not entitled to a response because for all she knew I was an axe murderer rapist, but it still made me feel like an asshole because it led me to believe she was creeped out rather than flattered(which is what I was going for). In the end I just wanna know that, and I know in the end she just wasn’t interested, but I really just wanna know what she felt when she got those flowers and that note.",

      "description": "         My girlfriend and I are both 18 and have been dating for 6 months, and she’s extremely against weed and alcohol. Before I started dating her, I smoked pretty often and drank often too. The reason she says she’s against it is because of her ex boyfriend of 4 months, who was mentally abusive towards her, and would drink and smoke often. \n          I have pretty extreme back pain from a track and field injury, and was prescribed pain killers for it. Personally I’m against opiates and would much rather smoke than to take them. But she has voiced to me many times that it would upset and scare her. I’ve told her plenty of times that I would be completely safe, and if she would prefer, I would only smoke cbd, and that she can be with me while I’m doing it.\n           So would I be the asshole if I smoke when she’s not ok with it whatsoever?",

      "description": "As I was looking for a parking spot next to school, I see a guy in a black Beetle parked in the middle of the street.  I’ve seen this guy a few times now. He’s parked in the middle of the street with his hazard lights on and waiting for a parking spot.\n\nAll incoming traffic had to circle past him just to keep going down the street. A girl in a Forrester circled around him to keep going down the street then someone got into their car and was about to back out of their parking space. The girl saw the spot that was about to open up and signaled to turn into the spot.\n\nThe guy decided to follow behind her and honk at her for a good five minutes as she parked in the spot.  At this point, everyone in the area was confused. She saw AND got the spot first. He pulled up behind her just to honk at her for no reason. Another girl with her friends were about to get into her car to leave her parking spot. She tells the guy that he should take her spot just to get him to stop honking and disrupting the peace. He doesn't listen because he’s too busy being petty and would not stop honking his horn.\n\nThe girl looks at me and tells me to take her spot, and gives me a thumbs up. I acknowledged her and started my turn signal. As I waited for her to back out of the spot, the Beetle which was in front of me by about 300ft decides to back up right in front of me, almost hitting my car, blocks the girl from getting out of her parking spot, and signals to turn into her spot.\n\nThe girl is unable to get out, the Beetle refused to move, and I was stuck trying to wait for my spot. As we waited for a good two minutes for the guy in the Beetle to move, the guy in the car behind me steps out of his car and approaches me.\n\nThe guy flashes his badge and asks what was going on. I tell him that the Beetle had been parked in the middle of the street and someone took a spot that they saw before he did, was honking at them and is now trying to steal my parking spot by blocking the girl who was trying to get out.\n\nThe cop says that he thinks the Beetle has the right to the spot because he's in front of me. I explained that the guy had backed up for no reason and was trying to take my spot when I already signaled and the girl who was trying to get out told me to take the spot.\n\nThe guy in the Beetle gets out of his car and tells me that he’s been waiting on this street for two hours to get a parking spot. And I responded with “I don’t care. If you were waiting for two hours, you’ve been parked in the middle of the street for two hours and blocking all the traffic.”\n\nThe cop asks the girl what happened. The girl corroborated my story; the cop told the guy to leave.\n\nThe girl backs out of her spot and I parked. I sat in my car after parking and decided to get out and take down the license plate of the guy in the Beetle in case he decides to be an asshole and somehow key my car as I’m in class.\n\nAITA for not just let the parking spot go and giving the spot to the Beetle?",

Also that since I’m doing it for nothing I don’t and will never apply a finish. I expect them to appreciate the work I’ve done by picking up a brush and giving 6-10 hours themselves. \n\nOne of the biggest complaints I hear too often is that I made a dining room table for a geographically distant cousin at the specs he gave me. They had too leave it out side until they could organise a spray painter and a way to get it inside at a total cost of 2500 and zero for me. (1800 for spray and the rest for transport and getting it inside, a window had to be dismantled). \n\nSo am I the arsehole. \n\nThis is getting a little long so I will comment on an example of the weight problem. \n\n\n",

      "description": "This happened a little less than a year ago, but recently one of my friends brought it up, so I decided to post what happened on here and see if I was the asshole in this situation.\nAlso, I apologize for any formatting issues, I am on mobile.\n\nSo, I consider myself an artist. I'm not professional in the slightest, and drawing is just a hobby, but I believe that as long as someone creates any form of art, whether it is their job or not, is allowed to label themselves an artist.\n\nBecause of this, I take a lot of pride in my artwork, even my purposely-bad shitpost art. Speaking of shitpost art, one day I was at lunch, sitting with my friends, drawing my shitty versions of Mario characters on sticky notes. Since I was drawing on a pad of sticky notes, I had to take the previous drawing off in order to move onto the next one, so I just left them sitting on the table, right by me, as I went onto drawing the next character.\n\nThen there was this one girl, I'll call her Rachel, who I wasn't exactly friends with, but we got along decently enough since she sat at my lunch table, who decided that it would be 'funny' to take my shitty drawing of Princess Peach, crumple it up, and then hold it so that it looked like she was about to tear it in half\n\nThe following conversation then went as such (I'm just paraphrasing what was said); \n\nMe: *looks up from my current drawing and sees what Rachel is doing with my Princess Peach picture* Rachel what the fuck?? Give that back!!\n\nRachel: JEEZ...*hands me the drawing with an annoyed look on her face* I was just joking!!\n\nMe: Well it looked like you were going to fucking rip it!! I know that it's just a shitty doodle, but I'm proud of it! You can just take it, crumple it up, then nearly rip it!!\n\nRachel: I wasn't gonna rip it!!!!\n\nThe next day, Rachel sat at a different table, which one of my friends actually sat at. Apparently, Rachel had decided to bitch about what I had done, and claimed that I was bullying her??? I swear on my life that before this incident, I had never been even slightly rude to Rachel before.",

      "description": "My girlfriend (26F) and I (30M)  have been dating for nearly 5 years. Our sex life started strong and has gradually declined over that time. The last two year or so, I’ve expressed concern for this trend because I think it’s important to the relationship to have a “healthy” sex life. I’d say we have sex around once every three weeks. Oral is much less frequent. \n\nAbout two weeks ago my gf brought up that she was going to purchase lingerie for my birthday and asked if there always anything I would like for her to wear. I showed her some items I liked (thanks, /r/lingerie) and we had a fun conversation about. Last Friday was my birthday and nothing happened all weekend. We went to dinner one on one Thursday night and took Friday off from work to spend time together before going out to dinner with my family that evening. Nothing happened on Saturday either. I calmly brought it up to her on Sunday and it was basically met with indifference or “I didn’t feel like it” responses. \n\nAITA for being annoyed and frustrated by all of this? I feel the lingerie conversation got my hopes up and not following through - especially considering previous conversations about being unsatisfied - was kind of a slap in the face. Obviously she doesn’t have to have sex or give oral because I said so but I feel that if the roles were reversed, I’d make some “extra effort” on their birthday regardless of how I felt. ",

      "description": "My friend was asking me about potential jobs where I work to which I was happy to talk to her about. She mentioned that where she currently works offers a referral bonus if someone you refer gets hired and I mentioned that yeah we have one too and it is quite a nice amount of money. As soon as I said this she mentioned we should split it. At this stage I could see where this was going so I told her she didn't have to put me as a reference if she doesn't want to. She tells me she'll put me as her reference if I'll split the money with her. I decline saying I'd rather not (Purely because I don't agree with her assuming she's entitled to a part of the bonus as it's not put in place for her). Finally, she asks me if she did put me down would I share it and I tell her honestly no.     \n\nSo there it is, was I being the asshole?",

      "description": "Disclaimer: First time posting and on mobile. I had no idea where else to put this.\n\nBack ground: So I (M18) am a college student working my butt off to stay in school. I pick up extra shifts all the time to try to make ends meet. I have a scholarship but I can not get free room and board until my sophomore year (for being an ). My day begins at 6:00 am and ends after 12:00 am. I feel like I never have time for a break. I am also a very honorable person. I work for every penny I have and buy much of my own things. I would never steal. Ever. I hate liars and stealers with a deep, deep passion. I also have insomnia and weed helps me sleep. I do not usually smoke weed.\n\nStory: It is a Friday night and I just got off work. I am extremely tired and I want to wind down. My friends are in my dorm (roommate let them in) and want to have fun. Again, I want to wind down but (A) this is the only time I would get to hang with my friends because of work and our busy schedules (B) the weed would help me sleep. My regular plug wasn’t available so I hit up this new guy my friend told me about. We were gonna get two grams for $20. I cashapp’d him the $15  and said I would give this $5 in person. He seemed genuine and legit. Long story short be never showed up and he blocked me. I was super fucking mad. Like how could you steal from me? I admit I was so anxious to just have fun winding down with my friends I didn’t think twice about sending he money. \n\nI have no idea what he looks like but I know his boys who sell as well. They covered for him (by saying they don’t know him) which I can’t blame them for, I respect that. They also have never scammed my friends. I wanted to handle this like people should where I’m from but I don’t want people to get involved and I can’t get arrested for assault over $15. Still, I fucking hate cheaters, dog. This happened weeks ago and still can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve told my friends who know him to never point him out to me because I swear on my mama I would cut him. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I snitched? I know his government (he’s kind of an idiot because cash app requires your real name and what kind of dealer puts their real name?). I also know where he lives. But, I don’t want to get his friends involved because they didn’t do anything. Again, they are legit. I know snitching is wrong but I have a feelings that I’m going to end up finding out who he is and I would feel like a huge bitch if I didn’t fuck him up. \n\n",

      "description": "  \n\nBeen on reddit for about a month or so at this point and this will be my first post so forgive me if I'm doing anything wrong as far as formatting goes or typos. Also a  long post so sorry for the long read, just needed to vent. \n\nTo start, a little bit of back story is necessary to understand everything in the story. I had met a gal on a dating app about five years ago and we had \"dated\" for a bit before things went to shit. Now something that's important to know is that she lived in another state, (I know, very dumb and foolish of me) but that didn't matter to me because I loved our conversations and had hoped that maybe we would meet up and see where things went from there. I also confirmed that she wasn't a catfish since that was when the show on MTV just got big and made it one of my main concerns but that's just a random side note. Mind you that I was about a year in a half out of high school at this time and was far from having any sort of money to be able to go on a trip by myself. Nonetheless I went through with pursuing a relationship with her and after we split, we remained good friends but would have moments where we wouldn't talk to each other for a few months here and there. Sometimes it would be because we would fight and make up later. Other times we would just fall off. We'll call her Cali for the story. \n\nNow before any of of that happened it is also important to know this tid bit. A good year or two before I met Cali, I volunteered at a basketball camp that my church held in which a youth group from Missouri came up and helped us out. Now being an awkward/weird kid in in high school, (still awkward, but much more comfortable in social situations, I try to make others laugh with my weirdness) I began to come out of my shell a bit and I would chit chat with some of the nice folk from the youth group. Ended up befriending some of them and adding them on the Book of Face. One of the people that I added was a girl who I had a crush on, but never really thought I had a chance with so it was mostly us making small talk and just catching up every few months. She did come with the group again the next year, but I had a gf at the time so anything with her relationship wise wasn't even a question. We'll call her...Mizzou. \n\nNow fast forward to this year, where I have a better paying job and can actually do some of the things that I want to do on my own. I've also become more confident in myself and I'm not as afraid to ask certain questions. So still having feelings for Cali, I suggest we meet each other in person as we had started to begin falling for each other again. She says yes and I'm like holy shit, this is great! I offered to get a hotel for her to stay in while she visits since she would be the one coming to me. Figured I should definitely help out and try to make it easier on her especially if it was my idea. She later claims that she has a cold and can't come only to later admit that she flaked out on me. Fan-fucking-tastic. \n\nSeveral months later, I start up with Mizzou again and one day I give her a compliment on her smile or something and she responds surprisingly well to it. So well that she ends up asking me to come out and hang with her. I'm like hold up, you serious my gal? Pffft, hell yeah. We end up at the point to where we're talking all day, every day for a good five months before my journey to visit her. We would snapchat, talk on the Book of Face, Facetime. The whole nine yards. Now over the course of the five months, I'm keeping it cool and just being my naturally weird/awkward self while also flirting with her here and there and letting her know that I'm interested to which she begins to flirt back too. It even gets to a point to where I'm talking about how if I had the chance to date her I would to which she replies, \"You never know what could happen\" which I respond by losing my shit because that made me so fricken happy. I get the vacation days from work off and I am more than excited to see her again. But what do ya know, her ex shows up about half way through my five/six day stay while I'm there and just makes everything weird. We go from talking and being super pumped and excited to do all this stuff around the city that she planned out each day, to her always being on her phone and seeming kind of distant. And when I mean kinda distant, I mean losing all the motivation to do anything at all. Save for a few moments here and there, she was just silent. Maybe she was embarrassed or old feelings had been brought up again. Anyways she ends up taking me to meet her parents and hang with some of her friends a few nights and I'm like ok this good. I felt a little froze out here and there with her friends, but I blame that on me being nervous around them and just meeting them. Then before I leave she apologized for that lovely guest appearance from her ex and I'm like it's ok. Not your fault. It's fine it is what it is...or is it? \n\nTurns out she told him when I was coming so that he wouldn't pop up and make things awkward, which made absolutely no sense to me. As far as I was tracking, they weren't on good terms based on the break up and what happened after. She was heartbroken over that. And that's totally understandable. I wouldn't have expected her to move on and not let it get to her so soon. Looking back at it now, as much as I hate to say it, she might have looked at me as a way to get her ex back or just make him jealous. I say this only because as far as I know, if she wasn't talking to him while she was talking to me, then why fucking bring it up to him. To me, the chances of him showing up were slim to none if he broke up with her a good eight months or so ago if she had just not told him. So this angered me as I found this out once I returned home but it still didn't change how I felt about her. Me being too caught up in the idea of being in a relationship with her, I had even considered going to a college not too far from her so that way I could finish my degree as well as work on things with her. I ran this by her about two weeks after I got back, and she gave me the standard \"idk, I haven't thought about it (it being us dating)  too much\" and I could accept that. Just to make sure that I wasn't given a bs answer, I asked if what she had thought about us was good or bad to which she said that it was good. Ok, cool so although she didn't say yes to the idea, it wasn't a complete no to it either. Two or three weeks go by again at this point and I'm feeling like our conversations just aren't the same as she is beginning to seem distant. So why not ask the question again! She ends up giving me the same \"idk\" answer before I tell her to just say what's on her mind straight up. She ends up telling me she isn't ready for a relationship which sucked, but more than anything made me angry as I felt like she had felt that way for some time. I don't mind that she said she wasn't ready, I was just mad because I felt lead on. Needless to say that was all I needed to cut that friendship off. I was just too hurt and upset to be able to talk with her without thinking about all of that. I tried to talk to her in recent month but it's just not the same. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago and I'm telling Cali about this, along with several other stories of me being used recently, and after I'm finished telling her she just disappears, but yet was still posting stories on her snap. This irritated me since usually she would listen to me vent and we could talk about everything but this one time all she says is \"that sucks. I gotta go.\" and when I asked what was wrong she just left me on read. That's cool. I'll bitch about it for a few then I'll probably be over it in a day or two. The next day when I get off shift, I see she messaged me and she apologized saying that what she did wasn't cool but she was a tad bit upset with me. Upset with me over what? I don't get enough sleep already and with work taking up 15 hours of my day, I wasn't exactly in the best mood to hear from her after that stunt the night before. Anyways, I will admit that I responded with a \"entertain me\" when she asked if I wanted to know why she was upset the previous night. She went on to say that she should \"cut my sorry ass\" out of her life and that I probably shouldn't be one of her closest friends in the first place. She tells me that she was upset because when we were \"together\", I hadn't thought about coming to visit her but I did for Mizzou and how she (Cali) didn't mean shit to me. Apparently when I was telling her my history with Mizzou, the only thing she heard was that we had ONLY talked for five months and completely ignored the fact that I had known Mizzou for a good minute. Oh, did I forget to mention that when I first started talking to Cali, she had mentioned numerous times about her town being full of racist, one of which being her step-father. Being a minority, that definitely sounds like a nice place to visit right? I explained all this to her as well as bringing up her backing out on the visit that I mentioned earlier which ended up in us talking things out so we ended up on good terms by the end of the night.\n\n It's been a week since that and we still haven't talked and I'm honestly not upset about that. I feel that if we were as close of friends as she says yet she would drop me over something that in my opinion is extremely ridiculous to even be mad about, then maybe I should be the one distancing her. I have been flip flopping on this idea since. On one hand, I do value our friendship and that's where I think maybe I need to just calm down, but also at the same time I feel expendable if she's willing to cut things off over something like that. I understand how she put that idea together, but I don't think see how she can be upset about it when SHE ba",

      "description": "So this Halloween I wanted to invite some friends at my place, nothing too serious, just a small party with a bunch of close friends and some less close guys they wanted to come with. Me and said close friends decided to buy some junk food, candy (what Halloween would it be otherwise) and drinks, mainly beer. My best friend Mark volunteered to bring some weed too. \n\nAfter we had bought everything I reminded everyone to pay their part, because it was decided from the start that we would have split the bill (the final cost was something around 3$ each). Everything was fine, until one of the not-so-close friends simply wrote in the group chat “Come on, man, why would I pay”. \n\nConfused, I asked him in private what was the deal, the conversation went something like this: (I’ll call him Z for short)\n\nMe: What do you mean why would you pay? \nZ: Come on man, don’t be an asshole\nMe: How am I being an asshole? Everyone else has agreed. \nZ: Are you serious?\nMe: Yup. \nZ: But I’ve already paid for the weed. \nMe: No you didn’t, Mark did. Just pay or bring something on your own. \nZ: Like a beer?\nMe: Yeah, like a couple of bottles. \nZ: Come on man. \n\nThis went on for a while, with me telling him to bring something and him just saying “Come on man” like that was the most logical argument he could’ve imagined. It got to the point where I was completely done with this, so I just told him to bring something, pay up or to not show up. He chose the latter.\n \nSo, am I the asshole for not letting this guy come empty handed to a party where everyone had helped buying something?\n",

      "description": "For the past 6 mnths I have been going to a therapist and when I started my treatment, we went over some of the policies and I agreed to the cancellation policy of giving &gt;24 hours notice. \n\nAt the beginning, I wanted to schedule frequent sessions as I had a lot of availability. He had limited availability and could only see me every 3-4weeks. In Jan. again, I wanted more frequent session but he had a vacation planned &amp; had limited availability so he could not fit me in for ~ 4 weeks.  \n\nIn the past 6 mnths I have had a total of 6 sessions. Besides those 6, I rescheduled 1 session with &gt; 24 hours notice, cancelled one session with &lt;24hours notice (for which I apologized and paid the cancellation fee of $90) and took his next earliest opening. Two days ago I called to reschedule my session for this afternoon(once again, providing &gt;24 hour notice). I gave my availability for the remainder of this week and for next week, to reschedule. \n\nToday: He called me this morning and wanting to have a “heart to heart”. He started probing as to why I rescheduled, I explained I have been happy with therapy and that it’s strictly a scheduling issue. I reminded him of how during my last session (2 weeks ago) I discussed over extending myself and am working more than one job at the moment. This is one of the reasons I am in therapy.  \n\nHowever, he didn’t really seem to take this as a good enough response? He kept saying that it wasn’t personal but clearly if I’m having scheduling issues that maybe this is not the best time to seek therapy and kept talking very vaguely about the situation. He then said “do you catch my drift”? So I responded with: “Are you saying that it’s best if we end this professional relationship?”and he said “no, no, that’s not what I’m saying, but can I get you to agree to a consistent schedule and a more than 48 hours cancellation policy?” I  agreed to the new cancellation policy.\n\nI explained to him that I had no idea this was causing him such an inconvenience since this is the first time he has mentioned ANYTHING about it being an issue. I provided him with more than 24 hour notice, and the one time that I didn’t, I was very apologetic and paid the cancellation fees. He said that he didn’t want me to feel like this was coming out of the blue but that he has overhead fees and it’s not good for my treatment to not be consistent nor is it convenient for all parties involved. \n\nAnyways, I agreed to the 48-hour cancellation policy, and he reminded me of my next 2 scheduled appointments. I checked my calendar and reassured him that I would be present for both of those sessions. \n\nHe then proceeded to say: “I think we need to scheduled anther 4 sessions right now, and have an agreement that if you miss any of those sessions that this therapy is terminated.” \n\nI thought about it and replied with, “ actually, I think it’s best if you cancel the two current appointments that I have scheduled and that we don’t schedule any future sessions”.

      "description": "A friend constantly messages me for help regarding Uni work. I try to give him some guidance and all but it's getting really obvious that he just want direct answers for his questions.  What's even worse is he barely comes in to Uni so it's obvious why he's struggling so much. So for once, I responded that he should have attended lectures to satisfy his questions as they explained it really well there. His reply almost implies that I'm an asshole for not helping a friend in need.\n\nNow, I know people might wonder why this is even a question but this post is really more to do with questioning my priorities, and less on the issue I stated above. I forgot the context but I was once asked by another friend if I value doing well in a test over helping a friend out (not in a life or death situation obviously) and they seem to be shocked when I said yes. Is it bad that I value my future over friendship because honestly, I'm getting really frustrated of looking like the villain all the time since I'm surrounded with friends who values their friendship over doing well in their course.",

      "description": "This happened just recently so I apologize if I give unimportant details. \n\nI found a video made by a small content creator I have been watching for the better part of a year that I think is incredibly racist. I left a comment about how disappointed I was, but it was an ancient video and I wanted to see if they stood by the video. I left a comment on a video that was released recently, but didn't hear back.  Sometimes you get a reply, but you don't get notified, so when I saw they were doing a livestream, I decided to check. \n\nI comb through the comments on the video, didn't find my comment. Checked the three before the one I commented on to see if I just had the wrong one. Not there. I decide that asking on the livestream would be the most direct option. I told them I saw they had a racist video and asked if they still stand by that.\n\nThe first time I got ignored. I get it, livestream, might have missed me. I wait a few minutes and tell them I didn't want to make a big shit out of it. I wait a few more minutes, nothing. I try to say that I understood it was a different time when it was made, I just wanted to know if they still felt it was acceptable, but I had been muted. Looking at it now, it was probably the curse word, but I am super insulted. I dealt with racists growing up, so I don't deal well with that. I feel a simple yes or no would have sufficed. I go back to the new video ask the question again, because I wanted to be sure I did in fact leave the message.\n\nI go back to the livestream to see if I am still muted and ask again if they still stood by it. I'm not, so the message goes up and someone tells me to stop trying to start drama. A couple of other people join in. I give the name of the video as proof that I wasn't just making it up, but get told by the creator to stop trying to slander them.\n\nI never said they were racist, but they did make some racist content. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, because just because someone does some stupid stuff, doesn't mean it should haunt them forever. I said the title of the video again and said it was racist, I just wanted to know if they stood by it. I was told by other people that it wasn't racist and told I was just  a troll, then the creator again told me to stop the slander. I said so you don't feel (the racist stuff they did in the video) wasn't racist? Goodbye. I unsubbed and am hurt about the whole thing. I really liked their content, but I am just not cool with the undoubtedly racist video or being gaslighted. \n\nI won't give the name of the video or the creator, because this really isn't about that. What I want to know is if I am the asshole for trying to get the answer during a livestream? Should I have waited and potentially gotten the question dodged again? ",

Not that he didn’t have access before, but now it’s ramped up because he can buy it himself.\n\nI don’t care that he drinks, but I find it extra irritating that’s it’s ramped up while I’m pregnant. I’m not huge on drinking, but I still feel left out.\n\nOn several occasions I’ve driven to family/friends house and he starts drinking without expecting to drive home. \n\nI’ve started to talk to him recently about how he can’t always expect me to drive home and that he needs to ask before he’s going to drink to the point where he can’t drive. He thinks it’s ridicules that I would expect that of him since because I can’t drink, then there’s no reason I shouldn’t be able to drive. Which is dumb because being pregnant isn’t a walk in the park. I get tired easily, I get nauseous, and frankly my irritated self doesn’t like being a chauffeur.\n\nIf it was up to me he wouldn’t be drinking for the duration of me carrying his baby, but I don’t want to be completely unreasonable.

Physically, mentally, and verbally. Just to the kids, he was a devoted and loyal husband. And, he’s an ok grandpa now. As an adult, he mellowed and I started to be forgiving as I started a family of my own. \n\nAbout 3 years ago, both parents health took a bad turn and mom asked me to take care of him if she died since my sister is essentially useless.  I agreed, I KNEW he would die first anyway.  \n\n2 years ago, I had a falling out with Dad. Soon after, her health took a sharp spiral. I begged her to move in with us, but she wouldn’t leave him behind. I begged her to move them both into assisted living, that I would pay for, and HE refused. Again, she wouldn’t leave him. \n\nShe died last week. Cardiac arrest and the living situation prevented paramedics from getting to her quickly. By the time she was revived she was brain dead. She passed on Friday. I kept my promise though, and handled everything. In process of cleaning the house now and trying to repair relationship with dad for her sake. \n\nToday he said he was thinking of assisted living. Bit my tongue, but I’m LIVID.  I was trying not to blame him, but with his change of heart, it’s hard not to. There’s more, but space constraints..\n\nSo...AITA?\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to talk with my friend about her sex life?",
      "description": "I had a pretty big argument with one of my best friends, who I’ve known since middle school (we’re both 19). She recently downloaded tindr and had me help pick out the pictures for her profile. Fine so far. About a week into her experience with the app she started telling me -in vivid detail- of her encounters with various men and women. At first I just listened and tried to change the subject as soon as possible, but then she got a boyfriend and starting reporting on an almost daily basis of what they did, the sex toys they were buying, and how they were implementing them. At this point I got pretty fed up and told her that I thought what she was telling me was a serious breech of trust between her and her partner, that I didn’t want to hear it, and there are some things that she should just keep to herself. She was hurt and offended, and told me that she thought she could be open with me about anything. I repeated that there are just some things you shouldn’t share with others and there are things I wouldn’t share with her, or anyone else for that matter. She became very pissed off at me when I said this and it has spiraled into a huge argument of whether oversharing is really “a thing.” I’m not dumb, I know I’m right in my position that oversharing most certainly exists, no matter how comfortable you are talking about the topic. However, she is right in that we are (were?) very close, and I’m starting to feel like I’m the asshole for not just shutting up and being supportive. I also said some dumb stuff that probably came across as accusatory but was not directed at her and was in the context of a more general situation like talking to a stranger. (“oversharers lack boundaries, come across as desperate, are naive, and it’s just generally not a good a idea, etc.”). Recently, she brought this arguement into our whole friend group, and literally everyone agrees with her that I’m being an ass, and people should be able to be open about whatever they want. AITA and how bad is it?\n\n(Sorry for shitty mobile formatting btw)",

      "description": "Hey guys,\n\nNeed your opinions on something, because I've gotten a few people annoyed at me over this. \n\nI turn 21 in a few days. Its very, very close to Christmas. My birthday was always overshadowed by Christmas, my friends would always be away or busy and I honestly just never formed the attachment to birthdays most people seem to have. \n\nI've tried. I really have. I threw an 18th and 20th birthday party but they both kinda sucked. People got wasted, my family were all jerks and I spent most of my time dealing with problems. Everybody else had an awesome time, but I didn't. \n\n\nIt kinda strikes me that the times I deliberately don't plan anything awesome stuff happens. I deliberately \"go with the flow\" on my birthday. That means no firm plans until right before. Its worked for a few years now. It's kinda like my.own personal tradition. Can list awesome stuff that's happened when I do this, but that'd just be bragging. \n\n\nBut this year my family have it stuck in their head that since it's my 21st I *have* to have some sort of event. First they got angry at me over not wanting a 21st party (my mum basically ruined my last party by telling at me over silly stuff and trying to make it her event) and then they got annoyed that I didnt want to go somewhere expensive for a family dinner. My sister and I dont get along due to a long history, and my parents like to pretend it's just normal sibling squabbling; I really don't want a family dinner with her at the table. Got to the point where I was very clearly saying \"I dont want to make plans on my birthday\" and my mum trying to twist what I was saying into drama. I just walked off. \n\n\nAnd now my girlfriend is trying to plan my birthday out. She keeps trying to plan a birthday dinner for the two of us at somewhere fancy, but I've tried to tell her that I don't want anything extravagant. Shes also trying to plan a movie, which I think would be cool, but trying to say that she wants to take me somewhere nice before the movie, as well as pre book tickets. I appreciate the gesture, but it's exactly what I don't want; setting (expensive) things in stone and removing any chance for cool shit to happen to me. \n\n\n\nThis is already starting to backfire. A piercing studio I like just announced a promotion on my birthday that would make piercings I've been planning for a while significantly cheaper. I feel like this is just the first thing that I'll miss out on if I let people keep planning things for me. \n\n\nSo AITA for refusing to make plans on my birthday, despite the fact it would make my gf and family happy? \n\n",

      "description": "Me and him just had some kind of quarrel before over something that happened a long time ago. He insulted my grandpa shortly after his died. I got angry and well, insulted his grandpa back. It was terrible of me. His grandpa had just died and I said something awful about him. \n\nWell, back there it seemed obvious that I was  the asshole in the situation. He told me that he didn't even insult my grandpa, that I misunderstood it and that I overreacted and that I'm completely 100% at fault and to blame. \n\nSo, a short time ago he confessed to me that he did insult my grandpa. And that he did it because he was jealous and angry that mine was still alive. I couldn't get it out of my head and today I brought this up. Honestly, I wanted him to apologize for what he said. \n\nHe didn't apologize. In his opinion I should forgive him because of the situation he was in, and because he had forgiven me for things I said in the past too. And besides he had a good reason for doing this, unlike me. \n\nI don't know what to think. I know that what I did was horrible, but my grandpa is the best person in my entire family. He is the only one that was always nice to me unlike the rest who just treated me badly throughout my childhood. And when he insulted him I got so mad. And I just want him to apologize for the sake of my grandpa.I know I'm a huge asshole often too. I'm sorry if this doesn't fit in or sounds too biased. \n\nI don't want to repeat what I said about his grandpa, but it was way way worse than what he said.",

      "title": "AITA for telling a friend's girlfriend that she's spoiled?",
      "description": "Several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. Before we start, some background about my friend: I've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. He worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. He paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. He recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.\n\nOn to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. I could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. When we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how \"At 33 years old I shouldn't have to take the bus anymore\", and \"Taking public transportation is for losers\". As someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, I'll admit I took some offense to that. I've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it \"beneath me\".\n\nThe real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. Wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. Here's where I may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. \n\nAfter a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. After they left, my wife said I shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and I almost ruined dinner for everyone. My friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.\n\nSo, AITA?",

We have been together for 2 years and yes there have been good times and we are faithful and I would just like to point out he has never physically hurt me etc but it's just not what I want anymore-understandably I think.\n\nI have been preparing, with the support of my family and friends, the absolute best way to break up as to not cause him to self harm or me to end up being involved in his self harm, and so I have a place to live in the mean time etc. I also have a bad experience in the past where I broke up with someone in person and they assaulted me. So the only thing left to do was... the actual break up. I was speaking to my family and talking about how to do it, face to face, send a letter, all the usual stuff when my sister pointed out that she thinks it would just be safer for everyone if I just sent him a message explaining my thoughts. We had already agreed I would spend a few nights at home as he had quite clearly realised that something was up with me so our only communication at this point was through messenger. So I sent him a message. Just saying I think we should end it here and it was better for both of us.\n\nAs you can expect, he was very hurt and upset and I said I would explain more in person. I didn't want to go into details over messenger but I wanted him to have a fair head start of the grieving process, just like I have. 2 days on and we have agreed to meet, I have written a letter explaining things in a very diplomatic way (I really struggle with words straight from my head and knew I wouldn't be able to say what I really wanted to).\n\nBut now, he is completely flipping out that I disrespected him by telling him over messenger. He says he feels like I never loved him if I can throw it all away in a message. He says it's really inappropriate and that I should have spoken to him so I wasn't so sold on the idea? I have tried to explain that I am doing the best I can in these circumstances, it's not easy for me, I'm just as hurt and upset but it will be better for us both, there's never a right time or way to do it. But he's so stuck on the message part. I don't want him to feel any more disrespected then a break up already is, and I do not have a malicious bone in my body as to want to cause him any more pain than necessary. I just need to know if it was really an asshole move and if it was, what should I have done instead? My sister just made me think about how unsafe it could be and with my experience in the past, even though he has never hurt me, I just felt at the time it was right. But since he has flipped I am completely regretting my decision but still don't know how I could have done it.\n\nI feel like an asshole, but am I the asshole? ",

I say something to my friend who sits across the aisle from me, and another teacher- the head of the subject- is in here now. (She’s not my teacher, and it notorious for being a piece of shit.) she tells me and my friend to sit down, and everyone else leaves. She tells us to say we’re sorry. My friend does and leaves, and I say it too- not actually meaning it. She tells me to say it again meaning it more, and I tell her I already have. She gives me a lunchtime detention, and then I say “will I still have a detention if I say sorry now?” She tells me yes, so I tell her that I’m not sorry and I leave. (She said i could go, I didn’t just leave without permission.) AITA for not saying sorry with ‘more meaning’ to an asshole teacher (who wasn’t even my teacher)?\n\nSide note: my teacher was just standing there the whole time, not saying anything.

      "description": "Backstory; I've known my best friend for 11 years. Not a day goes by we don't talk, or at least it *used* to be that way. Over the last couple of years, he's become more and more flaky as he goes through girlfriends and starts ditching me and his other friends to go be with them. And I don't mean he's making plans as an excuse to not hang out with us, I mean he literally will make plans WEEKS in advance and then bail the day of because he wants to go spend time with her and her group of friends. I've had a multitude of conversations with him about how it's not fucking cool to ditch me like that, and he apologizes only to turn around and do it again. I get that we're teenagers and a bit of flakiness is expected, but when I make plans with TONS of wiggle room and he bails, it gets to be immensely frustrating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently this behavior started bugging me so much that I flat out started ignoring him when he wanted to make plans, because every time I try to he decides to ditch. Today, we were supposed to hang out and he kept asking when I wanted to hang out; and I pretty much ignored him. Now he's pissed at me for not hanging out with him today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA? Personally, I feel like it's justified for me to do this. Childish, sure, but completely justified considering I've talked to him about this many times and he chooses to piss off every single one of them.",

      "description": "This happened years ago on a Ryanair flight and is obviously not a big deal, but to this day I wonder if how I acted was okay or assholish.\n\nSo I was sitting in my seat during the flight and got up to pee and change my pad (as - TMI - I was on a heavy day of my period and worried about leakage). I wait in line in front of the lavatory, 2 or 3 people in front of me already waiting as well. After 5-10 minutes it's finally my turn and I move to enter. \n\nJust then a little kid (4-5 years, maybe?) comes running down the aisle, his dad walking a few feet behind him, and kiddo tries to squeeze past my legs into the lavatory as I'm opening the door. I hold my arm out in front of the child and say kindly but firmly \"No, you have to wait in line like I did, it's not your turn.\" Dad says nothing and I move into the stall and close the door. I felt like I was in the right because I had waited in line, I really had to change my pad soon or there'd be blood on my pants, and I thought I was being fair and polite letting the kid know why he had to wait.\n\nSomeone gives a few firm knocks on the door but I just say \"occupied!\" and quickly do my business. As I exit the restroom the dad and child are gone, presumably to use the lavatory in the back of the plane. A male flight attendant, however, is waiting next to the door and in a tone like he has to school an idiot says \"What you did was very rude, that was just a child, what if that was an emergency?\" In an admittedly snippy tone I replied \"What if it was an emergency for me too?\" and went back to my seat.\n\nDoes not letting a child go first automatically make me the asshole, like that flight attendant thought? I would've let kid and dad cut in line if they'd asked, and feel bad because obviously a child can't hold it in like an adult can, but because of the whole trying to squeeze past me approach, my gut reaction was \"no way\".",

I had this friend who could usually take me to midnight, but she was a bit of a jerk. The main reason I still talked with her was for a video game buddy. \nAnyways, it was summer when this takes place. It was around 11:30, and I was on a discord chat with her (we had eachother’s phone numbers, but we thought it was cooler to Discord). We were playing a game that was basically the same as Minecraft, but still in the makings. We had been building a house that already looked like crap, and she wanted curtains. I’ll spare you the details from here, since they’re not at all important. \nBasically, she gave me a few options, I chose one she hated that went nicely with the house, and refused to back down. She was basically throwing a tantrum at this point, since it was past midnight, and she wasn’t used to being up late. There was also a third friend. I texted him about what was happening, along my intentions in this squabble. He hated her as much as I did, so this worked well. I told him exactly what to say in the group chat between the three of us, right before I sent my own message in there, giving him a choice between all of the curtains. I didn’t care about the curtains AT ALL. \nWas I the asshole?",

      "description": "Here's the deal: my friend's 30th birthday is going to be within a few days and his wife is throwing him a party at their place. She invited me and all of his friends to a facebook group in order to invite us. I agreed enthusiastically to her proposal because I really wanted to be part of his 30th birthday.\n\nIt was only after having a closer look that I realized that my friend's sister is also part of this facebook group. And only a few minutes after I realized this she wrote back that she and her fiancé would attend as well. Now here's the thing: some two years ago me and her had an affair that lasted for almost a year. Things were kind of intense and by the end of said year she wanted to take it to the next level, i.e. have an actual relationship with me. \n\nWhile enjoyed being with her, I just didn't have any feelings towards her. I liked the sex, her company and everything about her - but I just didn' have any feelings towards her...I couldn't explain it. It was then that she told me that she wanted to end the affair because of my lack of commitment. I understood her position and we agreed to part ways. There was no hostility or fighting. We agreed to remain in touch, though. \n\nNow, I know it sounds stupid: but a few monhs afer we broke off, I started to miss her terribly and regretted it immensily that I could not commit. But by that time she already hooked up wih anoher guy and they're now engaged. \n\nIt seems that I had feelings for her nevertheless - and might still have! I still fantasize about her quite often. And it is therefore that the thought of having to spend an entire evening in the same room with her and her fiancé makes me feel terribly uncomfortable. If I had realized that she had been invited as well, I would have come up wih an excuse and declined the invitation. In this case, however, I agreed to attend without checking beforehand whether she would attend as well. I just don't know how I will react in this situation: I might be horny, angry, drunk or any of the above. \n\nBecause of that I'm considering of coming up with an excuse (i.e. a lie) and tell his wife hat I cannot attend. WIBTA?\n\nTl;dr: Agreed to attend a friend's birthday party without knowing that his sister and her fiancé would attend. I once had an affair with said sister and still have feelings for her: I think about cancelling my plans to attend his party, which makes me feel kind of shitty. \n\nAlso: nobody, not my friend nor his wife, nor anybody in our mutual circle of friends knows that I had an affair with my friend's sister. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This happened a couple of years ago, and I still occassionally think about it.\n\nIn high school, I had a friend who I walked home with from the bus stop every day after school, since we were neighbors. I'd known her since I'd moved to that small neighborhood some ten years prior; we were never really close friends, but rather more close acquaintances, as we were the only two people roughly in our same age group living there. Nothing more than a three-four minute chat about the school day, the weather, or, occasionally, gushing about some new album that'd come out recently.\n\nOne particular Friday afternoon, the neighborhood was filled with noise. About two or three houses that day were getting work done on various parts of their house, their front lawn, or their backyard. We were chatting it up and laughing about something my Spanish teacher, whom we had a mutual dislike for, had done that day. Passing by a small group of the people working on the front lawn, I waved and said 'Hola!' They waved back with smiles.\n\nAbout seven seconds later when we'd passed them, my friend stopped and heavily scolded me. In fact, I think she was about to blow a fuse; I'd never seen her angry in my entire life, let alone this angry. She yelled that it was extremely offensive and racist to speak to them 'in that way,' saying 'They speak English, ya know! That was so insensitive!'\n\nI was dumbfounded. Startled and frightened, I just mumbled 'yeah, sorry, sorry' till I finished walking home. In the shower later that day, I was still thinking about what I'd done wrong -- how could saying 'Hola' to *Spanish* people be offensive? In context, I felt like an asshole. But if one of the workers walked up to me or her and said 'Hi,' in English, would I have the right to be offended?\n\nWas I being culturally insensitive or something? Since it was a Friday and the weekend passed before Monday, I couldn't tell if she either forgot or if she had put it past us. AITA?",

      "description": "So I've known this guy for years. He was considered a brother to me and my brothers. He joined the Navy and fell out of contact with them. I stayed in contact and we would game on a consistent basis. Texting and some phone calls, but he lived in a different state. Fast forward to recently. He works at a delivery job and interns on the weekend, so he has minimal income. He also just bought a guitar and constantly buys airsoft stuff. He texts me that he couldn't afford rent and that his check bounced. He asks me if I can help him in anyway, even like $15.\n\n\nI was iffy about helping with money as I know his situation. I know he doesn't make a lot and I know he would possibly be in this situation next month. So I said I'd love to help, but first do you have a savings plan in place or are you looking for a better job? Something to signal to me that he doesn't just want me to fix his problems and make it better.  He said forget it. And hasn't texted me since.\n\n\nI've worked hard to become as financially stable as I am and I would absolutely pay his whole rent this month, but I can't get into a situation where I am constantly bailing him out. I fell into that with a former coworker and it caused a divide when I stopped paying for his food almost every day.\n\n\nI want to help him, but I just wanted to make sure that he is happy and stable or at least has a plan. I've got a child on the way and I can't be as loose with money, but I also don't want to he an asshole.\n\n\nSo TL: DR Friend came to me asking for money for rent, I was willing to help but wanted to know his game plan for the future, and he got mad.\n\n\n",

Like throwing a wet towel on the floor after the shower and not picking it up for hours. We don't live in a fucking hotel and I hate stepping on a wet towel. If I tell him to pick up after himself a bit he sometimes gets mad and calls me 'mom' sarcastically. Which I really hate btw. However today we got in a big argument, I made pancakes and when I put them on the table he took one with his hands and turned to the computer. I told him that there are plates and silverware and he should use this instead of eating with his hands. He got mad, called me mom, said I treat him like a five year old etc. I got mad as well because I don't want to feel like his mom, but I think it is not too much to ask for him to use a knife and a fork if he's eating something greasy. I don't care about crumbs on the floor or something, but fatty fingerprints are so unnecessary. I'm really frustrated now. Am I the asshole here or is he overreacting?\n\nIf it matters, we live together. It's not like I'm trying to mess with his own flat, it is my home as well. ",

      "description": "I live in an apartment with two other roommates while we are all going to college. They are both out of state students so during the winter break, they go home to their parents' houses. Last week, we got the bill for the period of break and they told me they didn't feel comfortable paying 1/3 shares (which was only $35) of it because they weren't here. \n\nMy defense was that the heat has to be on no matter what because it gets down below zero here and the pipes freeze, so our landlord asked everyone to keep it on, and I tried my best to use as little extra heat as possible to keep myself warm and did things like seal the windows to keep the heat in. Also, I think that we don't actually pay the electric bill based on individual power consumption anyway since that would mean stuff like whoever turns more lights on would have to pay more, and if I'm away for more weekends out of the month, I pay less. \n\nAITA for asking them to pay 1/3 each? It would be really hard for me to afford the majority of it because I can barely get any work hours in because of my busy class and extracurricular activities schedules. Also, their parents pay all of their bills anyway so I don't understand why they're being so adamant about this.\n\n",

I never really remember this being different any in my lifetime.\n\nI can stop myself from doing it, but it makes me highly uncomfortable and nervous, even though I'm an adult now (20 years old). If I'm doing it because of stress, stopping it is very hard and makes me feel like my head will explode.\n\nFor some reason, my older sister absolutely **hates** and always has hated me doing it.\n\nShe's the favourite child of my mother, so naturally I wasn't allowed to behave like that around the family when I was younger, leading to me frequently getting scolded and punished or my sister mocking me about it until I cry, because I wouldn't stop it. I wasn't an easy kid, so they probably thought I would do it on purpose, just to be mean, never believing me I didn't.\n\nActual situation:\n\nOne or two years ago, my father, both of my sisters and I decided to visit a famous café to eat some cake. I already warned my family it wouldn't be easy for me since I suffer from social anxiety and there would be way to much people for me.\n\nWhen we sat down, I got really nervous and started humming. Knowing that this is the thing my sister hates the most, I stopped myself from doing it and started moving my hands. She got angry about it anyways. I thought it was because it's so easily visible, so I started moving my feet instead. She got even more angry and scolded me (a bit weird since we're both adults, but I guess it's just learned behaviour, so I don't mind). My dad sided with her (obviously) and both were getting mad, so I tried holding it back. I told them I couldn‘t really stop it, but they didn't believed me and refused my propose to just leave (as there was only this opportunity to eat there). Pressure started rising, I got extremly anxious and started crying, so I decided to stop surpressing it. That stressed my sister somehow and she got so angry that she started crying then while I slowly calmed down. She calmed down later.\n\nAt the moment I was just relieved that I could follow my way (and somehow proud that I stood up for myself), since nobody could punish me for it anymore and I didn't have to get a panic attack or something and didn't even thought about her side, but afterwards I felt bad for it. I mean, I just could have gone to the bathroom and hide myself while anxiety kicks in or smth, then I wouldn't have ruined their day. And making your sister cry should in no way something that should make you feel relieved, still less proud. So AITA for making her cry and (in that moment) not even being sad about it?",

Part of my job is going over applications for housing subsidies and government housing rentals as well as following up, checking status of applications, outstanding accounts, etc. Along with a slew of other employees, I make decisions whether an applicant can get subsidized housing or can continue to get it. There is *not much* leeway you can give but there is *some*. Why part of the process can be subjective I don't know, I just do my job.\n\nMy friend, single mother of two, is on subsidized housing. Her application came under review months ago and as luck would have it, it was my job to review it. Standard procedure is to recuse ourselves if a personal bias can appear, and I did so, but not before I took a look at her file first.\n\nShe was in arrears several months and the most recent inspection showed poor maintenance/upkeep of the property on her end. All signs pointed to possible eviction, but I had to recuse myself and handed it off to my superior who I guess delegated it to someone else. I don't know who.\n\nShe ended up being evicted and now lives in a shelter. I thought everything would be alright in the end but my friend made no attempt to solve her living arrangements issues. She insisted on \"fighting\" the eviction, ultimately doing nothing and hoping a miracle would happen. The government doesn't work this way.\n\nWe went out for coffee recently and through our conversation I let slip I saw her file and was going to work on it until I had to step aside and let someone else take over. She exploded at me, saying I was directly responsible for her living in a shelter. She said I had no heart to let two kids go homeless but I explained to her there was literally nothing I could have done. She claims I could have got a stay of eviction or something but I couldn't have.\n\nI feel like a shitty person but I don't know if it's just being empathetic or I really was an asshole. She made it sound like my job is to purposefully \"ruin lives\".",

      "description": "My husband and I have been together for 14 years and have 3 children together, ages 8, 2, and 1. This is important info for the rest of my post.\n\nWhen we were planning our wedding (10 years ago), his Father and Stepmom completely ghosted us on arrangements for the wedding. We weren’t demanding anything from them at all and expressed this several times, but they refused to communicate with us whatsoever and it caused a strain on our wedding planning and relationship. My husband made so many excuses for his Dad and I was so frustrated and baffled as to why they couldn’t just have a conversation with us. At the wedding, they came and left early without even saying goodbye. \n\nSince then I’ve had several awkward things happen at their home, which is an hour away from where we live. The first Christmas after our 8 year old was born, I asked his stepmom if there was a room that I could breastfeed in. She directed me to their office. I went in there and there were 3, used and open, cat litter boxes in a very small room. I should mention that they are animal hoarders. They have 8 dogs and I don’t even know how many cats. All indoor animals. I don’t care if people love animals, but this seems excessive. \n\nWhen I was 8 months pregnant with our 2 year old, their dog walked up to me in the living room and pissed on my leg and foot. They never apologized or acted like they were even surprised. I was mortified. \n\nWe’ve also had several birthday parties for our children where they’ve shown up an hour or later and just act like everything is fine. They didn’t even come to our 2 year olds 1st birthday and no explanation was ever given to us. They did this to my 8 year also. I know that they come to our city every once and awhile for shopping, business, or to visit their other children who live by but they never reach out to my husband and ask to visit or be involved in our children’s lives. \n\nThis past Christmas I reached my breaking point. His stepmom text messaged us both about a week before and told (not asked) us that we needed to bring one of three side dishes. Ok fine, we’re only driving an hour to your house where you insist on hosting each year, but by all means we’ll bring a side dish. We get there and have to walk through their garage (where they chain smoke and use as the only entrance into their house) with our three kiddos. As soon as I walked in, I got an instant migraine from the smell. It was a combination of cigarettes, wet dog, cat pee and mold. \n\nThe longer we were there, the more freaked out I became. There was mold on Christmas decorations, cat poop on the bathroom floors, cat piss on all the furniture. All on arms reach of our 2 and 1 year olds. I literally broke out in hives. My husbands step sister had to leave early to take her children to their fathers and I used that as an opportunity to leave also. When we got home my husband was extremely upset. I had told him earlier in the day I wasn’t feeling well and to watch the little ones around the cat poop and moldy ornaments so he knew I wanted to leave. After we calmed down he said he understood if I didn’t want to go to their house anymore. \n\nI’m ok with not going there anymore, but I still feel bad. I don’t feel bad for not going, I feel bad for my husband because it seems so one sided. It’s like they don’t want anything to do with us yet we’re somehow obligated to be involved. I just associate them with filth and not caring to communicate because that’s how they’ve always come across...\n\n",

I got really upset because I have some personal shit on my computer. He started to call me out for what I *do* have on my computer, and I have a note on it that is more or less dedicated to this friend and was a big rant about what I didn’t like about him (he is an ex boyfriend and I wrote the note prior to our breakup, but left it alone— we ended on good terms). I got even more upset because I didn’t want anyone, even him, to read this note as it was just a rant. He KNOWS I’m paranoid about everything and don’t trust even my best friends with my phone or laptop, and I never gave him permission to use it, nor did he ask prior. \n\nSo we got into an argument about the stuff I wrote in my note and I kept trying to defend myself saying that he shouldn’t have gone through my computer and went as far as to actually open up my notes and other things and that it was disrespectful on his end to snoop.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Okay so I (M21) have been with my girlfriend (20) for a year now. When we first started having sex it was pretty good, better than any sexual experiences I've had before. That lasted a few months, tops.\n\nEventually I started noticing that I am the only one who ever initiates sex (except for one time, which I feel kind of petty for counting). I asked her about it and she told me she essentially has no sex drive.\n\nI was kind of hurt. That went against everything she had told me about herself. She told me before we started having sex that it was her favorite thing, that she had a really high sex drive and that it was a problem for her when she was in high school.\n\nShe reassures me that it isn't my fault, every time she brings it up, but idk. I've started getting in my head about it and now I can't last for more than 3 seconds when I'm inside her (making our sex even worse and putting me further into my head). When I think of sex now I just get frustrated instead of excited.\n\nThough talking with her I now know that her last bfs dick \"fit her better\" with it's upward curve and made her cum everytime. I never make her cum through penetration and rarely can through fingering. She used to get so wet there would be a puddle under her on the bed. With me she's so dry we almost always need lube. We can go months without having sex, if I never initiated we'd never have it again. I also know that her first few sexual experiences she was more or less forced into, and she's mentioned that that was when she was most turned on even though she didn't want to be.\n\nI know she isn't cheating. And she will suck my dick or have sex with me whenever I ask or initiate, but I know she doesn't like it and can't get out of my head.\n\nA few weeks ago I was trying to finger her to orgasm before we had sex and it wasn't doing anything for her. She started going down on me and I couldn't get it up. She asked me if something was wrong and I told her that sex with her makes me want to bang my head against the wall. I keep trying and trying but it doesn't get any better. She started crying immediately. I love her so much and making her cry broke my heart. I know I should have handled it better, but does that make me the asshole? And what can we do?? ",

He visited my parents a few months ago, and when I visited, he was on the phone with his girlfriend and wanted to introduce me to her. He didn't ask me how I felt about it, how I felt about the pictures he kept showing me of her. He didn't ask me how I felt about the fact that she's just four years older than my mom. It made me want to claw my way out of my skin. He didn't ask me how I felt about the fact that this woman was friends with my grandmother, that my grandmother trusted her. \n\nI love my grandfather, but seeing this is so painful for me and I don't want to be around it, or her. AITA for feeling this way? Would I be an asshole for asking him to change the topic and not attempt to introduce me to her, as I'm not comfortable with it? What do you think?",

      "description": " A good friend of mine recently got engaged, and my friend group is collectively bummed out about it. They’ve been dating for 2 years, and have been living together for 5 months. I know the time to have said something was a long time ago, but nobody thought it would last.\n\nHer fiancé, “Mark,” (30M) isn’t awful but there’s little to like about him. He’s not particularly kind, interesting, or fun—just an all-around very “blah” guy. His friends do suck though (basically overgrown frat bros, homophobic) which is a bad sign for sure. The main reason why we really don’t like him is because my friend, “Ann” (25F) has changed so much in the time they’ve been together. In the 11 years that I’ve known her, Ann has always been a complete goofball in a really sweet way—very bubbly, loves to go out, with a really fun sense of humor. In the last two years she’s dimmed her light so much, much more than can just be attributed to “growing up” or whatever.\n\nI think they’re both settling for each other. Mark is worried that his window for getting married is closing, and wants to keep up with his married friends. At their engagement party last weekend (which he invited all her family and friends to before he proposed!) he said he “wants a baby by 31.” I think Ann is worried that she’s going to be in that position in 5 years, and has always struggled with self-esteem. I think she doesn’t think she can do better, which makes me really fucking sad. Their dynamic is just kind of awkward. This is her first real relationship ever. The first time she ever moved out of her parents’ house was to move into the suburbs with Mark even though she had hesitations because “she had to take where he was at in life” into account. At that point my other friend and I expressed concern that things were moving pretty fast, but she deflected all of it.\n\nWith all of that said, I see these as my options:\n\n1. Tell her that I support her decision either way but I’m worried she’s rushing into things because that’s what he wants, that she hasn’t seemed herself lately, and that I want to make sure she’s happy. Knowing her and knowing that has brushed off similar conversations in the past, I don’t see that doing much other than adding unnecessary tension to their inevitable wedding. If it were me I’d want her to say something, but I’m not sure she does at this point.\n2. Don’t say anything, probably stand in their wedding, and watch my lovely friend get married to someone she doesn’t really love because she’s afraid of being alone. The way that will pan out is very likely that they’ll realize they’re unhappy in a year or two, try to have a kid to solve save their marriage, and still end up unhappy. And then she’ll find out (deep down I think she already knows) that none of her friends or family ever liked him.\n\nI want to be a good friend here, and I’m having trouble figuring out a balance between being supportive and being honest. So am AITA if I say something, or AITA if I don’t?",

      "description": "I should probably start this off by stating that I have PTSD from abuse. Over the years, this has gradually turned into conversion disorder, where my mind dissociates and I go into a non-epileptic convulsive seizure. Because of the seizures, I cannot drive, and so I rely on a non-emergency medical transport service to get to/from appointments so that my family isn’t stuck playing taxi.  This particular company took over the old one a few years ago. I thought the old one was bad, it really was terrible, but this new company has turned me off to the point I am no longer using them and I’m just taking the bus instead.\n\nSo this past Thursday, the driver pulls up in a van with another client in the passenger. The door behind him opened and as I got in, I heard an audiobook playing and thought it was odd since most drivers just play music, but it’s whatever, to each their own. I get in the car, sign the log sheet, and we pull away from my house.\n\nI’m not paying much attention to the audiobook at first, since I had a lot on my mind and was trying to relax before my group therapy session. It wasn’t until we were halfway through my neighborhood that things from the audiobook started to catch in my ear, in the “did I really just hear that?” kind of way. I started to pay attention right as the narrator describes a scene where the man is abusing a black woman with a cheese grater, grabbing her by the hair and dragging her while a male narrator starts calling her a bitch and a N***** while he abuses her.\n\nI don’t feel Triggered easily. I rarely heed trigger warnings because most stuff is relatively tame to me. But something about this, especially hearing a man’s voice saying those horrible things in a very violent, angry voice triggered me so bad that I was shaking and felt sick to my stomach. This was all before we even left my neighborhood, I had only been in the car less than five minutes and I could not sit in that car listening to that all the way across the other side of my city.\n\nI snapped and said, “what the FUCK are we listening to?”\n\nHe grabbed the audiobook case and handed it back to be and said, “it’s a novel”. \n\nI handed it back to him and said it’s extremely offensive and he needs to turn it off. He looked upset and shook his head but said okay then and turned it off. He then tried to explain the premise of the novel to me, but I said I didn’t care, there are things that are inappropriate to listen to when you have clients in your car. He shook his head again but not another word was said. Not even the guy in the passenger seat said anything.\n\nAs soon as I got out the car, I called the company to report him. I was shaking so bad that the operator asked if I was okay, and I said no. She asked what happened and as I told her she kept exclaiming, “oh my god!” Didn’t help that she was a black woman. She transferred me to a manager, another black woman, who reacted the same as she took down an official report. They said they’ll contact me with an update when they have one.\n\nThe longer I have thought about it, the more I’m worried that I may have overreacted and possibly took away a man’s livelihood because I felt triggered. I still think it was wrong to listen to that in the car, I’m just not sure I handled it correctly.\n\nAITA? :(\n\n",

      "description": "So I have a static caravan on a holiday resort in the UK. I don't think the USA has quite the same concept, but to give some idea of value, the van cost me £55,000 and I pay £4,000/year site fees to keep it housed at the resort. To pay these fees, I rent it out in the school holidays at around £600-700 week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have it listed on a site that's kinda like Air BnB but only for people looking for a caravan holiday in the UK. The caravan has 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. Those bedrooms house 1 kingsize bed, and 2 single beds. It does have a pullout sofa in the lounge, so technically the legal occupancy for the fire code is 6 people max. I have decked it out nicely, it has two 40\" TVs, it has a PS4, loads of games, ridiculous amount of gadgets in the kitchen etc. etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the waffle but I think it sets the background. I got an enquiry this week for a date that is unbooked. When people enquire they have to fill in their party details (number of adults/children and ages etc). This person enquired for 1 adult, 5 children. The children ranging from 2 years old to 12 years old. So young children, not older teens. I  told my gf I was going to decline the booking because I honestly don't think that the caravan is suitable for 5 young children. I clean it myself every week and I only have a 4 hour window to clean before the next person goes in and I've found that the more children people have, the messier it is even if the parents try to clean really well (note: I don't charge a cleaning fee of any kind). I also think there's more chance of things breaking, especially with 1 adult to supervise 5 young children and I don't take a security deposit so breakages come out of my pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy gf says I am an asshole for judging this adult for having 5 kids with her and am stopping 5 children from going on holiday and that life is hard as a single parent and I'm making it harder. My argument is that this is my personal place that I rent out 10 weeks of the year, I can be choosey about the bookings because I am always full for those 10 weeks and I want to minimize the chance of any problems. I don't allow people with dogs for the same reason. Not a personal judgement, just a personal preference in my property. I often take bookings which have 2 or 3 kids, I don't hate children, but 5 kids 1 adult just isn't a ratio I'm comfortable renting to especially in such a small space. She is very angry and wants me to accept the booking. I understand her POV but I view it as an unnecessary risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I was in Goodwill today and there were these two teen girls, they looked to be 15-17 and probably sisters. So there I was, minding my own business, when these two little girls start LOUDLY talking shit about my appearance. They actually said I looked homeless and questioned why anyone would choose to dress like me. I do kind of embrace the grungy, bohemianesque aesthetic, so valid on the first part, but still, RUDE. \n\nAt first I ignored them and moved to another part of the store. The way the store is designed is that the women's clothing section is near the books and they were in the women's section when I wandered back over to peruse the books. Again, they start talking all of that shit and by this point I had had enough. So I approached them.\n\nMe: Excuse me, did y'all have something you wanted to say to me?\n\nThey looked like deer in the headlights and claimed they didn't know what I was talking about.\n\nMe: So I must have been hallucinating when I heard yall laughing about me being homeless???\n\nThe younger one muttered that I'm a crackhead and I went off. I started roasting them, saying they dressed like my mom in the 90's and it wasn't cool even back then, with their Steve Urkel looking selves. They got big mad and the mouthy younger one was like wE'Re fIfTeEn. It was becoming this whole thing and attracting attention, so I left. \n\nI think this was a great lesson for them. Some people are batshit insane and you can't be carrying all of that negative energy around in public, or someone will check you and while most people would let the behavior pass because they're FiFtEeEn, not everyone will and they're lucky it was just harmless me and not some psycho who would have put the beats on em.",

      "description": "Ok, so I was trying to make a dash to McDonalds to grab some food before a show came on. I jumped in the car without even putting on my shoes and headed down the street. There is a McDonalds that has a shared parking lot with a grocery store. If you go in from the street side you have to drive around the back of the McDonalds to get to the drive thru line. But if you come from the grocery store side you can pull up directly to the spot to order AS LONG AS THERE ISN'T A LINE ALREADY. In which case you'd also have to drive around the McDonalds.\n\nSo as I came from behind the McDonalds I'm driving thru the lane and coming to the last corner right before where you place your order.  As I pull up a car shoots in from the grocery store side and cuts me off and pulls directly into the drive thru line ahead of me. I LET THIS GUY GO, I felt like he was a dick, but he beat me there, no big deal. But now I'm stopped at that corner bc he's now stopped on the other side of it. And this is where it gets weird.  Because after that car another car pulls in with a couple of women in it (I only know this bc of the result, I didn't know who was in the car at the time).  This car pulls directly up to the line as well except now it's full of cars. This car lines up directly in front of me as if they plan on cutting me off as well. At this point I don't even know what to think bc I have no idea why they thought this was gonna be ok.  So I immediately pulled closer to the car ahead of me, but because of the corner there was a gap on the right side (because the turn is to the left). The other car pulls up closer too as if we have entered into some amazingly slow ass game of chicken. And I pull up literally about 3-6 inches, she pulls up a little. I pull up, she pulls up. And now are cars are at a point that's so close that I can't believe we haven't already touched. I moved up one last time just to show that I'm not gonna back down and she inched up again as well. And honestly at this point I kinda said fuck it.  The spot on my right front fender had a mild scrape on it from a pole I had scraped a few months before this. I just put the car in gear and hit her as hard as I could in 3 inches, which honestly did NOTHING to my car but tore hers up pretty good. She jumps out of the car livid.  Screaming at me \"look what you did!\". And I just looked at her and said \"You did that!\".  Then she says \"I have a witness!!!\". And I tell her \"lady, look where my car is, I'm IN THE LANE!  You are not. Who do you think they'll side with?\" Then she said she was going to call the cops. Which I had to say \"thanks, because i didn't even bring shoes, let alone my phone\".\n\nThe lady got back in her car and took off. A couple of people from McDonalds came outside after she took off asking if I wanted to call the cops (and saying \"That was friggin awesome!\") I asked them to.  When the cop got there he took down the information but they never found her.  The cop actually said because it happened on private property fault would have been 50/50. But because she drove off she would end up being found at fault (but that never happened).\n\nSo am I the asshole for hitting her car?",

She’s a very pretty girl ,skinny, with chubby face cheeks. I think it’s cute. She always lingered around with the idea, but I never took her seriously till she ask for my opinion in a very serious tone. I told her that I had to think about it in an unenthusiastic way. I know it’s not my place to tell her what she can and cannot do but I feel like she’s perfect the way she is.  WIBTA if I told her no. ",

      "description": "So my ex was texting me saying she was “curious” about how much I told my girlfriend about our break up. I told her that I told my girlfriend we broke up because of the long distance and her extremely severe depression. She got really pissed off saying it was wrong for me to tell her that (my ex is much healthier now btw).\n\nShe says “I have never shared such private information about you and never would. It's just no one else's business and does not have any place in a conversation with someone other than you”\n\nAnd that’s fair enough, honestly. But my girlfriend directly asked me how we broke up, and my ex and I were together for 2 years and I didn’t want to lie. It’s just as much my break up as it was hers and the break up really impacted me, triggering me into a severe depression of my own at that point of my life. I told my girlfriend about the break up from my perspective, it wasn’t just me gossiping about my ex, ya know?\n\nAnyway I apologized to her because we’re still friends and I’m trying to keep it that way but I don’t feel I’m in the wrong here...AITA???",

      "title": "AITA for believing a customer's ID was fake mostly because she was awkward?",
      "description": " \n\nI work at a liquor store and have done so  for a year and a half. In the time I've worked here I've never had an ID  that I thought was fake. I know fake IDs are an issue for stores and  bars, so I pay attention to that, but never really got a suspicious  case. Until tonight...\n\nIt  was probably half an hour til closing time when this girl comes in. I'm  gonna call her Tina. You'll see why in a minute. Now, for the record we  are a small local business, and quite understaffed so even though it  was a busy Saturday night, it was only me and one of my coworkers  tonight. At the moment he was in the cooler and it was just me up front  and a decent amount of customers in the store, so I have to kinda stay  up front and watch the scene. We've been getting shoplifted a lot  lately.\n\nAnyway,  Tina comes in. She's an average looking young girl, blonde hair and  glasses. Definitely young. Could pass for as young as 16 if not younger.  She comes up and tells me \"I want wine,\" in a very awkward kind of  monotone. I tell her \"Well, we don't have wine behind the counter, just  pints of booze. Our wine is either in all the wine racks in the middle  of the store or on the shelf over there.\" Tina doesn't even turn around  and look. Her hands are in her pocket and she tells me \"I want  Barefoot.\" I tell her \"Our Barefoot stuff is in the wall over there.\"  Normally a customer would go over and find what they want, especially  someone who's not super old or physically handicapped. She tells me \"Can  you get me a Barefoot.\" As if Barefoot just comes in one variety and  size. I'm a little annoyed, but whatever. Customer service... I leave  the counter and walk over to the wine shelf. I expect Tina to follow me,  you know, and look at the selection of Barefoot. She doesn't. She just  stands there, hands in her pocket. I tell her in a slightly passive  aggressive way, \"Are you gonna come look at the selection?\" She looks  over and goes \"Oh.\" Turns around and walks towards me and goes \"I want  the big white one.\" So I grab a large bottle of moscato and bring it to  the counter.\n\nI  scan the bottle, read her total and ask for her ID. She pulls out her  driver's licence. My state (Minnesota) recently updated their licences  last summer or early fall, and its one of the newer ones. Because this  particular customer was a little off in the way she was speaking to me  and acting, I inspect her ID closer than I would most. Her DOB says late  February 1995. It was currently the 9th. This would make her 23 going  on 24. The licence issue date said she got it in mid January 2019. All  fine and dandy, but then I read the expiration date.... mid January  2020. Now, I've checked IDs from all kinds of states, and I've never  seen a driver's licence that expires a year after its issued, even the  new MN IDs. I also check the back and it says she has no driving  restrictions, despite wearing glasses which should be listed as  \"corrective lenses.\" Nothing definitive but certainly fishy to me. By  this point my coworker came out from the cooler and was on his til next  to mine. I go over to him and tell him I'm a bit suspicious but ask for  his opinion, as he's 5 years older than me and has worked here for a  year longer. He tells me that its my judgement call. I decide to go with  my gut.\n\nI  tell Tina that frankly, I am suspicious of her ID, and I am gonna  refuse to serve her. She then tells me, again, in a very off putting  monotonish voice. \"What? But I'm 25!\" now I am for sure calling her  bluff. I tell her \"Umm I was born in '94 and I'm not even 25 yet. Your  ID says you were born in '95.\" She then says \"Oh... I'm 24!\" at this  point I'm about to burst out laughing, but I'm mostly annoyed that this  girl really thinks I'm that stupid. I tell her \"You wouldn't even be 24  yet as we haven't reached your supposed birthday. Now I KNOW this is a  fake. Sorry, not serving you.\" Mind you this whole time I am still  holding her ID. \"You don't believe its real? Then call the police!\" Her  tone of voice and demeanor really lead me to believe she was a teenager  faking it, aside from you know... getting her alleged age wrong TWICE!\n\nAt  this point I was like \"Okay. Fine, I'll call the police. If they tell  me its real, I'll serve you. But until then, I don't believe you.\" I  didn't really plan to call the cops, but I was calling her bluff. I  continued to ring up the next customers in line. \"Call the police.\" She  insisted. Suddenly, a cop actually pulls in to our drive in parking  spot. This cop is actually a regular who sometimes parks in front of our  store and does paper work. He knows we've been jacked a lot lately, so  he does it as a courtesy to help curb thieves. He was here this  afternoon and by luck just happened to pull up. I tell her \"Okay. I'm  gonna go ask this cop.\" I go outside with her ID and tell him the  situation. He's like \"Yea. No it sounds weird. But I'll look into it...  gimme a moment, okay?\" I go back inside and continue ringing people up  while Tina awkwardly stands there. She mentions that she's gonna get an  Uber. I don't care what she does, all I know is unless the cop verifies  its real, I'm not serving her. At one point she asks my coworker \"Why  don't you believe I'm over 21!\" and he flat out states \"Because you gave  your age wrong twice.\" which had me chuckling lol.\n\nBy  the end of it, the cop came in and told me he ran the card through the  computer and wouldn't you know it... its actually legit. It came up as a  real ID and she actually is 23. Well... now she decided she didn't want  the wine and got a cider instead. I told her \"Hey, I'm sorry I thought  it was fake, but you gotta understand its my job and it was pretty fishy  to me.\" She awkwardly said its okay. Afterwards she asked the cop if he  could give her a ride home or whatever. He chuckled and said he  couldn't. By now it was closing time so we told her she had to leave and  that she could wait at the grocery store for her ride as it was cold  out. Now it was just me, my coworker and the cop. I thanked the cop for  his help, told him I wasn't gonna mess around with a suspicious customer  with an ID that seemed a little funny to me. He told me he gets it, and  I did the right thing, and that the new state IDs are definitely weird  to him and that he himself hasn't seen a licence that is valid for only a  year. He did tell me though that I could have refused service because  she was intoxicated, but honestly to me she didn't seem intoxicated. I  mean it makes sense in a way but I mostly thought she was a nervous  teenager who was REALLY bad at lying. Had she not been so awkward and  nervouslike I wouldn't have thought twice about it. But I kinda felt  like a jerk because not only did I doubt her actual real ID, but I was a  little harsh to her especially in my tone of voice. But at the same  time, come on, even when I'm really drunk I don't forget my age....  twice! She definitely came across to me as more socially awkward and  nervous than drunk. Also I was being a bit passive aggressive to her,  and I'm usually genuinely nice to most customers, even if they are a bit  awkward. I guess its the assumption that she was lying to me and trying  to take me for a fool, at my job nontheless, that teed me off and made  me act kinda dickish to her.\n\nTL;DR.  23 year old girl who could easily pass for a teenager had an ID that  had a few weird things about it even though it looked legit otherwise  (its usually dates and little details that I look for, as its subtle  stuff that I feel they might slip up on if its fake) came up to buy  booze, I suspected it was fake and told her, she gave her age wrong  twice, we got the police involved, and it turned out it was real. Am I  an asshole for suspecting it was fake just because she was awkward? I  genuinely thought she was a nervous teen. It wasn't just because she was  a bit odd in her behaviour. Thats fine, I've served plenty of oddballs.  It was more of the combination of how young she looked, the way she acted and the stuff stated on her ID.",

      "description": "Some context - I’ve been dating this guy for about 2 months now, but he has been part of our friend group for about a year.\n\n\nBefore we started to date I gave him a list of my yellow/orange/red flags as a human and warned him that it’s probably not a good time in my life to date me. He didn’t care and was okay with the following that I told him or he knew before hand:\n\n\n* Less than a year ago I got out of an extremely abusive relationship and I don’t know what a good relationship looks like. And that I’m seeing a councilor at my school, which isn’t the best but I can’t afford anything else. \n\n* I’m a full time grad student who lives at home with her parents and I don’t have a job. Lots of my time is spent reading, writing, at the library, or doing volunteer work.\n\n* School comes first and I still have 2 years to go. \n\n* I’m unemployed and have 0 income right now. I can’t share any expenses for dates, entertainment, trips, drinks, etc. \n\n\nI was extremely explicit in my warnings, and basically tried to convince him to not date me. Even though I know I want to be in a long term relationship again one day. He told me he was okay with paying for everything (he has a high paying job and we live in a very affordable area). I’ve tried to be courteous and suggest free/cheap things to do in the area, but he likes to do expensive things and doesn’t mind paying for two. I’ve enjoyed the time spent with him and we usually have a good time. We have a lot in common and have a lot of things to talk about. \n\n\nHowever, he made a few comments about me that were supposed to be a “joke” in front our friends (friends that he has known for a year, and that I’ve known from anywhere from 5-15 years) that has made me reconsider the relationship. \n\n\nWhile we were at dinner with friend he said a few things along the following: [….] “Tell me about it, not only do I have to pay for these things myself, I have to pay for her too!” and “Eventually I’d like to visit X place, but I’d have to pay for two [motions towards me] and I can’t do that now.” and “If somebody [motions towards me] ever gets a job then we can go do X activity with you guys too! haha, just kidding sweetie we know you’re still in school.” \n\n\nAfter that night I felt embarrassed, and started to reconsider the relationship. I haven’t been excited to see him since Friday, and I’ve actually been using school as an excuse to not see him. \n\n\nSo AITA if I break up with over those kinds of comments? ",

      "description": "So a little bit of background.\n\nI'm a 15yr girl who at the age of 14 started having depression/anxiety/self harm thoughts. It first started by my step dad (which had been in my life for 2 yrs now) leaving without me knowing why .at the time my mom didn't tell me anything about it, I just got some vague idea by eavesdropping on conversations that they had a pretty bad fight... \n\nAfter that I got send into a mental hospital after my mom found my arms and legs full of cuts. But after that I had another mental breakdown because of my biological father. He died when I was only 6. And that really got into me because my mind just started saying how a bad child I am because I couldn't remember who my dad was, I couldn't even remember how he looks like, or how exactly he died... we got Into a family therapy to talk about it, my mom told the therapist, and me how exactly my father died, she told this story about how he saved us from a bunch of drunk man's and that if it wasn't for him I would've been raped...\n\nBut the thing is, that's now what actually happened... and, at the time I believed it, even going as far as having memories of it, basically, my mom gave me a memory conformity about a trauma.... \nOf course I got really paranoid because although I couldn't remember what happend, I searched so munch on the Internet because I remember my babysitter telling me about how my dad was on the news... \n\nBut after I learned the truth, I also learned another thing my mom didn't told me.... remember earlier how I talked about my step dad? Well the reason they got Into a fight/got a divorce is because he had a child fetish. Not saying he molested or did anything illegal, but he would watch porn with titles like \"daughter banging dad\" \"dad having sex with daughter\" and so on... and I didn't learn from my mom this info no no no... I learned from Joel's (my now new step dad) daugher, which in turn learned from my brother....\n\nBasically she told everyone about it, exept me... \n\nAnd so after learning that, and after a second visit to the hospital, my mom told the truth about my biological dad, and how he was actually killed because he owned people money and he didn't have any... I was really mad by it, not by the fact of who my dad really was, but the fact that she lied to me while on a therapy visit, with emotions and everything.... I started hating her, doubting her, rebelling against her...\n\nI wouldn't talk to her, look at her, and even let her touch me...  \n\nHer exude of not telling me/ drifting me away from the truth was that she wanted to protect me, she wanted to not let the outside world hurt me. She was scared that I would be more depressed if I learned the truth... \n\nSo my question is, was I in the wrong for being this rude to my mom? I tried the best I could not to let my felling tower over the truth. \n\nif you guys need any questions feel free to ask...",

      "description": "First Reddit post! Let me start out by saying my mom is my rock. She is everything to me. \n\nShe has been living pay check to pay check for her whole life. I am about to close on my first home and I dont feel very comfortable making this decision knowing my mother is one emergency away from not being able to survive. She has no health insurance, no home insurance, and no 401k. \n\nI budget my money religiously and I was determined to draw her out a budget so she no longer has to survive pay check to pay check. So I developed a nice budget and presented it to her (after she agreed to let me do this) and she started to become upset because she thinks that I dont think she knows how to manage her money. She doesn't make a ton of money, but this budget would allow her to end the year with roughly 4k in savings.\n \nI told my mom she was a burden on me because she isn't financially stable. The house I am purchasing is nice and I dont deserve nicer things than my mom. She deserves much more. \n\nOne last thing to note: She helps EVERYONE out when she feels her sons need something, but I feel you can still budget for that.\n\nAITA for trying to help my mom?\n",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to drive my boyfriend to the airport?",
      "description": "Disclaimer: sorry if there are any typos/this is rambling....I’m *really* tired. \n\nI had to post here before I go to sleep because this is really bothering me. \n\nMy bf had to be at the airport at 5:15 AM to catch a flight to see his family. He’ll be gone for 4 days. \n\nWhen he originally asked if I could drive him, I told him it depended on my work schedule. He decided on the dates for his flight last minute, and my work schedule was already set. \n\nAt a friend’s house yesterday he was talking about his trip and me driving him. At this time, I told him that he’s probably going to have to drive himself because I work that day. (I have to be at work at 6:30 AM.) He started acting really dramatic and disappointed at which point I told him I would pay for his parking if it was that big of a deal ($8/day x 4 days)—something I can’t really afford right now, but he can. That still wasn’t good enough for him. He continued to act pouty and it made it a bit awkward for the people we were with. I agreed to drive him because I just wanted to get out of the situation and he was making me feel guilty. \n\nLater that night, he asked if I was sure I could drive him. I again told him that it was incredibly early and I’d be losing an hour of sleep—which is a lot, IMO when you already wake up at 5:30 AM. I didn’t want t drive him, but I sensed that he was still bitter and this was going to be a “thing” for him. I told him “let’s see what I feel like in the morning”, meaning that if I was too exhausted he would drive himself or take an Uber. He agreed to this. \n\nMind you he also knew that I hadn’t slept well the past 2 days either due to work and a little get-together on NYE. \n\nI woke up with him this morning at 4:30. I asked if he could call an Uber or drive himself because I tossed and turned last night and slept a total of 3.5 hours. He immediately started getting upset saying it was too late (he had 20 minutes until he had to leave—plenty of time to call an Uber). \n\nI gave up. He’d surely argue with me the entire time until he left and I’d be awake anyway, so I drove him. \n\nNow...to put my work schedule into perspective: I work 13 hour shifts. I’m on my feet all day long with little time to sit and also do some manual labor as part of my job. I get one 30 minute break at work. I’m a nurse, so I have to be clear-minded and able to think critically throughout the day. I am scheduled to work 3 days in a row like this...the first being the day he needed to be drive to the airport.\n\nI just got off the phone with him and he’s insisting that part of being in a relationship means that you sacrifice and do things like this for each other and I’m being unreasonable and selfish. \n\nI think *he* was being childish and selfish. I’m still mad about how he seemed to have manipulated me into driving him. \n\nAm I an asshole?",

      "title": "AITA For Hanging Out With An Enemy Of A Friend?",
      "description": "Here's a tad bit of context: One of my friends moved down south in 7th grade. 2 years later, we are all now in 9th grade. The enemy I'm referring to is in my gym class every day. I personally am a very timid person when it comes to confrontation; I can be talkative at times, but if I need to assert myself, I often get very nervous. Also, I'm going to refer to each of the people by a certain letter so things don't get too confusing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been lurking on this subreddit for a while and only now have decided to post, since the guilt from doing this has been eating at me for a while. Since second semester started in my high school, among my classes is now gym. I was lucky enough to have one of my friends (M) in my gym class, but was unlucky enough to, at the same time, have another person who I distinctly recognized as a bully (B) from my middle school years also be in it. What's worse is that M and B actually are friends with each other, which makes this all the more difficult. Normally I would disregard middle school years, since I tend to be a forgiving person, but something is making it hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe friend that moved to Florida (J) still interacts with us through our group chat we have together. J regularly goes on rants on multiple topics, one of which being the horrific abuse and bullying they went through at our middle school, of which B was the primary source. I don't actually know any details of what J experienced (and I don't want to ask, since they claim to have anxiety from the memories, so I feel apprehensive in pushing it) but what I do know is that B made life absolute hell for them, and they continue to suffer from it to this day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn class, I usually try not to talk to B, but am forced into conversation with him and M anyway. I try to act friendly towards B, since I just can't find it in me to confront him. He also pushes M around and often is rude to him, but M seems to be fine with it, like it's just boys roughhousing, though it makes me uncomfortable. B also can be hilarious at times, and I've even found myself enjoying his presence, which I can't help but be ashamed of myself for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though I go along with B and his antics, I can't help but think of what he did to J, because, based on J's texts, he screwed him up severely. J talks about flashbacks and anxiety attacks, and I'm just wondering to myself: How on earth do I find it okay to hang around the person who did this to my friend? But then of course, if I did even find the guts in me to say something to B, I'd still have to see him every day in gym, and I'm afraid I'd become a target or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for continuing to be with this person?",

      "description": "Context: I live in a suite of four people with a common room and two doubles with bunk beds. Sexy, I know. One of my suitemates has had an SO stay over (without having sex) in her bunk while her roommate (my other suitemate) slept in the same room. The latter had consented to this arrangement and there were no problems.\n\nPreviously, I had had someone stay over for a few days in the common room, and he would occasionally sleep in my bunk while I wasn’t there. All of my suitemates agreed to let him stay, and I had given them the option to say no when I asked if he could come over. I didn’t, however, ask my roommate if he could sleep in our room (but my bed). This is important.\n\nAll of this is to provide some context for the dynamics of our room. Now we get to the situation at hand: earlier tonight, my roommate asked if her boyfriend could stay the night in our room with her. She made it clear that nothing would happen while I was in the room, but to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with the idea of having this guy sleep above me. We don’t know each other very well. \n\nI am afraid though, that the precedent set in our suite (and what I owe my roommate by not even having asked if my guest could sleep in my bed) would make it such that saying no would be an asshole move.

She just had a weird vibe and acted a little shady and our mutual friend also said she was shady. But i tried to keep that to myself when i found out they were such good friends, and even give her another chance.\n\nRecently i find out that during a date i had with my girlfriend (we met up the best friend at a local bar where best friend showed up with her boyfriend), best friend took her into the bathroom, tried to make out with her and then confessed some sort of feelings for her while i was at the bar talking to her boyfriend. \n\nWhen they go out they get super drunk and even when im there it feels like best friend is trying to start a battle for her attention? which is just annoying. My gf says that shes like her little sister and that shes just misguided in alot of things. But like I dont trust her (best friend) and have a suspicion that she likes to get her (gf) drunk in hopes that something will happen. \n\nI trust my girlfriend but it sucks knowing that shes spending time with someone who lies all the time, clearly has feelings for her and tries to make moves on her. I try to not talk smack out of respect to my girlfriend, but everytime we see her i see something i dont like, and i let my gf know about it when we leave.\n\nPart of me wants to confront bestfriend and tell her stop being so shady and that my gf will never be with her like that, but i know in the end it will just make me look like a huge ass, and an insecure one at that. But as time goes on, the more it annoys me.\n\n Am i the asshole for being honest about not liking her/them hanging out?",

One day she had approached me and told me that about a month ago she had been r\\*\\*\\*d on her way home from a shift at a Sonic a couple blocks away (she had walked home). I had consoled her and talked to her about it and asked her, \"What are the police doing about it?\" She had said she hadn't told the police. I took objection to this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer side:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe had a pretty rocky past as a child, so this has happened previously. The reason she didn't want to inform the police was because of the way it had been handled previously, a lot of s\\*\\*t happening but nothing really getting done (none of the three abusers were held accountable). She expressly told me not to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy side:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of things were going through my head. First off, I loved her, she was my first decent relationship after multiple people that burned me and left me. Secondly, I didn't want this to happen again (to her or another woman) so I wanted the man to be held accountable and put away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a lengthy conversation with her I was given a choice, stay quiet or tell the police and never talk to her again. This really f\\*\\*\\*ed with me but in the end I decided I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do what I could to stop the guy. I confessed to her and she stormed off, we haven't talked since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn hindsight, I don't know if I would change what I did. I wanted more input because all of her family and mine all agreed that I overstepped by a huge margin.",

Not entirely sure what I did to her, to sum up my best friend Brendan (we were friends before this all happened) started dating this chick and they broke up, other stuff happened, she’s mad I’m still friends with him, etc. But back to the main part, my friend Alex knows she’s done all this stuff to me, talked about me behind my back, spread rumors about me to my friends. But she’s still friends with her. Granted, they were friends before her and I were, but she’s knows how badly she’s treated me yet continues to be her friend. Am I the asshole for wanting her to cut things off with her? Or should I just let her be friends with whoever she wants but lose me in the process?",

      "description": "So a little background, I turned 24 at the end of January and my family didn't offer to get together for dinner or a celebration until a week later when my mother texted me saying that her and my father would like to take me out for a late birthday celebration. This is normally quite difficult because my father and I work at the same place but on completely opposite shifts (I work nights on days that he has off and he works days on nights that I have off). But I agreed believing that my father would either take a day off or I'd receive a text asking what days I could meet for dinner after my father got out of work. But I didn't hear anything until recently when my mother brought up that we still hadn't done anything so I offered doing a dual celebration for both mine and my sister's birthdays since her's is in a week anyways. I'm also a member of a juggling club (have been for years, they were actually the first friends I made when I got into college) but because I work a rotating shift I only get to go to the club once or twice a month instead of weekly; I've been juggling with this group for over 6 years and have gone to juggling conventions with them and they have all remained very good friends of mine and my family knows all this.\n\nTonight my mother texted me again asking when I would like to get together for dinner so I told her we should just do the dual celebration for both mine and my sister's birthdays since we're already close to hers and that it would have to be \"on a day that Dad works after he gets out of work because I haven't earned any vacation time yet.\" She then made a group text for her, my father, my sister and me and asked if everyone would be good for having dinner on my sister's 21st birthday (which would be on the same day at the same time that the juggling club meets). I responded asking if we could have dinner the day after my sister's birthday because I haven't gone to the juggling club in over a month and I would really like to practice and see my friends again. My sister told me off for wanting to juggle instead of spend her birthday with her (she goes to the same college I did and it would be very easy for me to visit her before or after the juggling club meeting). I told her I would skip juggling club for her birthday but that I would much rather just celebrate her birthday a day late because I haven't been juggling in over a month. \n\nMy sister got mad at me for wanting to push her birthday celebration off one day so I could practice juggling and see friends and accusing me of not wanting to celebrate my own birthday (even though no one texted me about it until after my bday had already passed) and not wanting to see my family anymore. I tried explaining that I don't get to go to the club very often and I would like to take the opportunity when it arises because I haven't juggled in a group since before Christmas (which I spent with family), but she accused me of caring more about juggling than I do about family and saying \"I only turn 21 once.\" The conversation ended with her calling me a dick  and saying that she didn't want me at her birthday anyways. \n\nI plan on asking my parents if we can celebrate in a restaurant near my college because that would allow me to go to the beginning of the juggling club meeting and celebrate my sisters birthday, but I can't help but feel guilty because I am kinda choosing friends and personal hobbies over family but only because I haven't done this in quite a while and really want to see my friends and practice with them all again.\n\nTL;DR: My family didn't text me about celebrating my birthday until after it had already passed but when I suggested celebrating my sister's birthday the day after her actual birthday so I could visit friends (who I haven't seen in over a month) and practice a hobby I really enjoy with them. Am I the asshole for asking the celebration be moved back a day even though no one asked me if the date was ok even though none of them asked me about celebrating my birthday until it had already passed?",

I tell him that he doesn't have to be an ass, and that there's a priority line just for seniors that he can use. He tells me he's 90 y/o and shouldn't be expected to wait. I tell him that I don't care about his age, what he is doing is wrong and he should either go to the back of the line or to the priority check out. \nThe register is cleared and he rushes over there. The very nice check-out lady says calmly that he is cutting in front of others and should go to the priority line. He starts yelling, saying that we all owe him for the years he spent working, that he worked his ass off to get me my rights and whatnot (don't know what he's talking about), but I keep insisting that he's an ass and should be respectful of others if he wants them to be respectful of him. By this time, the line has grown and even though everyone agrees with me that he's being a jerk, tell me I should stop insisting and let him be. \nBut I don't, I can't honestly. It makes my blood boil to see people that are this entitled. He literally has a line all to himself at the priority check out, but just had to cut this line.\nAITA for insisting on it?

      "description": "For background info; I'm a 16 year old cis girl, and I'm the vice-leader of a cosplay dance group one of my friends founded. We're currently 7 members, but we decided we'll be opening applications in January to fill up two spots in the group, so that we'd be a group of 9. Everyone currently in the group is a girl, and and our youngest member is 13 while our oldest is 20 years old. This all happened yesterday, except for a few little things.\n\nWe made the initial announcement about applications opening maybe a month and a half ago, only stating a few basic requirements for applying, such as knowing how to sew your costumes. A few people immediately messaged us, stating their interest in joining the group. After a while, we decided with the group to implement a few new conditions we hadn't stated in our initial post, such as an age limit (15-24 years) as well as that we'd only be accepting girls to join the group. The reason for making these limitations is that we'll be having sleepovers and training camps with the group, and having a man there, especially someone several years older than any of us others, would make the majority of our current members, myself included, feel uncomfortable in part due to previous bad experiences with men in similar situations.\n\nOne of the people initially interested in applying is a 23 year old trans guy. After the new conditions were posted, he again messaged us to ask whether the condition \"You identify as a girl.\" means you have to actually identify as female, or if it's okay to be a trans guy but still cosplay girls for you to qualify for our group. What I replied with was that for the sake of our members feeling safe and comfortable, we'd like to limit the group to just girls. I also said no one in the group has anything against him as a person, and we hope he doesn't take it like that.\n\nFast forward a few hours, and he's done a little bit of very vague posting to his instagram story about not fitting in so making yourself fit in somewhere else, while his girlfriend posted a few longer paragraphs to her story about how you shouldn't judge anyone or discriminate based on gender. She made it sound like we'd been rude and discriminatory against this guy because he's a man. Some things she said were that if this was a work situation something like this could be taken to court, that she thinks everyone should have equal chances to things regardless of gender, that it's stupid to say someone is a bad person just because they're a man, etc. Today she posted more about it, stating how it's unfair to leave someone out of something because of their gender especially when they're a sweet and lovely person, and that something like this can crush someone's dreams.\n\nNo one in our group said he's a bad person just because he's a man. We didn't respond to any of the posts. Our leader put up a post on our group account's story saying we apologise to anyone cut out by our criteria, and that we'd love to have everyone in the group, but because of sleepovers or training camps it doesn't matter if it's one or more people who feel uncomfortable, and as such we decided to stick as an all-girls group. We explained the reasons behind all the conditions in our post where we stated them, and have tried to be as nice as possible to everyone when responding to comments and direct messages.\n\nNote that I, and many of our other members, are part of the LGBTQ+ community ourselves and have nothing against trans people. Trans or cis, you have the right to choose which gender you feel is you.\n\nI have screenshots of the messages and story posts if anyone wants to see them, but they're all in Finnish so I don't know if they're much help.\n\nTl;dr: My all-girls dance group and I wouldn't like to let a trans man who is a few years older than the rest of us join the group because the majority of our members feel uncomfortable working so closely with and having sleepovers and training camps with a man.\n\nAre we the assholes for not letting him join even though he would have liked to? Should we still have let him join even if we still feel uncomfortable working that closely with men?",

      "description": "My friend broke up with her possessive and controlling bf and moved in with me. Before she broke up with him, she didn’t talk to me for about a year. She called me crying saying he threw all her shit on the side of the road. And he did. So I drove my naive ass over there and packed it all up and brought her back to our house. We made an agreement that she would pay $200 a month and she would get her own apartment in about 4/5 months. Everything started to go downhill about a month later. Her room was trashed, she was leaving old food and dishes in her room, spilling alcohol on the floor and never cleaning it up, inviting guys off tinder over at like 1am, calling off work, getting drunk every night... I decided I had enough when she came home thinking it was funny that a doctor reported her at work. He reported her for showing up hungover after she went on a 3 day binge of alcohol, cocaine, weed, and adderall. She didn’t bother to shower, fix her hair, makeup, or change her clothes. I had a very serious convo with her and told her it would be best if she finds somewhere else to stay because it wasn’t working out. Later that day, she texts me saying she is going to stay with her cousin for a bit and asks me to put her stuff on the porch. So I packed up her stuff and placed it on the porch and pretty much didn’t speak to her after that. About a week after that happened, she was telling all of our mutual friends that I threw her out like a piece of trash and I was just this horrible person to her.\n\nNow it’s been like a year since all of this has happened and *from what I hear* she has her shit together now. She has tried to reach out again but I don’t want to be her friend. She brought all kinds of chaos to my life and she thinks I should be giving her another chance. I cut her off right after all this went down and I don’t feel like I owe her. Am I the asshole for cutting her off? \n\nTL;DR: Friend breaks up with bf, moves in, goes on drug/alcohol binge, trashes the room, almost loses her job, I kicked her out and cut her off. She wants a second chance at a friendship. AITA for saying I don’t want to be her friend again?",

      "description": "Spring of 2018 I was a senior in college. I played bass for the school's marching band, which, for that semester, played for the basketball games. I was new to it because I had a lot of friends in the band who were pushing me to join and since I only had one semester left, I said why not?\n\nBecause I played bass guitar, I wasn't always playing with the whole band. Instead, we had a rather unique set up where our section (the rock band) played our own thing. I was not the only bass player, however. There were two others, but one was the section leader of the mellophones and didn't usually practice or perform with us, and the other handled most of the lead vocals. There were also several guitar players and two drummers and sometimes that meant that people had to rotate. Naturally, I think it was assumed that the bass players would do that too.\n\nAs the semester went on, the rock band played more gigs separate from the marching band. We did covers of popular rock songs. One day, the other bass player politely asked me if I would mind sitting out for a couple songs so he could play bass. I said I would mind because we're only playing six songs and this is my only semester to do this sort of thing. Plus, he was taking the lead vocals on those songs anyway, so he wouldn't be sitting out at all. The other bass player seemed mad but kept it to himself and we played the show and had a great time.\n\nFast forward two weeks and we had yet another gig. This time, he asked me again if he could play bass. Again, I said no for the same reasons as before. I should also mention that he was a sophomore so he still had at least 4-5 semesters left, all of which he planned to be in band for. This time he was pissed and he started yelling at me until I finally pointed out that we have two amps anyway and we can both just play at the same time if it mattered to him that much.\n\nI'm graduated now so I don't really care what they do now or about what happened before, but I remembered both of those things and was genuinely curious what others would say. I mean, trying it be objective here, maybe I should've not cared so much about playing two songs and I should've just let him play to avoid unnecessary drama? I don't know. Am I the asshole for wanting to play my instrument during our gigs?",

      "description": "Recent traffic posts have me curious about something. Background: every other weekend I drive a total of about 3 hours to pick up my son. It's a 2 lane highway, speed limit is 65 until you get to a town (there are 2, the one I come from and the one I'm going to). This is not a busy highway, it's a straight, boring desert highway.\n\nA couple of months ago my fiance was driving and had the cruise set to 65. That is what we both always do. There are state troopers out there and they absolutely will pull you over. As usual, everyone was passing us. They always do. But this one truck came around us and as it did, the passenger leaned out his window, threw a plastic bottle at our windshield, and flipped us off. Like i said we get passed a lot, but no one has ever done anything like that (or honked or anything). We figured we just weren't going fast enough for their liking.\n\nNow I'm wondering though, are we assholes for driving the speed limit when almost no one else is? My state does not have any kind of rule about keeping up with traffic, as I'm aware some places do. And it's not like we have 50 cars lined up behind us. This highway is generally clear enough to pass pretty easily. Just sitting here thinking about it though, I'm wondering if we're pissing everyone off or something. We drive the speed limit because we don't want to be pulled over/ticketed.",

      "description": "Not super familiar with this sub, using a throwaway, and on mobile, so forgive what you can.\n\nThis sounds petty, right? Well this could destroy my relationship.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had discussed buying a video game together when it was first announced, but as time has progressed it has gained a lot of negative publicity, prompting my boyfriend to continually tell me how it's going to be trash and he's glad we didn't preorder etc.\n\nSo we talked and he said he wouldn't want to play it by himself. That's where I fucked up, and I admit that. Because I understood that as \"I don't want this game\" he meant it as \"I don't want it but I'll play it with you\"\n\nSo black Friday shopping with my mom she offered to buy me the game to play with my dad, but on xbox instead of pc. So I said yes. My boyfriend was LIVID. Took it as me not wanting to play games with him or spend time together (we live together) and generally just made me feel like shit about it until I returned the game.\n\nMore on the gaming thing, i dont play very many video games with him because he likes to play online and uses my headset. I get anxiety playing in online games with people i dont know, and if I do know them I don't like having to just not talk to them. Not to mention we just have different taste in games. So this was one of the first ones we were excited about together. Based on this he tells me I never want to play ANYTHING with him and I'm just trying to hurt him, which isn't true.\n\nI think those are all the details, I can clarify any questions in the comments, but he could potentially leave me over this and I can't tell if I fucked up royally today",

A few years ago, I was a prick towards them and they made fun of me during the period for being a prick. I admit I did deserve it as a was a major asshole to them back then. When I rekindled the friendships with them a year ago, I made it a priority to change my behavior and to show them that I wasn't the same prick anymore. I even made fun of myself on numerous occasions of my previous behavior to show them that I acknowledged it was run. However, they have been making fun of my previous behavior recently despite it being a few years ago. I did tell them that I know I was an asshole but its in the past there's no point repeating the same jokes over and over again. This wasn't very successful as they would tell me that although it was in the past, it should not be forgotten. I've tried distancing myself from them recently but I've gotten quite lonely. They're my only group of friends and I really do think of them as nice people. However, its just this ribbing that bothers me. So am I just an oversensitive asshole? ",

So they became my parents and my two cousins became my sisters( let's call them B and C). It was all good until they got a divorce and my \"mom\" took C. whith her. So I and B stayed with my dad. All this happend while i was 4 or 5, so I didnt really have much of an emotional bond to my \"mom\" and C.\n\nNot until later as the Situation cooled of and C moved to her own place. We all met up for holidays and other events, but she never really felt like a sister more like a cousin or a aunt ( because shes like 15 years older than me). We grew even further apart when she got married. \nMy dad mentioned once she was part of a nazi-cult-thing, although she grew out of it, her and her husbands views were ultra-right.\nWhen I first met the guy, I thought he was kinda weird but nice, but that changed at their wedding.\nFriends of them came late to the reception and played anti-refugee songs the whole evening.\nThe grooms family applauded and joined in, while my dad, B and me looked at each other in disgust.\nAfter that we constantly argued, when we met up for holidays, since she always brought up politics and \"how the refugees destroy this country\"(I live in germany btw).\nUp until now she has two kids and she has no idea how to raise a child. They constantly missbehave and all she does is shout at them.\nWhen my grandma (who worked her whole life in a daycare) tries to calm things down and talks to the kids in a loving and caring way, she gets screamed at.\n\nToday my grandmother told me on the phone that she got sick and her survival chances are 50/50, so she got placed in a artificial coma.\nSince I moved out last year to study at a university, I'm not with my family right now.\nBut I don't feel anything. I think even feel a bit happy about it , but I know i shouldn't.\nI feel mostly sorry for my dad, he's devastated.\nAlso I dont want for the kids to lose their mother, even if she's a bad one.\n\nI really don't what to feel or to think.\n\nTLDR: Over the years I liked my Sister less and less and now she lies in a coma and I feel almost happy about it.",

She would say things like you're so fat when you jump your ass cheeks clap. I don't think she was very good at roasting. One day, she just straight up said hard facts. Not roasting but just \"You're a fat ugly fuck and I hope your parents die\"... harsh. I guessed she was in a bad mood, so I, taking it in good fun, told her that her crooked ass teeth remind me of the rocky mountains, and that her hair looks like cotton picked by all the black people she bullies. Too harsh?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, she just started talking to me again for whatever reason. I'm guessing she just put it behind her. Around a month after the first incident, the second one occurred. It was lunch time, and my friend Emily had bumped into me. We then kinda fake fought for a second, and up ran 5'5\" girl. She wanted to get in on the fun too, I guess. But she, like roasting, is also not very good at fake fighting. She just smacked me a lot. Everywhere. So, reflexively, I docked her in the nose. I did not hit her very hard, being her nose did not even bleed. I also got her some tissues if she needed them etc. Am I the asshole?",

Even through all of this, I still feel like I'm simply making their life worse, which is the last thing I want to do. I feel like a burden and a drag. I began to distance myself from them. Ignoring Snapchats, and other forms of communication. It's been 3 days since I began doing this and, even though I feel it's what is needed, I still feel awful. I feel the only reason we're friends is because they felt they had to as we shared the same classes. \n\nExams are coming to a close and the last time I have to see them again is this Monday.

We quickly became friends with benefits. \n\nWe used to have sex about 3-4 times a week. I was always adamant when I told her that I didn’t want a relationship, just a friendship and sex (we play games together and go out to eat often. We also took a mini vacation together.) I always stressed that we were friends and nothing more. \n\nToward the end of the summer/early fall, she started saying she’s always wanted a family and what not. I explained to her that I wasn’t ready for the responsibility of a family or a child, and we agreed to slow down on seeing each other so we went to a once a week deal. Eventually it turned into 2-3 weeks and we recently went a whole month without talking. \n\nThe other day she messed me and wanted me to come over after school, so I did. We ended up having sex, except I didn’t pull out in time and ejaculated inside her. \n\nThe next day I made her take a plan B against her will.

I can’t go too into detail to protect her privacy, but I’ll try to tell it as clearly as I can. \n\nShe went into labor ~3 months early and was declined medical attention. She gave birth as the on board doctor ate his sandwich and told her “animals do it in the wild all the time”. She gave birth to a live baby and watched it die. She and my dad got dropped off at a dirty hospital somewhere (I genuinely don’t know where) where my mom had to continue to clean herself off and transport the deceased baby back home.\n\nI obviously was not there for any of this, and heard pretty much all of the story from other family members. My mom doesn’t ever talk about it. \n\nHowever, over the years I’ve had many people tell me how wonderful cruises are. After I tell them (if they aren’t a stranger) what happened to my mother, they say they are sorry about the incident, but it shouldn’t stop me from going and having fun. \n\nSo WIBTA for going on a cruise?

Especially when it happens to people who treated me badly/bullied me in the past? \n\nJust a few examples:\n• Ex boyfriend getting a divorce \n• The stuck up bitch who was always mean to me and actively spread rumors about me still works a dead end job.\n• The jerk who got me super drunk and aggressively tried to have sex with me, only to kick me out of his house when I said no is still trying to be a thug/dj and failing miserably at it and all aspects of adulthood. \n\nI know that hurt people hurt people and the most satisfying revenge is to live your best life. I made peace with this after high school (full disclosure, that was almost 20 years ago).  Then social medial happened. I used to maintain a very close group of friends and family who were allowed to friend and follow me.  Then about 5 years ago, I started excepting friend requests from people who I haven’t seen or spoken to in years. This opened a sort of flood gate of info on the people who treated me horribly in my past. \n\nSo now, once in a while I’ll see someone tagged, liked or linked to another person, and  I’ll think “oh yeah,  that’s the guy who stole my bag, dumped it out in the back of the bus, then laughed hysterically as I had to crawl around and collect everything.  Let’s just clickity-click that profile and see what he’s been up to...Aaaaand he’s a giant fucking loser!”  Then this wave of satisfaction will wash over me. \n\nI guess I’m probably still pretty hurt, which is why I love seeing these assholes fail.

      "description": "My brother and I used to be really close growing up. All his life he's suffered with various mental health issues (mostly depression) and I've tried to be there for him. About 10 years ago he got divorced, and it was a bad time in his life; I was there for him to talk to, listen, cry with etc. Over time however I began to feel that I was just a shoulder to cry on, and that he was not moving forward with his life or doing what needed to be done to help get himself out of his rut. If I'm honest, it was also because I found being around him exhausting, after he'd talk to me for hours I just felt like I had a load dumped on me and he'd walk away feeling better.\n\nAround that time I shifted my behavior to encourage him to start bringing positive habits to his life - working out, setting a schedule for himself (getting out of bed before noon), talking to a therapist, etc. Rather than listening to his complaints and commiserating, I began to say things like \"that sucks, what do you plan on doing about this?\" and \"what are some things you think would help you feel better about this?\" to try to put the 'ball in his court' so to speak. I noticed as soon as I did this our talks became much shorter, ie: before we'd talk for hours, now it was 5 minutes at most.  It was around that time we began drifting apart, and he moved back in with our parents.\n\nFlash forward a few years and I find out that my parents have been paying for everything for him - buying him cars, paying for food, entertainment, etc. to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars a year. It was causing a lot of stress and burden on my parents, my mother had enough and told him he needed to get a job and move out, and he responded that if they tried to force him to do either of those things he would kill himself. I told my parents to notify a mental health professional about the threat, but they were afraid of him being committed and didn't. Over the next few years, in my opinion he financially abused my parents, and mentally abused them by constantly threatening to kill himself when confronted by his abhorrent behavior. After trying everything I could to help my parents (and him) I cut ties with with my brother because I came to believe that he is a malignant narcissist who cannot really be helped.\n\nOver time he found himself a girlfriend, and were talking about getting married last fall. My family and I had moved to another country and were planning on flying back for the event. The summer before the wedding my wife and I had plans for my parents to visit us and see their grandchildren, who they hadn't seen in over a year. Out of the blue, I get an email from my brother to the whole family that they're moving up their wedding date... to the weekend my parents were supposed to be flying in to see us.\n\nWhile I wanted to go to the wedding to see family I hadn't seen in years, I refused to go a) because I object to my parents paying for more of my brother's life, b) him manipulating my parents into not seeing their grandchildren, and c) I'd just had enough of his shit. The night of the wedding, I was getting sent videos and pictures from my whole family about what a great time it was and everyone was so happy. It was a huge punch in the gut that I missed out on that event.\n\nTo this day when talking to my family I get references about how \"I should have been there\" and \"it was too bad you couldn't make it\". I also get the feeling that I burned some bridges with my other family members for standing for my principles rather than caving to my brother's manipulation, even if it ended in a good time. I regret not going to see everyone, but I don't regret not going because I can't support my brother's behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "This is kind of a long story, so there's a tldr at the end.\n\nSo the context of my situation is that I'm a 16-year old girl in high school, and I have been friends with this guy, \"Kevin\", also 16, for almost 4 years. We've always been pretty close. We tend to play-flirt with each other as a joke, but neither of us had feelings for each other at the time. However, near the beginning of this school year (in September), I found out that he liked me. I turned him down, and I thought things were fine, but then I messed things up. I continued to play-flirt with him, despite my knowledge of his feelings for me, because of course I am a teenager who is absolutely stupid and naive. Long story short, that escalated into me leading him on and then blaming him for misinterpreting my signals (yes, I already know I'm the asshole in that situation. I apologized to him about it way later, and he's not holding it against me, but I'm aware that that still doesn't exactly make me the good guy).\n\nWe ended up arguing about it through text, and during it, Kevin just snapped at me, \"Sometimes I wish a guy would take advantage of your flirting so you'd learn.\" Obviously, that dealt a huge blow on me, and I called him out for it and said goodnight. Normally, I easily forgive people, and I would've forgave him eventually (I know he's really bad at communication). However, a couple days after the incident, with no notice, he SHOWED UP TO MY HOUSE AT 8:30 PM ON A WEEKDAY TO PERSONALLY APOLOGIZE. I told him to leave immediately because my parents would be arriving any minute (they were out shopping) and would be disturbed, but he refused to leave and tried to give this huge apology thing. I told him he was being creepy for showing up at my house at night without consent, and he responded, \"How is this creepy?\" Later that night he realized what he did and sent yet another long apology text. He told me that he thought he had to go \"the extra mile\" in order to get his apology across.\n\nAfter that whole incident, we started ignoring each other. Then, a few months later he sent me walls of text that was generally like \"I'm so sorry. I've been nothing but an idiot, and I deserve to lose you.\" I had no idea how to respond because, in all honesty, it was the cheesiest and cringiest thing I have ever read. I told him I forgave him and that he wasn't losing me or anything like that. I thought that would fix things, but we're still avoiding each other. It also doesn't help that one of our mutual friends (and my best friend) has now cut him from her life because she's fed up with his antics, too (he tends to cause trouble in class). \n\nI want to fix our friendship, but it's gotten to the point where I don't want to deal with him anymore. He just makes everything worse by making a dramatic scene out of it. We used to be so close, but now I don't really care what happens to us in the future. Before all of this happened, Kevin told me that I was one of the few people he really trusted, even among his family. I don't want to ditch my friend, but at the same time I really just want to end this.\n\ntldr: After my close friend of 4 years told me he liked me, our friendship has been really iffy. He has caused so much unnecessary drama in my life that I want to cut him off completely. I know I could probably fix it, but at this point I see no reason why I should.",

      "description": "*sorry for any Grammer or spelling mistakes English isn't my native language*\n\nSo this is my first post on reddit and the reason why I even made an account I will try to keep this post unbiased and not bring my opinion in to this post because I'm very curios if I maybe have a wrong view point.\n\nSo today I had dispute with my brother ( I'm M 16 and he's M 18) he was cooking something when I entered the kitchen. I came and wanted to take my cup of tee out of the kitchen and then he took a wet kitchen cloth twisted it up and hit my leg with it (I was just in my underwears so it hurt pretty bad). He has been doing this for some years now and I always told him that he shouldn't do it cause I really hate it and I just lost it when he did it this time.\n\nI told him dude why the do you always do this and I kicked his leg and proceeded to grapple the towel out of his hand. When I had it I told him you wouldn't also like it when I would hit you with this. He then got angry and told me with a serious face that I should get out of the kitchen and I said why I want to talk about this now it has been bugging me fore years. He tried to push me out of the kitchen (I was very close to the door at that moment) I pushed back but I didn't wanted to use violence after like 2 to 3 trys he pushed me past the kitchen door and I stretched my arm out with the intend of stopping the door but he slammed it and it crashed throug my arm. At that moment our parents came and stopped the \"fight\".\n\nMy arm had luckily only some small cuts on it and and no one got seriously injured.\nSo what I'm asking now is am I the asshole for not leaving the kitchen and wanting to talk it out\nor is my brother the asshole for acting like this.\n\nMy mother told me that I had also should take for a part of the blame because I wasn't taking in to account that something like this could happen and I was trying to stand my ground and sometime this isn't the best idea.\n\n",

      "description": "My husband (M 26) and I (F 24) got married last March. He loves to ski, but I only skied once and it was horrible. This January he planned a 5-day ski trip with a few of our friends and invited me. I knew I was scared of gravity and deep slope, but I would love to try to take lessons and hopefully I would be ok. The first day in ski school, when I face down the slope my entire body was shaking. He was there for me for the second half of class which I really appreciated, but I hate the feeling of speed plus gravity pulling me over, I don't want to experience it again unless I have to.  \n\nAfter the horrible and exhausting experience, I asked him to return my ski equipment to save some money. He refused and said, \"You can rest tomorrow, we will talk about this later.\" I freaked out because I really don't want to ski again, and I apologized for not be able to do it and I can give him money back. He got mad at me for not trying enough, and said if I was this afraid of the deep slope, I should go see a doctor about it.\n\nLater when we discussed it again, he said he suggested the doctor therapy only because he never heard about someone be this scared of slope and try to help me.  He was unintentional to be mean or rude (which might be worse).  \n\nI am very disappointed at my husband, 1, he cannot accept the fact that I don't want to try more; 2, he cannot accept that everyone is different and ask me to see a doctor; 3, he still thinks he did nothing wrong about what he said, its all me to make ski worse in my head. \n\nI understand overcome fear is awesome, but I don't need to overcome every fear in my life, the ski is one of them. I expect my husband to understand my desires and respect my choice instead of talking down to me.\n\nIs he an asshole, or I deserve this and I should just keep practicing. \n\n(English is not my native language, pardon my grammar errors)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "A kid across the street from me got a soccer ball for christmas, and he and his little friends are always playing ball in the street. Every day since he got it, his ball comes over my fence, and bounces off my wall. I have asked the kids to be careful, I've asked thier parents to watch them, because I have a small child that likes to sit in my yard under the big tree and read. I dont want her to get hit.\n\nToday, I am in my room, and my daughter is in the den, sitting in the window reading. I hear a crash, and I run into the room. Fucking soccer ball broke the window. My daughter is fighting back the tears because a piece of glass cut her on the leg.\n\nI am so pissed. I put a bandage on my daughters leg, and glare out of the window. I see little kids scattering.\n\nAbout 40 mins later, the ringleader comes over to my gate. I can hear him trying to climb over. When I go to the window, he asks for his ball back. He has about 7 other little kids from the neighborhood with him.\n\nI say sure, one second. I grab the Bowie knife I keep up in the closet.(its about 8 inches). I walk outside, pick up the ball and open the gate. I ask if this was his ball. He says yes. I proceed to  stab the ball, then slice it in 2, like an orange. Then I slide the knife into its holster, and hand him the 2 pieces of his ball. He ran off in tears.\n\nIt felt great for like 5 mins, then I just felt like an asshole.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

I don’t get to set my own prices where I work and we are a little pricier than some other places.

      "description": "Throwaway.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for close to a year now, but we had been good friends for a couple of years before that. Before we started dating, I made it very clear to her how I was totally against cigs and vapes (lost grandfather to heart condition due to smoking). When we started dating last year, I found out that while she doesn't buy cigs/vapes herself, if she's ever out with her friends then she might use them. I didn't really mind this; I did ask her, however, to tell me if she were ever considering buying a vape or take up smoking because it's something that I wasn't totally comfortable with and we would need to have a conversation about it. She promised me we would if she ever considered it, and that was that.\n\nFast forward to last month, I found a juul charger connected to her laptop. I asked her about it, but she swore it was a charger for some make-up device and that she was borrowing it from a friend anyway. I pressed though, and she admitted that it was a juul charger, and that she had had the juul or 6 months now. When she told me that, I fell silent for a moment then told her that I was going home. She didn't stop me, but as I was driving home I got some texts saying how I was being extremely selfish and that I'm an asshole and have no right to be upset. Tbh, I'm more upset about the fact that she lied to me rather than the actual juul, but I don't know if I'm allowed to be mad at her or not.\n\nI don't want to control her at all, that's not my intention. But I hate the fact that she hid this from me. I wish she had been upfront, I'm just not sure how to react.",

      "description": "TL;DR my breaking point is rape apologists\n\nThere's a girl who has been in my grad program for 3 years. From the get go she had major issues. In undergrad her parents spoiled her so much that they drove her from class to class. This is the first time she's been independent from her parents and it really shows. She's very obviously on the spectrum to anyone who talks to her for more than 30 seconds but she thinks it's this whole secret because her parents told her not to tell anyone and I don't think she received therapy despite very clearly not being a well adjusted person. From the get go things were bad.During her visiting day before deciding to come here for grad school she cried very loudly in the visitor's office because some other visiting grad student got into the school she wanted to go to. Week 1 she meets all of the other first years and they go through orientation. \n\nDuring one of the classes we took together the second week (I'm in a year above so we were in some of the same electives) she noticed that I was organizing people to do our problem sets together. She asks for my number directly and I tell her we meet on X day at X time. She says she doesn't want to work with anyone in her year because she doesn't like any of them \"especially Y person\", which she loudly whispers. I was literally sitting right next to another person in her year so he heard the entire thing. There's a few other grad students who try to reach out because she was obviously having a hard time adjusting and I help out. One by one she stops responding to their texts with one excuse after another until I'm the only person in the department that she doesn't hate. This is really confusing because I have a lot of the same personality traits that Y person has and she hated him within 5 minutes. There's also a professor who is the most empathetic to her case, she has an autistic son so she has a lot of experience knowing how to empathise with people on the spectrum but this girl hates this professor too because during class the professor has bad handwriting and misspells things (incidentally this is attributed to the fact that this professor is dyslexic, but the girl doesn't care). It got to the point where she yelled anti semitic slurs at that professor, which is really sad because the professor was one of the nicest people I know.\n\nAnyway, all that aside she asks to hang out every weekend. The only way I can really stand hanging out with her is if we play Pokemon go together. She has these comics that she draws and shoves in people's faces whenever she gets the chance. She is completely uninterested in anyone else's writing or art. When we play Pokemon go it gives me an excuse to check out of the conversation, makes it difficult for her to make me read her comics and gives a time limit of how long we can hang out. (Am I also an asshole for doing this?)\n\nEvery time we hang out I come out of it just feeling awful, to the point that people around me tell me it's unhealthy to be around someone that toxic. She talks about herself constantly. At some point she talks about how much more open people are about mental health here in comparison to people in the state she previously lived in. I tell her that I generally am pretty open about being bipolar because I want to make people feel like they can talk to me about stuff. She responds \"well don't talk to me about being depressed because it'll make me depressed\". Whenever I bring up anything personal she either shuts it down or turns it into somehow get being a victim constantly (am I the asshole here for being pissed off that she shuts it down despite the fact that she probably doesn't really feel comfortable talking about problems?)\n\nI tried all kinds of things to try and make it easier to hang out with her, I tried to invite other people so I wouldn't feel like the entire burden was on me (she refused because she hated everyone else including people who's names she didn't even know). I read her comics (which I absolutely hate) so I could talk to her about things. At my lowest I started taking shots before hanging out with her just to make it a little more bearable\n\nThis went on for 2 years with me thinking that it won't be that bad every time I hang out with her and then coming out of it feeling like shit because she constantly shits on the science I study and the work I do. I keep putting off hanging out with her because I honestly fucking hate it by this point (asshole for not being up front about this?), but I get guilty every few weeks and so we hang out for a few hours. My breaking point was something about a professor who sexually harassed a grad student in our department. I had to tell her which professor it was because she was considering doing research with him. The last time we hung out, I was talking about how I wanted to leave academia because it was all too toxic concerning sexual harassment and assault. This is the fourth sexual harassment case I've seen thrown out despite the fact that some of those sexual harassment cases were criminal. She, of course, shat on that decision because clearly *she* cares so much more about the science. She was just confused about how to think about the whole thing and she said kind of out of the blue \"am I just supposed to assume my dad is secretly a rapist?\". I told her that you just had to trust people and sometimes that trust will be broken. I told her that once there was someone who I trusted more than anything and he ended up doing something fucked up to me that has scarred me since then. I don't remember what she said but it was bad enough that I just had to walk away. Didn't look back\n\nShe later texted me \"apologizing\" saying that she didn't want to follow me because she felt too awkward to be supportive. She said it hit \"close to home\" because the harasser was nice to her once. I literally told her about the most traumatic experiences of my life and she still turns it around into her being the victim. I sent her a message saying that it's unacceptable to talk to someone about sexual assault like that, blocked her number, blocked her on all social media, changed my screen name on games. \n\nI feel really shitty because this is the first time I've openly said something is unacceptable to say despite the fact she's been saying awful stuff for years with no one to tell her not to. She and others blame her lack of self awareness on the autism, but after 3 years I think she's also just a spoiled asshole. My boyfriend put it best saying that she was in a video game and I was just an NPC in her life that she could talk to and would always give her information without any back and forth. I feel like such a selfish asshole for shutting someone out because I couldn't make conversations about me, or receive any support for my problems, when it's also not her job to help me or be my therapist. I feel like I should give her one more chance and this time be more open in telling her when things aren't socially unacceptable but I really just don't want to. I don't have any experience with other people this far out on the spectrum so I have no idea if I have just mishandled the situation for years or if I should just accept that it's not my job to change her. It's really just the worse that she says I'm her only friend in this city because that's really the only thing that had kept me talking to her for so long and now she just doesn't have friends .",

      "description": "A brief background - I have been working in my career since graduating college 5 years ago and have lived comfortably thanks to my hard work. My boyfriend went to college a little later in life and is currently working on getting jobs in his field. Though we live in the same city, being in different places in our lives at the moment has created some conflict, since we can’t necessarily always do the same things.\n\nI have done as much as I can to include him in things that require spending money by offering to cover it (I wanted to have the experiences together), always been understanding when he can't be around because of working odd jobs on weekends to keep his finances stable, those types of things. \n\nA few of my friends and I decided to take a weekend trip soon to a city no one but I had ever visited. I jumped on this opportunity to be the guide of all our debauchery! I instantly knew I wanted to ask my boyfriend to join. He said he wouldn't be able to because of the cost. I offered to cover it and he accepted. There's been a ton of excitement and chatting surrounding this trip ever since. \n\nFast forward to now. I wake up this morning to him telling me that a large group of his friends from college are going to a cabin in the woods near my hometown next weekend and they miss him and want him to go. It's very short notice and would require him to take off of work. \n\nI know he was super excited getting that text and also rushing to get out the door to work, but as I sit here thinking there are a few things that are bothering me and 2 things that definitely have me hurt. I'm bothered by the fact that he didn't in the moment think to ask me about going or even hint at gauging my interest. I'm also bothered that he would so quickly be okay with not working for a weekend and risk his financial stability - I only say this because he has been very open and talks about his predicament quite a bit. \n\nWhat I'm hurt by is that for the last 2 months I have asked him to take off or work later hours on a Sunday (not the whole weekend) to come support me and my sports team during a match. This is a group I have played with year-round for 5 years and they are like family to me. Hasn't made the effort once. Not to mention… next weekend is the season ending championships and our team party, which I clearly expressed I really wanted him to be a part of multiple times. I'm also hurt that after just including him in my experience with my friends, he then went on to contemplate a solo group trip without even making me feel considered. \n\nThe feelings are fresh and I don't think I would do this, but the thought crossed my mind to tell him he isn't welcome on the trip with my friends anymore. I'm not sure if I am right to be so bothered and hurt by this, and I do feel shitty that I've toyed with the idea of cancelling on him.",

I just didn’t feel comfortable leaving her out to be eaten by the foxes.  She’s about 2 or 2 1/2 months old, so she is kinda prime adoption age. \n\nI put up flyers around my neighborhood, my friend who lives in the same neighborhood put her up on the next door app.  I never found the owner.\n\nProblem is - I’m allergic.  She can’t stay here.  I’ve asked everyone I know and nobody wants a kitten.  My neighbor got my hopes up and said his ex and his friend wanted kittens but both of those fell through. \n\nI keep her in my bathroom all night while I sleep and every time I am not at home because my home isn’t kitten proof and I have a very expensive couch that she’s already ripped.\n\nI feel bad making her stay in the bathroom but I really didn’t ask for this. I really tried hard to find her a home and haven’t had any luck and she deserves a home where she is wanted and where she can run around and play and not get in trouble for being a kitten. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I took her to the humane society?

      "title": "AITA For Saying an Elderly Woman's Wig Looks Stupid?",
      "description": "Last night, I was visiting my aunt in the assisted living facility she's been staying at temporarily. We were in her room watching TV when she mentioned that she is considering getting a wig. She was struggling with a condition that made her hair brittle and thin. That has been resolved but she is self conscious about how she looks. She is only 70 so her hair would look considerably worse than her peers.\n\nWe were having this discussion in her private room at the facility with the door slightly open because a nurse's aide had come in to start giving her the evening medication and check her blood sugar.\n\nAs my aunt and I were having the discussion, I said that I didn't think a wig would be bad, especially if it made her feel better about her self. I then added \"Just make sure you get a decent quality one. Not one like that other lady here wears. That one looks stupid and really fake\".  For context, \"that lady\" is probably 90 years old and wears a prodominantly dark grey wig with white accents, rolled into tight helmet like curls. I also said this to my aunt in a normal voice, about 20 feet from the door to the hallway, with the TV still on in the background.\n\nThe nurse's aide, who hadn't been part of the conversation, jumped in and said \"Don't let (Wig Wearer) hear you! It is really important to (wig wearer's daughter) that her mom looks good.\". \n\nMy response was to confirm that I had no intention of saying anything to anyone outside of my aunt but that the wig did look really obvious and kinda stupid. The aide then stated \"Yeah, but if her daughters heard you, that is discrimination. They would probably tell (director of facility).\" I said that it wasn't discrimination and that I wasn't calling (wig wearer) stupid but that it was my opinion that the wig did not look good. The aide stated again that there were rules against discrimination so I should be careful.\n\nAt this point, I thought it best to drop it with the aide since she was upset and not following my explanation. I have never said anything to (wig wearer) directly, nor would I ever. I would hope that, by the time you are that age, you are ok with being yourself. But again, to each his own.\n\nI wasn't planning on debating this point with anyone when I said it but the reaction from the aide had me wondering. Was ITA or are people getting a little too sensitive about what 'discrimination' really is?",

      "description": "Some background knowledge here:\nMy friends and I are all very short — I’m about 1.55m, the tallest of us it at most 1.64m. \nBeing teenagers, most of our humour comes from hyperbole and exaggeration in a sarcastic (and often fatalistic) manner. \nMy friends and I tend to tease each other a lot, including height-related remarks. \n\nThis took place in a group chat. I sent a message saying that we ought to breed tall people out of existence, because they were too difficult for a short person such as myself to talk to, and for the sake of equality. I was trying to mock my own height, pointing out the irrationality in obsessing over physical characteristics that one cannot control and mocking exaggerated notions of equality (since communist and socialist jokes are common amongst people our age). \n\nA snippet of what I said: \nCan we breed all tall people out of existence? Sterilise all people above 1.75m. \n(edited for grammar, typos and punctuation)\n\nOne of my friends, an ex-basketball player, took offence as height was important to the sport, which I apologised for. \n\nHowever, some of my other friends felt that it was selfish (they thought I genuinely wanted to commit mass genocide simply because of the inconvenience that came with communicating with a person of great height differential) and made an indirect comparison of my statement to anti-Semitic Nazi jokes. After which, I apologised for such. \n\nFor the record, I know what I said was definitely insensitive (I was unaware that my friend was sensitive about height, as she has teased me about my height in the past) and likely in bad taste. However, people in my school and community often make insensitive, exaggerated and fatalistic jokes (e.g. suicide jokes), so I don’t see why this was so bad.   It’s not as though there have been any mass genocides related to height (to my knowledge). We are also all girls, and girls (to my belief) tend to be less insecure about their height than boys. \n\nAITA for making insensitive height-related remarks?",

      "description": "So, some context. To put things lightly, my family relationships are strained. There's a lot of history that I don't feel like I need to get into, but my parents are both narcissists with substance abuse issues (mom in recovery, dad in denial), and because of that, the family dynamic has always been rough enough that my siblings and I are not close as adults. I moved away for university, graduated, built a nice career and eventually moved overseas, and time and TONS of distance have been good for all of us. We're generally all respectful to one another and catch up occasionally via text in a family group chat. It works well enough and everyone seems fine with it.\n\nMy younger brother is getting married next summer. Until recently, I had been planning on going to the wedding, because, you know, lack of closeness aside, he's my brother.\n\nA couple weeks ago, that brother was out partying while the rest of the family was having a pretty benign catch-up chat in the family group text. I know he was out partying because his fiancée is in that group text and told us he was unavailable because he was out with his friends. We were talking about The Bachelor, I think, when drunk brother made an appearance in the chat and started absolutely berating me, calling me fat, an embarrassment to the family, etc. No one said anything to him; the chat just fell kind of awkwardly silent after that. I sent a last text calling him out pretty hard, because ya know, no one's standing up for me so I better stand up for myself. I deleted the chat so I don't remember exactly, but I said something along the lines of, \"Getting drunk and alienating your friends and family is a pretty textbook symptom of the alcoholism that runs in the family. Something to think about when you sober up.\" Then I exited the chat.\n\nI thought to myself at the time it would have been nice if he'd apologized, but also, I've known him since he was born and I certainly didn't expect that. It's been a few weeks and I haven't heard from him at all. No one else in the family has addressed it.\n\nSo this is kind of where I'm at. I've been making plans to travel back to the U.S. for his wedding, which is expensive and inconvenient and requires me to take quite a bit of time off work. I was fine with that, but now, the idea of getting there and being like, \"We haven't interacted in six months and the last time, you drunkenly berated me in the family group chat but congrats on the wedding bro!\" isn't exactly appealing, you know? This whole incident also has me thinking, does he even want me there? I don't know. This all sucks, and I'm tired of family stuff constantly sucking. I know I should just talk to him about it, but I've spent so many years and so much emotional energy on family baggage, and for once I'd just like to take the easy road and just quietly not go.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

Because of this, Lucy hates Lily and Lily hates her back because of how hostile Lucy is.\n\nWe are meeting at Lily’s house for pictures and to get picked up by the limo. Alex wasn’t going to tell his mom because Alex’s mom doesnt want him going to Lily’s because she is on Lucy’s side on this, but Lucy told her anyways. Since Alex had to tell Lily that they couldn’t go to her house for this, Lily and Lucy started getting mad at eachother and arguing. The original group was going to be Me, Alex, and John and our dates as we’ve been friends for a long time. Since Alex wouldn’t have been able to go, he asked Me and John if we just wanted to go ourselves, but John told Lily about this (she was already suspecting it). \n\nNow Lily and Lucy are hostile as ever, Alex is mad at Lucy for not sucking up the fact that we were going with Lily and at John cuz he told Lily, Lily is mad at him because he tried to get us to ditch. Alex is saying he doesn’t even want to go anymore.\n\nThe group is falling apart and I’m not sure if I even want to go anymore, but my date (Sara) is out of the loop on all of this and Id have to tell her I’m not going so I cant take her. There’s also the fact that lily might have already ordered the Limo but I’d be happy to still pay for my own share if she can’t cancel or part of the cancelation fee. I just don’t know what I’m gonna do yet though\n\n",

We pay for food, rent, electricity, higher speed internet for streaming, his phone, he has no car so occasionally uses mine so gas/insurance. \n\nI'm trying to file my taxes, and put him down as a dependent, because from what I understand he is technically.

I am so horny that I've begun sexting him and masturbating while on my break at work, which I have never done before.  Every time I see my husband I am ready to rip his clothes off and make him cum (to which he always reciprocates).  This extreme incline in my libido has left me wanting, because while we do have sex pretty much as often as possible, the craving is still there.  Now, like I said, on days that he had jerked off, especially on days where he did it right before I got home from work, or if he did it before I woke up (he works a morning shift and I usually get home after dinner), he would be almost completely uninterested in me.  Noticing this, I asked that he take a break from porn, at least until this subsides (which, since I'm entering my 2nd trimester, might be kinda soon).  His reaction to this request was kind of strange, but understandable.  He said that even though sex is more fun, masturbating is easier (true), and it's hard to wait around until I get home, especially since it hasn't really been a problem before and it's something he's used to just doing when he wants (understandable), and that to completely stop would be a challenge for him (this is where I am questioning myself).  However, he would try.  \n\nIt has been about 2 weeks, and they have been AMAZING!  On top of having some really great escapades, the intimacy is nice.  He has admitted to me (because I was able to tell) that he's masturbated twice since I've asked him to \"save himself\" all for me.  I can also tell that this is not ideal for him.  Even with how much we've bonded these last couple of weeks, he would prefer to do things as they were before, rather than how I have asked (He hasn't said this explicitly, but  with him there is truth in all sarcasm, so I know what his true opinion is).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for asking this of him?  Am I being selfish?  I've never really been all that intrigued by porn, so even though I understand the appeal, I definitely don't \"need\" it.  Is his \"need\" normal for most guys?  I've only ever had short term relationships before meeting him, so this kind of issue is not something I've discussed and I need an outside opinion.    \n\nWould I be the asshole for asking for this to continue, just to see how it would go even if my sex drive drops off a bit?",

Mine loves her, and her’s love me.\n\nI’m sympathetic about MOH son’s autism. I’m not anti autism. We see him all the time.

      "description": "I will try to make the background of my dilemma as clear as possible, without giving away too much personal info -- hence the throwaway too.\n\nFirst a little bit about my situation. I lived and worked abroad for a few years, but I wasn't able to get a full time job because of my immigration status. While I did contract and remote work, the loneliness, job uncertainty, and distance from my family got to me. I've always had depression and anxiety for most of my life‌, but the straw that broke the camel's back was a terrible depression episode that lasted 3 months, where I pretty much locked myself in my room and cut off all contact with the outside world. My mom flew halfway across the globe to take care of me, and I decided come back home. I spent a lot of time looking for a job, and also took care of my family members while they had a series of mental and physical health crises. After therapy, medications, and over a year of searching for a job, I finally found a full time job with an interview that went amazingly well. While I get to finally work, what I actually work on is a bit boring and the bosses can be quite asshole-y.. but hey, I get to work in a field I love and I paid pretty well. And most importantly, this job has brought a lot of stability and peace to my family. So I feel like it's pretty important for me to hold on to this job.\n\nI joined the team around the same time as another person did. This Co-worker (let's call him C), is much more senior, has a different job function, and is from an English speaking nation. We get along well right from the beginning, and bond over being the \"new kids\" as well as our experiences being in foreign countries. It comes up in conversation that I am used to the work environment that this team has, rapidly iterating on tight deadlines; while C tells me he is used to a much slower and relaxed 'corporate' environment. Most of my team is also my nationality, and I speak their language too. C doesn't. However, C and everyone else on the team except me are all technical people, so they often talk about things that I don't completely understand and can't contribute to. C also goes out drinking and \"bloke\"-ing with the bosses. So in the beginning, we're evenly matched in terms of getting along with the rest of the team. So I don't think there was any favoritism involved.\n\nI make sure I talk to C and try my best that he doesn't feel left out when the team talks in our common language. However C often throws me under the bus in small ways, trying to shift the blame me in front of the whole team for something he hasn't thought of doing, or getting me to take ownership of a problem he should have solved. Still, I put these aside because we have to work together and I don't want to create unpleasantness -- I keep my head down when I'm angry at him and keep on working. I did stop making an extra effort to be C's friend, but still kept it completely civil.\n\nThe months go along and it's clear that I'm fitting in much better with the team. My boss is also much happier with the work I'm doing, as I'm improving on the work of my predecessor. C however is struggling big time. He's missing deadlines and the bosses start berating him in front of all of us. Things come to a head when we had a review where both of us were supposed to present big new features -- first him, then me. His work ended up taking all the meeting time -- it had so many problems that it was ripped to shreds by everyone on the team, and the bosses held him back after the meeting to yell at him because the deadline has to be extended yet again. I showed the boss my work after the meeting and he seemed to like it, as he complimented me in front of the rest of the team -- something that he has never done before, my teammates tell me. He gave me charge of an even bigger feature, so I was inundated with work. I tried to maintain C and my normal level of conversation, but with all my extra work and C kind of becoming quieter with everyone, our communication reduced significantly. \n\nA few weeks later, I was confirmed as a full-time employee in a glowing review. C, meanwhile, was told that his probation would be extended. C started working non stop to complete his tasks.\n\nI just found out from reliable sources that the bosses wants to kick C out as soon as he's done working on his current tasks. They aren't telling C because legally, C can leave at any time since he's on probation. The whole team knows. Except C.\n\nIn the country I live in (it's not the USA) our residency relies on the job if we're on the organization's visa, like C is -- he would have to leave the country within a few weeks of his employment being terminated.\n\nI really want to tell him to start looking for other opportunities. If I was in C's place, I would want someone to tell me, out of human decency if nothing else.  I can't drop C hints in casual conversation because of our reduced interactions. And moreover, if I tell him about what's happening, I can't trust him to keep his mouth shut and be discreet -- he has already thrown me under the bus for much smaller issues. I have kept quiet until now, but it's eating me up inside.. I have been through joblessness in a foreign land and it really wrecked me. Even if C has been a bit of a dumbass, no-one deserves this degree of pain. At the same time, I don't want to risk the boss's and team's wrath and let go of this opportunity to further my career and retain my much needed stability. \n\nAITA for keeping quiet and not telling him that he's going to be fired? What should I do?",

For a little bit of context, my aunt and uncle got married just last year in December. She works in Dubai and he works in NY so they’ve only really gotten together maybe once. According to my dad, my uncle has tried to cut her out of his life after just being married because she hasn’t sent money to my grandmother(her MIL). She is raising a kid all by herself in Dubai and has a difficult job. She also doesn’t know my grandma, has never met her in person. My uncle is sort of using her for the money she sends him, as his life is pretty easy. I started an argument with my dad because I think it’s wrong to try to cut ties by not answering phone calls, just after one year. She’s not toxic, she’s really nice, and my dad argued back saying that his grandmother’s well being is more important and it’s selfish of her to not give any money to her. (Keep in mind, that he doesn’t really give too much money to his mom either, but he has plenty to give.) Am I the asshole for trying to defend my aunt, or even starting the argument in general?",

It has wayyy more likes and retweets (as of now) than the original I posted. \n\nI replied, saying that I was slightly jealous (because of how many likes and retweets it had), and said it was from reddit (another person asked where the original was from) to make it look like I wasn’t focusing on the “haha you got more likes” etc etc part.

      "description": "This is regarding an incident a while back that I'm still mulling over. Long post, so sorry.\n\n**Content warning:** there's a some backstory here involving a history of abuse. It factors into my own motivations and actions, but can be skipped since it's only contextual to the incident in question.\n\n**The Context**\n\nMy sister was verbally and emotionally abusive to me and my brother up to around two years ago, for around 10 years total. I won't go into all the details, but suffice to say although she nominally meant well at times she effectively made my high school years and part of college hell, our dad did nothing or backed her up, and my friends were the only reason I made it through. (Sidenote: I'm seeing a therapist, don't worry.)\n\nShe was aware I complained about her to them online and in person, one time taking my computer and reading my chat messages about her. *Most relevantly,* twice she told me to listen to her or get out of the house. The second time I chose to get out and she and my brother had to go get me when they figured out I actually left. (I hadn't gone far, I also happened to have a broken foot at the time for unrelated reasons.)\n\nA few years back various factors converged, and my sister apologized for what she'd done. We had a decent relationship for about a year and a half.\n\n**The Incident**\n\nMy brother and I visited our sister where she lives in Chicago right before Christmas, staying at her apartment over a few days/nights. At dinner one night we got into an argument (something petty about pronunciation that escalated) and she essentially accused me of ignoring evidence because I didn't want to admit she was right and I was wrong, and if I was going to be like that she wasn't sure she wanted me to be under the same roof as her. Effectively, she was threatening to throw me out.\n\nGiven our history I immediately recognized the situation as familiar and soon pulled out my phone to vent-text my friend about it - my brother clearly didn't want to get involved (which I don't blame him for), and I was internally screaming at what I perceived as the injustice of the situation and the repeat of history.\n\nI was sitting next to my sister so naturally she saw, and when she asked if I was complaining about her to a friend I gave a flat and unconvincing \"No\" (not wanting to escalate, but also not in the state of mind to lie convincingly). I continued texting my friend until she asked me to put my phone away, at which point I did.\n\nShe later apologized and said she doesn't like it when people complain about her where she could see because it was rude, and she wouldn't complain about her boyfriend if he were there for example.\n\n**TL;DR:** AITA about complaining about my sister in front her? In terms of abusive behavior she's definitely the one at fault, but for the specific texting incident I don't know whether I was justified or not.",

      "description": "Well, shit. This is a long one, buckle up.\n\nMy friend, who we'll call \"**A**\", has been acting really out of character lately. \n\n**A** and I go way back. All the way back to Elementary school. We met in 3rd grade and have been inseparable ever since. But recently, things have been different. I'll start of by saying this, **A** struggles with mental illness. They work like a pattern. One day they're talking about how fat they are, the next day they're talking about how fat you are. \n\n**A** has put me through a lot of mental strain as well. In middle school, **A** hit a rough patch in their life. One late night I receive a lengthy message from her number. The message was their final goodbye to me before they planned to kill themself. As anybody would, I panicked. I frantically texted back, trying to convince them not to do it. Worst night of my life, I truly thought that I'd never see them again. I was frozen in my bed, whimpering and choking on my tears all night until I passed out from exhaustion. Morning arrives and I call their sibling completely hysterical. I pleaded with them to get out of bed and check on **A**. Turns out, **A** was unharmed and sleeping like a baby. I was relieved and livid at the same time. Apparently they had fallen asleep after she sent the text to me. \n\nEven through shit like that, I stuck around. I supported them through thick and thin. Like a good friend should. Sadly, I can't do it anymore. Everyday they chip away at my self-esteem with their judgemental commentary on everything I do. I'm not the only one who feels this way either, they're affecting our whole friend group. Enough is enough, somebody had to put them in their place. *So I did.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo **A** is on a \"diet\", If you can even call it that. If anything, they're average size with most of their excess weight being carried in their stomach. But they're obsessed with the idea of being thin. So much so, they go out their way to buy clothing they'll only wear when they're skinny. Which I guess could motivate them, but personally I think it's stupid to buy clothing you could possibly fit in much later down the road. They have a pile of crop tops and skinny jeans just sitting around collecting dust. \n\nBecause of the \"diet\" **A's** on, they like to act holier than thou. On a daily basis, they have a bagel (Or two if they skipped breakfast) in the morning, vegetables and soda for snack, two small lunch meat &amp; mayo sandwiches on white bread, pizza and a salad drenched in caesar dressing. I wish I was exaggerating but I'm not. This just infuriated me because If I even dare ordered two pieces of pizza or they'd say, \"Pizza again? You're going to get fatter if that's all you eat\" or \"That's all going to your thunder thighs\" and follow it with a laugh. But I didn't think it was that funny. \n\nIt was really damaging to hear this from somebody I felt safe expressing myself with. After that, I stopped eating in front of them. I was scared of what she was going to say next. I know what they were saying was coming from a place of their own insecurities but it still fucked me up. It became a little more personal when they attacked my newly found friend calling them such things like \"fat tranny whore\" and other offensive shit. \n\nEnraged, I completely went off on them. The whole ordeal was quite childish. I made a stupid remark about, \"how is it possible that you're uglier on the inside than you're on the outside\" and how they eat like dump truck and have the same physique of a garbage can. Just really pathetic insults I'd been bottling up inside of me up until that point. The damage had been done and **A** just left about ready to cry, and I didn't chase after them and we haven't talked since. \n\nBut AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The person who I got the meme from was tagged in the picture, the person who retweeted it was in the picture as well as the person who originally tweeted it. The post was making a joke about how guys will hit on you no matter what situation you are in. \n\nI am white. I never typed nor said these words. I wouldn't do that and didn't think posting this meme indicated that. I didn't see a problem with posting something like that especially since it had 3 different people in the picture who had reposted/retweeted it. However a person messaged me(another white person) saying that it's not okay for white people to repost stuff like that. That it's 'tramatic'. I honestly didn't see a problem with it and still don't? AITA and just don't know it?  ",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago in my old neighborhood but this is the first time I have ever felt bad about it. \nIn my old neighborhood (my family moved two years ago) there was this family that were assholes to everyone. They had a dog that the dad was training to be aggressive, in our affluent    and safe suburb. Not a very smart idea. \n\nWe also had two dogs and I walked them everyday. One day in the middle of the summer I’m walking my dog Kia on the communal neighborhood path that runs through the woods behind their house. Their dog jumps the fence and lunges at my dog Kia, who ran behind me, she’s very old and scared of everyone/everything besides me. The dog gets my pant leg but I kick it away, drop Kia’s leash so she can run away, and run to hop a fence hopping the dog will follow me and not my poor old dog. Weirdly it doesn’t and it just goes back over the fence to their yard again. I run the long way home and my dog had already arrived home when I got there. My mom was scared and ready to call the police when Kia arrived and not me. So when I got there she was very concerned and  when I told her what happened she went on a warpath. The dog ended up being taken away and was assumable put down due to the very strict rules of our county about dogs that are human aggressive. We never were updated and got this information via angry Facebook post on the HOA. \n\nBut the thing is, the dog never tried to attack me, it only went after my dog that was behind me. And when it had a chance to bite me it didn’t and rather than clamp down on my leg it let go. I never even considered my actions wrong until we were at a Christmas party in the old neighborhood and the asshole family turned up. The dad cussed me out for killing his dog while his son blinked back tears. I now see that the dog was probably trained that way and not a bad dog, just a bad owner. Now I see the sons at school and can’t help but think I have my dogs still but they don’t because of my actions. So am I an asshole? \n\nTl;dr- I told my mom a dog attacked me rather than my dog and the county probably put it down. ",

      "description": "(TL;DR at the end) \n\nSo my best friend, let's call him S. S and i have had a very short relationship thing which ended painfully for me (he said it won't be happening as he saw me more like a sister, even though he told me he loved me not long before)\nFast forward a few months, we're having a best friends thing going on with occasional sex which is fine by me (even though I still have some feelings left)\n\nHis birthday is on halloween and i agreed to come. I was very excited about it and he said he was, too, and he was so happy spending time with me for the night (my mother was watching my son so it was possible, which is like a huge deal)\nHe goes on about how his crazy ex (which he obvs has still feelings for, and i have been picking up his pieces after their fights ever since) won't be invited. Well they fought and he said he didn't care if she came but she wouldn't be the center of attention for him.\nI'd never met her before, so i was upset for him inviting her but i just dealt with it. So it's his birthday and she shows up and of course starts flirting and cuddling with him and whatnot and he lets her, she and i kiss (i am bi but that was a dumb idea, he was still fine with it tho) then she drinks too much and he carries her to his bed so she could sleep a bit.\nWell all of the other people except one friend of him had left at this point.\nSo the three of us had a good time, then she woke up and S and her went downstairs to talk. I and the other guy (B) hear both of them crying and fighting quietly so we choose not to interrupt even though i am worried about them. I call down once to ask if they are okay but don't go down because they seem to want privacy.\n\nWell me and B start talking, we get along well (he is kinda hitting on me) and I'm thinking why not, he is cute. So we kiss for some time and touch each other a bit (in a sexual way) . Well we didn't notice but apparently S and his ex were standing and watching for a while. He later told me it hurt him that i was kissing and touching someone on his couch without asking.\n\nWell S and his ex went down again without us noticing, and after she's left (it's like 4am at this point) he comes up and tells us he's had sex with her downstairs and then sent her home. (she has a child too, and is in the process of getting back together with the father even tho she still loves S, but she's a cheater anyways soo)\n\nI was going to sleep at his place anyways and he invited B to stay. So B crashes on the couch and me and S sleep in his bed.\nIn the morning B came to us, we talked for a while and watched videos etc\nI was touching both of them in a non-sexual way by then (having my hand on his arm, etc) \nI just like physical contact. Apparently S felt it was inappropriate and he felt replaced.\n\nAITA? I'm not sure about it. I have been there for him almost more than i can handle and i stayed all night even though he basically begged me to attend and then chose to spend it fighting with his crazy ex.\n\n\n(TL;DR: I went to the bday party of my ex, who is now kinda my best friend (he ended it). He invited his crazy ex, they fought and then had sex. He is angry at me for making out with his friend on his couch while they were fighting downstairs for more than an hour.) ",

      "description": "My girlfriend of just over a year pressured me to move in together last September when the lease on her apartment was up.  At the time, we had been together for less than a year, and I told her I wasn’t ready for that.  She claimed her feelings were hurt, got a little upset, but ended up finding a new place closer to me, but still separate.\nI have explained to her many times that I am naturally an introverted person, and although I do love my time with her, sometimes I just need a night or two to myself.  I’ve tried to express to her that it has nothing to do with her personally, and that it’s no indication of my feelings for her.  I have my own business (two, actually) which requires me to deal with many, many people (mostly strangers, but also a few dozen employees), and sometimes I just need time alone to recharge.  If any of you are naturally introverted, you know what I mean.  I feel like my apartment should be my place of refuge when I need this time.\nA few months ago, I gave her a key to my apartment, because she was working a job that was less than a five minute drive from my place.  Her job is a dirty one (outdoors), and I thought it would be nice to give her access to my place so she could shower and clean up after work, if she needed it.\nSince then, she has basically moved in.  There would be bags and bags of her clothes and accessories at my place.  I bought an extra dresser because I was tired of having random bags of clothing stacked in my bedroom.  All the while, I kept politely reminding her that I do need my private time, and asked that she try to spend a night or two a week at her own place.  She gets all butt-hurt when I remind her of this, even though I over-emphasize the fact that it absolutely doesn’t mean I lover her any less.\nBecause I know it hurts her feelings, I asked her if she could please take it upon herself to excuse herself once or twice a week.  She doesn’t.  Ever.  She’ll stay for weeks at a time until I finally say something, and it results in a fight.  Then she leaves, but in anger.  That’s not what I want.\nNow, because her job is outdoors, and seasonal, she has been laid off since mid-December.  She has been at my place 24/7.  I know she’s stressed about not working, and I don’t want to kick her while she’s down, so I’ve not said anything about her being here for about six weeks straight.  However, I’m beginning to feel really claustrophobic, and it’s making me have feelings of resentment.  \nThis past weekend, I went to visit my sister out of town.  I asked her before I left, “you’re not going to stay at my place all weekend, are you?”  She assured me she wasn’t, and I left Friday afternoon.  She did.  She stayed all weekend at my place, by herself.\nI’m nearing the end of my rope.  I do love her, but I don’t feel like she’s being respectful of my needs and requests.  Not only that, but it’s costing me money.  I work 10-12 hours a day, or more.  Usually, I turn my heat way down during the day to save money.  The apartment under mine keeps my place plenty warm while I’m gone, and it only takes a few minutes to bring the heat in my place up when I return home.  Now, my heat is running all day, everyday, and apparently even when I’m out of town.  She gave me money once, at the beginning of December, but nothing since.  My heating bill was $200 last month, and I know it could have been half that if she wasn’t at my place all day everyday.  I don’t want to ask for money because I know she’s not working, and stressed financially, at the moment.  I try to look at it as my way of helping her out in a time of need.  I don’t know how much longer I can maintain that perspective, though.  This is really beginning to affect my feelings about our relationship.\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR My girlfriend stays at my place 24/7 for weeks at a time, even though I’ve told her I need a night or two to myself every once in a while.",

      "description": "This is sparked by the recent post. Everyone overwhelmingly said YTA, so I'm questioning myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's winter here and every time I want to go out we end up canceling for some reason. It's too cold. Being lazy. We are doing something tomorrow. Plenty of times I still want to go out, but I stay in because I enjoy spending time with my husband. In the past few months we've barely gone anywhere. I work from home and my husband works from home at least 2 days a week. Sometimes for several days I only leave the house to take the dogs out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe used to go to karaoke every Thursday night at my favorite bar. I planned with our friend for us all to go to karaoke. My husband said yes at the time. The day arrives and when he gets home from work I tell him she wants to meet up there at 10pm(when karaoke starts). I could tell by the look on his face he had forgotten or plain did not want to go, but he said okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo mention of being sick at all. I made dinner- pasta and soup with a questionable yogurt. After dinner, he says his stomach hurts. I ask, do you think it was the soup ? No, he didn't eat any soup, but he ate a lot of pasta. No mention of the 2 shots of whiskey he did on an empty stomach. After dinner, I asked him if he wanted water, medicine, canned chicken soup to settle his stomach, or anything else. No.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt 9pm, I ask him if he still wants to go to karaoke. He says his stomach still hurts. I assume he doesn't want to go. I ask again if he needs anything. Nope. I said okay I am going to get ready.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I'm about to leave, he says wait you're not still going ? I said yes I am I don't want to cancel on our friend within an hour and I said I was going to get ready. He says \"you are going to leave your sick husband at home alone instead of taking care of him ?\" Like... yes. He is likely going to pass out in 30 minutes and even if he doesn't he was watching a show I don't like so we would be sitting in separate rooms doing separate things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe says fine then he will go too. He falls asleep in the car on the way there. At the bar he ends up drinking A LOT. We were on our 2nd drink when our friend got there and they did a lot of mini shots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore our friend gets there he is insisting he can barely stand up, but refuses to sit on a stool. He says if he gets worse, we NEED to go home. When our friend arrives he asks her if his head feels hot and doesn't he seem sick ? She said \"why aren't you sleeping in bed at home ?\" He doesn't say anything, looks at me and stops mentioning being sick. The rest of the night was normal drinking and singing. We leave right after our song at around 12.15am. Husband falls asleep in the car ride home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext day he is not sick at all. Doesn't even mention feeling sick. And when I asked he said no with some attitude. So AITA ? Should I have stayed home ?",

      "description": "My wife and I have 3 kids who are 7, 5 and 3 years old. My brother babysits for us, which is a huge help, on average once a week, as he only works Tues-Thurs and he conveniently lives around the corner.  I should mention that they are very well behaved and are low maintenance kids to watch. \nMy brother and I also work in close proximity to each other, about a 5 minute drive, which is about 30 mins from our homes, depending on traffic.  \nHe recently got this job and since he doesn’t have his license and I wanted to help him out, I offered to drive him home when he works as we start at different times but both finish at 5:00pm.  I would obviously never ask him for gas money because he helps us out with the kids.  \nHowever, he then offered 2 of his coworkers rides home, who are basically on the way, but didn’t consult me so I was pretty much forced to agree to it, which is fine but I feel he should have asked me first.  \nSo the one guy lives 5 minutes from our neighbourhood and the other guy lives way past us but I drop the coworkers off together and the one guy takes the bus the rest of the way home, I then drop off my brother.  \nWhen I brought up that maybe they should be chipping in, my brother disagreed and said that they were on the way and it’s only 3 days per week and he’s uncomfortable asking them.  They did offer and my brother told them not to worry about it at first, but when it came up again I made it clear to everyone that it would be fair for them to chip in, nothing crazy as this carpool situation is unique as it’s only 3 days per week and I don’t even drive one guy all the way home.  Also, if I want to make a stop on the way home I can’t because they’re with me, and I can sometimes leave work early but I can’t when I have to drive them home.  \nIt should also be noted that when they don’t have a ride it takes 3 buses and over an hour to get home from work.  \nSorry for rambling but AITA for wanting his coworkers to chip in for gas?",

      "description": "I am a social neanderthal. I have absolutely no people skills whatsoever, zero charm and normal situations in which regular people interact daily are completely foreign to me. I have anxiety disorder and I'm not fully convinced someone didn't slam my soft spot as a baby.\n\nI've been dating my girlfriend, who we'll call Amy, for a little over a year. Amy is probably more of an introvert than an extrovert, but still much more social than I am and has a good group of friends and doesn't dread going out in public. Over the course of our relationship she's been trying to help me become less anxious and more outgoing, which has been hit and miss. Somehow she manages to tolerate my shut-in nature and we've had a great relationship despite it. \n\nThis past friday Amy wanted to go hang out with a large group of her friends at a bar, and wanted me to come. Most of whom I've only met briefly in passing, the rest who I've never met and have only heard about me through Amy. Basically my worst nightmare, but I figured I owed it to her to try it rather than refusing yet again.\n\nOn the way there, Amy was giving me a pep talk and telling me to just be myself, do what comes naturally and \"let loose.\" We arrive, I survive introductions and sit quietly while everyone talks until the boyfriend of Amy's best friend brings up urban exploration, which I love. No one else at the table is interested, so I mention I am. This leads to me and him having a great talk about it with everyone else chiming in, and I started to feel more comfortable and kept the conversation flowing and engaged others at the table for a few minutes.\n\nI noticed Amy had gotten quiet, so I quietly asked if she was ok got a very reassuring \"mhm\" which I took in the moment as her just letting me keep up my momentum since others tried to include her too with no luck. I tried numerous times to bring her in on the talk but she was pretty quiet. When we all left, people were asking for my number, joking with Amy about having to bring me again next time and how I'm a good guy, it felt pretty great.\n\nShe was silent until we got home. When I finally pried out of her what was wrong, she accused me of \"one-upping her\" and \"completely overshadowing her.\" Apparently I had taken over the conversation. I told her I was only doing what she asked of me, and since people kept talking to me I kept answering them, and that they talked to me that much because they wanted to get to know me but already knew her. She told me she wasn't expecting me to \"be that social and take the spotlight\" and that it ruined the evening for her, and now I'm even more reluctant to go back for another meet-up.\n\nI don't know what I did wrong, but I also don't know social etiquette enough to trust my own judgement. I tried to bring her in on the talk or shift the focus to her multiple times but she wasn't having it, and I thought I was only doing what she asked of me for months. Did I fuck up here? ",

      "description": "My friend, who I will call Mike, and I went on an international trip with students from several other colleges. Pretty early on in the trip cliques were formed and after a day or two of flirting it was obvious who was going to be hooking up with who for the duration of the trip. We ended up befriending and hooking up with two girls that also happened to be really close friends. \n\nThe four of us hung out as we travelled around and it become pretty obvious (to me and her at least) that myself and the girl he was hooking up with (let's call her Rachel) were much more compatible than Mike and Rachel. But things were already kind of in place and the trip was only about 10 days long so no sense in rocking the boat. \n\nMike and I go to the same school, Rachel and her friend another. Although both universities are only about 3 hours apart. So not inconceivable a relationship could work over that distance. Anyway, Mike and Rachel attempted to pursue something after the trip was over. It fizzled out quickly because Rachel wasn't that into it.\n \nHowever, at this point Rachel and I start talking often and getting close. Everything stayed very friendly because I was weary of being the asshole and pursuing a friend's old flame. But after several months of on again off again communication it's pretty clear we're both into each other. It's been almost a year since the trip and whenever Mike and I reminisce about it he sort of mentions something like \"Damn, I wish things would have worked out with Rachel. She was really cool.\" Don't think he still has feelings for her but more he just wishes things played out differently. \n\nLast piece of additional context: he has pursued ex girlfriend's of mine. He's always asked respectfully and I've never cared.\n\nSo I'm wondering, is there a statue of limitations on pursuing a girl that my friend has been with? WIBTA if I pursued her?\n\n",

      "description": "Story: I met someone who I became very close friends with. Honestly, in hindsight without all this bullshit, one of the best friendships I ever had. She was a struggling make up artist and so never had any money in the bank, ever. One day she asked for a loan of $500 and I gave it to her. When she asked for bank details, I told her not to worry about it while she was struggling. Because I genuinely did care for this person, more than what I probably should have, over the course of 12 months I have went through bank statements to find out I have helped her to the tune of around $15000. Car payment here, rent there etc etc. It seems to have all added up. She always told me she would pay me back when she got on her feet financially or that she would find a way to make it up to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI make $150,000 a year as a network administrator and have no debts or any big ongoing expenses. I therefore save and have a lot of money so I am just making this clear to save the comments about \"omg so much money, you're an idiot\" etc. I KNOW THIS!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now, I feel like a failure. How can someone who you've helped so significantly cut you off and act like you don't exist? Go out of their way to block you on all social media? She always told me how much I'd \"saved her life\". Have so little disrespect for you they then screw your best friend? Have you pay for a car deposit and not even bother to find the time to come and take you for a drive in it? Honestly, it could go on and on, but imagine a way someone could disrespect you, and it has happened to the nth degree. I'm not trying to say this all happened at once, it happened over a period of time but again given how much I cared for the person and my lack of respect I still allowed it to happen and help but regardless she never paid me back or even did anything to \"make it up to me.\". I feel like the biggest loser I feel like I'm too embarrassed to even tell people what's happened. The depressive part of this situation has really gotten to its peak with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLegally: I spoke to a lawyer, and they agree there is common law equity to recover the money. He believes the evidence can establish these elements, and although he said it really depends on the judge that is put on, it is worth a shot at filing the paperwork. He says that over 50% of the people who he sues never even bother to respond to the complaint, so the merit of the case doesn't matter and it goes to a default judgement anyway. For me it's not even about the money, but the principle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease Reddit help. This dilemma has been living in my mind rent free for months now and has been eating me alive. I'm sorry if the \"disrespect\" part isn't really clear I am just in huge emotional clout at the moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So to pre-face, my ex of 5 years broke up with me in late november. While we were dating, I moved out of my parents house and had been wanting to get a dog, so I did. I paid for her, got her shots, and did most of the training. My ex wasn’t living with me at the time, but she stayed over a lot. She would always call the dog hers or ours which I didn’t mind because she was there for when she was a puppy and all of that. \n\nFast forward 3 and a half years later, we started living together and taking care of the dog equally. Basically splitting chores like taking her outside and picking up dog food. Then she broke up with me. I decided I would be nice and still let her see the dog ever-so often. I finally realized that I would never be able to fully get over her if I didn’t do no contact because I still love her a lot. She thinks I’m doing this to be an asshole to her, but it’s completely for my well-being. She texted me recently to see her and I deleted the text. AITA?",

      "description": "Background: religion has always been a touchy subject in my family. I'm treated as the \"black sheep\" of the family for being anti-religious, and come from a family of 6 kids (same parents) of Roman Catholic background. I'm also the only one among my siblings who doesn't have a criminal record, or doesn't live off the state (i.e. welfare), or have a child out of wedlock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy 2 younger brothers are living with my parents, and 2 of my older sisters live in other countries (don't miss them; both are living off the state's good graces in Minnesota, last I checked). One of my older sisters, Ada, is suffering from terminal cancer (Hodgkins, spread to the liver and bone marrow). My two younger brothers have been basically taught to hate me \"because I refuse to join them in heaven one day\" along with the other two sisters that live in the US. Ada is probably the only sibling to treat me decently, but she's quite well indoctrinated. Her husband left her 3 years ago to start a \"sales business\" in the EU, which was basically a pyramid scheme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife, sons (2, 4) and I live quite comfortably ($270,000/year, both of us are engineers), and moved up to Quebec, Canada. Ada has asked me to watch over her daughters (3, 4, 6) when she passes on, but has made a point of stipulating that her estate (about $320,000 tops, most paid for by our parents) will only be made available to me to pay for the girls' expenses, cost of living, etc.; if my wife and I \"raise them proper\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the girls are poorly behaved in general, they are kind girls, and I genuinely want them to prosper (out of compassion, and maybe some tribal/clan-line loyalty). My sons also love playing with them. However, taking on 3 extra kids with a \"gun to my head\" in terms of access to additional funds to raise them is unacceptable: I will **not** sacrifice the college funds and future of my own children, no matter the cost. I also won't tolerate asinine bigotry like religion in my house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told Ada, who has maybe 10 weeks left, she can either accept her kids will be loved and raised humanist/pastafarian/educated and go to college, or become burdens of the state, and she can leave her daughters' upbringing to the living while she makes her peace. After a thorough back-and-forth of logic-versus-platitudes, Ada exclaimed she'd \"prefer her girls meet god before having to live with an asshole like you (me)\".",

Also he would keep moving me around the calls on the server so all I do is take his roles away for literally a second and give it back, but he always gets angry and just leaves.\n\nOne day he decided to go to the afk channel with these 2 other guys and unmutes themselves to talk. I saw this and I tried moving them out but they keep joining the AFK channel so I just server muted them until they moved out. The other two didn't really mind but the \"friend\" started calling me a cunt, asshole, and bitch on DM. His main argument is that this is a casual server with friends so he should be able to talk in AFK, and my main point is that this isn't a big deal: I've unmutes him and his friends and he can just talk on any channel on the server except for AFK, since that is for AFK people only. After some arguing I said \"maybe the autism is getting to you but you should just relax and reflect on this when you've calmed down.\" \n\nRemember, this guy has a history for dark and racist/offensive jokes/speech style, so I thought simply saying he's autistic wouldn't be much of a deal. (He would joke about down syndrome, autism, Asperger's, all kinda stuff all the time)\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Today at school, a guy that sits behind me in Calculus started whispering in my ear things that he had heard from fellow classmates from what happened at a party over the holiday break where I was sexually assaulted by two boys while I was black out drunk.\n\nThings like:\n\n“You wanted it slut”\n\n“Care to add a third next time? 😉 “\n\n“Lemme pound that puss, babe”\n\n“Do you like them big? 😉 😉 “\n\nThese were all especially triggering for me because I didn’t consent to this sexual activity that took place. These two drunk guys basically r*ped me while I was black out drunk and someone opened the door and pulled them off me.\n\nThen all this rumors started spreading the moment that we all got back from the break that I wanted it and that I requested it from them and that I’m a whore, a slurry, etc. I was never even given a chance to tell my wife of the story — which was that I went upstairs to play what I thought would be a couples’ game of King’s - a drinking game. And then they threw me on the bed and it all just happened like that so fast.\n\nAnyways I have not reported it to the police since we were all underage drinking (obv) and I don’t wanna get in trouble; also they were stopped before orgasming and they also did wear condoms so I’m not worried about pregnancy or STDs.\n\nSo this fucking prick of a kid (actually he’s a pizza face loser) finally sets me over the edge whispering this BULSHITT in my ear, and I finally turned around, stood up out of my desk, and popped him, closed fist - straight in the nose.\n\nClass had to be stopped and an ambulance was called because there was so much blood and his nose was def crooked after my hit.\n\nI creeped his IG stories with one of my Finsta’s and he posted a photo of his crooked ass nose with a caption of “thots gonna get a lawsuit bitch”.\n\nWas I in the wrong for doing this? I know violence is usually never the answer but I’m sorry I just had to show this mother fucker Thad sexual assault is not fucking cool or OK, ever.",

      "description": "So a little background info, Me and my friend (lets call her Brittany) have known each other for years and she just got out of a 2 year relationship. So she texted me last night and apologized for being so distant while she was with her boyfriend and that she wanted to catch up over drinks. I told her that sounded great and I would meet her at the bar when I got off work. \n\nFast forward, I get to the bar and shes pretty drunk hanging out with some girl friends she just met. I order a beer and we start talking and she is all over me. At this point I should tell you we are just friends and I wasn't expecting anything more than just talk, but we have fooled around in the past so I knew it wasn't off the table.\n\nAfter a while she tells me she wants me to take her home so we can smoke. We were getting ready to leave when one of her new friends (Paige) stops me and tells me she will take Brittany home because she didn't know my intentions. I told Paige she was a good friend and handed her Brittany's phone and wallet and told her the address. I just went home and played some Overwatch with my friends and forgot about it.\n\nAbout an hour later, Brittany texts me repeatedly telling me to come over and that she has something to show me. I started the 10 minute journey to her house and she proceeded to call me 3 times to make sure I was still coming. When I got there she answered the door in nothing but an untied bath robe and grabbed my hand and led me to her room. She opened her drawer and showed me a blunt she rolled and we sparked it up. About three minutes in she gets a call from someone and I wasn't trying to listen in to her conversation but I heard her say \"but you have to come over because we were supposed to fuck tonight\". At this point I just start laughing because I just realized how stupid I am. I wait for her to finish her call and tell her I'm going home. She asks why and I tell her \"I'm not about to sit here and hang out with the guy you're about to fuck. I'm fine with just being your friend but you cant be doing this shit to me.\" and then I left.\n\nAITA here for getting mad because I was too stupid to see what was actually going on?",

His younger brother would help him. I told my youngest son this, and my wife is very upset that I told him.\n\nIn her mind I am playing favorites and I am making my youngest feel excluded.

      "description": "**TL;DR at bottom**\n\nFirst off, just a little background. My (18F) boyfriend (19M) have been together for going on two years now. We're both in college and we both live with our own parents. However, I hit some rough times with my family and I lived with his family (and paid rent to them) from April 2018-November 2018 until I patched things with my parents and moved back home. My BF's parents have always been really, really controlling. Anytime he wants to do something that they don't like, they threaten to not pay for his college (that they pay a whopping $1k a year for, thanks to the many scholarships my BF earned). Keep this in mind, its relevant a little later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow fast forward to today. My BF and I took my younger brother to a \"fancy\" grocery store near us to get some muffins that my brother really likes for brunch. We bought a 4 pack and my brother ate his, but my BF and I brought the other 3 back to his house. We accidentally left them on the kitchen counter for a few hours, so I asked my BF to go grab them. He saw that someone had eaten one, so he just asked who had eaten it and apparently his younger (14F) sister had. NBD, right? We had an extra one anyway. So he came back upstairs with the two remaining muffins, handed them to me, told me what had happened, then walked to the bathroom. A minute or two later, his mother comes storming upstairs, screaming. She barges in and starts screaming at me. This is how the conversation went: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMother: *sister* is in her room crying because you were mean to her\n\nMe: Why are you screaming at me? What's going on?\n\nMother: Here's your fucking two dollars for the fucking muffin, bitch. \\*THROWS money at me\\*\n\nMe: What's going on??? Why are you yelling at me?? \\*Throws money back at her\\*\n\nMother: Ungrateful bitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, BF comes back into the bedroom and tries to diffuse the situation. His mother continues to scream at him. From this point, it continued to escalate, but not really involving me. His dad comes up, screams at him about being disrespectful (neither of us had been disrespectful, and we're both confused as to why this is even happening), and threatens to stop paying for his car insurance and college. Not even threatened really, just said that he wouldn't pay either of those anymore. My BF and I left and went elsewhere, but now I've told him that I will not go back to his house at all until his mother apologizes to me. He's pissed off at me because he says that I'm making this worse for him because I'm putting him in the middle. So, reddit, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: BF's little sister ate something of ours, asked about it, mom flipped screamed at me even though I had nothing to do with it and now I want her to apologize. BF is mad at me and thinks that I should just get over it.",

      "description": "so in class two days ago, my friend (I will call him D) sat at another table than usual. I wanted to catch him off guard with a picture and he never usually minds it. so I call out “D is this what we are doing?” and he turns around as I take a picture. after class, he comes up to my other friend at my table (this friend is R). D snatches R’s phone and says “you’re recording me” while R was not even using the camera. R shoved him a little and said “I wasn’t recording you, you retard!” just seeing my friends yelling and getting mad in class I start to laugh. D pushes R and swings at him and then says “don’t call me a retard” and then he heard me laughing. D comes up to me and says “you think this is funny?” why lie? so I just said that I thought it was very funny and he stances up like he was going to fight. I am probably twice his muscle mass and he is my friend so instead of instigating I said “I know you aren’t going to hit me so just calm down” and he walks away and I just laughed at the situation in general (i am always joking or laughing about something so this is not unusual). then, as I try to calm down after laughing almost to the point of tears, some random girl that I’ve talked to once gets in my face (more like my torso; she was 5’5” or so and I am about 6’) and tells me that she will punch me in the face. I told her that I wasn’t even part of it and to mind her business. she just keeps coming with names and telling me she will fight me. being a non-serious person, I jokingly pretended to be scared of the short being in front of me and then she backed off and I said “laughing at my friends is so bad all of a sudden.” then, some other guy in my class tells me if I was friends with him I would apologize. again, I didn’t call him a retard or fight with him, all I did was laugh.\n\nlater that day, I messaged D and said that if he was mad at me for some reason that I was sorry and he just denied that I was. I still don’t understand what I would have to be sorry for in the first place. I didn’t call him names or steal his phone, and it’s not like R was recording him or anything, there was one picture taken (just like I do to all of my friends, including D). AITA in any way in this situation? There is a chance that everyone thought I was calling D names and stuff, but I would think that the fact that R was getting swung at was a giveaway that he did it.

      "description": "Alright well to start this off, this is my first post to reddit at all and i've wanted to see what other people think of this. So a bit of background, i'm a college student (17), i'm apathetic and i'm a transgender man. This is happened when i was experimenting with my sexuality and i now know i'm definitely gay. Anyhow, around a year ago me and my partner (who i'll call T from now on) broke up after a 10 month long and awful relationship, i'll start from the beginning. Sorry if this is long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEarly 2017, i was asked out T, i had known them for a few years. They were a writer and i'm an artist, we went together perfectly and the relationship was going smoothly for a few months, but then it started going downhill. They started saying that i should stop talking to my friends because they weren't 'good influences' (friends i had known for longer than i'd known them), demanding i block them. I argued against this with T, saying i would not remove my friends from my life just because they didn't like them. I tried to talk to T about this but they didn't listen and constantly changed the conversation topic. \n\nA few months pass, with repeating arguments and issues. T didn't like me spending time with anyone but them. And if i was out with family or friends, i HAD to be messaging them the entire time. To the point where i couldn't go a few minutes without a \"where are you???\". Again i tried to talk to T about this but they wouldn't listen. If i kept pressing they'd begin guilt tripping me with harsh words, threats. A lot of post-argument conversations that have left a permanent mark on my mind. I wanted this relationship to work because they had been my best friend for a while before we started dating. T also wanted this relationship to work, but it seems more like they wanted a boy toy more than anything.\n\nNow not long after this, i ran into a major issue with them. I'm not exactly skinny, and i started working out and changing my lifestyle to become healthier, and mainly to relieve some gender dysphoria with my figure.\n\nT didn't like this.\n\nThey sparked a massive argument, saying that my body is fine the way it is, saying i shouldn't get surgery or testosterone shots because they loved my 'femininity' and that if i became more masculine, i wouldn't be attractive. They argued that point the entire time.  \nNow as an extremely dysphoric transman, this made it so much worse. They admitted they only were attracted to me because i had a feminine body. I felt like breaking down and crying. In the end i just closed the conversation and had to message my friends to calm me down.\n\nThe next day, as usual, they tried to talk to me as if nothing happened.\n\nIt was about 7 months in i was thinking about breaking up with them. It was on my mind 24/7, i hated being in this relationship and realized how toxic it was. It wasn't until our 10 month anniversary that the day came, but instead they broke up with me. They said i had become distant, that they felt like i had been pushing them to the side (apparently talking to them from waking up until passing out at 3/4am wasn't good enough). I was relieved. I said that i understand and i apologized for being distant (although not very sincerely).\n\nMy life started getting better, i came out to my mum and most of my friends (the others already knew). I got better grades, exams were starting, all was good.  \nBut about 5 months after we broke up, i started noticing some things. Specifically on my instagram story. The view number would change by one every now and then, but i took it as a glitch. It wasn't until an old mutual of ours said that T had been stalking my social media to 'check up on me', and that they'd made an account specifically to follow me without me knowing. They had been looking and blocking me so it doesn't show up on the viewer list. I then decided to upload on my story (something petty, vague mentioning them so others wouldn't know but they would. Sure enough mutual had said they saw it and i got to business.\n\nI messaged T saying that i'd appreciate it if they stopped, not mentioning the mutual at all as i didn't want to get them involved. T instantly messaged back that they were just \"checking up on me\" and that they thought they were being a good person by doing it but \"clearly not :/\" This went back and forth, me saying how i didn't feel safe and them attempting to guilt trip me into feeling bad for them. It went something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nT: I thought i was being good by checking up on you, but clearly you're doing fine.\n\nMe: Please T, our relationship wasn't a healthy one and what you're doing isn't healthy either,\n\nT: I guess we had different views on it then. I never wanted to stop talking, but you just stopped as if nothing had happened. I hate that you're happy\n\nMe: I'm sorry but i'm autistic and you know that effects how i show emotion, you know i'm not empathetic.\n\nT: I hate that you're so emotionless about this, it hurts to see you happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a long convo, i just said that i'm blocking them on everything, that i knew about the fake account and that i'll be blocking it too. T finally caved in, but not without calling me an asshole and throwing insults at me. It's been about 7 months since that, but it's still plaguing my mind.  \nAm i an asshole for not wanting them in my life anymore?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey guys, \n\nI share a room with this girl that I don’t really talk to. As in, we share a bedroom (oh the funs of living at university accommodation). We are cordial and all, but I barely even know her last name. I can only contact her through Instagram, as she doesn’t have Facebook and has always “forgotten” to give me her number. \n\nAnyways, she was eating in the room on I think Friday evening, and then left her plates with food on them on her table. I get it, we all have days when we just can’t deal with it, I didn’t bring it up, thought she’d clean it in the morning. It also didn’t smell, so I don’t mind. Next morning, when I woke up she was asleep, and by the time I got back from breakfast she was gone. The plates weren’t. When I came home that night she was already asleep and so I couldn’t bring it up. I went over to her side to turn the lights off, and one of the bowls was soaked in water, with the remnants of the food just floating in there. Gross, but I thought I would let her know in the morning. \n\nIn the morning she was already gone, and she didn’t come back until Wednesday. So on Tuesday I messaged her asking to clean it up, because I don’t wanna get bugs or mice (which are very common in London). She said she would the next time she comes home. \n\nShe came home Wednesday, didn’t clean it up. I didn’t say anything, as I didn’t see her again. Today morning I left her a note on her mirror to clean it up. When I came home a few hours later, she crumpled up the note and threw it away. Plates still there. \n\nThey are so disgusting at this point that I will definitely not clean them. Fuck that. \n\nWould I be the asshole for throwing them away? I would wait one more day probably. They are so annoying by now. And gross. ",

      "description": "To preface, I am not currently engaged, but I am helping my best friend plan her wedding so the topic of weddings came up at home when I was talking to my sister about the arrangements. Also I am on mobile, so I apologize for formatting. \n\nSo I got home from my friend’s house, and I was looking through Pinterest for centerpiece ideas for her wedding as I am helping out quite a bit. My sister (who was over doing some laundry) saw me and jokingly asked if I was already planning my wedding (knowing that I was helping my friend plan hers). I told her I was trying to find centerpieces for my friend, and then I had to go pick up the bridesmaids dresses from the shop. \n\nOut of nowhere my sister starts talking about how when I get married then she wants to pick out her own dress because “if I’m going to be the maid of honor I want to stand out” and kept going on about it. I politely told her that when/if I get married I already have my bridesmaids picked out, and she isn’t one of them. I only want three bridesmaids, and I already know who they are. \n\nMy sister started screaming at me and saying that she has every right to be a part of my wedding, and it isn’t fair that I won’t even have her as a bridesmaid even though she feels she should be the maid of honor. I reminded her that I’m not even engaged, nor will I be in the near future, and that I have the right to choose who I want in my wedding, and she lost it and started to call our parents and complain. \n\nThis evening my mother called me and said that I was being insensitive and should include her in my hypothetical wedding, and apparently my father agrees. I pointed out that I’m not even engaged and that it would be my wedding and therefore my choice, and now my whole family is apparently mad at me. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not wanting her to be in my hypothetical wedding?",

      "description": "We were assigned a group project however we were all getting separate grades regarding the presentation. The only thing we had to work together on was a movie trailer for our presentation. That was literally the only thing we were getting graded on as a group, and they failed to contribute. Their slides still aren't done and we present on Monday. My slides are up to the top notch on the rubric and everything. \n\nIn regards to the trailer, I told them at the beginning of this project (2 months ago) that we needed to get it done because it'll take awhile to edit due to the fact that we all have 0 experience editing and I knew they'd fuck around. \n\nTwice every week I'd propose a new plan to get together and film this shit to get it done. Each time I was blown off or told they were busy. It's ok to be busy but every single time I proposed it they shot me down. \n\nFast forward to Tuesday the 19th, and the Teacher tells us that the trailer is due on this upcoming Monday. I panic obviously, so Tuesday and Wednesday my group and I made plans to film and what do ya know, they don't show up. So late Wednesday I talked to my instructor and he said I could do the project by myself and get a single grade for it. I jump on the opportunity and now all my free time has gone towards filming. Today I go to edit and my group comes up and tell me we need to film ASAP. I told them that I already did mine and that it's not ok for them to have messed around and put me off for so long. I told them that they're not going to help me edit and they're not getting credit for it. And then they decided to tell me I'm a bitch and other names.\n\nI, sadly, stayed in a neutral tone even though I wanted to throw them out of an airplane with no parachute. \n\nAnyway, Was I the asshole to not give them credit? \n\n\nTL;DR group members put me off and procrastinated, didn't help with project, I'm not letting them get credit for my work.

      "description": "Today, I was at a unity event hosted by my school, focused on race, gender and sexuality issues. I came ready to discuss, as I had been to this two years before and stayed quiet most of the time. We did some activities highlighting racism in my school, and we had a long, thought-out discussion. I was happy to contribute and speak my mind. \n\nLater, we broke for lunch, and afterwards, we all got in a line, facing one way, shoulder to shoulder. We were told to follow instructions. Our leader read us statements like, \"If your parents are still together, take one step forward.\" Others were something like, \"If you've ever had to help your parents with the bills, take one step back.\" This went on for what seemed like a long time, and I noticed I was pretty far out in front of everyone. I started to feel huge amounts of embarrassment and shame, for no reason other than I was at the front of the pack. There were people at the very back too, and I felt bad for them as well.\n\nNormally, I am a pretty vocal person, but I wasn't today. Being at the front made me feel bad and disgusted. I can't explain it. We talked a little bit about white guilt, and I guess that's what I'm feeling, but I don't think it's fair. I feel a large bit upset and singled out. The leaders said that tomorrow, we should come prepared to discuss some struggles that we have dealt with. It puts me in a weird position to talk about my struggles because people there will only see me as the guy that was at the front of the pack of people. No one said anything to me about it and I wasn't feeling bad from any of their actions, just overall a weird feeling.\n\nIn sum, Reddit, am I the asshole for feeling bad about being the one with the most privilege, and not wanting to share out because of it?",

      "description": "So my sister works at a hardware store and when she comes home from work, she likes to talk about events that happened at her job that day. The problem is her job is boring as hell and not all that interesting to hear about. All her stories boil down to “a customer wanted to return something outside the return window and was rude about it” or “my coworker said this hilarious thing that is only funny if you work there”. \n\nNow even though I dislike hearing her talk about her job, I’ve put up with it because that’s what you do for people you care about. It’s the only thing she’s got going on in her life, so I understand why that’s the only thing she ever wants to talk about. However, she is not willing to return the favour. Anytime I try to talk about my day or what’s going on in my life, she shuts it down right away. In her defence, I’m a physics major, and talking about my day usually involves talking about physics or stuff going on at the university, so I get why she’s uninterested. But considering that her job is just as uninteresting to me as my education is to her, I feel I shouldn’t have to listen to her ramble on about work if she’s not willing to do the same for me. \n\nSo my question just boils down to this: in this case, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "First let me state, unequivocally, I have never stated my opinion on this to anyone except you lovely strangers, and I never would.\n\n(TL;DR at the bottom)\n\nRecently I was shown a group photo from my wife's side of the family. It shows great-great-grandmother, great-grandfather, grandmother, new mother, and infant. It's a good picture; everybody's smiling. \n\nHowever, I'm less than impressed. And I'm generally okay that I probably won't be in a similar photo for a decade or more.\n\nSee - in order to get that five-generation photo, including various aunts and cousins, the following happened: \n\nGrandmother got pregnant in high school and gave the baby to a Catholic adoption agency, then got with a different guy. Then started having babies with him.\n\nMother and Aunt both got pregnant in high school. \n\nOne married her boyfriend while a teenager. \n\nThe other made up a reprehensible accusation against a guy at school to keep her boyfriend from getting in trouble. When it became obvious that the guy she accused was innocent, she gave birth, and split up with the real father. He didn't get to be part of his daughter's life after she was a toddler.\n \nNow the most recent generation's baby is from a boyfriend of about a year who was a rebound from the last boyfriend. In three of these generations, the boyfriends lived under the girlfriend's parents' roof, for at least a while.\n\nI love my in-laws. I took care of those babies. I rocked my neices to sleep when their own fathers couldn't be bothered.\n\nMy wife and I dated through high school, dated through college, got engaged, got married, moved in together, then started having kids. My wife's the only one of her family who can say that. It seemed like the right order, at least at the time, and it wasn't always the easiest thing to do. \n\n\nSo, TL;DR - while I truly love everyone involved, I see my in-laws' five-generation photo as the result of some pretty horrible and selfish decisions and I'm not terribly impressed....\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "I've been with my gf a couple of years. And we've been long-distance most of it because she entered med school about a year into the relationship. One of the things I vividly remember her telling me early in the relationship is she is very \"low-maintenance\" and that was one of the reasons I continued the relationship. Not to sound like I don't care or anything, but I want a partner who can take care of themselves. She has proven to be anything but low-maintenance in my opinion. \n\nShe seems so different from when I met her. I feel like she flat out does not know how to cope with adversity. She has been continually stressed since she started med school, and she just can't handle it on her own. Early in the relationship I would immediately call her when she told me was sad/crying, but now she cries about 4 times a week and expects me to have hour-long face times whenever she needs emotional support. Initially she got mad at me when I would tell her I don't have time (I'm in school too), but I eventually put my foot down and said that even though I cared about her I would not skip schoolwork for her and jeopardize both our futures. I told her if she could not handle that then I could not help her. She softened a lot when I told her that; maybe she was just surprised as I'm generally pretty passive. Since then, though, she gets went from aggressive to passive aggressive. She said it's fine to tell her that I'm busy or whatever and she will respect that, but from her tone and the way she texts I can tell she's really annoyed and implies I don't care about her.\n\nI just feel like the relationship is not reciprocal by my own nature. I had a tough childhood and learned how to cope when things aren't going my way. I don't need other people to get me through my day. I feel like she just saps me of all my energy. After a long day at work or school she expects me to sit there for an hour while she cries and vents about how her preceptor is mean or her roommate plays loud music and she can't study or she is worried about exams or she misses me or she misses her friends from here. These are all things she cries about regularly. I have only been with one other girl, so I don't have a good feel for how normal this is but I have never cried to her about anything.\n\nI know I've only complained, but I do really care about her and genuinely want her to succeed in life. I convinced her to start seeing a counselor and I guess it helps a little, but she has a weird thing with not wanting to take medication that I strongly think she needs. So basically she just vents to a counselor once a month or so, not much help IMO. She is a genuinely nice human being, we have a lot in common in terms of beliefs, politics, and so on, and she is very intelligent. Maybe there are other guys who like to feel like that bulwark for their gf and shield her and protect her, but I just find this draining. I don't want to be called at 11pm to hear her cry because she is feeling lonely for the 9th time that month. I want to just chill and talk about how our days went when we get home over text and then eat dinner and go to bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that school is out for me and I have some breathing room, I am seriously considering breaking up with her. At the same time, I feel guilty thinking about just leaving her stranded in med school with how much a struggle it is for her even with my emotional support. WIBTA?",

      "description": "I'm posting this to get an outside opinion and see if I'm overreacting. \n\ntl;dr - I feel as though once I do something nice, it is expected that I do that task in the future.\n\nGirlfriend[26f] and I[26m] have lived together for about 2 years and have been together for a total of 4 and a half. I feel like my GF is self centered in a lot of ways and takes advantage of my kindness and somewhat uses me. \n\nA few examples of what I mean\n\n- Last night she was watching Netflix on our Smart TV and her legs were hurting so she wanted to do some stretching. She handed me the remote and asked me to find her yoga. Not a big deal there, I happened to hear a yoga program a few days ago that is one of those like 8 week mapped out programs with videos included. After the video she says I'm going to try to do this every day, cool, works for me. I told her I'll find the programming guide for her so she can see what videos she should watch every day. She tells me \"no you can just put the video on and tell me okay this is what you're doing.\"\n\n- She absolutely refuses to take partial responsibility to try and remember to take her birth control. I have to get it for her every night or else she doesn't/forgets to take it. Sometimes, even if I verbally remind her to go take it, she has me get it for her. I ask her why doesn't she make an effort to remember to take it herself and why is it always on me, she responds with \"it isn't always on you, you give it to me and I take it\"\n\n- When she goes to bed she will always ask me to set her alarm for work on her phone and plug it in. This especially annoys me when she literally hands me her phone when shes done browsing Facebook or whatever and then asks me to do this. I understand it if her phone is on the dresser or something and I'm walking by and shes already in bed, but that to me is ridiculous. \n\n- We don't often go to bed at exactly the same time (I'm full time getting my masters in CS, she works full time, I usually go to bed about an hour later or so) but sometimes when we do and I'm already in bed messing around on my phone or whatever and she is getting out of the shower she will get in bed without turning the light off and ask me to turn it off and turn on the fan. I usually make a big deal about this whenever it happens and ask her if shes serious...\n\nI don't want it to come off as she treats me as her slave and just bosses me around all the time, I just feel that I get punished for my kindness, because all of these things (and others like it) I have done at some point not because I was asked, but just to be nice and it seems once I do something to be nice a couple of times it seems like its just expected that \"oh okay this is your job now\" and it just kind of frustrates me. \n\nWIBTA if I brought up that I feel like I have a child rather than a GF? Obviously I would NOT phrase it this way, but that is honestly how I feel especially with stuff like the birth control and the alarm.",

      "description": "I asked my best friend, Brad, to be my date to a date party for one of our student orgs. Both of us recently had bad experiences with people we were talking to or interested in and therefore, neither of us had a date. I had never been to a dance before even in high school, so he knew how much this meant to me. We agreed to go and said after the bar opened up at 11 to  the public (the bar was reserved from 9-11 for just our org), we could split up and dance with other people.\n\nFast forward to the night, within 15 minutes of us getting there, Brad leaves me to actively flirt and dance with another girl. He didn’t pay any attention to where I was or look for me at all till around 11 pm at which point, I had left to take another friend home because they were actively projectile vomiting. I wanted to be a supportive friend and be happy for Brad that he was talking to this chick, but I was mad that he couldn’t even last 15 minutes before leaving me as my date. He wouldn’t respond to his texts (which was reasonable since the bar was loud) so I left after failing to find him.\n\nThe next day, when I called him out on it, he said “if you want me to feel bad about this, I’m not going to. I only went with you as a date because I knew you’d have fun and you refused to go on your own. We took a few pictures and pregamed but there were so many singles at the bar, why would I wait till 11 pm to split up?” He also said “you got to take \\_\\_\\_\\_” home and I was happy for you”. Basically, acting as if taking my incoherently drunk friend home to take care of him was a “fun night\"/ \"hookup.\"\n\nEventually I got mad and called him a dick &amp; an awful date for not taking my feelings into consideration. He then ignored me for a full week, which was out of the usual. When I messaged him to resolve things &amp; apologize, he said he was mad because he \"didn’t appreciate being called a dick\" for doing something “we agreed to do” and that he wanted to go to the date party with “a friend and not \\[his\\] mom” and that I was being irrational about the whole thing and that agreeing to split at 11 was “a dumb idea.” He brought up how he was sad that the girl he was interested in had dumped him and that it was nice “having someone \\[girl @ bar\\] pay attention to \\[him\\] and not treat him like \\[he\\] was disposable.” At that point I felt pretty guilty because I wanted him to have fun, and was glad he and that girl were talking, but I just felt like he refused to see why I’d be upset about him leaving me\n\nI was also more upset because another mutual friend of ours (whom he isn’t that close with) asked him to be her date to our formal the previous semester, and he stayed with her the whole night. I called him out on it and he said “well I’m not that close to her so I couldn’t say no, but I’m close with you so I don’t feel as bad turning you down.”\n\nAITA for being upset about this entire situation?",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AITA for not being bothered by the fact that I'm only getting promoted because I made a good impression on the head of my company and not because of my work ethic?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n^(Throwaway bc I'm paranoid that someone I work with will see this.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started a new job about 5 and a half months ago.  It was a career change for me, so even though I'm \\[super\\] overqualified for my position, I was excited for the opportunity to be in a field that I actually wanted to eventually advance in.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quickly realized that the head of our company is a giant flirt, so much so that people have quit because they were made to be uncomfortable by his behavior.  I'm not the kind of person to be easily offended; if anything, I saw his approaching me to be nothing less than an opportunity, plus, he wasn't saying anything that was even remotely offensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI figured that engaging with him enough to make him like me, but not enough for him to think that I'm flirting back/not enough for him to have evidence (so to speak) that would backfire on me, there was no way that I could be hurt in this situation.  I was going to milk this dude and make it so that I end up on top in the end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, my plan worked.  I found out that in a couple of weeks, I'm going to be promoted into an *actual* role (my position now is admin and this new role is, well, not).  I'm definitely qualified to do it, but, again, I've only been here for a couple months and I haven't done much by way of proving myself.  I know for a fact that I've only been promoted because our head honcho likes me.  This does not bother me in the slightest.  I believe that this is just the world we live in.  It's all about who you know to get you there, but *staying* there is what really matters.  Anyone can get you a job; you just have to prove after the fact that you were the best choice for it.  That's what I'm ready to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy co-workers think that I'm an idiot.  They don't think that I should have engaged with him at all in the first place and that it doesn't matter that it worked out for me in the end.  I disagree.  I'm getting a significant pay raise and about to climb the ladder up towards something that I actually want to continue doing for the long run.  They argue that the last time he was this close to a staff member, he said something inappropriate to her, she quit, and she had to sign an NDA and was paid half a year's salary on the spot.  I'm enough of an asshole to admit that this scenario doesn't seem to bad to me, but that's not the point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, AITA for not being above nepotism?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons and i’m on mobile, so forget formatting. \n\nBackstory: my cousin is about ~40. He left the country about two decades ago and i was just a toddler so i don’t remember much about it. Long story short, he had a baby when he was about 22, she was born with a heart condition and by her doctors orders, my cousin was advised to take her to another country to continue treatment, so he, baby, and GF left and they haven’t returned. Due to this, he never graduated college neither did his GF, but they’re very hardworking and have a nice life. \n\nMy dad’s side of the family has always been very wealthy. My cousin’s now wife comes from a middle class family, not poor, but not wealthy. Her father passed when she was really young, so her mother raised her and her siblings, but my uncles never liked her because she didn’t have a fancy name...\n\nAnyway, here’s were uncles come in. When my cousin got her pregnant w/baby previously mentioned, my aunt repeated multiple times that my cousin wasn’t the father. Once the baby was born, they avoided any contact with her and my parents were actually the ones that helped my cousin look out for her. It wasn’t until the kid was about 2 that they started bonding with her. Btw, for any doubters, she looks just like my cousin...\n\nFast forward a couple years, my cousin gets married, has another baby (now a teen) and my uncles criticized everything about the wedding and even the baby’s name... \n\nSince my cousin never visits, all i knew about him were the horrible stories my uncles would say. “He didn’t finished college”, “he works a crappy job”, “he could be living much better here”, “he doesn’t have much money”so i, gullible as i was, believed them..\n\nThis past Christmas i decided i was gonna go and visit. I had an amazing time. Everything my uncles said were untrue. His wife even told me that my uncle made her cry at the wedding because “she wasn’t good enough for him” and my aunt just stood there as it happened. My cousin told me that he sent his parents some things with a friend that had previously visited him, said friend went to drop things at parents house, and the parents proceded to crap talk my cousin to a stranger that was just dropping gifts for them from their son...\n\nAfter all those things, I realized that they’re horrible people and I don’t want anything to do with them, so I just cut them off since after Christmas. I really can’t believe they acted like that to my cousin, yet they praise their other sons because they married rich people.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for cutting them off??\n\nBtw, english is not my native language so forgive any grammar mistakes.

      "description": "I'll try my best to make the situation as understandable as possible.\n\nBasically, my fiance and I just started looking at reception venues for our wedding that'll be next year. We procrastinated a bit up until this point but what we saw was what we liked. The first place we looked at (which I'll call venue A) was a nice/cozy community building, that had a big open space, a clean slate for us to decorate as elegantly as we want (as long as we clean it all up obviously) and was within our price range. I practically fell in love with the place as soon as I walked in. We told the venue owner we would continue looking around but will give them a yes or no answer by next week (which happens to be today.)\n\nDue to our schedules and the holidays, we never got to visit any other venues, but I have been looking at pictures of other places online and calling to get info like prices and room capacity. Nothing just hasnt seemed as good as venue A.\n\nHeres where mom comes in.\n\nShe is INSISTENT that I'm making the wrong decision choosing venue A. She claims it will be a massive inconvenience for us and our guests because it's a 30 minute drive from our ceremony site (which I dont see as a problem. I'd rather have a beautiful site far away than an average one close by.) Which brings me to her next point. I should be going with venue B, this incredibly rustic-themed train depot that's only 10 minutes away, but holds less people and is slightly more expensive (which she isnt paying for.)\n\nI told her we like what we found, and unless she wants to pay for it we're sticking with venue A. She offered to pay the difference between the two but that still leaves me paying 80% of the price for a venue we dont like. I told her she can reserve venue B for her own wedding if she likes it so much... you can imagine things got heated after that point.\n\nNow shes slamming doors behind her because I \"dont want her opinion\" and \"I can take my MIL dress shopping with me since I won't listen to her.\" I'm honestly scared to include my mom in wedding plans for the next year because I'm afraid she'll keep acting this pushy and crazy. AITA? Is she actually crazy or am I being stubborn about what my fiance and I want?",

Yeah I play it too, but I do so in moderation. She's obsessed and by that I mean, she gets home from school and immediately glues herself to the TV screen until someone nags her to get up. And it's from little things like telling me to do something (and her getting mad at me if I decline to do her bidding) to getting mad when my mom tells her to get up and do her chores. Which she knows she has to do, but chooses not to anyway. It's gotten to the point where my mom has to tell her to get up and do something 5-6 times before she actually does, each time met with nasty (yet advertiser friendly) remarks. \n\nShe yells when someone passes infront of her to use the front door; she even put her hands on me to move me out of the way last night because I wasn't moving fast enough to lock it for her, since she couldn't even be bothered to get up to lock it in between deaths. It's not like she even plays anything other than arcade mode anyway; she stay's away from comp so it's not like it'd kill her to do her obligations in between matches. My mom understands videogames, she played WoW a lot herself. But my sister is turning into one of 'those' kids. The 'get the fuck outta my room I'm playing minecraft' kid. And I'm kinda tired of hearing her yell about how bad her team is, and hearing the back and forth of an addict being told to get up and do something to clean the house. It's not like it'd kill her to take 10-15 minutes to wash the dishes/vaccum the floors in between games.\n\nFast forward to today, I started my chores but my sister had gone through two matches. She could've excused herself to get up, but no. Then I did something I was planning to do for a while. With the vaccum on and being out of her line of sight, I unplugged and replugged the modem, forcing her out of the game. She took the walk over to check it, then went to do her chores, crying about how she 'was going to get banned for leaving a game'. I know OW has that system installed, but I doubt it's as severe as she thinks it is. Even when my mom went to comfort her she lashed out at her. \n\nSo AITA for finally pulling the plug on my toxic gaming sister?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to share a hobby with my partner's mom?",
      "description": "After I get rid of a bunch of old hobby stuff I don't use, I'm wanting to look into making resin jewelry. It's interesting, it's cute, and I could make a couple bucks on Etsy with it.\n\nBut I made the mistake of mentioning it around my boyfriend's mother. And now she wants to join me in it. If any of you know what r/justnoMIL is, I used to post about her on there. But the TL;DR is that she's pushy, controlling, and has a victim complex.\n\nSo she wants to join me in making this stuff. A lot of things go into me not wanting to share it with her. One, again, she's pushy and controlling. I don't want to come home after a long day of work just to be shouted at that I'm doing my hobby wrong, because I'm not doing exactly that she wants me to do. I'm not putting the right flowers in that piece, she thinks I used too much glitter, that piece needs to cure longer than three days, yadda yadda yadda.\n\nTwo, she's about to have several surgeries that will leave her bedbound for a long while. While my partner thinks her joining me in this would be something good for her, I haven't gotten to explain why it would fucking suck for *me*.\n\nShe's going to be bedbound by the time I want to start trying it. I'd be the one having to go back and forth for her for supplies, getting this and that because there's not room for her to cram anything else into her hoard of a room. I'd be the one having to make sure her room is well ventilated so the fumes don't kill her AND try to make sure the cats don't escape out the window. I'd have to keep her room spotless to keep all the dust and cat hair from drying into the work. That, and she's already trying to push all these grandeur visions of a big Etsy business on me, wanting to sell this and that when all I want is a fun hobby for a little bit of extra money, not a booming empire of flowers and glitter in fake glass.\n\nAnd I can't just tell her I don't want to. I can't tell her no. Because she'll go into a rage and yell and cry about how we're all awful, that she can't do anything right, we're all selfish, blah blah. I don't want to deal with that. I already deal with it on a daily basis and don't want to be made to feel like shit for not wanting to share. And it's not like she doesn't have any hobbies, she's got all kinds of crochet stuff that I'd be happy to help her relearn (or set her up with the right YouTuber because I'm not good at teaching), and an entire section of her room is already devoted to more transitional jewelry making. So it isn't like she'll have nothing to do. We all live together as well, I can't just go somewhere else for a few days until she cools her shit. (And before anyone gets on my case, we've tried and failed at moving out. We simply can't afford it.) \n\nI just want to have a small hobby to enjoy in my free time without having to divide that time to someone else's hobby needs. I want to have something small that's mine and mine alone to enjoy. But I still can't shake the feeling that I'm an asshole for not wanting to help my MIL find some kind of enjoyment while she's bedbound for months.",

      "title": "AITA for taking petty revenge against my HOA?",
      "description": "Hey all,\nSome back story here. I live in HCMC Vietnam. I have rented an apartment in a nice upscale apartment building for the last two years. Each apartment is privately owned, and we have an HOA in charge of management of the building. The HOA board is in charge of hiring a managing/service company to oversee services such as security, cleaning, etc. This year we elected a new woman in charge of the HOA, and she promptly fired the old company and hired another contractor. I work from a home office, which is relevant to this story.\n\nI order food often. Food and delivery here is really cheap, and I can order from essentially any restaurant in the city far cheaper than I could personally cook a meal. We are talking like $3 delivered to your door. I'll often order coffee or whatever as well. My girlfriend doesn't much care for western food, so sometimes we will order from different places. This essentially equates to like 3-7 deliveries a day.\n\nHow this worked in my building is what you would expect from a hotel or an office.\n\nThe delivery guy talks to the woman at the front desk and she calls my apartment. I confirm I am expecting a delivery, he has to sign in and she escorts him to the elevator and allows him entry to my floor. Everything in the building is key-card access, and the delivery guy can only go to my floor and back to ground.\n\nThis morning I woke up and there was a sign posted in the lobby which stated that this procedure was \"unsafe\" and that tenants of the building will have to go down to retrieve any deliveries.\n\nI talked to the security guy and the girl at the reception desk why this policy was put in place and they told me that the woman in charge of the HOA spent an entire day in the lobby of the building and counted delivery people coming in and out of the building and arbitrarily decided there were too many. We have never had any theft or break ins, everything is very tightly controlled here with cameras and security at essentially every exit, 24 hours a day.\n\nNow this policy frankly pisses me off. Ever since the new company has taken over, my desire to stay in this apartment has decreased significantly, but I have a lease and don't want to lose my two month deposit so I'm a bit stuck. It takes me 10-15 minutes farting around with the elevator which should normally be like a 5 second transaction with a delivery guy.\n\nI have tried talking to this woman about how much of an inconvenience this is. She has ignored me entirely or had the girl at the front desk run interference.\n\nI've decided that I would fight fire with fire and I've started ordering deliveries of bottled water to the woman who runs the HOA and I've paid the security guy to let me know if she let's anyone into the building. I've also paid a photocopy shop to deliver 100 copies of a letter every day this week saying I disagree with the policy.\n\nTomorrow I have a meeting with the company that sells ads in the elevators for the building, and I intend to buy a TV sized ad expressing my dislike for this policy.\n\nMy girlfriend agrees that the policy is bullshit but she says I am taking this too far. It'd be cheaper for me to run the ad and try to change the policy so I don't have to move than break my lease.\n\nAm I the asshole here? How far should I take the petty revenge. My idea is if this woman is inconvenienced in the same way she is inconveniencing me, she will change the policy, but I live in a country where this form of protest (or really, any form of protest, since politically it's illegal) is seriously looked down upon.\n\nMy girlfriend is quite pissed off about this, because I'm causing a scene, but it is enough of an issue to me I feel like I'd like to see it through.\n\nWhat say you, Reddit?",

      "description": "I (16m) have a best friend (16f) that I've known since I'm 4. We've been having sleepovers our whole lives, and she proposed we have one tomorrow night. I'm looking forward to it, but I decided that I should see if my girlfriend (also 16f) is ok with it. Just to be clear, I have no romantic feelings for this friend; she's like a sister to me. \n\nMy girlfriend said for me to do what I want, but she said she would be upset if I did have this sleepover, the reason being not jealousy but the fact that my girlfriend used to be allowed to sleepover at my house until recently. She wouldn't be upset at me per se, just at the situation. She can be emotional sometimes, and I really don't want to hurt her. I feel, though, that my girlfriend would get over it within a week or two. Also, she just left for vacation.\n\nMy best friend, however, believes this is unfair and that my girlfriend is imposing on our friendship. She believes that since I've known her for longer, she should be able to sleep over at my house. While my girlfriend is very important to me and I love her, my friend makes a good point. My girlfriend wouldn't be jealous but she'd be lonely all night. \n\nFor context, my girlfriend and I have been together for about 7 months now and go to different schools about 40 minutes away from each other. She feels that she doesn't have as much of a social life as me and she thinks she's pressuring me into not hanging out with people. I don't think she's doing that, but she's generally self-deprecating anyways. I feel guilty for being with others while she feels so alone. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I let my best friend that I've known my whole life sleep over while my girlfriend would be unhappy for that night?",

I probably come across as very cold, and I haven't opened up to her, as I should have. Anyway, I've been away to the US for about a month, and after a few weeks the phone calls dried up. Last night I called her at least 10 times, the last of which a man I didn't recognize answered, and hung up. I called again, same man, but I heard my wife say something in the background. She was cheating on me.\n\nI tried holding it together, I was in a hotel room after a party, there were some people there. I started crying, and I don't know why, but I just exploded. I broke furniture, threw food and drink at my guests and completely trashed the place, broke windows and TVs and all. I went completely nuts. I feel horrible.

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year. She used to get angry all the time, but she’s been amazing for months. Last night, she was with a friend and I was at home working, but thinking about going out if she wasn’t coming home soon.  I sent her a text saying “any idea around when you’ll be home?” And she texted me 30 minutes later a picture of her friend’s dog on a tractor.  I laughed and waited about 30 minutes, then said “do you know when I I’ll see you? No rush” also “how’s the dance going?”  They we’re practicing a dance. We spend Friday’s together usually and didn’t want to go out if she was coming home soon.  She ignored my question about coming home and just sent a video of their dance. I complimented her on how well it was coming along and asked if she could just give me an estimate if she’ll be leaving soon. She said she’ll probably leave in a bit and that she didn’t have time to text or she would’ve answered, but she’s been texting all these pictures to me.  Well she then came home very mad, told me to leave and then got mad when I went to leave. So I stayed, but she wouldn’t speak to me all night.  This morning, we were supposed to go on a motorcycle ride to a state park and she won’t speak to me. 2 hours late, she’s still in bed and I get a text saying “go without me, I’m not in the mood”. I’m obviously not going alone, we had a big ride planned and the fun was find it together. She knows I’ve been excited and planning this all week.  She says asking when she’ll be home takes her freedom and nobody should that. AITA, did I word it wrong? Idk what to do, but I hate that she got mad over one text and canceled our plans.  I was just trying to plan my night too, I didn’t care when she came home. ",

      "description": "Disclaimer: I've never handled this kind of situation before and I've never investigated what to do.\n\nSo some days ago I picked up my little brother from a party at one of those big event places, it was pretty late (12:30 AM) when he finally showed up, we were about to leave when we both saw a couple, but the guy seemed to be touching his girl and the girl was clearly struggling to keep him away, nobody was helping or doing anything, so my brother suggested that I did something and got close, so that's what I did.\n\nI was right, the girl was crying/struggling and the guy was trying to touch/kiss her. I had no idea of what to do, so I simply asked the guy in a menacing way to get away from her, he simply replied that she was his girlfriend and I should stay the fuck out. He swore at me, I swore back over and over, I couldn't tell if he was actually drunk or not. The girl looked better, but then said that it was fine, the guy then insists to get in a fight with me, which I honestly wasn't afraid to get into (Although I really don't know how to fight), I just wanted him to leave her alone. \n\nIn the girl screamed and told us to stop and then told me that she'll scream for help if she has to, so I decided to go back with my brother, but not before realizing that the place's security guards were right behind us. I simply told them \"She was being touched\" and left.\n\nI'm still thinking about it to this day and I don't understand if I did the right thing or if I should've left them alone like everyone else. Was I the asshole for intervening?",

      "description": "On a throwaway because I prefer keeping my personal life and shitposting for fake internet points separate. ALsO oN moBIlE rIghT NoW so that excuses me for any grammatical and structural errors, right?\n\nOkay, let's get ready to ramble and climb the great wall of text. To start this off I'm currently doing my final exams and hopefully graduating with good enough grades so I can apply to an university. Not such a big deal because of the mandatory military service my country has, which basically gives me an extra year to get those grades up if they aren't enough to get in since I won't be going there before that's out of the way. Me and one of my friends have planned for a while to go to the same university and rent a flat together, because we are both interested in the same field of study. The first couple of exams went pretty smoothly, and everything was going fine until my mother passed away last weekend.\n\nIt came out of nowhere, and I don't think my brain still wants to register it happened. Needless to say, this really brought down my motivation for the remaining exams which just happened to be the ones I needed for the field I'm applying to. But again, no big deal since I can just raise the grades and apply again next year with no drawbacks.\n\nTo the actual reason for posting this, my dad always appeared to be not too keen on the university I was considering with my pal, offering alternative unis and such, as were some of my other relatives. I didn't think about it too much back then, but now when all this is going down, we had a talk and he said he wished that I would consider not applying there.\n\nI think the points he made are reasonable, and finally he told me it would make him really happy if I applied to more nearby unis, especially a one near where he was going to be living, the capital city of my country. Again, I didnt say anything as I haven't even looked that place up because the required grades seemed tough and the location doesn't interest me at all. I brought it up later and he told be that if I wanted to make him happy I'd make it my second option.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I still put that far away uni as my first or second option, before the capital city uni? I know and he has told me many times that it's my choice but I still feel like a scumbag for thinking about it and upsetting him even more after recent events. On the other hand, I dont want to pull the rug from under my friend because we have been planning this as long as we've known what to do with our lives after graduating.\n\nNow, I want you to hold any NTAs off to say that my dad is a great man with no animosity between us. Even though my parents divorced ages ago, he's arranging most of the funeral services and the practical proceedings so I don't have to. I also believe that the reason behind his suggestions is that he would miss me and worry a lot about me living so far away after being with him and/or my mom the whole time before this.",

      "description": "I know how the title sounds. I had my daughter when I was 19 and raised her as a single father. It wasn't always easy and we had a lot of struggles, but we made it through. She's 14 now and we are extremely close. I met my girlfriend about 2 and a half years ago, and started becoming more heavily involved with her kids (12 and 15) about 6 months into our relationship as we both wanted to make sure we were solid before getting the kids involved. She's not considered mom by my daughter and her kids don't call me dad but we're still a unit and it works out very well.\n\nI love her sons, I'd protect them with my life and getting to know them has been amazing. They might not be \"my\" kids but I care about them and do my best to give them structure and a male figure in their lives. I also keep things as fair and balanced as I can, I don't allow my daughter to get away with things at their expense, or hang out with my daughter and exclude them. The get the same amount of gifts, we hang out the same amount of time (aside from when they go out with their mom) and so on. I've had heart-to-hearts with both of them and told both I loved them, I'd do anything for them.\n\nMy partner can have a a temper at times, and one of her less than great qualities is she'll go through topics until she finds one that upsets me enough to take the bait so she has an outlet for her frustration. She's been working on it and she's in therapy, but we had an incident recently. We had a disagreement about something and combined with a long day she was ready to argue, so she started cycling topics trying to get a rise from me. I waited for her to burn herself out, but she ended up accusing me of loving her kids less than I love my own daughter.\n\nThat got a reaction because I've never told her or her children that. There's no need, it serves no purpose and despite it being true I love all three and treat them no differently. Her own family commented on how close we are. I took the bait and we got into an argument, and she just would not let it go. This went on for upwards of an hour with me trying to explain how much I do love them when I should have just disengaged. It was late, I had work and I lost my patience so I finally told her yes, my daughter is the most important person in my life and yes, I do love her in a way that is unique to everyone else. I told her I love both boys as well and would never express my love for the kids differently, but I love my daughter deeper than I love anyone else as I'm sure she does her boys.\n\nI now hear about it every time we disagree. I feel like she's only using it now as leverage, because I know if she truly felt I didn't love the boys she wouldn't be with me. If ITA then I guess I'll have to be because I can't change how I feel, but I'd like to know if I'm the asshole because it'll change how I approach this situation with her and how I try to approach this going forward to keep the unit balanced.",

      "description": "Yesterday morning, some of my friends asked me to be their designated driver (for a party that happened later that night). They get drunk about once every other week, sometimes more. Anyway, I’m a pretty busy guy. I’m a premed major and I don’t drink at all. They usually have a designated driver (lets call him Jake). Jake is a chill guy, but he’s easily pushed around imo. He always drives for them, even at times when he doesn’t want to. Jake could not do it yesterday because he hasn’t been feeling good all week. Anyway, I declined as I didn’t want to do it, and we are all underage (all 19 or 20). Call me a loser or whatever, I don’t care. It’s still illegal. I told them that I am not their babysitter and that they are all adults. They can call an Uber or something. So one of them (we’ll call him Seth) gets extremely annoyed at me. He asked me what had to do yesterday night (obviously in terms of later that night). I told him the truth.  I said that I would be studying for finals next week and playing video games. He proceeds to call me a loser and says that I would rather play games than make sure they’re safe. He says that Jake “is always there for them”. I told him that I’m not spineless like Jake. The others chimed in and said that I had nothing better to do (they weren’t angry at all tho). I told them that I don’t owe them my time. So they went and got drunk. Seth ignored all my texts today. I told another group of friends and half said I should’ve just drove for them. The other half said that it was my choice. However, they all said that I was being uptight about the drinking age, and that other countries had much lower drinking ages. I replied with “well we don’t live in those countries so I do not care”.

Also live in different country, so different currencies.\n\nSo I decided to sign up for a month at a local gym, with instructor for 1,500. I didn't have money at the time but I really want to push myself out of my depression and do something. My then bf was supportive with the idea, so he withdrew at the ATM for me, and let me borrow 1,000 for the moment. (This is important)\n\nOn Monday at the gym, I signed up and paid 1,500 (One 1,000 paper and one 500 paper) because that's what I thought the payment would be, but the gym instructor (gym owner's daughter) told me it was 1,650. I told her I would pay the rest tomorrow. She took my payment and she instructed me. Everything was fine for the day.\n\nI wasn't able to go back on Tuesday because my whole body was sore.\n\nOn Wednesday, when I was about to pay the rest, she told me the 1,000 paper I gave her was torn. She said I should pay her again because she wouldn't accept it. The paper I gave her was clean, no tears or vandals, and it's crispy because it was fresh from the bank/ATM. What she gave me was an old, wrinkly, vandalised paper (stamped with red ink) with rat bites at the sides.\n\nI asked her if she was sure this is the money I gave her, because I SURE AM this isn't it. She said she is sure, because I'm the only one who paid her that amount of money that day. Bells in my head were alarming, and I knew something was up. It was so hard to act calm while full of suspicions, but I still managed to finish the training calmly.\n\nI talked to her again after the training. She was mildly offended because she said I was implying that she is lying. I told her that it's impossible this is the paper I gave her, because that was fresh from the bank. She said it's my fault because when I gave her my money, it was folded so she didn't see it. This pissed me off. She then kept blaming it's my fault, it's my fault, and this pushed me off the edge.\n\n\"WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD FIRST CHECK THE MONEY YOUR CLIENT GIVES YOU BEFORE ACCEPTING THEM?!\" I told her, which made her mad telling me I shouldn't shout at her. I said she should stop lying to my face, and I want my money back. She gave me three 500 papers and I checked all of them just to be sure before leaving the place. AITAH?\n\n\nTLDR: Gym instructor was trying to scam me by giving me different money and blamed me because she did not check what I gave her.",

      "title": "AITA for asking my boyfriend for transparency",
      "description": "I (F27) and my partner (M38) have been together off and on for almost 3 years. We've been living together for the past 10 months. He's a private person, not one to be forthcoming with information or give a lot of detail about things. \n\nHe's quite guarded with his computer and is on it pretty much all of his waking hours. He takes it with him into the bathroom when he showers. I know that it's off-limits for me. \n\nI know that he's close to some of his exes. This doesn't bother me. He talks about them from time to time. That's out in the open and is not an issue.\n\nI noticed over the past few years that he talks to a certain female friend often (see her name pop up on his chat and she posts on his Facebook), but he had only ever mentioned her name to me once (a year ago when she came to visit him overseas and he told me his \"friend\" was coming). \n\nI recently worked up the courage to ask who she was (I felt there was something off since he never mentioned her, but seemed to talk to her several times a day), and he said she was an ex. He said he was also talking with 2 other exes (whose names I had never heard prior to last night), and that he spoke with them a few times a week. I asked if they knew he was living with someone, and he \"is pretty sure they do, yeah.\" But also said that he doesn't talk about me as a rule because he feels that relationship things should be kept private. \n\nI don't feel jealous. But I DO feel a bit weirded out that he hid this, and that they might not be aware that he's in a relationship. He said their conversations were sometimes flirtatious, but nothing more. It seems clear that some of these women are still interested in him.\n\nWhen I told him I felt it was weird that he kept it secret, he got upset and accused me of wanting to control his life and have him \"report to me.\" He sees this as a violation of his privacy and autonomy. I see it as a natural extension of being in a relationship (I'm friendly with my exes but always give him a heads up if I feel like something could be interpreted as less than innocent. I just want the same courtesy in return.)\n\nHe seems to think I want to strip him of his individuality (I don't want him to stop talking to these people. In fact, I encourage him to continue to do so because he's a bit closed off emotionally and needs close friends he can confide in.). I just would rather he be open and not hide stuff.\n\nI should add that he has a long history of open relationships that had \"don't ask, don't tell\" policies. We are in a monogamous relationship and I want him to be a bit more aware that his overstepping bounds with other people would be hurtful.\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend hid the fact that he has been talking to several exes multiple times a week over the past several years. When I asked him to be more open and let me know about this kind of thing in the future, he accused me of trying to control his life and take away his privacy.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I work at a company that drives to different clients to service equipment. I work with Mike (fake name). Mike is a new hire who comes with me to everything I do. All of the techs in our company are under our manager John (fake name). Thus I don't really have any \"authority\" to tell Mike what to do, but he'll still listen to me.\n\nA store's fan was not working. After we isolated the problem to the fan itself, I told Mike to get the step ladder. In case you don't know, when you are on a step ladder, you're not supposed to stand on the top two steps. You're also not supposed to overreach. People break both of those rules regularly, almost always without injury. I was at the highest safe step and I could barely reach the fan. I would have had to break one of those rules to access it.\n\nI called John.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Hey John, I'm at [store] with Mike and we need the bigger ladder.\"\n\n&gt; John: \"The one in your truck should be fine.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"It's not.\"\n\n&gt; John: \"Did you go all the way up?\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"I went as far up as I am supposed to go. I can't reach it safely from there.\"\n\n&gt; John: \"For fuck's sake, u/AdorablePreference. Let me speak to Mike.\"\n\nHe apparently told Mike to \"just fucking do it.\" Mike wanted to do it. I just said \"no you're not\" and I took the ladder down. Long story short, John drove over to fix it himself (in the unsafe way) as Mike and I watched.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\ntldr I defied my boss because of a possibly unnecessary safety rule. I also brought another employee into the conflict.",

This girl was very vulnerable and was basically offering sex to literally anyone who took her home. I talked her away from a group of men and said I would take her to my nearby home just so I could get her out of there. She agreed but I walked her straight to the nearest taxi depot and put her in a taxi to her home city. I think I have done the right thing but I can't stop thinking if she is Ok and if I done enough.

      "title": "AITA for asking for a blowjob from my gf and making our relationship all about sex?",
      "description": "A little background. I'm a 23 year old male and my gf (19f) we used to be pretty sexually active. Sex almost every day. We both have very high sex drives. It's one of the reasons I think we fit so perfect together. She is my only partner to have ever really initiated our intimate times as much as I'd like. We've been dating 6 months. I know sex usually dies down (at least in my experience) after the \"honeymoon\" phase in relationships. We've started too, we only get intimate around 3 times a week now, if i'm lucky. But last night she told me she thinks we have sex too much and it might not be healthy for our relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer sexual history which influences some of my thoughts. She started having actual penetrative sex in the last 2 years. She's only had 3 partners but Her and her previous bf did oral on each other for for years. As well as she's performed oral on several other men, totaling up to above 7 guys, before I told her I was okay not knowing so much detail. The oral detail does hit a sore spot with me, but I did ask her about her past history. I've had 7 sexual partners but only 1 of them has ever gone down on me, so it's definitely more of an intimate pleasure for me. Personally I feel like going down on your partner is 100% about the recipient and that might be why I feel so different about it. I've brought up my feelings on this several times and she understands it. She's even told me how she loves giving blowjobs. However in our time dating she has only performed oral on me a hand full of times, less than the number of men she has done it to.  I know this shouldn't upset me but every time I ask or bring up the possibility of it happening, it never happens. At the most she'll just initiate sex which I know she loves because she gets something out of it. Our argument started when I tried again to ask for some special attention to myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other night she came over very sore after a workout. I gave her a very lengthy massage without the intention of repayment. She kept insisting even offering money at one point. So I suggested maybe later when she wasn't tired we could think of something. The next day she brought up again how nice the massage was and she said she really owed me. I knew exactly how the next conversation would go but still took my shot. I gathered my courage and carefully suggested that a blowjob would be more than a repayment and I would actually love it. This sparked her stating she feels we have sex too much. This revealed some more issues. She feels I'll get bored of her. Also that our relationship shouldn't depend on sex. I told her I don't see myself getting bored and that I feel sex is a pretty important part of relationships. I did my best to delicately bring up how it's been over 3 months since she reciprocated any oral. Which she really didn't like to hear because now she feels I keep tabs how much we have sex. Thus furthering her point of us(me) relying on sex as a relationship crutch. I tried to defend my point that I don't use her for sex, that I just really love the bond it creates between us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we're in an argument over this. I am really tired of trying to navigate this discussion with her. I have just moved on and stopped talking about it. I really don't want to be seen as the guy that has to have sex all the time. At the same time I definitely feel that I need that level of intimacy and release. It is a huge driving force for me, and I try to be as subtle as I can about it. Going so far as to literally never initiate it as to not offend her. Am I so wrong to ask for a blowjob one time? I know she's pretty familiar with giving them. That's a dick thing to say, I know. But it just never happens to me. I know it's not fair to compare past histories with current situations but I'm not asking for anything out of her comfort zone. I would just love some attention without me being the guy who has to be sexually stimulated all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I love having sex more than the next guy but am dealing with the gradual decline of my relationships sex life; coupled with the fact that I can't negotiate a reciprocating act of felatio for my life. When I asked for a blowjob I started an argument which lead to her thinking all I want is sex. I know if I try to make my point more clear I'll be labeled more of a sex fiend. All I can do is sit back and watch my relationship decline. ",

      "description": "A friend of mine from New England is coming to visit me in Florida in about a week. He’ll be here for 5 days (Friday morning through Tuesday evening), most of which we plan to spend together catching up and hanging out. He’s expressed that I’m the main reason he’s coming to visit, and that he’d like to spend as much time with me as possible while here. A few of the days he’s visiting I’ll have to work, and I set aside about 2 hours every day for a work out. He’s aware of both of these limitations and has told me he’s ok with them. What I’m wondering, though, is whether or not I would be an asshole if I cut into the potential time we could have to hang out in order to go on a date with a guy I’m seeing. We’ve been dating for about 3 months and it’s going pretty well. Lately, though, we haven’t had much of a chance to see one another due to work, sickness, and the holidays. We are planning to get together before my friend visits. However, due to my friend’s visit we won’t be able to see each other for another 2 weeks in between our upcoming date and the next date. I’d like to avoid this, because I really want to get to know this guy I’m seeing better and another 2 week break isn’t exactly great for a budding relationship, but I also don’t want to be an asshole to my friend who is traveling a long way to visit me. To clarify, if I did decide to meet up with the guy I’m seeing, it would likely be in the evening for a few hours, 4 tops. Would I be an asshole if I saw him while my friend is visiting me? ",

      "description": "So I'm just writing this cuz I'm fuming atm and wanna see if I'm actually in the wrong. This just happened today. \n\nContext:in my country there's this week that happens once a year called \"Alternative Week\" in which you do anything else that's not school. And most classes go on a 2-3 days trips during this week. Our teacher wants us all (we're 35 in my class) to go to \"unite the class\"\n\nMy class is formed of like 6 genuinely nice people(of which I hang out with one cuz I don't really have things in common with the others),nice girls that gossip all the time but won't bother you (14), entitled cunts (4)and the fucking zoo animals (10).(I didn't add myself cuz I'm the one writing the story)\n\nPersonally I really can't stand this class. As a bi, non-religious person that doesn't bind to gender rules and gender stereotypes that my classmates live by (even the \"girls are weaker and dumber and only made to pop uglies and cook\" bullshit) the mere thought of having to spend more time than necessary(school hours) with overly religious, homophobic af people it's uncomfortable and down right scary. So I decline any possible interaction that isn't school related.\n\nMost of the people that want to go are the zoo animals and entitled cunts. And from the nice people only a few that I don't have anything in common with. Anyone that I could hang out with doesn't want to go and made up a reason why they won't go.\n\nI'm a straightforward person so when I was asked today by my teacher if I want to go I simply answered \"no.I don't want to\". She got extremely pissed saying \"that I don't have any reason not to\" and that I shouldn't give her this kind of attitude (which I wasn't but ok) and that she knows I don't have any type of home situation or trouble and that she doesn't want this trip either but she wants the class to be united and we shouldn't be selfish and just go since after that week we'll be on holiday. I didn't say anything else besides that \"just like last year I'll just come to school instead\" and she let me be for a while saying that if there's something personal we can just tell her in particular. \n\nNow at the end of the day (we had last class with her too) while I was packing up my things she stopped me (there were still kids in class otherwise I would've just told her why not) and asked me if there really is a reason for me not to want to. I said yes there is and when asked if I can tell her (all the classmates were looking at me at this point which made me very uncomfortable) and I said \"not now\". She then asked if I can tell her in particular of which I said \"yes\" (I really wanted to leave) she then gave me more lectures about attitude and I just apologized and saying \"have a good day\"and left.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation for not wanting to go on a trip with classmates i cant stand and that make me extremely uncomfortable even tho it would make the teacher happy? (trip is just 2 days)",

      "description": "First, I have to say we both love playing video games. We have much of them, we enjoy it, it's our hobby. My bf (of 7 years, living together) has a friend, where he goes to over night sometimes, where they play together, drink alcohol etc. That's okay with me. I don't like the guy, but it's not my friend, it's his. \n\nNow the situation is, i lost my job because of epilepsy. I try do build my own Business at this time, it goes pretty well, but I don't earn as much money as in my old job. I often said I'm sorry, and I am working for more money. He always told me, he's okay with that, we have our money together, it's not important who earned it. \nWhen he was in uni, I was the one who got the only money. So basically he does the same thing I did, both of us didn't bother, we love each other.\n\nNow video games are pretty expensive. Because he wants to play with his friend, he bought many games earlier, and when his friend didn't want to play it, he mostly didn't play it alone anymore. I never loved that, but I kind of unterstood him - he wanted fun time with a friend. Now we have almost no money left because of our situation, and today he asked me, if he can buy a new game to play it with his friend when he stays there next week. It would cost almost all the money I left for food, so I said no, and that I would be glad if he wouldn't run after others who have more money. I felt like this playing time is more important then eating, and I almost exploded. This month we bought 2 games already. And this isn't even one he wanted to have in first place. He just wants it, because his friend said that. I always wanted a man with whom I can have kids, house, family. I don't feel like that about him now. \n\nBUT he earned the money. Yes, I did the same thing for him for a few years, but I never wanted to buy things I can't afford. So AITA for Not letting him buy it?",

      "title": "AITA for thinking my parents should fix the mistake they made while choosing a piano?",
      "description": "Note: format may be bad, I'm on mobile.\n\nFor a bit of pretext:\nI've been practicing piano for about 8 years now and take it VERY seriously. I'm a freshman at an art school where I study with a teacher there (he's great). Clearly, I need a functional piano to get things done.\n\nA few months ago, they decided to replace the perfectly acceptable upright we had with a heavily used baby grand. I had not asked for a new piano. I was perfectly content with the one I had, actually. However, this new piano was absolute *shit*. They hadn't asked me if I wanted the piano, or even told me they would be getting a new one. If they had just let me try the piano before spending $500 to move it in, I would have told them not to do it in a heartbeat.\n\nHowever, now the piano is in our house. I can't practice on this thing (just want to emphasize how shitty it is) and my parents have this conception that they can fix it using *youtube tutorials*. Personally, I think it would be cheaper and easier to just get a new one, but I digress.\n\nMy problem here is that I really don't think they can do it. I've made the metaphor that they're trying to do brain surgery by youtube tutorial, and while it's a bit over the top, I think it encompasses my point well.\n\nMy other main problem is that, even though they caused the problem, they expect me to actively search online for parts we need. Now, I'm no piano technician, but I think we need way more than a few spare parts. Like, maybe a whole restoration. Which, professionally done, can be upwards of *$15,000*. We don't have that kind of money, which is why they want to do it themselves.\n\nI still think that it would be cheaper to just get a new piano, but whatever.\n\nNow, as I said before, I take piano very seriously. So, not having a usable piano for 5 months with no effort to solve the problem is seriously detrimental to not just my future, but my mental wellbeing. My parents don't think it's as serious as I say it is, but I've actually felt more depressed in recent months than usual. Not to mention my parents randomly cut me off from my piano teacher 2 months ago and just made efforts to get a new one ***TODAY***. \n\nHowever, I do feel like I'm demanding a bit much of them to completely fix the problem themselves, and I feel I haven't fully appreciated the sentiment enough. But, it's kinda hard to be grateful when you're fucking depressed because you can't do one of the only things in life that bring you joy.\n\nSo, AITA? I know I portray it as me definitely thinking I'm not the asshole, but I have been pretty rude to my parents about it, even though they were just trying to be nice.\n\ntl;dr: my parents replaced my acceptable piano with a crappy one without telling me and think I should help them fix it and that I'm not appreciate enough. I take piano seriously and this seriously affects my life. AITA?",

It turns out most of the girls have plans to watch the Grinch on Friday, so they declined (about 5 people). So I suggested having a guys-night on Friday and watching Spiderman then, since the girls are having themselves a girls-night. \n\nOne of the girls then said she wants to join as well, to which I asked her if she's not joining the girls to watch the Grinch. She said she is and this is where things escalated. \n\nI suggested she should go watch Spiderman with the others (that can't join on Friday) another time. I said not every activity  needs to include everyone anyway and that they are watching a movie without us aswell. I also explained it  doesn't make sense to reschedule the people that would like to join on Friday for Spiderman, just because shed like to watch it as well. Again, I said, she's watching a movie anyway so why shouldn't we be able to watch a movie aswell. Then another friend, that is going to watch the Grinch, explained shed also like to watch Spiderman. Additionally another guy friend then suggested watching another movie on Friday and watching Spiderman together with the girls. \n\nTo which another guy-friend replied that would be enough people to go watch it on your own another time and leave the people who want to watch Spiderman on Friday alone. They then said we should just wait two days and watch Spiderman with them to which I replied this:\n\n \"So let me get this straight and feel free to correct me but you are complaining that we want to go watch a movie on Friday without you guys, when on that same Friday you are literally also watching a movie, that you did not ask anyone else about? We are not taking away your right to go watch Spiderman, please make me understand. It's really nice that you want to spend so much time with me and (friend) and (friend) but you can go watch it on your own or take the people who haven't watched it yet.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for telling my friends to watch Spiderman without me (and some others) another time, when they're going to watch the Grinch that same day without us?",

      "description": "Some background, I am 24M, my father 64M, my mother 62F, my sister 26F. \n\nMy father has always been a disciplinary figure in mine and my sister's life over a more fatherly one. He retired at 40 to be a stay at home dad, while my mom worked to provide for us. My father had a pension and savings, so there's never been stress about which parent works or whatnot. My dad didn't actually DO much with us kids, I would later learn he smoked a lot of weed in secret in the garage (mom knew, and it was 'for pain' from his working years, as he said, but I can tell now it was also for fun) and kept busy in the garage with home projects. \n\nMy dad would throw out 3 or 4 punishments at a time for anything we'd do wrong (no TV, no games, can't leave your room, bed at 7:00pm) *until our behaviour improved* (read: goalposts can move anytime, so fuck off and get comfortable wherever you fuck off to, kid). Basically I had no engagement from him and a fat punishment when I, a bored kid in the country steps out of line. My mom and I became much more close, and my father laments his lack of a relationship with his son, despite the fact that my entire childhood, we never did a damn thing together except for family vacation (which he'd insist we go to his cottage the whole summer, try keeping friends like that). I think we went to the movies 3 times between me being born and moving out in Feb of this year.\n\nI've always liked my mom more as a result, we've talked about my issues with how he acts, and my dad refuses to change, refuses to treat me like I'm an adult, and anything I object to in his behavior is caused by me for having an attitude. Mom used to come home and correct the overpunishment from my father, and my dad has eternally blamed her for the kids' *lack of respect* for him, when he's just been rude and awful to us.\n\nThis has gone on my entire life. My dad and mom wanted me to commute to school while I was in 2yr college and 4yr uni, so I would be supported during it, and after endless fights, on my last semester of uni, my father told me that I was ruining his life and his marriage, and he hoped I was happy for doing this. After \nthis, he returned upstairs to tell my mother he loved her, told my sister he loved her, and then tried to hang himself in the garage with belts I'd bought him for past birthdays.\n\nI moved out immidiately, and stopped talking to him regularly until April. It was my last semester of school and I barely made through amidst the pressure and him existing. After all the years of being treated like a little kid, punished harshly my entire childhood, told how I feel about the way he talks down to me is my fault, I don't want anymore to do with him. There are talks of family therapy, and frankly, I think me going to therapy with him would be like me going to therapy with a pack of cigarettes to try and work things out between us. It's not what you're supposed to do, you just get away from the cancer that's killing you.\n\nAm I the asshole? I actually just got out of a fight so I'm a little scrambled. If there's necessary info missing before a verdict can be found, let me know.",

      "description": "Me along with 5 of my friends once was very close and we can talk about anything together. The circle was kind of being held together by me and I knew if I left then the circle is going to vanish sooner or later. Albeit, we all had fun in that circle, and I never would have thought we would split before graduating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeday near the winter holidays, we were eating lunch and talking stuff about Christmas dance parties, me and my friends never thought of going (we are homebodies). However, one of our friends, let's call him Ethan, starts talking about his friend and his friend’s girlfriend had invited him to one of the parties, and asked for our advice. Instead of giving advice, we started joking around where no one would dance with him at the dance party, and that his friend would just dance with his girlfriend, leaving him all alone standing at the dance floor like an idiot meanwhile suggesting us to have a gathering of our own the same day instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe thought it was a harmless joke and we would just start planning the gathering together, but Ethan took the joke very seriously, and said things like this… (all in order)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n “I was asking for advice and all you guys are doing is mocking me.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“If you guys are just going to joke around and not give alternatives of what we are going to do, I would rather just go to the party alone.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where I realized that he was actually mad, but I thought we already suggested that we have a gathering of our own. So I tried to relieve him by saying it again, I didn’t even get to finish the sentence though, he interrupted me and said...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n “Do you guys see even see me as a friend? Cause I don’t anymore.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where I got really pissed, I never would say things like this even if I am really mad, especially not because of a joke. I was holding my anger in though, as everybody was leaving after a long awkward silence (I can tell they were disappointed too), I was the last to leave. I just said “Me neither.” then left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has been about 4 months since then, I never gathered with them anymore, although I missed the times that we spent together, I am still mad about Ethan’s words. My 5 other friends seem to have stopped gathering as well, though I have talked to the other 4 and they have already forgiven him. Sometimes I ask myself if I am too stingy and if I am the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for ending a friend circle because of one single conversation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. My mother tongue is Cantonese, so the situation might be lost in translation. I tried my best and wish it is understandable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Lets start with the background that led to this issue then some context.  My girlfriend was talking to a friend at work yesterday and discovered that he grows weed at home.  She loves plants in general so this got her excited about idea of growing some at home herself and spent the whole day talking about it and getting more and more excited until she ordered some seeds online from overseas and excitedly told me about it.  My reply to her said I was worried that it would only take one nosy neighbor to see something dodgy over a fence or overhear a conversation and we could be in a lot of trouble and that I was not comfortable with the risks.  I didn't hear back from her for a while until she responded to say she was feeling sick which is what happens to her when she gets a hit of depression / anxiety which had happened because of my reply.  This eventually led to an argument when we both got home from work.  We both got emotional and we couldn't reach a mutual understanding and things are still tense between us today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom her point of view, I was being overly and unnecessarily negative towards something that she was excited about and this had made feel feel miserable and made her regret sharing something with me.  Admittedly, I do have a habit of doing this as it has happened in the past that I have acted negatively about things that I think are stupid that she is excited about.  However, I insisted that this is a different case because it's not just another hobby she wants to pick up, it's actually something that is illegal and worst case if we get caught due to factors outside out control it could cost me my government job, could violate the terms of the lease on our rental house and get us kicked out, as well as fines or prison time in an extreme case.  From my side of things, I feel like she is dismissing the risks and the fact that it's illegal because \"we won't get caught\" or because she learned about it from someone who hasn't been caught but she has also made me feel like I'm the one who is wrong and like I'm overreacting about the risk and looking at worst case rather than what is realistic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my country, possession is still illegal unless you have a prescription from a doctor for medicinal use and cultivation is illegal unless you have a license to do so.  In my state in particular, possession under 15g as a first offense and for personal use typically gets you a mark on your criminal record and a formal caution but cultivation is considered alot more serious as it often gets treated as though you have intention to supply and depending on the information I find, the maximum charge could be anywhere from 2 - 10 years prison and $2200 - $11000 in fines (as per information I found from various local law firms about drug charges).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not backing down on my stance that I am not comfortable growing weed in our house?",

She basically thinks that's she's superior to me because of her education level. Last night we were both at my GF's place and we were talking about provinical politics in Ontario (Basically about Doug Ford if you know him) and she kept on saying she has more education than me so is smarter and her opinions are more valid. I told her to shut the fuck up because her masters in Public Policy is gonna get her a job at starbucks only.\n\nShe started to call me an asshole and douche and now my gf is hurt because they are in the same program. \n\nAITA?",

The longer than I am in this house with her I am trying *really really hard* not to hate her. She is constantly being extremely rude to me and starts yelling at me for no reason. She insults me and tells me I'm a bitch, nobody cares about me and that I'm a mistake because I wasn't planned and she was. When we are at family gatherings she likes to randomly announce that I'm flat chested (32B and proud) in front of my family and continue to laugh at me. When I am going out somewhere nice with my boyfriend she yells, calls me fat (I have a thin loli body), and insults me all the way out the door. If I go shopping, she throws my items out of the bags and yells at me \"I thought you said you were broke?\" and continues to yell about how I should quit school and get a \"real\" job (I work at a walgreens part time while in college). She has told me multiple times that she hates me. She wishes I would have an accident and wants bad things to happen to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only does she disrespect me but she constantly yells at my parents. Cursing out my mom because she gave her egg whites instead of just the egg yolk. Calling her poor, insulting her, and saying she makes \"poor people food\" when she makes Mexican dishes for dinner (we are mexican/chinese). My parents were on the poorer side when they got married but we now live comfortably and I've had many people tell us we have a nice house. She cusses out my dad when she wants him to buy something expensive and he says no because she has a good job and is living rent free, but eventually gives in because he can't handle it anymore.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't be nice to her anymore. She tries to act like everything is fine and tries being friendly with me the next day, *but i just can't.* She frustrates me so much I'm no longer nice to her.  I don't have conversations with her. Shes tries coming into my room and sitting on my bed to \"spend time with me\" but I ask her to leave or I leave my own room. She tries to go out  to eat with me but I tell her no, because 15 minutes into the lunch she will begin to yell at me again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents tell me I am in the wrong for not letting it go and being rude back. That I should just be quiet and take it because \"She is your sister.\"\n\nI just need to know... am I the asshole for not dropping it and being rude back? ",

      "description": "I pay in cash a lot of the time, and I like to avoid having any more than 5 singles in my wallet at a time, so I strategically give the cashier more dollar bills than necessary to cover the total, with the intention that my change will come out to $5.XX or $10.XX. This lets me get a larger denomination than one dollar bills so I’m not walking around with a bulging wallet that makes me look like I just robbed a strip club or a lemonade stand.\n\nFor several weeks this practice worked fine until one night a cashier assumed that I was either drunk, high, or disabled when I handed her a twenty-dollar bill and a one-dollar bill. I think in her mind, I was just shoving everything I had into her hands as if to say “Is this enough? Did I hand you enough paper to equals $15.81, pretty lady?” so she calmly handed the one-dollar bill back to me and gave me a very awkward $4.19 in change, consisting of no less than ten individual pieces of U.S. currency.\n\nNow I didn’t want to make a scene then, but now every time I go to check out, I green-light my practice by first asking something like “if I hand you twelve dollars, will you understand what I am trying to accomplish even though ten would be enough to cover the total?” and they usually say yes. But occasionally people will say “what?” so I have to kinda treat them like it’s a stickup and say “here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to hand you a twenty-dollar bill, a ten-dollar bill, and three one-dollar bills. You’re going to take the money and type in *three three point zero zero* into the cash register and hit enter. My change is going to come to five dollars and ten cents, so you’re going to hand me a five-dollar bill and a dime. Ok?” and I occasionally get nasty looks from the cashiers or other customers.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to get burned again?",

      "description": "My friends and I decided to hang out with my other friend (lets call him K) and his friends a few years ago. While we were eating food, K I assume remembered how he had brought up a question I never answered a couple days back. So while I was busy examining a tree because I was ignored, he says. “Hey J, are you gay?” Everyone was looking at me and I said “N-No.” Embarrassed by the fact I was bisexual.\n\nI had problems with my sexuality a few months before and was afraid in what would happen if I told them. After I lied saying I wasn’t he responded by saying I was smiling. I had enough of that shit and said I had to go to the bathroom.\n\nI went to the bathroom and went home, avoiding the issue, or I fucking thought until they brought it up again. I was pissed and simply said “I dont know.” Now looking back that was about the dumbest response and I should have just confessed that I was bisexual. They started laughing and asked how I didn’t know, I was pissed enough and just about ready to explode with anger.\n\nI went over to a bench saying I found something, called my best friend, went back and said she needed me at her house, and left.\n\nSo, AITA for being completely pissed and not talking to them for the next couple of months?",

She told me, if you want the dog out then you go take him out. I told her I was tired from the night before and wanted to sleep. She rolled her eyes at me and then took the dog out.\n\nLater when I got up I told her I didn't appreciate her attitude, she told me, don't boss me around, I told her I didn't but it would've been nice for her to do that for me without complaining. She told me, you are picking on me and I said I'm not but she told me she was going to work and left and didn't let me defend myself.\n\nI come home tonight and she made soup for dinner knowing that I don't like soup. I asked why she didn't make chicken like we agreed we'd have for Valentine's Day and she told me she didn't have all the ingredients. I asked why she didn't go to the store and she cried and told me, you always criticize me (not true). I told her I support you and help you with things all the time and listen to you when you have a hard day, so why are you being difficult and making this a big thing. She told me, eat the soup or eat nothing. I told her she was treating me like a child, she told me, you're acting like a child for picking a fight on Valentine's Day. I told her I wasn't picking a fight, she blew up over small things.\n\nAm I wrong?",

      "description": "So I have/had this friend that I got along pretty well with and she just so happens to sorta be my type and I developed a decent sized crush on her. Only problem is that she had a boyfriend while we were friends, which was fine, I was ok with being friends. Anyway I had some people round about 3-4 months ago for predrinks before town, and she came and met some of my friends and we all got drunk and had a good time. She gave me lifts a couple of times, just me and her, and I helped her pick up her car because her bfs car was broken down. Anyway about a month and a half after predrinks she won't reply to my messages I just sense something is up, but don't confront her. So I find out a few weeks later that she told my other friend that one of my mates told her I was trying to get in her pants (I wasn't), I simply told them I was attracted to her etc. Anyway that was why she wasn't talking to me and she said she'd be angry if I tried to talk to her about it. A few days ago I noticed she deleted me off FB and o just got really mad (kinda unreasonably) when I didn't really care when we stopped being friends cause it was getting hard liking a girl that had a bf. Anyway I rang my friend and I said I was gonna confront her cause I was really mad and she said not to cause she just broke up with her bf. I was oddly sympathetic, but couldn't hold back the urge to message her so I just sent something short and nice explaining myself and she didn't respond. I never found out which one of my mates told her what she claimed they did.\n\nDid I do something wrong here? I'm still kinda angry about the whole situation, I just wish she'd at least explain herself or say she's not interested in me like that. We got along quite well TBH, and our mutual friend even told me she thought that this other girl would hook up with me, and another mutual friend has made comments too.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I was in the only bathroom at a coffee shop, in the process of relieving myself (#2), when an extremely rude elderly woman interrupted my relative peace.  Extensive jiggling of the doorknob went on despite the fact that the door was locked and the “occupied” sign was clearly displayed.  Some time passes, and I hear her speaking very loudly to another person in line (knowing I can hear her), complaining, “This person has been in here since the 1930’s!”, followed by a lot more jiggling.  That was a tremendous exaggeration, as I had been moving as fast as I could.\n\nHowever, I decided to take the woman at her word and assume that this was a true emergency; why else would someone be so overly dramatic?  I decided that in order to ensure she be able to relieve herself ASAP and prevent an emergency situation, I must cut as many corners as possible.  I didn’t flush the EXTREMELY large object left behind in the toilet, as I know stopping to flush would take up needless time and delay her from getting in, which she had made very clear she was desperate to do.  As I relieved myself the other way (#1) before heading out, I did so very quickly and thus sloppily (as I needed to hurry for her!) and did not wipe off the toilet or put down the seat afterwards; doing all this would also delay her wish of having me out of the bathroom.  \n\nI exited the bathroom, greeted by her scowl, and just about ten seconds after she went inside, I heard her storm back out.  She walked up to me and gave me quite the barrage of obscenities for the mess I had left her.  I can understand that what I left behind was a less than lovely sight, but shouldn’t she be **happy** with me that I attended to her wishes and got the hell out of that bathroom as quickly as I could?  If you make so clear you need to use the bathroom desperately, isn’t it sort of ridiculous to complain that its previous user didn’t spend an eternity getting it in tip top shape?  Some people are just never happy, I guess.",

      "description": "We have five month old twins who still aren’t sleeping through the night. I’m staying at home until they start going to school, and my husband has a job where he is very busy February-April. The situation with both of our moms isn’t ideal. My mom: not sure if she’s one of those narcissistic moms, but definitely super defensive, can be very selfish. She is the only reason I have felt upset and alone since having the twins because of this behavior. His mom: my husband and I had a mild falling out with his parents for about a year before we had the twins. Things have been better since, but before they just weren’t very supportive when we needed their help, and they are extremely overbearing, impulsive people. \nNeedless to say, I would rather just have my husband and I handle our babies in a caregiver role. I give his mom credit for trying to make an effort to do better with respecting our boundaries, but I guess I’m just not over the years of craziness prior to this. My husband thinks that since he’s busy at work, that asking our moms for help should be my first option. I’ve agreed that I need to suck it up during this time, so I went to my moms for a week a handful of times, and it just doesn’t fully work out. There’s tension, she questions everything I do with the babies, it’s just miserable overall. His mom works, so she would only be able to help in the evenings for a few hours anyway. \nI try my best to do it all on my own, but every once in a while I don’t get enough sleep and need a break. This is when my husband rolls his eyes that he has to rearrange things at work and help me more when I really don’t want to have our moms help. So, am I the asshole for being stubborn on this?",

      "description": "I (F22) bought a ticket to see a lesser known band I really like a few months ago. I showed my friend (M21) this band awhile ago, and he liked their stuff. \n\nWhen I originally bought my ticket for the show, we did not discuss going together. I had simply said I bought a ticket for it. Fast forward to last week. My friend asked me if I was still going to the concert. I replied that I was, and I had bought M&amp;G as well. He then proceeds to tell me that he had bought a ticket and \"totally forgot about it\". He said that upon look for another ticket in his e-mail, he found that he had bought a ticket for the show. He told me \"So I'll see you there?\"\n\nThis made me uncomfortable for a couple of reasons. One, I am having a hard time believing he forgot he bought a ticket. Because it is a band he knows I like and knew I bought a ticket for, I find it hard to believe he wouldn't have told me when he bought it. It also sold out within the first week, so it happened fairly soon after I got mine. \n\nAnother reason is that he has done this to me before. I bought a ticket for myself to see a band I liked, and while I was on my way to the venue, he texted me to tell me he was in line. I had no idea he was going, and I ended up having to stand with him the whole concert. When the concert ended, I was ready to Uber home, and he talked me up for an hour. \n\nI personally prefer going to concerts alone; I feel like I can be more carefree and when the artists mean a lot to me, it is sort of an emotional experience I feel uncomfortable sharing with others. I don't have to worry about being judged, and even if I feel my friends wouldn't judge me, it is a personal experience for me. \n\nObviously I don't believe the solution is telling him he can't go to shows for bands I like. That would be completely unfair and entitled to suggest he couldn't. However, these shows aren't huge. I can't really avoid him if I wanted to, and I don't know if I am an asshole for thinking I shouldn't have to see a concert with someone just because they bought a ticket as well?\n\nFor context, I do not believe this has anything to do with romantic feelings. We don't hangout often, and mostly communicate over text. ",

      "description": "  \n\nTLDR: friends for almost 25 years, he wasn’t reciprocating, so I ghosted him.\n\nI ghosted him almost 15 years ago. Now I'm feeling bad about it.\n\nWe were best mates from the age of 13. We did everything together: school, weekends, nights out, holidays, car renovations, gaming, sporting events, surfing etc. He once said my best trait was loyalty. He apologised once for being judgemental about my prior girlfriends; I thanked him. We had a \"bro code\" never to let a girl (or woman) ruin the friendship. It never did. He was a great friend and I loved his company.\n\nIt took years to realise it was a one-sided friendship where I was making more effort. I still made the effort to see him every week, even after he was married. She was a client of mine &amp; also a friend, &amp; we previously shared an office. Examples: he came to my place maybe once for every 100 of my going to see him on the other side of the city (no exaggeration). I would initiate contact. I would pick him up. I had to make sure we had enough money to get a taxi home after a night out etc. I had his back.\n\nAfter our careers started we continued to have a games night at his place every week. Once I cooked too much dinner for myself and I drove it to his place so he and his wife could have a home made meal rather than a takeaway. There are plenty of examples where I made an effort and it wasn't reciprocated - not that I was counting for the first 20 something years. I prefer quality to quantity so what friends I have tend to be very good friend. I believe friends should be for life, but not living in each others pockets.\n\nAnyway, life got in the way and we got busy in our careers &amp; I hadn't seen him for maybe a month or 2 given my self employment work would regularly take me to other cities. I was in the city one day so I phoned him to have lunch given it was only a 10 minute walk for me. The conversation went like this (I'm Jim\\*, names changed):\n\n\\[Hey Fred it's Jim\n\nJim who?\n\nFred it's me, Jim\n\nOh...... Jim! I had completely forgotten about you\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's like you have been erased from my mind\n\nFred this isn't helping.  How about lunch?\\]\n\nWe didn't have lunch. He was too busy or some lame ass excuse.\n\nIt was my red pill moment &amp; after being frustrated with the friendship for maybe 2+ years, I realised what was happening &amp; this was the straw that broke the camel's back. I had put in a lot more effort &amp; it was never going to be appreciated/reciprocated. So I cut him &amp; his wife off from everything. Everything. No warning. She was a client &amp; I dropped her the next day. He tried to reach out to me a few days later &amp; I cut him off. Total radio silence for 15 years. I never told him why.\n\nYesterday I figured life was too short so I reached out via email and he responded.\n\nSo, am I the asshole? Should I explain or maybe apologise?",

      "description": "My wife and I are in an open marriage. I have two other partners, and my wife and I have a young child. \n\nLast night I was on a date with one of my partners while wife stayed home with child. My partner and I were cuddling between rounds when I got a call from my wife. She never calls or texts during my dates, so I figured it must be important and answered. She said that child was \"vomiting everywhere\" and there was a \"huge mess.\" She asked that I come home to help. I explained to my partner what was happening. We chatted for a little while (maybe 20-30 minutes), and then I headed home (a 40 minute drive).\n\nAfter I was in the car for a few minutes, my wife called. She asked where I was and how long ago I'd left my partner's place. Like an idiot, I lied and said I was almost home. She caught me in the lie and lost it. She hung up on me.\n\nWhen I got home, she was livid. She said that I violated the main rule of our agreement--that she and my child always come first. I explained that it would have been rude to my partner to just bail. She just stormed off and left me to finish cleaning vomit (child got the bookshelves good). Wife has cooled down some, but I can't decide whether or not I'm the asshole.\n\nSo, AITA for sticking around to chat for a few minutes instead of bailing on my partner?",

      "description": "Last night I was chatting to my girlfriend on the phone after she left the gym. She hadn't been there for about 8 months and is looking to get back in shape. I think she looks sexy as hell regardless, and tell her this all the time, but I'm supportive nonetheless.\n\nI asked her how the workout was, and how she was feeling, blah blah, and we got on to how, \"it was really great to see all her old friends again\". Then she made a comment about how \"Hot Tony\" was there, so I was slightly incredulous and repeated, \"Hot Tony?\" in a quizzical, slightly incredulous tone, that I *thought* implied I thought it was kind of uncool to call him that, at least to my face. She then said, \"Yeah, that's what we call him. And then he took his shirt off *unf*.\"\n\nI kind of let it slide, knowing she didn't mean anything by it. I trust her. But it's been bugging me all day, which I told her, both last night and today. She of course feels awful, assures me she didn't mean anything by it, that I'm the only guy she wants etc etc, and honestly I believe her, but I can't help feeling hurt by it.\n\nI'm in pretty good shape, if it matters, but I'm definitely not ripped either. I've explained to her that it was hurtful to hear her talk about another guy like that, and that it felt disrespectful for her to say that to me. I want to get over it, because I feel like I'm unfairly punishing her for it now that it's gone on this long, but I just can't get past it.\n\nSo, I know I'm not the asshole for being a little hurt at first, but AITA now that this is still an issue almost a full day later?",

At least thirty groups of very rich, privileged white girls skipped us. He's getting mad. I tell my boyfriend to let it go, because we will get into the club eventually. I didn't want to cause a scene, I wanted to just have a good time, without any fighting, at the club. Nothing good will come up from yelling at these girls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegardless, he starts yelling. I tell him to stop. The girls behind us start egging him on. I go to school with these people. I network with them. He doesn't because he doesn't network with them. I'm getting angry at him because I'm telling him to calm down, I don't want to make a scene with people who could (possibly) make/break a successful career for me. I tell him -- who gives a fuck, you aren't making a change now at the club why does it matter?! If you want change, make it count at the voting booth. Which he tells me is ridiculous. \"It's important to stand up for yourself.\" I understand that. But seriously?! At the club? Even the bouncer told him \"listen man, it's my job, I don't make the rules.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a minority, he is white. The girls behind us were white. Personally, I feel like I just know when you should and should not make scene. At the club -- it isn't important to make a scene.

I sometimes need her urgently and she still doesn't respond. Phone calls, SMS and Whatsapp messages, I can't reach her with nothing. And after that she appears out of nowhere and acts like nothing happened. When I ask her where she's been she told me she got busy with work and college and couldn't respond at all. (which I find very hard to believe because someone as phone bound as her couldn't hold out without her phone for even half a day).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat brought my blood pressure up is that she does this without warning, and I sometimes see her online on messenger/whatsapp that she was active not too long ago but still doesn't respond. I sometimes need her urgently (don't wanna go into detail about exactly what, but in my judgement it's something that should be adressed quickly and many times were in a bad situation because of her lack of response). I'm not controlling and don't care much about response time, I myself find responding to her every few hours if it's something unimportant because I also have my own work, but whenever she needed me and called me I was available for her 99% of the time even though I am on my phone a lot less than her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the 10th time of her doing it in the past 6 months I told her she should atleast give me a warning or something because I know she is straight up ignoring me because I see when she is online but she either ignores my request or tells me I'm controlling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?

      "description": "Sorry yall, this'll be a long one.\n\nMy brother is now 33 and i'm 29. We both suffer from severe mental illnesses. \n\nMy brother is previously divorced, and is now remarried with 3 kids. My brother does not work and has been applying for disability for about 2 years now. My parents helped my brother through his divorce to ensured he got full custody of their grandson. He's lived with them for most of his life and they are VERY attached to his kids, and have taken a huge part in raising them.  They purchased all christmas gifts for the grandkids for 10 years. They paid for the kid's activities.  He recently moved his whole family across the country after several conflicts with them, breaking my parent's hearts. \n\nNow on to me. I have been separated from an abusive husband for more then 3 years now. I have chosen to put kids off until I am both financially and mentally stable.  I tried to do the divorce entirely on my own, but couldn't complete it.  I'm now waiting until I have the resources to hire a lawyer.  My parents have not assisted me in this process.\n\nIn the past 3 years, I have worked very hard on myself. I pay for therapy out of pocket as I have no insurance. I searched for a local center who does free psychiatrist appointments about a year ago and I have attended monthly appointments ever since.  I take my meds. My doctors have advised I only work part time, bringing me to the realization that i'm going to have to do school to get anywhere in life. I worked really hard, got my associate's at a local community college and got into a university.  I recently quit my part time job at the urging of my doctors because I am starting at the university full time and they don't think I could stay healthy doing both.  \n\nSo financial aid is the only thing getting me by, along with a TON of help from my incredibly supportive boyfriend who works his ass off 60 hours a week. His mother also helps us absolutely anytime we need it, no questions asked. I hate taking money from her.  It hurts a bit knowing that she would help us and my parents wouldn't.  \n\nMy parents guilt me every time I ask for money, saying they have none to give. If I ask for 30 bucks, there is the full expectation that I'd be paying it back in the next 2 weeks. If I can't pay it yet, I will recieve frequent calls and texts expecting it back until I give it to them.  They've loaned me larger amounts (250 a little over a month ago for car insurance and groceries) and they call me constantly about it even though they know I have no income right now. \n\nNow they're doing their signature move,  saying they can't loan us any more money but we can move in with them. When I express that A. As a mentally ill person, the instability of moving is the last thing I need right now,  and B. It is inappropriate to live with your parents at 29 if it can be avoided in any way. They cry saying, I \"don't want to live with them\",  because they're \"so horrible.\" \n\nFor years I have been the one that my mother or father would go to if they needed something from someone they could depend on. I listen to them endlessly bitch about my brother. I have unfortunately taken on the role of their emotional caretaker, even though I tell them continually to talk to a therapist instead.  Now i'm starting to wonder why I stress about supporting them emotionally so much when they leave me to fend for myself all the time financially. I feel like as I get healthier through therapy,  I get more and more mad at them about this bullshit. \n\nNow I see them sending my brother's kids a mountain of christmas presents, and they are preparing to move into a house that is more expensive then their current one. They just bought a new car this year. I truly feel like if I had a kid id have a much higher value to them and that sucks. Am I a dick for feeling like I deserve some level of assistance from them? Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "I roomed with my best friend for 5 months. After I moved out she sent me a bill which included some unpaid hydro, bed sheets my pet ripped (these things I have no issue with and will definitely pay), a couple of cups that I accidentally broke and a torch I DID NOT BREAK.\n\nThe cups are not special. They are just regular cups, and it was an accident. What makes me think this is tacky, is the fact that she is an avid thief and 80% of her apartment is stolen goods. A lot of her kitchen wares are stolen. The only reason these cups weren't is because they were too guarded in the store. I told her to go steal some more.\n\nThe torch, was her boyfriends and I was the last to use it, however I DID NOT break this. It worked perfectly fine when I last set it down, I was just blamed because I was the last to use it. I don't agree with that charge. AITA in this situation??",

      "description": "Okay, first things first: it's tinder and I'm the big silly who thought I found meaningful connection. I'm not on it now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I don't use tinder much, certainly not for cheap sex. I guess I had it vaguely because it's a way to meet people.\n\n\\- Still managed to match with a guy who seemed nice. He messaged me first, we had great chat and went out for a brunch date when he was articulate, funny, interesting and attractive. Definitely I had gone into the date without expectations and left with them exceeded.\n\n\\- Second date is heaps of fun and he takes me out for a really nice dinner. We have great sex and hang out the next morning and I decide on the spot that I've met prince charming. YAY! I let him know that I'm interested and he responds, awkwardly, that he likes me too.\n\n\\- Okay, here's the juice. I have clinical depression and, while I'm medicated and don't expect him to 'save' me from myself, it's still there. I haven't disclosed this information.\n\n\\- The next few months shit gets wobbly. He works away and is a self-anointed poor communicator. I go through this stage of being super patient with him while ultimately feeing ignored and frustrated because every time I reach out (like once a week) I get the feeling that I'm bugging him and being the proverbial 'ugh, needy woman'. We have sex when he's in town and I feel no problem with that, but definitely feeling that I can't communicate with him because, gross, feeeeeeeeeelings. I want a straight answer as to how he sees us - together? Not? FwB? Dating?\n\n\\- He updates tinder.\n\n\\- I realise I'm [Gillian Flynn's cool girl](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/584441-men-always-say-that-as-the-defining-compliment-don-t-they)\n\n\\- He ends it: I crack and tell him I can't sit around waiting for him to remember I exist and he smoothly reciprocates that he probably needs someone more 'chill'. Ouch.\n\n\\- Over the next few months my brain packs it in. I'm not coping and I'm having obsessive thoughts.\n\n\\- He starts dating someone else. Yes, I stalked his social media.\n\n\\- I send him a long, angry text that basically calls him out on his shit behaviour, for not giving me a genuine reason for ending it. I don't say 'you used me for sex' - because I enjoyed it too - but I definitely feel disposable.\n\n \\-He doesn't respond. My friends, from the ivory tower of their smug relationships, are like 'that's tinder babe'. \n\n\\- I let him know I have severe depression. I don't know what I'm trying to achieve out of this beyond making him feel ashamed for pumping and dumping someone with a mental illness and then walking away as cool as you like.\n\n\\- I realise that I am The Crazy you're not supposed to stick you dick into.\n\n1. Am I the asshole for sending angry texts six months later?\n2. Am I the asshole for having expectations on tinder?\n3. Am I an asshole for faking being mentally stronger and more resilient than I actually am, for fear of being - shock - needy. ie. having needs.",

      "description": "Sophomore year of college I moved in with 3 friends that I had known through high school.  Everyone contributed some furniture (I brought a set of couches) and one of my roommates brought a dining room table and chairs.\n\nOver winter break I had a small get together.  The roommate in question wasn’t present but one of our mutual friends was visiting and broke one of the chair legs by accident.  We threw it out the next day figuring it was beyond repair and it was just a college table set, incorrectly thinking he had the same mindset as me that at the end of college I would just get rid of anything that got trashed during those years.\n\nI let my roommate know the next day and he wasn’t happy about it but didn’t seem like it was the end of the world.  Our mutual friend that had broken the chair went on deployment to the Middle East a couple weeks later (Marines).  I then get an e-mail from my roommates dad explaining that the chair and tables are expensive family heirlooms and that I need to replace the chair.  The son won’t talk about it and says I need to speak with his dad regarding it.\n\nI got weekly aggressive emails from the dad following up on my progress to find a replacement chair.  He didn’t contact the friend that broke the chair and I don’t deflect responsibility to him - he’s barely reachable in a war zone and doesn’t have much money.  After 6 months of searching on Craigslist and EBay I finally find a replacement chair that costs me $500 (a full table and chair set was $5,000+ and was difficult to find an individual chair).\n\nAm I the asshole for holding a grudge because I was held responsible for a piece of furniture broken under my watch?",

      "description": "So basically I have known this guy since I was in 7th grade. We are both 23 years old and we have always been good friends but I can't help feeling like I was a little *too* straight up with what I said to him. I went a little too far but I felt it needed to be said. Anyway, here we go.  \n\n\nSo this guy, I'll refer to him as Steven, doesn't have a job and isn't actively looking for one either. He gets money from his parents as a type of 'allowance' because they don't work either and get government money because of medical reasons. He basically lives in his room most days watching Twitch and makes videos on YouTube in his free time that basically only me and one of our other friends very occasionally watch. Fair enough, he has an interest and he enjoys doing it which is completely fine with me, but I always just lightly and in a peaceful manner remind him to keep it as a hobby and to keep an eye out for something to support himself and to which he agrees. Only he never does anything about it.  \n\n\nHe always tells me how he is having a hard time and he never has the money to do anything with, to which he never really tells me *why* he is always so short seeing he literally gets given money for doing nothing. He would always give me a vague reason but I always just believed him, he was my friend why would he lie to me I guess? However just this weekend it was finally revealed as to why, and this was how it happened.   \n\n\nOn Saturday me and Steven were hanging out so we went to the movies to see Overlord (which was fairly average really) but surprise surprise as we got to the ticket booth he was a little short on cash so I stumped up for his cinema ticket once again. I am mostly used to it at this point but for some reason on that particular day it really got to me how I have probably spent more on Steven than I have my own Mother over the years. After we got to our seats I asked him what happened to his money seeing he told me on Wednesday night his parents gave him his 'allowance' because there was no chance in hell it was already gone, it had been two days. I looked him dead in the eye and just waited for the response, to which he finally and rather sheepishly told me he has used it all by donating it to god damn Twitch streamers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI literally sat there for a good 10 minutes speechless. All this time I have been paying for this guy over so many years for anything we do has all been because he has literally given away any money he has ever had. Every single last penny. I finally after staring into thin air trying to comprehend what he has just told me asked him why? Apparently he would rather, and I quote, 'let them have it and not give it to big companies because they have enough money as it is'.   \n\n\nThat was the last straw for me. I knew I had to say something because I felt like he not only had been mooching off me for so long but also his parents. It all suddenly became so clear to me that the reason he never has money is because he *gives it away.* I presumed he was using it to buy things like groceries or I don't know, maybe to pay bills with, is that too much to presume? Thank god the room we were in was empty because I couldn't keep it in. I told him that all this time he has been wasting his money on complete strangers he doesn't even know, and has basically been coming up with excuses as to why he never had money. I told him right there and then that is the last time I'm ever paying for him again. He doesn't like to give his money to big companies but he gives it away to strangers? He is happy enough for me to use all of my money on him to give to these companies? No. Enough. I told him how stupid he has been getting his money for nothing and using the money that his parents have given to him and wasted it, money they could have used on themselves for things they actually need to get by. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was saying this something in me clicked again and this is where I feel I went a little too far, but I told him that he is never going to get by in life if he doesn't get his life together and get a job, quit making YouTube videos that no one ever watches apart from me that from now on I won't be. He needs to get a job and to stop living like an ignorant child. If he doesn't accept that he has to get on with life and live in the society of the current world he is going to be on the streets once his parents are gone. I know that last part was a little over the top, but I want him to realize this is no way to live, this isn't normal. If he continues on like this much longer he is going to have it hard for real. I see him completely differently now, and I feel like I don't want to be around him anymore. All this time I thought he was using his money to support himself, but no. He was wasting it and using both me and his parents. He got up and walked out, I haven't seen him or heard from him since. Frankly I don't want to.  \n\n\nTell me Reddit, am I the asshole?   \n\n\nTL;DR: A friend/now ex friend of mine was always short on money even though he gets it from his parents for doing nothing so I would always spot him some or pay for him. Find out after years of knowing him the real reason he never has money because he gives it all away to Twitch streamers. Tell him he has basically been using me and wasting his own money and what I think of it, end friendship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This just happened today.\n\nMy wife and i were recently married and she has a 4 year old Small breed dog who her mother originally wanted and got and since has been the family pet for the past 3 or so years. \n\nI met her about 2 years ago and this year we got married. All of a sudden we get on the topic of what to do with the dog since he is not fixed. She asks me whether we find him a wife to have and keep up puppy from the litter or if he should be neutered. \n\nI have no problem with the dog, in fact i take care of the dog and walk him twice a day since her parents haven’t been around for the passed 6 months. I have always taken care of him as if I had chosen him myself. But i explained that i don’t see our lives having just that one breed of dog for the next 40 years so I don’t really want that breed of dog if we were to get a new one because i prefer other kinds of dog breeds. Next thing i know I’m getting called a massive selfish asshole who didn’t even answer her question properly because i first tried to explain my feelings behind why i think we shouldn’t have him wifed up.\n\nNow she wont talk to me and is questioning our relationship about what i thought and it seems like that was the wrong answer to say...\n\nAm i wrong here?\n\nSorry for any grammar/spelling. On mobile.\n",

      "description": "My daughter's dad and I split up ten years ago. He was absolutely horrible to me (still is, actually) and has been incredibly difficult to parent with - to the point that I regularly pick my battles with him and avoid him as much as I can. Just a bit of backstory.\n\nOur daughter is turning 12 and wants me to host the party at our house. It's bigger and we have a yard and I tend to go all out with her parties, so obviously she wants me to do it. We have a custody agreement where it says we will alternate years for doing the party; last year he dropped the ball and didn't do one for her, even though it was his year, so I threw one together for her last minute. I even invited him, as awkward as that was. He got very upset with me for \"ignoring my child's father\" and \"purposefully not taking any photos of him\" when I was trying to just take pictures of the kids. He also just sat around with his friend (who he brought, I didn't invite) and didn't really interact with anyone but him. It was a whole ordeal and even my daughter complained to me after that she just wished he didn't come. \n\nHe had said last year after the party that he would do a party for her THIS year since he didn't do it last year, but we haven't discussed it since. Daughter's birthday is in a month and she wants me to just take over the planning and everything and have it here. In which case, I would only invite a couple adults (mostly just to help) but have it be about her and her friends.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I just took over the party planning and didn't invite him to celebrate in her festivities?",

Basically my dad who has drip brain (alcohol induced dementia basically) was evicted from his home last year and has a new place. He left some furniture that belonged to his mom there and has been wanting to get it back but the bank owns the place now. He has been pestering my brothers and sisters about it for a while now, including myself, trying to get us to break in to the old home to get said things. This is super emotional because it’s my childhood home and my dad’s health etc. Well he called me today asking again if I was willing to help. I said yes but on the fence still. What will happen is everyone in my family will give me some serious shit that I do NOT want to go through but I understand the value of this chair to him. If I don’t, my dad will be angry, if I do everyone else will be and I’m so angry about being put in this position. Either way I am an asshole to someone and I really think I am being put in a rough and weird situation. I’m sorry if this reads as a mess, I’ve been going back and forth for a few hours and just want some feedback.",

      "description": "I am 27 years old, and am one of the owners of a small startup that employs 25+ people. I am also acting manager and have developed a reputation as the \"disciplinarian\" of the three owners.\n\nI dont gain any pleasure out of being a dick to people, but I do require that everyone is held to certain standards and tries their best in all things and I will enforce those standards.\n\nIf someone shows up late, I will grill you on it. If you dont meet your deadlines, we're gonna have a discussion about why that didnt happen. If I see you bullying a coworker, I will shut it down publicly. If I see you putting your work onto others, I will directly ask you why you deserve to be paid. I wont ask anybody to do something i wouldnt do.\n\nI have fired three people in the three years our business has been running, and im not afraid to fire more if needed. I care very much about my company and I dont let anything slide.\n\nSo, now that that has been established. Last week I was involved in a car wreck on my way to work. BMW ran a red and T-boned my sedan on the passenger side. I spun out, bashed into an electric pole. I was lucky I wasnt hit on my drivers side as this car was going fast.\n\nSmashed my face on my steering wheel and door. Busted my nose pretty good. Two black eyes now. Pieces of glass cut up my face and my leg, and my lip got busted. Also, the worst injury, I broke my wrist and hand which is currently in a cast.\n\nBMW driver was fine. Car ended up getting towed and the EMTs bandaged my nose and plugged my nostrils to stop the bleeding. At the time I told them my wrist was fine, just sprained. Took it to a doctor over the weekend and yep, its broke.\n\nSedan was totalled and had to be towed.\n\nAt this point I had two options. I could either go home and rest, take a day off, or go into work.\n\nIn the past ive given many pep talks about being committed to your job, to overcoming obstacles, to making sacrifices and taking risks. I have denied sick days in the past for various reasons that werent satisfactory. \n\nSo, I decided to use this as a teaching moment and prove that im not all talk. I call a lyft, and show up to work. I looked like I was just mugged, but i showed. People bombarded me with questions and asked if i needed an ambulance but i just explained what happened and that everything is fine.\n\nI went to my office and got to work. One of the other owners came into my office and asked if I was alright. I said I was but he said I should go home or to the hospital. I had already paid to be brought here so I refused. He tried to insist but I wouldn't back down. I worked the rest of the week.\n\nThis week me and the other owners had a lengthy discussion about it and while they understand my reasoning they dont like that i came in and that i refused to leave. Its not a huge deal but what do you guys think?\n\n",

      "description": "Where I am from, it's really hard to get park reservations for interior canoe backcountry camping. \n\nThe parks let you book 5 months in advance, for a trip that is up 20 days long (for easy math). If you want to book a trip from the 20th-30th of August,, many people start their booking on the 10th of March, and book 10 campsites they never intend to visit. The idea is that you book \"garbage\" sites for the first 10 days, then the actual days you want later. Then you cancel your bookings a month later and the sites open up for others to grab (still 4 months ahead). But now you've booked your great sites.\n\nI think this is an abuse of the system. But when I woke up extra early 5 months before I wanted my trip to start, in order to book campsites, I found every single one of the campsites that I wanted were booked. Every single one. \n\nSo I played \"the game\". I booked garbage sites for the first 15 days, and then the actual sites that I wanted for the next 5. \n\nMy options were: 1. Go canoeing in noisy parts of the park with lots of motorboats, 2. Cheat the system like this, or 3. Not go camping. \n\nAITA for perpetuating this system? ",

      "description": "This happened a while ago.\n\nMe 20(f) and my ex 21(m) were going through some issues. We had been together 3 years but had recently started having some bigger fights. One fight was because I felt that we had stopped doing anything special for one another and that I wasnt getting enough attention. He said it was just the way he is and he doesn't think he needs to change that. \nOur last fight was because I had some time off work due to my anxiety and depression. I am usually fairly good at handling this and new that I needed the time off as I was not functioning well. I planned to have one day off to try and heal a little but his sister who I was living with found out about this. She called a house meeting and told me that this was unacceptable and that I was being selfish for risking my job and mine and my boyfriends future. She said that if I didn't get medical help, I could not complain about my depression and anxiety symptoms. This conversation lasted about an hour and I was left alone to stick up for myself. I told my boyfriend that this hurt me and he said that he agreed with her. I felt really alone at this point and told him that I wasnt sure I was happy in the relationship anymore. \n\nAnyway, I started doing a lot of overtime to get away from the house. One night after work a colleague invited me for a drink. I said yes as we had always got on. He was attractive but I'd never looked at him as anything more than a colleague before this night. I was having a really good time and got quite drunk.We flirted a little bit but it was mostly just chit-chat. Before I knew it, it was midnight and I said I should probably go home. He walked me to the door and kissed me good bye. I kissed him back for maybe a second before I realised what happened. I left without saying much. \n\nI told my boyfriend the second I woke up in the morning. He said we could work through it but I just felt numb. Mainly because I knew I didn't do do all I could to stop the kiss. Also, it made me realise I truly did not want to be in the relationship anymore. A few days later I left him but i was extremely apologetic (not that that means much I guess)\n\nMy friends dont think that what I did was cheating. His friends and family have all labelled me a cheater and dont think it was the first time either. I dont know what I think. Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway for personal safety. \n\nI am a sixteen year old male. My girlfriend and I have been dating for less than a year, about 7-8 months I think. Everything has been pretty perfect. We always get along and are on the same page most of the time. We started getting more sexual about last December or November and it was perfectly okay still. \n\nYesterday she wanted to meet me in person and wouldn't talk to me over the phone. She told me that she is pregnant and doesn't know what to do, except that she wants to keep it for sure. I said that I don't know. I didn't react harshly or anything, because I was mostly in shock, but I did not want to give her a solid answer or get her hopes up. She said she'll let me process. Now I do not want to talk to her or see her. Her and her friends have been blowing up my texts and calling me but I'm currently putting my phone on silent so I can think.\n\nI don't want to tell my parents. I would get in huge, like life altering trouble. My parents can act pretty crazy when they want to. I don't think she will get an abortion if I ask her to, but i don't know what else to do. I'm thinking about breaking up with her before she makes it official with everybody. I know her parents are pretty well off and seem supportive from what I've heard and could afford it if she went through with it. We never talked about having a long future together or really set in stone that we were dating. only our friend groups at school knew.\n\ni think that for my personal well being and safety, i should end it with her. I'm not ready for something like this, but she seems more ready. She would be better off if I didn't stick around, and I would too. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Okay, this is a slightly complicated story.\n\nI broke up with Nick in September. \n\nI never really got over Nick, we broke up because he moved about three hours away and the relationship became really difficult to maintain. In addition, I was having some health issues that meant I couldn’t be the best partner.\n\nIn October, Mike asked me out. Mike and Nick were casual friends while I dated Nick. \n\nI didn’t really know what to do, because I hadn’t really had an interest in Mike before. Not that I was actively disinterested, I just didn’t know him very well. \n\nI ended up going on a few dates with Mike. The relationship was weird.\n\nMike honestly struck me as a bit of a psychopath. He was completely unable of expressing emotion, and honestly said some really scary stuff.\n\nMostly comments about violence towards himself and others that made me really on edge.\n\nA mutual friend named Ellie was like, well that’s just how mike is. He doesn’t mean it he’s just a little bit quirky. \n\nI slept with Mike once and it was... not good. It was his first time but he didn’t even try.\n\nAfterwards he told me he realized he didn’t like sex and never wanted to have it again.\n\nAt this point I was pretty done with Mike, and we didn’t go on any other dates but continued to hang out during school.\n\nI ended up running into Nick the day before thanksgiving. Mike had flown out of the country for thanksgiving a week prior. He hadn’t replied to any of my messages and I was really frustrated with him.\n\nNick ends up explaining to me that he moved back, and that he missed me. I went over to his place to see his dog and talk, one thing leads to another and we end up making up and having sex.\n\nLater that day, I’m sitting with Nick and it hits me. Crap, I haven’t officially broken up with Mike.\n\nI was so sick of him and his weird behavior at this point so I just fired off a text “hey, I think we should break up”. He replied within the hour “Yeah, we probably should”.\n\nIt’s January now and I’m still with Nick but I occasionally feel twinges of guilt about mike. He’s never expressed any anger and knows I’m back with nick.\n\nIn a lot of ways I feel like the relationship was dead before then but I’m curious what others think.\n\n\nSo, tell me reddit: AITA for dumping Mike for Nick?

      "description": "Long backstory:   This girl and I knew each other from church, I grew up in this church and she was introduced to my church by her aunt in her preteens. When she first came in, she was much closer to this other girl and besides the weekly pleasantries exchanged we never went beyond acquaintances. Few years after, the other girl stopped coming and she started going around alone. I felt bad for her and so I started to include her in my group of friends.\n\n\nThe first few years were fine, but subsequently she started becoming very clingy towards me, showing me physical affection and literally latching onto me despite my very obvious shows of discomfort. For a year I tried my best to stay away from her, but felt bad again and opened up to her, letting her touch me and stuff.  \n\nShe hasn’t gotten baptised despite half her life in church, and I have no negative thoughts regarding that because I don’t want to come off as the staunch Christian who drives away people with religion. And since her parents don’t come to church, along with me being part of 95% of the conversations she has in church, it’s evident I’m the only person keeping her in church. She says she believes but when asked whether she wanted to get baptised she always avoided the question. But that’s not my point. \n\n\nWe’re both adults now, I’ve known her for close to 10 years, we’re the same age so we experienced changing of schools and major events in the same period. I would think as adults she would be more thoughtful of others or more socially aware. It’s getting very frustrating, she only turns up for events I go for, otherwise she will never go. When she comes, she sticks to me and I cannot hold proper conversations with other people because she’s always butting in. I feel like an asshole because sometimes I just want her to leave my side for a minute or two, especially in a church context any negative words is almost blasphemous. \n\n\nAITA? I’ve tried talking to her about it but she didn’t really get my point. ",

      "description": "For context: I love my parents but at an arms length. A lot of resentment against my mom for emotional and physical abuse and my dad for never stepping in but our relationship has improved after I married and moved out. We all live in the same city but it’s still roughly 40 minutes between our houses. \n\nMy younger sibling messaged me this morning telling me that my dad was mad at me and was thinking of disowning me because I don’t visit them enough and that it’s a “child’s duty” to visit their parents. I haven’t seen my parents since Christmas and have thought about seeing them soon now that the storm has settled after my other sibling moved out of the house recently  (moved into her boyfriends place and my parents are religious and very cultural about daughters living at home until they get married.) \n\nMy parents have tried to get me to visit in the past by asking if we would be coming over for dinner or celebrating a birthday, but they would always ask me to come during the weekday and I honestly never went because it would be after work, fighting 30-40 minute traffic to get to their place and then another 30-40 minutes with no traffic to get home afterwards.  I have also invited them several times to come visit me on weekends when I’m free and they always say no so I usually go to their house when I can so maybe once a month. \n\nAnyways, I feel like the asshole for not visiting them enough and they usually lay it on thick with the guilt whenever I do see them that I don’t visit them near enough as I used to when I was jobless. I’m married, I have a job, I make plans in advance with friends or go on vacation, or I want to vegetate at home after a week of work, and my parents don’t reach out to me to talk to me unless they want something or if they’re mad at me or my siblings. Or in this case, they’re mad at me for not visiting enough. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n",

      "description": "Ok here is the short version. \n\nThere’s an age gap with me and my gf. I am 24 and she is 20. \nWhen we found she was pregnant we immediately started preparing. \n\nThankfully I have the financial means to start a family. My gf on the other hand, not as mentally or financially prepared. She’s real big into social media and reading blogs. Right off the bat, I became very concerned that she wanted things for the nursery so she could show off to social media. \nI try to explain to her - we have never been parents before, let’s take it day by day and add to the nursery as we see fit. Well this didn’t fly with her (my gf had a not so good home life until she started living with her well off grandparents who gave her everything).  \nSo I start caving to various things. I probably have a whole room of stuff that will never get used... but hey it looks nice. \n\nThis weekend she convinced me to buy a dresser that we would use as a changing table. It was from IKEA but still was rather expensive. As we were in line, I ask her, please don’t ask me to build this until next weekend. I work 10-12hrs daily in the maintenance field and the last thing I want to do is build something after busting my knuckles all day. She says no problem, she has the next day off and she will do it herself. \nI try to talk her into letting us do it together on the weekend. She pretty much says no I will do it. \n\nSo I am sitting on my lunch today and she tells me she needs my help after I get off to help build the dresser. After some back and forth I told her she got herself into this and she would need to do it herself or wait till this weekend. \n\nObviously I don’t want her super stressed out, so if I get home and she’s still freaking out about it, I will help build it. \nBut am I a douche for not just wanting to go home and build it??",

      "description": "So my boyfriend has been sleeping separate from me for almost 2 years now. We stopped when he noticed that I was getting up at night and sleeping on the couch. He snores ungodly because he has a deviated septum and is a mouth breather. I am a bit of a light sleeper and tend to have issues falling asleep and repetitive noises like breathing or my step dad's hacking in the morning would keep me up. \n\nMy boyfriend, since he is a mouth breather, tends to have pretty bad breath a lot and I do not really want that in my face at night. He also kicks and punches in his sleep. Every night I would be getting kicked and punched at lease 3 times. And he would sleep right up on me no matter how much I shifted away. I even tried to sleep with half my body off the bed once because he would not give me room. \n\nNow I did try to deal with these things and get used to them. I have a feather pillow which tends to block a lot of sound so I started wrapping that around my head to muffle the snoring but it was still way too loud sometimes loud enough he would wake himself.  But instead of getting used to it it just started becoming annoying. Basically how you start expecting things to happen so you are already annoyed before it happens. \n\nHe of course says its not fair, how is it not fair to you? You get to sleep nice and well while I barley get any.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was frantically searching for a pair of socks that were a really good deal, when this lady says “Excuse me,” I just kind of turn and look at her while she’s talking and kind of tune out after the ‘excuse me’ because I assume she thinks I work there and I wont be able to answer her question either way. \n\n       When she’s done talking I kind of just say “Uhh, I don’t work here, sorry.” Very awkwardly, and try to continued looking for my socks but that’s when all shit breaks loose, “Well I’M sorry but I’m legally blind and the employees don’t have time to fOlLoW mE aRoUnD tHe StOrE aNd -“ She kept going but my friend saw me standing the bewildered af and grabbed the socks and whisked me away while this blind lady was still going off about how rude I was for just being a little confused?\n\n        Obviously if I would’ve realized she was blind I would’ve helped but SHE WAS SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES! My friend said I had the face that I was being yelled at by the teacher. And honestly it sort of felt like she was one of those people just waiting for a reason to freak out about her disability. Afterwards, I thought it was a funny situation but my one friend said I was in the wrong. I dont know, she didn’t have to be a bitch and not even let me explain that I didn’t fully understand what she wanted. AITA?",

      "description": "Ok... So this is a long term story, been going since I was 16. \n\nBack when I was 16 (I'm 27 now), I was dating a guy that my mom did not approve of (he was 2 years older than me.) She and I fought about it for many years, because he and I dated on and off for 5 years. He had a lot of piercings, visible tattoos, stretched lobes, etc. Got arrested once for a non-felony charge after getting drunk and trying to break a window. Decided to not drink again after that. He worked odd jobs, like roofing, etc. Because he didn't go to college or a trade school to learn mechanics, etc. She always talked down on that and on him. That he wasn't good enough for me, that I would always have to support him and he would never elevate me in any way, regardless of how he treated me (he treated me very well.) Eventually, we called it off. \n\nI then started dating my current boyfriend (working on 6 years together.) My mom was the one that pressed for us to go on a date; we bowled in the same bowling league so he knew I had a boyfriend and didn't want to go out at first. She said it didn't matter. Obviously we did eventually go out and we've been together since. \n\nHe is a wonderful man, who treats me exactly the way I want to be treated, we agree on financial things, etc. (hi, B, if you're reading!) \n\nFast forward 2 years from our first date and now apparently he isn't \"good enough\" for me. My mom, at this time, was married to my step-dad who is awesome. He was very traditional, though. Opened her car door, paid more bills, etc. That is all well and good, but also not what I want from a man. I can open my own doors, pay half the bills, etc. But apparently, that is not what my mother thinks is \"good for me.\" So we fought about my now boyfriend and him not being good enough for me. Keep in mind, he has a steady job that absolutely adores him, makes good money, buys me presents one offs, definitely fulfills my love language, we agree on almost everything, we laugh, etc. But since it isn't HER idea of a perfect man, she shit on him and his behaviors.\n\nHe and I have never really gotten over it, honestly. \n\nFast forward to now - my mom is now divorced from my now ex-step dad and is dating someone new. \n\nThe person she is now dating is someone who less than 6 months ago was arrested on 3 felony charges, who has multiple DUIs, has no job, and is reliant on her for many things. Drives her car because he doesn't have one, etc. She is 52 years old and he is 43. \n\nShe's an absolute hypocrite and I refuse to meet this person she is dating because he is the almost the description of the first boyfriend from when I was 16 - just an adult and honestly worse. \n\nShe berates my ex step-dad for \"cheating\" on her, when he didn't, after basically begging me to chest on my then-boyfriend to go out with now-boyfriend. \n\nIt honestly is tearing at my mental health at this point. \n\nAITA because I want to cut her off because of her behavior and how hypocritical she is?

      "description": "For context, I haven't actually told him anything. This is more of just a sort of \"thinking out loud\" for myself. A friend of mine had a medical procedure that he needed, and didn't have enough funds to cover it. So, he went online, started an indiegogo, and did a fundraiser. He's a good friend of mine, and I thought he needed the help, so I donated a large sum. (My contribution matched basically what everyone else combined paid) And I'm okay with that. I make good money, and I care about my friends. The other day, however, he posted that he had gotten a new tattoo. This may sound silly, but now I feel like rather than helping pay for his medical procedure, I've paid for his tattoo, and that kind of irks me. Of course it's his money, and he's allowed to spend it, but I feel like getting a tattoo less than a week after asking friends and family for financial help is a bit... tactless?",

      "description": "My Uncle and Aunt visited me in the US last week, and now I'm being branded by them as a selfish asshole. I (25 Male) am a big car guy and as a result, both the vehicles I own are expensive performance cars ( '17 C63 AMG S and '18 Ghibli SQ4 for you car junkies out there) . As a result, I never let anyone who isn't directly under my insurance drive them ( Only my parents and GF ever drive them). In addition, I have around a total of 25k in modifications done to the cars, so I stand to lose that money in the unfortunate event that either car were to be damaged or totaled. Basically, they ended up coming for a short 2 week trip. They decided to use my house as a hub and travel around, which I didn't mind at all. When we discussed their plans for the 2 weeks, it became apparent that they would do a lot of long distance driving ( \\~2000 miles total) . I made sure they were aware that I would not be willing to let them use either car for their trip as they have had a history of not respecting other people's cars ( They filled regular gas in my dad's car before when it requires premium and brushed it off like it was no big deal). Things seemed fine and they booked a rental car, which I got them a huge discount on ( Worked out to an average of 32 bucks a day for a Small SUV) . They are not poor by any means btw, together making around 200k. The trip seemed fine, until after they returned home. My parents told me that apparently they were upset and have been bitching about me being a selfish asshole for forcing them to rent a car despite having two cars. I have an extended family of about 45 people and apparently a good chunk of them have had an earful about this 'act of selfishness' on my part. My aunt and uncle even went as far as to say that I should have considered family members needing to borrow my car before buying such an expensive car. Unfortunately, while my Mom isn't siding with them, she is upset at me for not letting them borrow one of my cars. She says its not a big deal and that nothing would have happened, and even if something would have happened, I could just ' claim insurance'. My dad, however, understands my point of view and says theres nothing selfish about what I have done. I'm so conflicted. Have any of you been in a similar situation? ",

For the sake of anonymity i will not give the name of the school or any students and teacher names.\n\nSo i was raised as a patriotic child since my father was a member of the army and my mother was a teacher. I respect soldiers of my country more than anyone else. And i used to have a lot of fights against other students and teachers for saying pro-terrorist stuff. I live in turkey btw just to clear things up. So around 5 years ago in my class there was a girl in my class that would go to meetings of some terrorist groups because she supported their cause.\nWell i would get mad at this but since this did not affect me that much i never cared too much to say anything about it since she never confronted me about my ideals.\n\nHer last words i heard was that she was going to a meeting with her family to support their cause.\nWell the next days on the news i sae that there was an attack on the meeting site and that some people had died. Well those days that kind of stuff would happen very often in turkey so it was not surprising that it would have happened in a meeting. \nAfter the weekend the whole class was aware of that she died and stood silent in a means to grief for her. \nWell i wasn't having none of that and spook out during the lunch break that she was supporting an illegal party that would use every means possible to get what they want. So i told that she knew what was coming her way and that she deserved it since she supported them.\n\nSo to say i got a lot of backlash from my comment on her death be it from my classmates or even other teachers\n\nAm i the asshole for disrespecting a student who died while supporting a terrorist group?\n\nSorry about messy post first time posting here",

      "description": "The university I attend has some pretty great volunteer partnerships with groups in our city but when I look into some of them I find that they are rooted in religion. For example, there is a volunteer opportunity to be a camp counselor for kids whose parents have passed from cancer, but when I read up more on the organization they were very Catholic and it was clear the religion was a big part of their organization. I feel like an ass hole for passing on an opportunity to help some children because of my preference to distance myself from religion. I don't have a problem with religious people or the public and open practice of religion; I just don't want to talk about it or experience it personally. So, am I the ass hole? ",

      "description": "My daughter is sixteen, and she is generally very well behaved. We lost her mother two years ago, and she has taken on a lot more responsibilities in order to help me out, like taking care of her brothers and helping around the house. She has never really given me reason to worry about her. She has recently started to go out with her friends at night, which I’m fine with. She has a curfew of ten, but I’m generally fine with her staying out later if she calls me to let me know where she is. Last night, she came home more than an hour late with no call whatsoever. I was worried sick. I kept calling her and she wouldn’t pick up. When she finally got home, I was thankful that she was safe, but furious with how late she was (she claimed that she lost track of time and that her phone died) and I yelled at her and grounded her. I thought it was the end of it, but this morning she came up to me and said that I shouldn’t have yelled, and that I shouldn’t ground her since she rarely goes out anyway, and that since she has taken on more responsibility since her mother died, that she is essentially not a child anymore and shouldn’t be treated as one. I always knew how lucky I was that she was willing to take on these responsibilities, but I never realized that she was bitter about it. I feel guilty now, for yelling at her and grounding her, because I feel she does have a point—she’s far from being a child. But, it still doesn’t stop me from worrying about her, and I feel that as a father, I should still have to right to impose rules on her since she’s still a teenager.

He asked her to homecoming last year and this year and she said yes, but last year's spring dance she said no. From mutual friends I have learned she has no interest in him and he knows this himself, but he continues to chase after her. She's too nice to say she isn't interested in him to his face and his sisters are friends with her so, yeah messy situation.\nHe wants to go speak with her when he gets the chance and I always encourage him to do so, but he never does. I feel he squandered his chance for anything meaningful with the girl because he never really committed to forming a real friendship with her.\nI've always stepped aside when I've learned that my friends have feelings for the same girl and tried to be a good wingman, but this time I want it to be different. I value my friendship with this guy though, but I also want a meaningful relationship with this girl too. I feel backed into a corner where I lose no matter what route I take. So, I'm asking WIBTA if I started chasing this girl either while he's interested in her or after he loses interest?",

      "description": "So, this story goes back decades is as complicated as it gets. But the TL;DR is that my father is one of the worst human beings i've ever met. None of his family will talk to him after he stole over 20 thousand dollars from his dad. He mooched off my mom for their entire marriage. He refused to work and made my mom work 2 jobs to support us all. That was until her found a younger, hotter woman and ran of with her, leaving my mom with 4 kids to take care of on her own. He only ever reappears from time to time to ask for money or get something. When I was in college my brother let him sleep on his couch only to have my father steal his truck and try to sell it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go on about everything he's done here but I won't. That's the past and I've moved past him and his shit (at least I think I have). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, as of recently, my father has reappeared again. This time, however, he claims he wants to \"reconnect\" with us. From what my siblings have said, he tried to reach out to them and apologize for everything. He want's to \"make amends\" for what he's done and reconnect with us. He's even tried to contact my mother and apologize. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't buy it. Up until yesterday I had two short conversations with him and while he is acting as if he's sorry there was something telling me he's lying. So against the advice of my siblings I met him yesterday for lunch to talk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt turns out he has lung cancer and has 6 months to live. He says this has been his wake up call and that he want's to spend his last moments \"being the father he never was\" to us. The lunch was spent with him apologizing and trying to \"connect\" with me, but I refused to interact with him much. Towards the end of it, I honestly had enough with his groveling and told him what I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him that he is a piece of human trash and that I will never accept his apology. That he has abused me and everyone else for all this time and he's not truly sorry. He only want's to feel better about it now that he's going to die. I told him that I'm happy that he's finally going to be gone. That him getting cancer is a sign of gods mercy to the world. I told him that he's going to die alone and unloved by everyone and that all of his kids will fucking party once we get the news. I ended by telling him that the last time I will ever thing of him is when I pour his ashes down the toilet after pissing in his urn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got up, payed for my half of the meal and left while he just sat there. He tried to call me last night but I ignored it and blocked his number. He's apparently told my sister what happened and after talking with her this morning she says I went over board. She says that he's dying and I should have not told him that. My mom also heard what I said and thinks that, while what I said was true, I'm wrong for ever even sitting down with him in the first place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't feel bad at all.\n\nAITA though?",

We started dating the summer going into our junior year of high school so our entire adult life has been together.\n\nSo a little over a year ago we both went through a bit of an identity crisis not knowing who we really are without each other. So we decided we would break-up for 1 year before meeting back together and deciding if being together was what we really wanted or if we were just trapped out of not knowing any better. It was a full break-up, there was no communication and no expectation of loyalty.\n\nThe year came and went, we both spent time alone and dated other people. It really was a good decision to make as we both decided that we really did want to be together and this little test seem to really bring us closer together.\n\nWell we just found out that she is actually pregnant and it isn't my kid. I have since broke up with her over this. She didn't do anything wrong (other than not being careful enough) and I don't feel betrayed by her. I don't have any ill feelings for her. I still love her deeply, but I can't and won't be responsible for a child that isn't mine.\n\nIt has been a really rough week for me and I am sure it has been at least just a rough for her but I don't regret my decision.

Secondly, I'm on mobile, so excuse any formatting errors.\n\nBit of a background, I've decided a few years back, after a major pregnancy scare, that I'm not gonna leave something like this to chance, and I've got a vasectomy.\n\nFast forward 5 years, I'm in a relationship with this girl, our 1 year anniversary is coming up, and she decides to spring up on me, that she is pregnant. To this day, I'm amazed that I've kept my calm. I'm not going to lie here, I'm not a saint, in fact, I'm a pretty vindictive person. My first course of action was asking if she considered an abortion. After her stating, that having a child was one of her top priorities, the case was pretty much clear to me.\n\nThe whole gist of the matter, in my country, abortions are allowed until 16 weeks in. So I've waited, and bid my time to strike. I've waited the whole 16 weeks to make sure, then confronted her with the following: either we get a paternity test, or she fucks off immediately. Now I know that even a vasectomy isn't 100% safe, so I was fully prepared to take responsibility if the child was actually mine. Well, seems like I'm never going to know, as she vehemently refused testing, and broke down crying after me kicking her out.\n\nTL;DR Girlfriend cheated on me, got pregnant, I've tricked her into believing that I belive it's mine until she couldn't abort anymore, then unceremoniously kicked her out and cut contact.\n\nSo, am I really the Asshole here?",

      "description": "Tomorrow morning I am sitting a 10 hour medical admissions exam (in Aus it’s called the GAMSAT, it’s the equivalent of the MCAT I think). Tomorrow night is my mother’s 50th birthday party, although not her actual birthday. \n\nThe party has a theme which is ocean, from the moment she gave me the invite she said that it’s important that her kids dress up, I thought okay groovy I’ll be a mermaid. and let her know my idea. All sorted, right? Wrong. For the next two weeks she called me constantly as I was trying to study for this exam, with the calls usually ending in her suggesting that I hire out a costume (which I can’t afford) me saying no, I’ll be a mermaid, and her calling me selfish or implying that I don’t care about her party. \nEvery time she called I chatted a bit about the costumes etc. because I knew it was important to her, and gave her advice on her costume so she knew it mattered to me. After the first few calls I did mention that I wasn’t going to change my costume and the calls are distracting me from studying. \n\nA few days ago I realised that if I wanted to dress up as a mermaid I’d end up being late for the party (which I’d be late for anyway, my exam finishes at 6:30pm when the party starts, and I’ll be travelling about an hour to get to the party), I mentioned this so my mum and she once again tried to force me to hire out a costume that I can’t afford. When I said no she suggested that I leave my exam early (...I paid $505 to sit this exam and only get two attempts, she is well aware of this) so I don’t end up being late. I said no, she once again called me selfish and said I don’t care about her birthday or her party and that I’m putting my medical admissions exam ahead of her party (no shit I am!). \n\nThe hilarious part of all this is that she takes so much pleasure in bragging to all her friends about how she’s doing everything she can to help make sure I do my best in this exam, but last Friday when I asked for the day off of work so I could study/because I was unwell (my mums my boss - yay) she told me there was endless amounts of work to be done and that I needed to come in. I asked multiple times for the list of tasks that need to be done and she refused to send it to me, so on Friday like the jerk that I am I came into work... it took me an hour to do the ‘mountain’ of work that was required of me. And the drive into work is an hour so it was pointless for me to go home afterwards. \n\nI’m at a loss, she’s currently resorted to saying that I’ve ruined her birthday and she doesn’t even want a party anymore, and I’m worried if I turn up I’ll get harassed. Whereas if I don’t turn up I’ll get badmouthed to the whole family. I’m about 90% sure that after the exam all I’ll want to do is pass out/cry, I’m pretty sure just the fact that I’m showing up shows that I care...\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I (23f) live with two other roommates (22f and 19f).  We all get along mostly well, except for a few spats here and there.  Tonight, my youngest roommate bought dry shampoo for the first time and asked \"What does it DO?\"  And I said \"It absorbs the oil in your hair\" and she goes \"Where does the oil GO?\" So I got a plate to demonstrate (I was going to use the plate for her scalp and rub some oil on it and sprinkle cornstarch to demonstrate the dry shampoo).  My other roommate said, \"No, let's not dirty dishes.\"\n\nHere's the thing: It's my dish.  I brought about 90% of the kitchen stuff in general, including a full set of plates and bowls with a matching set of cups and mugs.  I was standing next to the sink, and I had asked everyone to clean up the dishes they used earlier this week.  Would I be the asshole if I said to my roommate \"Don't tell me what I can and can't do with my own dish?\"  I can understand if it was her dish, but it's not.\n\nThe only reason I haven't yet is because she has an issue with me saying stuff like that, telling me that I'm talking down to her yet she's constantly talking over me and saying stuff like \"Don't dirty a dish,\" and \"Never say that again,\" in all seriousness.",

      "description": "Let me preface this by saying this past year has been the worst of my life. I have been depressed and disassociating and so stressed. I took a leave of absence from my university this semester so I could transfer because it was a terrible place for my self image and health. My boyfriend of ten months knows all of this. Decisions for transfer should come out around now and I just called the admissions office of my hopeful university and found out some of my high school transcripts aren't in. He started telling me to call the admissions office now (sending around 20 separate messages saying \"now\" \"NOW\" \"stop messagijg me here\" \"call the admissions officr Znow\" \"you nlNEED to call zznow\"), though I'd already called them and that would have been apparent if he had closely read my previous messages explaining what was going on with the transcript and the call to the office. I told him I had called and was going to call back, but that I'd just be crying to them. He said to not cry because it is \"not professional\". I know crying is unprofessional. He didn't have to tell me that. In response I said I know crying is unprofessional and asked how I'm even supposed to help it. I said I'm in a crisis.  How am I supposed to help but cry when it seems like I am incapable of doing anything right and I just found out I will have to be out of school for a year and all my plans are falling apart? It just felt totally unempathetic and out of touch on his part.",

      "description": "Disclaimers: do not bring an r/atheism attitude to this please. Also, I live on my own, I was visiting home. I am uninsured at this time.\n\nLast night my dad got home (drunk, so more emotional) and asked if there was anything he could do to help me. After some back and forth, it seems he was misinformed on some things I've been having trouble with, including my suspicion of having ADHD (this is a years long process of research and learning, unconfirmed because doctors and psychs had  been rather expensive for me with or without insurance). I only brought it up because he'd asked how my A+ certification was going.\n\nHe suggested re-adding me to his insurance but it was cost prohibitive on both of us. After the insurance suggestion, he suggested church / a priest. I did give religions a fair chance as a child and it doesn't appeal to me. I had to tell him no in an increasingly... irritated tone to get him out of this loop. (I made it clear that my issue was with my mom for being very anti-medication and thus being the largest part of the issue.) He seemed saddened by this just before going to bed.\n\nI completely understand and appreciate his wanting to help me. However, I'm one of the few in the family who doesn't subscribe to religion. I don't have a problem with my family when it comes to that, it just doesn't work for me. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: probably have ADHD which makes it hard to get certs I want, dad feels guilty when I bring up mom's very anti-med stance, suggests church, I reject, he seemed hurt.",

      "description": "Before jumping to any conclusions, here’s the backstory and where I’m at:\n\nWe’ve been together for 4 great months. She’s a great girl and I’m so happy with her. But, one flaw: she never reaches out to me.\n\nI call/text her everyday just saying hi and seeing how she’s doing. You know, “boyfriend”, type stuff. And it’s easy for me to do when I truly care for her. After 3+ months I started getting annoyed. Realized she has never called me ONCE. I repeat, NOT ONCE. I know she really cares for me and wants to talk to me, so it baffles my mind why she won’t reach out. So, I started waiting to text her - i went crazy. I felt this unspoken tension the whole day and i knew she was waiting to hear from me. She eventually texted me, late at night (midnight) just saying goodnight and she hopes everything is okay. I said goodnight and said everything was good. Come the next day, no message until late, again. I opened up and told her how I feel like I’m the one reaching out all the time and I get no initiation from her. I told her I just want to feel more, “wanted”, and a simple text/call during the day could do all that and more. When I told her all of this, she replied:\n\n“Hey, sorry if I dont text/ call you enough. I’ve never been good with that stuff but I’m going to try and work on it 🙂 I appreciate you always making an effort to talk to me. It’s dumb but I always think “I’ll just let him call me when it’s convenient for him so I know I’m not bothering/interrupting him” I know I can always talk to you if theres an issue and trust me, I had every intention on talking to you about whatever was going on at some point today. I want you to know you can do the same with me!! Even though it was only 1 day it was so not like us not to speak so my mind was racing automatically thinking the worst (typical me) and so I made myself so upset/sick over the fact that something was possibly not right. Sorry if any of this sounds dramatic but its 100% the truth. I just care about you A LOT and I want you to know! With all that being said, no need to not talk to me until I talk you anymore, I get it now and will make more of an effort 🙂”\n\nI felt great reading that. So relieved. But, 2 days have passed and she hasn’t reached out all day. Of course, I could reach out to her. The phone works both way, I know that! But, I want to see if she really meant what she said.\n\nSide note: She’s a quiet girl. An absolute DIME, but very to herself. So much so that this girl is a 10/10 but I’m her FIRST boyfriend at 21 years old. Maybe she’s new to the whole relationship thing? But, still. She acknowledged it and said she’d change. But, seemingly hasn’t.\n\nAm I the asshole for playing this petty game and not reaching out?\n\nThanks, everyone.",

The movie watching never happens for some reason and we end up in her bed, going to town. She was pretty nervous I think, so she was talking random stuff between making out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe decides to tell me (between making out in her bed) that she recently got waxed and how her waxing lady is this super cool polyamorous lady that she should be friends with, cause she has cool stories. She tells me her name and it hits me. It's a girl that I hooked up with about 3 times, latest hookup being approximately 2 months before this 'movie watching'. She talks about the waxing lady some 5 minutes and I sit there, listen and ponder if I should tell her about my time with the waxing lady. We were having a good time and I decide not to tell her, thinking it would ruin the mood. We proceed to the fun stuff, all is good. We end up having a great time, so the next evening I go to her place again and repeat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I go out of town and we keep texting daily. I usually don't like 90% of the girls that I meet online, but I decide I like her, she was really nice. One week passes and we text daily. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember about the waxing lady and decide it's the right to do and tell this girl about her. I bring it up through text and say something like 'Remember you told me about X? Yea, so wanted to tell you that I saw her about 3 times, last time 2 months before meeting you'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe gets worked up really quick and starts saying that I have low standards, I'm pathetic and being shady with her. I tell her that I didn't wanna ruin the mood that night, because we were having a great time and I didn't think it would be a big issue since I met the waxing lady 2 months before meeting her. She says the only reason I didn't tell her that night was because I knew that otherwise I wouldn't have gotten laid. Then it's bye bye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm wondering what should I do if I end up again in that kind of situation. Tell the girl immediately or never tell her?\n\nAITA here?",

So B and I plan to “work on an assignment together” at his place (I actually DID want to work on the assignment for at least a bit but he didn’t lol). \n\nThe whole time I’m at his place trying to get a bit of work done and he keeps saying stuff like, “Yeah, A is a total stoner and never does shit with his life” (even though B was telling me this while smoking a fat joint) and “I definitely could’ve gotten into XYZ frat, I know so many of the guys there” and just dumb shit I didn’t care about. Finally I resign to the fact that I’m not gonna get any work done so he offers me some of the joint and I take it. We got pretty high and decided to watch Django Unchained (again, I actually wanted to watch this but I later found out was not the case with him lol) and not even 10 minutes into the beginning he goes for the kiss. Except it was a really fucking bad kiss. Like, his entire lips engulfed my mouth. Whatever, maybe he like slipped or something.\n\nWe take it to his bedroom and he is still just doing a terrible job kissing. By now I’m like high as a kite and kind of just trying to get into it but I just couldn’t. I think he was *trying* to suck on my lower lip in a sexy way but it ended up being a big swollen bruise the next day. It was like making out with one of a Kraken’s tentacles. Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and told him, “Look, I’m not trying to be mean, but you’re kind of a bad kisser.” At the time I think it sounded ok because I was so fucking high but he obviously did not take it well, told me he wasn’t hard anymore, and ended up driving me home. I told my friends what happened and while they thought it was hilarious they definitely said I was in the wrong. I did end up texting him apologizing for “being bitchy” because I was high but I literally never spoke to him or even made eye contact him again, even though we were in a very small class for the rest of the semester.\n\nSo, WITA for telling him that he sucked (pun kind of intended) at kissing?",

      "description": "I'm a state-paid caretaker for my grandparents, along with an older sister of mine. My grandma, who is 84 and about 178 pounds, has been told by her doctor to cut out sweets in their entirety, *especially* soda. My grandma has already gotten much better; in the last two years she really cut down on Pepsi and lost about a hundred pounds.\n\nHowever, it seems she's hit a plateau and she's not really loosing any more weight, maybe a pound here or there and that's it. My concern is that she has a tendency to refuse the meals that my sister and I prepare for her (which consist of vegetables, good fats, protein, and so on), and instead begs to have cereal like Honey nut oats or cinnamon raisin bread. She'll ask for ice cream and then say she's too full to eat any of her actual meal, and she'll throw a fit if we ask her to wait for dessert until afterwards.\n\nMy grandma got really close to kicking the Pepsi habit for real, that is, until she discovered that root beer doesn't have any caffeine in it. Now she's drinking a big glass of root beer every day, no matter how many times my sister and I sit down with her and try to explain that *sugar* is the problem more than caffeine. \n\nShe gets VERY upset whenever my sister and I question her diet at this point. The thing is, I do see where she's coming from. My grandma has all her independence stripped away from her; she can't drive and she has to rely on her grandchildren for transportation and to make most of her purchases for her. She says she knows that it's bad for her, but that she's so old she doesn't want to sacrifice her small joys for maybe an extra year or so of life. \n\nHowever, although I understand her, her mental facilities *are* slipping and it seems like she literally wouldn't eat any real food unless my sister and I kept up the pressure to eat healthy. She claims over and over again that she *never* gets to eat anything sweet, which is a lie. The reality is that she gets stressed out and wants to eat sweets to calm down and maybe exert some independence.\n\nWould I be the asshole for refusing to buy her root beer? At this point in time, I don't really know what to do so I just try to remind her that her doctor wouldn't want her drinking that, before going and getting her soda anyways. In this case, am I the asshole for enabling her sugar addiction? \n\nShe gets pretty upset when I remind her about her doctor. Should I stop bringing it up and just let her have her way? Her memory is so bad, and she's so willful about getting her way, that it's impossible to to try to some sort of compromise to limit her soda intake. Reddit, please help me because I'm in dire need for a moral judgement here.",

I think she's really great and I love to talk to her as well as be around her. The problem is I don't find her attractive physically. Not to toot my own horn, but I know what I look like and by a conventional outlook I'm a little \"out of her league\". That doesn't bother me at all as I'm someone who seeks an emotional connection well before a physical one, particularly as I've gotten older. She has a really high sex drive and just about every time we are together she wants to have sex. Oppositely my libido is rather low, and 99% of the time I don't make any sexual moves towards her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day we were laying in bed after I had just gotten home from work and was subsequently falling asleep. She makes a move and I brushed it off. After I made it clear I wasn't feeling it currently, she got fairly flustered with me saying she doesn't feel like I want to connect physically with her. I told her I loved her and that I just was tired. Which is true, but I also just don't find her physically attractive especially in a sex related environment, despite not saying that to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I being the asshole because I don't find her sexually attractive?",

Since she’s moved we almost never see each other anymore. Her fiancé will never watch the baby and every time she wants a babysitter he gets mad and starts a fight with her. I don’t have a car or get along with her fiancé so it makes it tough for me to visit her. It really seems to me that the fiancé is emotionally abusing her and keeping her locked up away from everyone. She has talked to me before a out him bullying her about certain things. I didn’t react well to hearing this and kinda told her she needs to get away from him, etc. Recently she posted a new profile picture of herself and she looked gaunt, pale and generally not super healthy. I messaged her about my concern and told her I didn’t think she looked like herself or well. She got mad at me and said she’s perfectly healthy and she has a good relationship and I need to stop criticizing everything she does. She was also upset the I’m never supportive of her and that it bothered her. I didn’t respond because I didn’t want to argue but now it’s been over a week and I still really don’t have a response for her. She doesn’t do anything to be supportive of, I haven’t seen seen her 6 months and she lives 5 miles away and I’m genuinely concerned for her. She doesn’t want to her it and so I really am just at a loss. So would I be an asshole for giving up on our friendship? She doesn’t seem to want to change anything about her situation and there obviously isn’t room for me the way things are. ",

We became friends at work and he got a wife and son.\n\nOne day at work he was very cautious. I asked him whats up and he said his bankaccount was hacked. He needed money for his son and his wife, but the bank closed his account (he told me so). I told him, i could borrow him the money, but i need it back in 6 months. He answered, he can give it back in 3 months. So I borrowed him 5k. 2 weeks later he came and asked for more. The bank needs more time to solve the problems and such things. Long story short, i gave him additional 2k for the time. He said he isn't doing so well for now and I felt sorry.\n\nAfter 6 months I began to ask about the money. He was like \"I need more time, sry\". Several weeks gone by and I've seen nothing from the 7k.  I asked several times, but it was always the same monolog. Even as I admited that I need the money for a new Car (had a little accident). So I proposed him, he could return in installments. He said \"yeah ok\", but until today there came nothing.\n\nThen I became a little rude and confronted him. We came to the same end as ever. I asked him again and again the next weeks. Although I knew he was not feeling well. \n\nNow the point. 2 weeks ago he didn't came to work. I was told that he is back in a clinic because of burnout. I am afraid it's my fault. He really stressed himself into the \"thing with the money\" but i need it. I gave him almost everything I had. And now i don't know if it was ok.\n\nIt seems like this thing is responsible for his hospital stay.\n\nWas I to rude? Should i take more care because of his backstory? I'm in very doubt.\n\nSorry for my very bad english.",

      "title": "AITA for not letting my employees switch shifts?",
      "description": "Here's the story of my current situation. I work at a coffee shop and our manager recently left. While we are manager-less I have been put in charge. I do all daily operations, orders, maintenance, settling employee issues, etc etc. I do all of this without any additional pay or title change (they're \"working on\" promoting me but that's a post for a different sub on a different day).  The only things I don't have access to are payroll and schedule building so they're being taken care of by a manager from a near by location. Everybody knows those two things are out of my control and if they need to change their availability or ask for days off they need to talk to that manager, not me. She requires these requests to be put in 2 weeks in advance.\n\nEverybody knows the shitty situation I'm in right now. I'm running a store with no control over my staff's schedules. After schedules get published people often come to me with issues (\"I was scheduled on a day and time I have school\" and \"this was already approved time off and yet somehow I'm working???\") They have to put in requests 2 weeks in advance. Everything is just one huge cluster fuck. In instances like this I decide to fuck it and not deal with my \"babysitter.\" I find some way to rearrange the shifts and everything works out fine. I've talked to them so many times about how they need to be patient and understanding. I said that I know things suck right now but it's temporary and we'll all get through together. Things will go back to normal after the holidays. In the meantime I'm doing what I can to keep things as normal as possible. You'd think everyone would understand how difficult this all is and they'd be a little mature. I'd hope they could make small sacrifices like just dealing with the fact that their shifts are going to look a little different than we're used to (ex 9AM - 5PM instead of 8AM - 4PM).\n\nThere's one barista in our shop that is more bitter than the coffee we serve. She gets off on being pissed off. Anyways... right before my boss left, this barista demanded she be cut to working 4 days a week. Not for school or another job. No. She wants to work 4 days a week because \"it's not fair that I work 5 days a week and bring home 22 hours while Eric works 4 days a week and has the same number of hours!\"\n\nShe also insists on being out by 3pm every day. \"I need time to see my girlfriend! Never get to see her because our work schedules clash and then I keep getting scheduled all weekend when she's off!\" There are only 3 shifts that get out by 3pm and they're all shorter shifts. The only two 8 hour shifts at our store are 8-4 and a closing shift that gets out around 11:30 at night.  She refuses to work these shifts, again, so she can \"spend time with her girlfriend.\"\n\nSo next week's schedule came out yesterday and this salty barista saw that she's working 4 days but only has 18 hours. She started complaining left and right. I tried to ignore it because I didn't have time to deal with her hissy baby fit. It's month end, I have a mountain of work, corporate is on my ass despite not giving me access/resources to do my job, and she literally brought this on herself. Besides, I don't build the schedule. She knows this. I can fix small issues but this is not something I had any say in.\n\nAt the end of her shift she comes to me telling me she's taking another baristas shift (for a total of 5 days and 23 hours). He works 2 jobs so he doesn't \"need as many shifts here\" and is willing to give her one to help boost her hours. Well denied the request. If he really wants the day off, somebody else can take the shift. But he doesn't want to because she approached him about giving it to her. I am sick of her not being a team player, being negative, and wanting her way or the highway. She cut down her availability drastically and still expects to rake in 22-25 hours a week. Even if I had control over the schedules, I can't pull hours out of my ass like that. \n\nI told her that I won't allow it because of the availability she insisted on. If she wants more hours she can return to having open availability and pick up some mid day or closing shifts. But I will not give her more morning shifts when she insists on working this way. We have plenty of other people (positive team players) that also need to work morning shifts. \n\nIf I keep accommodating her she'll keep walking all over me and taking advantage of the situation we're in. And it won't stop when I become the manager either. She'll keep doing shady things to get exactly what she wants. This is my line in the sand as a new leader. Am I the asshole for that?",

I always had a pretty good bond with her growing up, and we were living in different small apartments, just us two, for as long as I can remember.\n\nNow, everything changed once I started a serious relationship and soon thereafter wanted to move out to live with my boyfriend (I was 19 at the time).\nFrom the moment I started speaking about my plans, she got upset, saying that I am not allowed to move out and that she thought I would stay with her at least until I finish University. \n\nI tried talking to her about it over and over, but she kept saying that she forbids me to move out. We had multiple arguments at that time, some ended in her screaming at me, saying I was a horrible daughter for leaving her alone and that she will DISINHERIT me if I should move out.\n\nI did actually move out, mostly with the help of my friends and my grandparents. She didn't talk to me for weeks and only once or twice visited me and my bf in our apartment. \n\nOur relationship has been very tense since then and I feel like she tries to let her anger out on me every time I see her (which is mostly for the holidays etc). She has even gone so far as to say to my face she's happy that one of our pets died in my time of grief. (Because she was against us having pets in OUR apartment).\n\nIt has been more than  4 years since I moved out,I am still happily living with my bf,  but sometimes I still feel very sad, thinking about all the horrible stuff she said to me and trying to figure out if I am really such a terrible daughter for leaving her. This event has been tough on me, so I thought maybe hearing other people's opinion wouldn't hurt.",

      "description": "So I (29M) have this really good and considerate friend, J (28F).  She set up a trip this year to Bonaroo with me, a close friend, and one of her random friends, A (26F).  Now J has been trying to hook me up with A, and I was receptive to the idea because she's cute and she was cool the few times when we hung out.  She's not interested in a relationship right now, and I told her that was cool, lets be friends.\n\nfeel like we need to get to know each other since we'll have to spend a week together, and she's expressed that she feels the same way, but in no way do her actions reflect that.  I've tried four times to get her to hang out and she's always busy.  Cool, I'm understanding, but she has never invited me to hang.  I text her and try to get to know her, she gives short answers and usually just stops responding.  Yesterday I thought, I'll send a joke to break the ice, she did not respond at all.  Keep in mind, she had  asked J why I wasn't trying to be friends with her, why I wasn't texting her, and that she really wanted to get to know me.\n\nI'm normally a long fuse kind of guy, but I find the whole thing to be widely inconsiderate and it's pretty frustrating.  This morning, I decided to be straight with her about how I feel so I texted her, \"Jesus fuck do you ever make it hard for people trying to be your friend.  Like holy shit, buddy, you're about as hard to talk to as a bear fucking a goose.\"\n\nI feel mostly validated in my feelings, and I've been nothing but nice up to this point. I would say the same thing to any of my friends, who all know that I'm blunt.  I'd rather air the issue than skirt it passive aggressively.  J says this is totally out of character, for A, so I feel like maybe I was too harsh.",

      "description": "This is one of those situations that happen frequently on tv but you could never imagine it happening to you.\n\nI have been dating my ex sister in law for five months now. Its been secret, passionate, and wonderful. I am 27, she is 24. She divorced my 30 year old brother a year ago after four years of a dysfunctional marriage.\n\nI knew her throughout that entire time, and we never crossed any lines since im not a cheater and neither is she. We did joke, we talked, we became best friends. She and myself have similar outlooks on life, we share the same politics and humor, we know almost everything about one another.\n\nShe and my brother were not compatible to say the least. My family comes from a small southern background and my brother hates that part of himself and thinks hes \"above that\". He made my sister in law move to NYC so he could pursue his teaching career but she hated the city.\n\nWhen they met he was out of college and wasnt as much of a snob, he had fun then and wasnt afraid to go outside in shorts and flip flops.\n\nNow hes like Patrick Bateman, obsessing over material things, looks, appearances. He has no joy in his life. Im not saying this to make anyone hate him, but my then sister in law was completely different.\n\nThey had a bad breakup, and initially i stayed away, but we were best friends for so long that i decided to message her. We instantly hit it off, and now I can say that i do love her very much. I think i found my soul mate.\n\nI havent told anyone except my sister and mother. My mom thinks i shouldnt be dating my brothers ex wife, my sister thinks i shouldnt be keeping it a secret from my brother. I feel like the past is the past and if we love eachother, thats enough.\n\nAm i the ass.\n",

      "description": "AITA if I dont move rooms?\n\nI am at a college where you have to share a very small room with another roommate unless you are lucky and get one of the very few single person rooms. The rule at this college is under-18s are not allowed to share with over-18s. Recently I became over-18 and have moved out the room I was in (which had 4 roommates) and into a room by myself.\n\nMy old roommate from last year, John, is also over 18 so we were not sharing but were expecting to after I turned 18. I expected this because I had been told by the head of education that I will most likely move in with him and his current roommate, Steve, will move into a room on his own.\n\nOn the day I was moving I saw that I was going into a single room and I went and checked with the head of accomodation if they had moved me correctly into my own room and they said yes it was all planned. I then told John who said I should try to see if I could move in with him and switch with Steve. I said that I didnt want to do this because I was so lucky to get a room on my own and did not want to lose it. A couple of day later I get called in to talk to the head of education and he asks if I would be okay giving my single room to my John and moving in with Steve who I am not very close with (he is also a bit of a bad roommate very messy and kinda creepy). Luckily I did get a choice in this and I said no I am happy where I am.\n\nMy main question is if I am the asshole for not moving in with John or is he for attempting to move into my single room?\n\nSorry if this is a bit of a rambly post I dont often comment but if there is any qestions or I dont make sense anywhere please ask me to clarify.",

      "description": "Ok so some context here. I met one of my 3 best friends in 8th grade, we can talk to each other about anything and we have a lot in common and relate to each other easily. We’re like two peas in a pod and I love him to death no homo. However, he’s always been the overthinking type, assumes the worst is going to happen, and is VERY chatty. I’m more on the quiet side, I’m more stoic in my thought process and I suck at small talk and conversations in general. Despite these differences we’ve had similar experiences, we know we can trust each other, and we click very easily, which is why we’re best friends. We hang out a lot during the weekends with our group of friends, and we enjoy each other’s company. However, I usually have rugby a couple days a week right after school, and when I don’t I go and lift with another one of my 3 best friends. The thing is though, we just go and lift, it’s not like we would chill at each other’s houses after. I generally don’t like to hang out with people during the week because I just wanna go home and call it a day after having to deal with people I don’t like and waking up at an ungodly hour. \n\nBack to my original friend. He always wants to FaceTime, and don’t get me wrong I’m happy to talk when we’re together in person, but when we FT it always drags out to at least 45 minutes, and it’s mostly him doing the talking. I find the fact that the conversations take so long to be annoying, and I have confronted him about this and he did say he’ll try and keep them shorter. It actually did the first two times but then it reverted. It just gets annoying when he calls me when I’m doing homework or something because I know I’m dedicating an hour or so to this, when after school+rugby I really just want to be by myself, chill, and unwind. \n\nI’ve told him I don’t like FTing because the conversations always stretch out and I ask him to just tell me what he needs to say on Snapchat unless it’s urgent. But I’ve been thinking about whether I’m really being a good friend or not, because this could be taken as “Jimbussss is only there for me when it’s convenient for him.” After realizing this I’ve been feeling really feel bad saying no to him so I’ve just been saying shit like “I have hw” or “Rugby was a bitch today I’m tired asl.” I really don’t want a trivial issue like this to spoil the great friendship we have and I don’t want to lose a person who’s made my life so much better because of this. I’m super confused on how to handle this going forward as well. ",

      "title": "AITA For Keeping My Cat Indoors?",
      "description": "Hello folks, I've got a bit of classic \"family drama\" here that I hope serves as a good post for this sub. I apologise if I ramble a bit!\n\nI bought my own first pet around six months ago - an awesome Maine Coon kitten I imaginatively named \"Luna\". She's such a joy to keep as a pet, and brought so much happiness to a somewhat dark spot of my life. As per her vets advise, now she's six months old I've had her booked into being neutered and getting a track chip for her in a few weeks time.\n\nFor context, I'm still kind of young and live with my parents. As such, there are times I'm out of the house working when my cat and my family are home together. Recently,  I ended up arguing with them all about how I intend to keep Luna as a house cat. This decision mainly stems from how all three cats my parents have owned in the past unfortunately passing away due to car accidents. We live in a relatively urban area, so there can often times be a lot of traffic by where we live. In addition, a lot of our neighbors own big adult cats that I worry would attack Luna if left to her own devices, not to mention the large number of dog walkers we have in our area.\n\nRecently, my parents have seemingly tried to guilt trip me, talking about how she is \"desperate to go outside\" and urging me to hurry up and get her neutered and chipped so she can do so. I stood my ground and said that Luna will be a house cat. Well, to that my parents reacted badly, saying that to do that would be cruel and inhumane. Not only that, my Mom has outright stated that she intends to let her out \"if she wants to go out\" regardless of my wishes. It's led to argument over argument on the topic, causing me to doubt myself more and more.\n\nPart of me certainly feels bad about restricting her to only the house, but it's not like our house is small or anything. I'd even be willing to \"walk\" her, depending on how she took to that. I know for a fact that if I let my cat that brings so much joy to my life outside, and something terrible were to happen, I'd be furious and upset with myself. Are my folks right in calling me the asshole for how I intend to treat my cat?\n\nTLDR; AITA for insisting my cat remains a house cat, despite my parents claims of \"cruelty\" to do so?",

She gets annoyed and says is it a yes or no. I suggest maybe with a walk in the morning the dog will be okay and she hung up on me.\n\nWhen I later went home to get my stuff she told me I had really pissed her off and I should have just said yes to looking after the dog. She said I was being cruel and if she wanted to she could tell me somethings that would really upset me but she decided not to. She said she has found someone to be with the dog but I should have put her through the extra hassle. \n\nI feel really guilty about leaving the dog and maybe I should have just said yes because I probably could have come back in the morning. It’s annoying because my mum knew for weeks that I was going on holiday and knew because of this the dog would be on his own because of her working times.\n\nAm I the asshole?? \n\nTLDR \n\nMy mum asked me to look after my dog even tho she knew I was going on holiday the next day and I had other plans but now I feel extremely guilty.\n",

      "description": "So my sister-in-law got married. She is not one for society’s norms when it comes to arbitrary rules. She isn’t rude but doesn’t buy into etiquette for the sake of etiquette. She and her husband, also aren’t to big on the fluff of marriage so when it came to planning their wedding they kept things as minimal as possible. The parents that were paying took over and things turned out amazing but it wasn’t the intentions of the married couple. \n\nHere is where I come in, the couple really didn’t want much as they are already established adults. But I dabble I’m graphic design and said I could help them make them make their invitations, order them on Vista Print, and save them(their parents) a lot of money.  They knew that they would get gifts anyway, but on the back of the invitation, they put “The only presents we want is your presence.”\n\nI thought I was being funny and obviously joking, but during the design part I said, “Can we put a little disclaimer suggesting Hulu Plus if they insist on a gift?”\n\nTheir lack of understanding of etiquette in these matters made it sound like a good idea to them and they endorsed the suggestion. They are big tv fans so they didn’t think anything was wrong. \n\nFast forward to last weekend, they got a little bit over $6000 of Hulu Plus gift cards from their wedding of 220ish guest...and also cash and other gifts,\n\nClose family was initially upset I made the invitations with this suggestion because everyone expected most people giving cash and it is rude as hell to request a gift on the invitation even if it is on the back. But now that cash they planned to expect, is tied up in Hulu gift cards, people are now more or less furious with me. \n\nAm I an asshole for not being the hand of reason while helping them plan their wedding?\n\n",

      "description": "She's actually my ex, we broke up on pretty good terms. We still talk sometimes, but this was definitely part of the reason we split. This has just always bothered me so I want to hear what some other people think.\n\nBasically, we had been together for about 6 months when I found out I had a great opportunity in another state. I knew that she alone was not enough to get me to stay (hadn't been together that long), and that I wouldn't be comfortable asking her to come for the same reason. Also, I knew it would be like a year until I actually left. So I figured I would tell her, and since I was happy with her and wouldn't be leaving for a while, it would be up to her whether we stayed together and see how it went, or broke up.\n\nAround the same time, her mom (who she was really close to) got sick. Like real sick. Like, dying. I knew I had to tell her my plans but it didn't seem like the right time. I actually talked to my therapist about it and she told me not to tell her.\n\nWell, her mom eventually passed and about 6 weeks later when she was doing a bit better I told her. I was upfront about my reasons for the move, and why I didn't tell her sooner. She was pissed because honestly is one of our core shared values, and tells me I should have told her anyway. I told her what my therapist said, that I should wait, and that I really struggled with it. I also said that I felt it was easy to say \"you should have told me\" after the fact.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

I’m not a super religious person by any means, and I don’t care that my fiancé drank in the past, but I am so uncomfortable at the idea of him drinking again. He said that he wanted to go out and drink alcohol and that drinking and getting drunk are two different things. I said I know that, but I am still uncomfortable at the idea of it. It shocked me how casually he said it, and I tried to reasonably talk to our with him, saying I was caught off guard by this sudden want to go out and drink and uncomfortable with alcohol.\n\nI have heard bad stories about alcohol. Especially when it comes to relationships, men getting drunk often and coming home late, alcoholism, and cheating. I know this is not something that happens every time someone goes out to drink. I know people are not always going out with the thought of getting drunk, and not everyone makes terrible mistakes when drunk. He even told me he is really good at holding his alcohol and doesn’t really get drunk. But I have terrible anxiety and know that I would be a mess if he did. \n\nI told him I would be uncomfortable with him going out and drinking, and he thinks I think he is just going to go out and get drunk. Which isn’t exactly the case. I tried to be very calm, and explain why I was upset by it, but he called me a bitch and controlling. I wasn’t saying he can’t go, I was saying I would be uncomfortable with it. \n\nI took some time to just think and decided I would offer to him that maybe he could take me out to drink some time that way I could at least have a bit of the experience (since I have never tried alcohol- I know, not many people can say that). To be honest I have always been curious though, but I know the side affects of getting drunk and was nervous about those, but my family would be very disappointed in me. \n\nSo I offered that when I visit him in March (we are in an LDR) he could take me out and we could try. At first he thought I meant me go with him while he drinks and watch him, and said he doesn’t need a babysitter. I explained that’s not what I meant, and I would try it, and he said he was very surprised and caught off guard. He just kept saying “interesting, very interesting”.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for not wanting him to go? ",

      "description": "Okay so I (16M) am the second of 7 children to 2 parents who are still together. My parents and I have always had a shaky relationship, mostly due to the fact that my parents have a toxic style of parenting, as phrased by my therapist. \n\nThis takes place over this past Friday and Saturday. My parents decided that they wanted the 9 of us to watch several hours of family videos over these two days and I didn’t want to. As I explained to them, watching the videos with me in them always result in my parents/siblings taking shots at my masculinity and making fun of me for sensitive topics that have been recorded on camera. Additionally, one of these videos was my circumcision and I really don’t feel comfortable watching that video, nor do I with my siblings seeing this (Don’t ask why this was videoed- I have no idea). My parents said that it’s a family thing and I should suck it up and take part. Friday night, after dinner, my mom sets some videos up on our TV. Everyone goes to watch and I opt to sleep instead. Around 5 minutes after I went to bed, I was asleep. My father came into room and said that I need to come watch or I’m grounded for two weeks. Thing is, I was asleep at the time, so I didn’t respond. The next day, after a family lunch, my parents put some more videos on the TV. I began to head towards my bedroom and my dad said I’m obligated to watch. He said I’m grounded for ignoring his comments from the previous night (the ones I was asleep for) and I need to watch these videos. I told him that I wasn’t going to watch them. He screamed at me, saying that I’m less involved with our family than anyone else in the house and that I need to spend more time with them. I said that I’m actually a huge part of the family, in fact I’m  more a part of it than he is. He continues yelling, saying that I’m wrong and I look for every opportunity to avoid spending time with my family. I responded by telling him that there’s a difference between wanting to spend time with my friends and ditching my family. Seemingly ignoring my calm tone of voice, he continues his shouting, now saying how I’m avoiding my responsibilities and an all around piece of shit. He claimed that no one’s ever told me that because I’m so controlling and I’d snap at them if they did. I sarcastically asked “oh, so you’re the saint who’s going to speak for everyone and take on the wrath of the enraged fagaaron?” He yelled at me for being disrespectful so I, knowing that he’s a deep down sensitive man, said that I’d trade him in for my best friend’s dead dad any day of the week. With that, I went to bed and was ignored by him for the rest of the day. \n\nThat’s my story, Reddit, so with that I ask:\n\nAm I the asshole?",

When you’re drunk” and than she would repeat the drunk part over and over again as if I’m not a fun person when sober. \n\nAt the funeral of my grandfather, me and my nice cousin just wore sober black outfits, but then my annoying cousin came into the room with high heels and a tight shirt at a freaking funeral. She just loves places where our family and friends get together so that she can show off.\n\nShe would always say “ooooh my hands and my legs are sooooo white1!!1!1”. We’re an asian family, so being white gets you a lot of compliments. She would then say things by using me to look better “oooh jessobama, you have such dark legs! I tried to tan, but my legs just won’t get darker!” Okay, maybe you could think that she’s actually giving a compliment, but she uses a shitton of whitening products.\n\nI once told her that I’m considering to cut my bangs into a pony. She was like “yeah it would look good!” Few weeks later she would say “My cousin from Italy wants to have bangs, but I said it wasn’t a good idea because she has a short forehead.” Notice that I also have a short forehead that she once commented on. \n\nI have an iPhone 5 because my other phone got stolen so I used this as reserve. If it worked, then it worked. My cousin would then ask me things like “Will you get a new one soon?” I said no because I have to pay it myself and the phone still worked, so I didn’t see any problems. She would then say things like “are you sure?” “Your father is the richest of the family, why wouldn’t he just buy one for you?”. I grew up with the idea that you can’t just throw money around, but her father always gave her the newest model of phone so I think I understand where she got that spoiled attitude from.\n\nAlso during summercamp, I told them that I was very insecure about my bellyfat so I wouldn’t dress in front of them. My annoying cousin would then walk around naked in our room because “cousins shouldn’t be afraid to be naked around eachother 1!1!!1” I have nothing against the female body because I am a female, but seeing someone else naked isn’t something I prefer because that image stays. She really just wanted to show off her body when I was insecure, because when i did have the confidence to wear a bikini and to go swimming, she would lay in her bed and wouldn’t want to go swimming.\n\nWorst of all is, I realized that she’s just incredibly insecure. She also said that she had boulimia to me and my other cousin. I understand that that’s not fun, but if she stays so arrogant, I really don’t want to hang out with her anymore. I once ignored her for a few months to see how she maybe would realize that she got an arrogant attitide, but then she started to cry because I didn’t want to talk with her. After a few months I did start talking with her, but nothing changed. I tried to talk about her arrogance, but she would make excuses that she’s insecure. \n\nMaybe I’m seeing her in a way too negative light, and the things that I think about her is too far fetched. Am I the asshole for thinking this way about her actions?\n\n",

      "description": "This might get slightly complicated.\n\nI am a harp student in a music school. Every 6 months there is a performance assessment where the principal of the school hears a piece and critiques it. One of these assessments was last week.\n\nI have been with this school for years but only because I was forced to continue learning the harp by my parents. My passion is absolutely zero.\n\nBecause of this, I didn’t practice enough (yes I am the asshole for doing this) and I couldn’t finish a piece in time for the assessment. In the end, I prepared a previous piece I already shown the principal for the assessment.\n\nThe day comes and I play the piece to okay standards. But just when I was about to go back to my seat, the principal asks me to take out the unfinished piece to play. \n\nNow she knows it wasn’t ready. But she still asks to hear it. I feel embarrassed and anxious as there are other students in the room too and I’m about to play a piece really really badly. \n\nI play the piece. I start and stop, I had no musicality, the notes were all wrong and I feel drained and tired at the end.\n\nThat is when the principal starts critiquing it. She barely gave a comment on the first piece before ripping into the second one. \n\nNow because of my lack of passion, I mostly learn how to do things by listening to other people. (Yes I know this isn’t right.) So when she started asking me about phrasing and how I phrased the piece, I had no answer for her as I always just followed what sounded right when others played it. \n\nThis is when she started to get angry. When I said I didn’t understand, she said ‘You can do it! You’re just showing me attitude like you always do!’ But she didn’t understand that the reason I could do it before was because I listened to other recordings for hours! This relatively new piece hadn’t sunk in yet and I felt so hopeless as I didn’t have a satisfactory answer for her. \n\nI kept on trying to explain through angry tears why I couldn’t do it and she kept saying that I could and was just doing it because of my bad attitude. \n\nBecause I was so emotional I forget what most of our exchange happened but it became a shouting match. I remember her saying:\n\n‘So embarrassing.’\n‘You SHOULD be crying.’\n\nIt is this week. And I go for lesson as usual. My teacher informs me that the principal has decided to drop me as a student. She says that if I write a message begging her to take me back, she may consider it. \n\nI just...don’t know and need some neutral opinions.",

      "description": "So my ex and I broke up about a month ago, and we were still living together in a studio apartment. Recently we got in an argument and he decided he can't stay in the apartment with me anymore. The problem is neither of us can really afford to move out. He's claiming he can afford the apartment on his own, but I made his budget and I know for a fact he can't. We both knew going into this apartment that breaking up was a potential outcome.\n\nThe options he gave me where I move out, and pay rent at two place in a very expensive city. I move out and don't pay rent at the current apartment, but I still have to worry about finding a new place and a new roommate. He moves into his friends house and crashes on the couch (which is only on the table for a week or two).\n\nMaybe I'm being a jerk, but I'm okay with living together still. EVERYTHING in the apartment is mine, and I would have to get a moving truck. Which would be a cost on top of a security deposit and first months rent. Also most places where I live require you make 3x the rent, and I have a cat. I just can't afford to move out right now with all of that, even if he pays full rent here. I would have to save up for a few months before I had the money to do that. \n\nHe's acting like I am being unreasonable, and I should just move because he doesn't want to be around me. While I feel that he is making that decision and I am not going to take out a loan so he can be more comfortable. I know this situation is incredibly hard for him, and he literally feels like he can't be around me \"because he feels guilty for all the things he's done\". If he wants to find a place and continue to pay rent here that's fine, because he signed a year long lease here. I just don't think I should get pushed into moving and or paying more because he wants out.\n\nA side note, when he broke up with his last ex girlfriend she moved out because she didn't want to be around him. He was mad when she didn't want to continue to pay rent, and he made her keep paying after she moved out because she made the decision to move. Part of that, he said, was because she knew the risk of moving in together and it wasn't his responsibility that she moved out. I feel like this is a similar situation, but now he has switched sides.

      "description": "I'm a junior in high school. I have been a part of this team (I don't want to specify what because if I did it could be easily traced to me n I am paranoid) for 3 years and have become the leader. My co-leader has been on for 4 years, and he used to be the leader before passing it on to me because he didn't want senioritis to kick in. (he agrees with me, along with the people on the team. it's the people outside who don't)\n\nThere is this boy who has been on the team for three years as well. Initially, we would have him out of necessity to make the numbers work, but now we have enough freshmen (who are better than he is) to cut him out of the team.\n\nThis guy is usually late, and he feels like he is entitled to be a part of this team despite everybody who is actually on the team not wanting him. Although me and him are actually friends outside of this, objectively, he is no good, he complains the entire time, he yells at me and the co leader (they have issues), and is angry that I usually let this one sophomore do a lot because he is actually really responsible and when I quit (tradition has a junior in charge) I need someone to take over. He says that I'm the asshole because he has been loyal to this team for three years and wants to take this to the coach. His mom - once again, I'm actually friends with him - has called me telling me that he has always been good to me (which is true) and that I should just give him the spot since he has always been on this team and he is, despite being pretty trash at it, the third most experienced. I've also been told that I'm an asshole for not giving him any jobs (co leader trains newbies, the sophomore is in charge of equipment, those are the two jobs) because \"maybe then he would feel useful.\"\n\nHe did not go to our last competitions due to grades, but we have one more and he is taking it to the coach if I don't put him on.\n\nMay I note that we placed at one of our last competitions without him. We had not placed in our event in eight years.\n\nIt is ultimately my choice as to whether or not I take him - and if numbers allow for it, I do not want him. He is unreliable and pisses off most of my team (him and co leader don't get along. at all, they have constant pissing matches and usually co leader is right. I'm the only one ON the team that does not hate him). \n\nHowever, once again, I also know he is one of my more experienced people and throwing him off is questionable, especially because I will be replacing him with a freshman who is also questionable but it's more excusable because 1. he is trying and 2. he is a freshman, he is still learning.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to take this guy?",

      "description": "Using a throwaway so my friend doesn't see this.\n\nI (16M) have a good female friend who we'll call Danielle(16F), who I've been friends with for almost 10 years now. Danielle and I did a lot together growing up, and up until like 6 months ago we were inseparable. However 6 months ago she hooked up with a boy we'll call David (17M), and the time we spend together has decreased considerably. I’m fine with this, and I couldn't be happier for her finding someone who really cares about her in a way I can't.\n\nHowever, what I'm slightly irritated by is him tagging along to almost everything Danielle and I do. It seems like anything I try to do with her he's always there, and I can't have any alone time with my best friend anymore. I ask her to meet up in a study room at the library to work on Math and English while we chat, and she responds with “David and I will be there in a minute,” or I invite her to the movies to see the new release of things we wanted to watch before David was even in the picture, and when she arrives in the theater David is holding the popcorn for them to share. I told Danielle about this and asked as calmly as possible “Do you think David has to be at everything we do?” To which she responded by telling me she thinks I'm just jealous.\n\nHere’s where the story really comes to a head. Danielle's birthday is on Sunday, and I was proud of the gift I planned for her (a new pair of earrings to replace one's she lost at my house some time ago), and we've had plans for her 17th birthday since about a month after her 16th. Well David tells me this morning point blank that he's doing something special with Danielle on Sunday and that I'm not welcome to be in attendance. I ask if I can drop off my gift to her and leave then. He says just give him the gift and he'll give it to her Sunday from me. Me being the unsuspecting sucker that I am agreed.\n\nAfter school today however, I see who else but David and Danielle in line for the bus. David says something along the lines of he has an early gift for her to hold her over till Sunday, and lo and behold, it's the earring box I handed off to him. I had to sit there in complete disbelief at the fact that he just did that. (On the bright side though, she loved the gift) About an hour ago I texted her telling her about this, and she has refused to believe a word of it. She thinks I'm a liar when I tell her the earrings were from me, and she thinks I'm just being jealous still, but no she also called me an asshole for accusing David of stealing.\n\nI'm so fed up with David and everything surrounding him, but I feel like I may lose my best friend over it at this point. I want to know if anything I'm doing is too far so I can stop things before I lose my bestie.\n\n\nWell reddit, work your magic, AITA?\n",

      "description": "Last month was the best month of my life- after years of busting my ass, I finally got a likely letter from Columbia. As a black woman who went to a predominantly white school (PWI) and the first person in my family to go to college, this is a REALLY big deal for me. I’m still so excited I can’t stop smiling :). \n\nThe issue here is that I’m in a group chat with 5 other students at PWIs in my city (not gonna specify, but very large and well known), and a lot of us got into top 50 schools. We discussed having a black student only graduation event, and inviting other black students and their families (we think we can get around 20 graduates). We want to invite kids from the lower income inner city elementary schools so they can shoot for the stars. \n\nYesterday, I managed to secure a venue at one of the public schools in my city. I was extremyl excited, and rushed to tell my friend Kate. Kate is one of my best friends at my school, and she is usually on board when I talk about diversity initiatives. But this time, she said “you know (my name), I’ve been holding this in for a month, but I got into Brown yesterday and the fact that you’re excluding all the other people who achieved their dreams and having your own special ceremony disappoints me.”\n\nI tried to explain to Kate that the event was mainly to inspire black kids, but she asked me why not inspire all kids to shoot for their dreams. I pointed out that black kids tend to go to shittier schools with less opportunities, and need role models who made it. However, Kate just told me that all kids need role models, and implied I was an asshole for even thinking about this event. \n\nSo reddit- am I the asshole?\n\ntl;dr: Want to have a faux-graduation ceremony for black students to recognize their achievements and inspire at-risk youth. However, since my event does not include all races, my friend Kate called me out for being unfair. AITA?",

      "description": "Alright so I think this has asshole behavior on both sides but here it goes.\n\nMy bf is best friends with a girl, we will call her L. L and him play music together and he will hang out with her for hours and they get drunk and play music together, usually a couple of times a week. This is a relatively new friendship--a few months, they met working together. In the beginning I would get mad because he would get super drunk at her place and end up staying over - happened a few times a month. I know its not a cheating thing (really guys, it's not), but it still had my jealousy meter going. I am open minded and I have guy friends, and also very much value my autonomy, so as not to be hippocritical, I pretty much worked through these emotions to just get over it. For reference, I hadn't met her yet at this point.\n\nWe met around Halloween for the first time, and it was fine. Hung out a couple of times since then. I like her and I am glad they are doing something crwayjve together. Apparently she suffers from anxiety (my bf does as we) and is somewhat intimidated by me.\n\nAnyway so last night we were all hanging out together... And I weirdly felt like the third wheel. The majority of the night they were talking to each other, talking about inside jokes, that weren't relevant to me, not including me in the conversation, etc. I don't really blame her for it though, more him for not facilitating balance. After some drinks we were all walking back to our place and I told him \"you should just be with her\". \nSeeing how they were together, how she seems to have more patience for some of his no longer endearing antics (we've been together 3 years and his eccentricities can be obnoxious at times), and feeling left out the whole night revved up my jealousy and made me feel insecure. I obviously didn't mean it but it is what it is. Thinking about it now, I probably said it wanting reassurance.\n\nHe said or did something reassuring and it was a little better. Then we went to our place and they played music the rest of the night (drunkenly, not that great, repeating the same song over and over), which again was a 2 person thing.... Not including me at all.\n\nSo today he told me that what I said really upset him. I was pretty incredulous because I feel like i am the one who should be upset at him for third wheeling me all night. Not only that... But he TOLD HER what I said. So what could've been a conversation between my bf and I talking about how I shouldn't be jealous and how he should do a better job including me when we all hang, now has escalated, which will make it even less likely that L and I will have a decent relationship--it's just awkward now. \n\nSo now he's mad at me and acting like all of this is my fault, when I see multiple areas that he screwed up. Sure i said something stupid but is it really that bad? \n\nTLDR: My bf has a good friend and band mate who is a girl. After all three of us hanging and drinking, I got jealous because they were third wheeling me all night (leaving me out of conversations/Inside jokes/playing music together instead of hanging the three of us) and I told him \"he should just be with her\". Now he's pissed I said that and it's getting blown up (he also told her what I said) , but I still think what he did was shitty, and that he is mostly in the wrong. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "First off, let me start by saying that my partner is a lovely human being. Our personalities are absolutely opposite but I have no doubt that he is crazy about me and I am about him. \nI am communicative and expressive in general, and I tell him if something bothers me or if I feel something. The problem is that he will not be emotive or expressive, he is never extremely passionate or vocal. In short this leads to many situations that leaves me disappointed. I know he tries, but there are so many times where I would like him to give me priority or think of doing something that would delight me and go that extra mile. (I know this sounds full of it but I do these things for him quite often)\n\nJust so that you see both sides of the story, he is extremely practical, kind, patient and down to earth.\n\nThe feeling of small disappointments is eating into me and I find myself questioning this relationship. AITA for bejng petty or something ? \n\nThanks for the inputs everyone. If you have any stories like this, do share so I gain some perspective \n",

      "description": "From time to time I browse some right-wing \"news\" websites out of a morbid sense of curiosity and, if I am feeling especially masochistic, I take a look at the comment section to see how the other half is looking at things.  \n\nOn one site, I kept seeing a particular poster make what appeared to be encouragements for political violence against Democrats, feminists, and liberals/progressives in general.  Nothing that could be construed as a direct threat of violence against anyone in particular, as I suspect he was smart enough to recognize that would cross a legal line, but lots of generalized \"It's time Trump started hanging Democrats as traitors,\" wishing for feminists to be subjected to sexual violence, hoping for prominent Democratic politicians to be killed, etc.  Really lovely stuff.  \n\nI was pretty surprised that the website, which would consider itself a voice of reason among the great unwashed, allowed that kind of thing to go on, but it did.  After seeing this person making these kinds of comments for some time, I Googled his screen name and found that his account name linked directly to his Twitter and Facebook page with his real name. A Google search of his real name linked directly to his place of employment, a government agency at which he held a professional position, with all the contact information of his employer.      \n\nWhat to do with this information?  After the recent pipe bombings and threats of political violence in the news, and seeing this person escalate his rhetoric in response, I decided that if this person wanted to put this kind of thing out into the world, he could no longer do so anonymously.  I emailed a collection of about a month's worth of his most egregious comments to half a dozen of his co-workers and supervisors at his agency, asking if they were aware their coworker was spending his work hours saying these things.  \n\nA week later, the person's account was deleted, and his position in the state agency listed as \"vacant.\"\n\nI could have DM'd him on Twitter to give him a chance to stop, but I didn't.  I probably knew that by doing this he would likely lose his job, and I did it anyway.  I did so because I was aghast at the kind of dehumanizing and dangerous rhetoric he was putting out into the world, but if I am being honest I probably also did it to take some satisfaction in sticking it to someone like him whose views I find so abhorrent.  \n\nSo, am I the asshole for doxxing this guy?

      "description": "Title pretty much says it all. I have two headsets, one is worth $90 and the other is $40. He broke his headset awhile ago so I let him use my extra headset (the $40 one). He ended up breaking the microphone piece off so you can't talk anymore. He never told me and I just found out through another roommate. \n\nI dont even play PS4 that often so I barely use my newer headset now, but if somehow my newer headset broke then I would want to use the old one. Now I can't.\n\nI told him I'd even be fine with him being me chipotle once to which he said no. I don't think I'm being unreasonable but he thinks I am.

The reason I don't is often I feel it's unfair on the recepient if I ask how they are, then simply feign interest whilst we have a dull conversation about how they're fine. \n\nMost people I'm close to care about will outright come to me if they have anything of import/interest to tell me rather than expecting me to check up on them every five minutes. My boyfriend despite this things its just the right thing to do, however it's clear lots of people really don't care... Take the other day - he passed by someone he knew when we were leaving his flat and the conversation went as follows:\n\nBf: hey you alright mate?\nFriend: you all right?\n\nThey didn't say it at exactly the same time so it wasn't as if they accidentally over spoke each other, neither actually responded, and then they both just walked off. Am I crazy for thinking this is just a tad bit pointless? Either way, he refuses to get into a conversation with me about it as it drives him mad, so here I am. ",

      "description": "A little back ground: All my roommates are dating someone and are very open and involved with their sexuality(/are sexual beings?) Me on the other hand, I am always the single one. I don't like dating people and I am not a very sexual person and I am just not interested in that stuff at all. I get annoyed and uncomfortable if people express PDA around me or talk about their partners in a sexual way or romantic way. I think this is fair, but all my friends think it's cute and support each other. And I mean... I support them too, we are all friends and I am glad they are happy. But I just can't be around that all the time. \n\nSo me and my roommates are preparing for the fall/late summer where we are hoping to move into a nicer house together. While we were taking inventory of all the furniture we had, I half jokingly said that I didn't want them have sex in our house especially while I was there, and they all turned to look at me like I was crazy. (Also, there are four of us, and our house has two rooms and a small office. Two of them are sharing and the other one is using the room while I get the office. I don't really mind using the office, but the reason they get the bigger room is because they want more space for when their SO comes over and all my other roommates agreed. I mean, that's gotta be SOME sort of discrimination lmao)\n\nHere's where I might sound like the asshole: All of my friend's SOs live pretty far away and go to different uni at the moment, so they would probably only visit for weekends and holidays. Unfortunately, my friend's parents don't really approve of their relationships so they couldn't go back to either of their houses if they wanted to get off. I feel bad for them, but not that bad for them...I'm paying rent just like the rest of them so it's equally my house and I don't want to sleep in my tiny room hearing them bang each other through the thin walls. \n\nI really really REALLY value privacy and respect, and of course I want us to all be comfortable in our house, but I think that it can't be that hard to go fuck in your car or rent a hotel if you're that horny and desperate...\n\nI know I probably sound like a bitter wanker and maybe I made them seem like horny fucks, but we normally all get along really well and I really like them so I want this roommate situation to work out with no hard feelings. And I really don't want to get pushed around just because I'm single or the youngest in the group...\n\nSo give it to me straight doc, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Alright so there's this girl in my math class that is overweight, and we have this study period that me and some other people in the class go to to review homework. Usually the study period doesn't amount to much and we just talk to each other and have a good time in general. On occasion she'll say I have a small dick or something or that I'm built like a pencil/stickbug/twig/stick. I didn't feel like I was getting offended by these because I'm fine with the fact that I'm a little skinny (i.e. I have high metabolism and run track). However, after like 3 months of this constant pestering she said that my eyes were too big for my head and showed me a picture of a stickbug and said that was what I looked like. I brushed it off with a sarcastic \"Thanks.\". It really bothered me because I knew that I shouldn't say anything back because then I'd be painted as the asshole. However, when she kept going on with the whole stickbug gag, I got sick of it. She'll be G and I'll be Me.  \n\n\nG: Hey, u/Uncle_Gregg, you look like a stickbug and your eyes are too big for you head. I bet your dick is as skinny as you are.\n\nMe: Thanks, G.\n\nG: You're so skinny, this resemblance to the stickbug is actually insane. Your eyes are like the bug's because they stick out and are too big in proportion to it's body.\n\nMe: Well, I guess all of our bodies aren't perfect, huh, G?\n\nG: What's that supposed to mean?\n\nMe: I think you can figure it out. Might have something to do with those daily venti coffees from Starbucks, I'm not sure though.  \n\n\nNow everyone's calling me an asshole. She's saying that I'm fatphobic and that she can't control her weight. I feel kinda bad for saying what I did and I feel like I should have just told her to stop or something like that. I didn't want to tell her to stop because she would've just laughed and said more snide remarks. Now I'm starting to feel kinda bad about my body, which I know I shouldn't be because I'm in pretty alright shape, but after a while you start to kinda wonder if they're right. I don't know, I don't think that I've done anything mean to her besides this, but I guess there is always a possibility of something I said being taken the wrong way (kind of like this situation, but I've never poked fun at her before?). Anyways, I'm derailing, AITA?",

      "description": "Kontext: the last weekend I was on a trip with my girlfriend for 5 days with the last of the 3 staying at her parents home and getting to know them (we are in a long distance relationship). Days before the trip I asked her if it was okay if I worked on some stuff for my Dungeons and Dragons games during the trip as it was an overall 14 hours of train riding and she said okay. Now the weekend was good besides that I got very ill on the third day. I had some tummy ache for a few days already and It got really bad one day, I threw up a lot too. I didn't want to cancel the trip however and pulled through, going to both dinner with her parents and her friends. I felt pretty miserable the last few days but I wouldn't be visiting her home town soon again so I didn't want to waste the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I actually hadn't done any work yet because the first 7 hours on the train we just talked a lot so I had no reason to. Same goes for the 7 hours back except for the last hour before she had to get off. We had nothing to talk about for the last 20 minutes or so already so I figured I could get some work in now else I get bored when I got nothing to do. My gf then started listening to music. Of course I closed my laptop in the last 10 minutes before approaching her station so we had some last time to smooch and cuddle before saying goodbye. So much about that. A few days later I went to the doctor to get my stomach checked. He did not find anything super worrying or irregular but took some probes and would get back to me with it on Monday. Now I told my gf basically everything he said in short Form and said she could ask me for more details in 2 days when we would videochat as I know she is noisy. Thing is I have some big anxiety problems and am an extreme introvert. Spending time with my gf is always exhausting for me because I am so close to another person 24/7 and I told her that's the case. So naturally 5 days without ever an hour to recharge my social batteries alone but instead meeting lots of new people that are important to my gf in a place that I do not know is extremely mentally exhausting for me. So I really needed some alone time after this which is why I didn't want to talk on the phone about my doctor's visit until our video chat.\n\n\n\n\nNow I got a text from her and she is really pissed at me for pulling out my laptop to work in that last hour saying it felt super insulting and hurtful. \nSame goes for telling her we will talk about the details of my doctors visit during our video chat, she says it's super rude to not know what happened during your friend's doctor's visit until 2 days after, even though I really told her all the important stuff that happened. \nShe says she always thought we had different understandings of kindness and not being rude and looks away often enough but this was to much for her. \nAITA?",

      "description": "So I haven't spoken to him about my feelings regarding this, but we have spoken about her. \n\n(If this doesnt fit here please tell me, I'm mainly looking for advice and to see if my feelings are well founded)\n\nFor context, we're in a long distance relationship. His friends girlfriend (whom we'll call V) is the oldest out of his group of friends (shes around 27 while the rest are 23). Me and her are the only girlfriends of the group which consists of 4 guys including my boyfriend. \n\nNow V is well known cheater. I'm just going to go right on out and say it. She's sent pictures of her tits to one of the guys in the group (who is not her boyfriend) and is frequently hanging out with another guy of the group (who is also not her boyfriend and that guy LIKES her). I hate cheaters and I hate V. I honestly believe she loves Male attention and would do alot to get it even if means pulling a group of friends apart.\n\nSo my boyfriend knows my feelings about her, we both don't like cheaters, and we both know that she's shady as fuck. We've had lengthy discussions regarding her behaviour.\n\nAnd V has recently gone back to school again and is taking a course on public speaking or whatever and my boyfriend tells me that hes going to go later to be part of the audience for a project she has to do. \n\nI know this is generally innocent and that I might be irrational but I fucking hate this girl and I dont trust her at all. I dont give a shit if his friends see this or even if she sees this (cause I know they browse reddit but idk if she does).\n\nI think I just hate the fact that he can hang out with another girl willy nilly but not with me.\n\nI dont know what to do. I can't ban him hanging out with her (cause that goes against my moral code even if I do want to lol) and when she hangs out with him, it's always with other people (I.e. his friends), so I can't ban him from being with his friends when she's there because that's a really shitty thing to do.\n\nI know if this situation was turned around, my boyfriend wouldn't like it if I hung out with a serial cheater regardless of who they're dating. But I have no clue what he would say to me regarding that and I have no clue if I should even say anything to him because he already knows I don't like her. \n\nI hate that I'm in a long distance relationship because then I can be there (cause I do often feel sad that I can't even hang out with my boyfriend without flying there first) and would feel better knowing that she wont try anything while I'm there. That's not even saying if she believes my boyfriend to be attractive, for all I know she could think he's ugly but she loves male attention so idk.\n\nSo, AITA for feeling this way? And what should I do about it because I have no fucking clue.\n",

      "description": "So I've been living in my current apartment for 2+ years. For the majority of that time I've had most of my stuff including my TV and consoles in my room while my roommates stuff was in the living room. Never complained about it. \n\nThat roommate moved out prematurely so I was by myself for 4 months in this apartment until my high school friend of 10+ years moved in and told him that his room would be near the living room and my TV would be put there since it would be bare for 4 months. \n\nI decided to put up framed posters that are video game and movie related. I also decided to use this square shelf with 9 cubes in it to put my movies and video games and some stuff I just got from Japan recently, in it. On top of said shelf, I also put my collectible figurines on it since they're video game and movie related as well. \n\nNow my roommate is telling me to take down the figurines because he doesn't want to see them. He also says that it isn't fair that I put up all these posters and put my stuff in the cubed space without consulting him, even though he has nothing to put in them. Not only that, he says that it also isn't fair that I'm using this room more, even though it's not anymore than he would since we work similar hours, and that we should switch rooms. He does have a smaller room but it's not like I kept any of this a secret. \n\nI told him that I moved my TV into the living room because it's the TV that should be in the living room since its 55\" 4K HDR and while he wasn't here for 4 months, there needed to be a TV in there for when people came over. I told him his room was smaller than mine, I told him all this. I cant just change rooms like that. And it's not like I'm stopping him from decorating the living room too, I never said he couldn't. I also never said he couldn't use the living room when he wanted but he never asks nor even tries. Not only that, I was in Japan for 2 weeks and this is the first week in about 3 weeks where I even used the living room. \n\nSo now he wants me to take down my figures and put the *entertainment* shelf near my room. He wants me to not decorate the walls with not just video games or movies even though, again, he doesn't have anything to hang up at the time. His literal words were \"I just want this to be a blank room where I/we can just chill out\". The living room should be lively and it should have the best possible TV in that room. I'm not gonna put everything back because your room is right there, I told him all this before he moved in. So am I the asshole for decorating the living room and using it because my TV and consoles are in it? Should I really just go back secluded in my room because he says so? Even though I've been here for 2 years and 3 months and he's been here for 3 months? ",

      "description": "Let me preface this by saying that I do not put myself out there a lot. I was in high school and was diagnosed with IBD and am definitely insecure. I was 19 at the time of this story. \n\nI met this girl at my job and instantly started having feelings for her. Over time we became good friends. She was really supportive of me and my issues and was just a genuinely nice person. \n\nShe lived at home with her parents (and boyfriend too). Well a couple of months passed and she said that her and her boyfriend went through a rough patch and decided to end things. He was supposed to move out at the end of the semester, end of December.  \n\nAfter she told me the news she started hanging out with me a lot more, and those feeling started coming back. Eventually I bought her tickets to a Nashville predators game. We had a blast, I thought everything was going great. She even some mutual friends saying how she really liked me and would probably start dating me. I was floored. I don't put myself out there a lot and for the first time in forever I felt genuinely wanted and appreciated. \n\nDecember came and her ex was still living at her parents place. She said that he was looking for an apartment down here so he could stay at the same college. Should've been a red flag but didn't think much of it\n\nThen it happened. She went to her OBGYN and had a scan done, and it turns out she had cancer (her family has a history of cancer). I tried to be as supportive as possible. She had surgery to remove the tumors.I was at the hospital for the next few days while she recovered (never saw the ex). When she started chemo I would drop off flowers for her in the morning before she left. I put together gift bags throughout the week and dropped them off at her house. I would make spotify playlists every month with her favorite artists.  Throughout all of this she kept saying how she doesn't deserve me. \n\nNext time I hung out with her, weeks later (she was still going through chemo) I leaned in for a kiss. She pulled away and said that she can't do that with her ex still living there (at this point its been about 8 months since they've \"broken up\"). I asked her why he hasn't moved out yet and she had no reason, just that he's there so there's no way we can date. I just got in my car and left. \n\nI stopped texting her, I stopped bringing by things, and just went quiet. She didn't make any attempt to try and talk to me. \n\nShe ended up beating cancer (TTL for that!). She texted me, asking why I stopped dropping by, and that she \"lost her best friend\" during the worst time of her life.  I basically told her if she were up front about all of this boyfriend nonsense that I would've still been there, and how hurt I was, but that the past is the past and that there's no reason to reopen a wound. That I still care about her, but that I am ready to move on with my life.\n\nDid I shamefully leave someone who needed all the love and support they could possibly get? AITA? ",

Courtney got over it within a reasonable amount of time. Peggy has never moved on. Not a huge deal, sometimes you never fully get over shit. The problem is that I can’t share anything in my life with Peggy without her bringing up Courtney. I tell Peggy I’m moving, she wonders how close I’ll be to Courtney. I tell Peggy I’m trying to get pregnant, she says she thinks Courtney and I will be pregnant at the same time. I have the baby, “is Courtney helping you a lot?”. Peggy also used my wedding as a platform to try to get Courtney to finally talk to her. That’s all Peggy could focus on leading up to the big day. She even tried to get ahold of me during my honeymoon to see if I’ll help her write a letter to Courtney when I get back. I had to stop telling her when Courtney and I would hang out. Her reactions would range from anger towards Courtney, to worrying if I am closer to Courtney than I was to her. Other than this, she has been a good friend overall. I loosely called her out on it one time, and the only thing that changed was she became more discrete about how she asks shit. Her obsession seems to have cheaped our friendship and I’ve lost my steam to keep trying. ",

I know there are people that have had it way worse but to me the things he put my through are the main reasons for the MH issues I have today. He continually berated me, and gaslighted me to the extreme of I actually thought I was having delusions and I would have my phone on record everytime I thought he would do something to me. We would both get in trouble for fighting, even though it was nearly always my brother instigating it and I would very rarely retaliate. Thanks for the \"just ignore it\" advice, mum and dad, that didn't do anything.\n\n\nMy brother didn't mature as he got older, he just changed his ways to upset me so my parents would pass it off as petty (on my end) whenever I would get upset. I dropped out of doing medicine at university because of health issues meaning I couldn't study as much as I could for exams. I failed, but am now on a different course which I'm doing much better in.\n\n\nI have a disability which is hard enough to live with anyway let alone study medicine with. But my brother insists I am a retard and deserve to just work in a shop for the rest of my life as that's all I'm capable of. \n\n\nNow onto my partners side. When we started going out, my brother stalked my partners social media, as well as his family's. I've seen texts he's sent to my mum making fun of him, making fun of his education, of his work, of his looks, of his dad etc. We'd only been going out for 2 weeks at this point. \n\n\nWhen we would visit my family over holidays, my brother was malicious to both of us, and there was a big family fight because my brother had referred to him as autistic. My boyfriend was so angry as my brother views autism as an insult. \n\n\nFast forwarding on, there are many other qualities my brother possesses that make him unlikeable. All of my friends hate my brother for the way he's treated them and me. My partner and his family hate him too. I've literally had 7 different friends say that they would love to punch my brother in the face after hearing my stories about him. \n\n\nNow with me recently getting engaged, I yet to tell my parents he is not welcome. They have never really taken my view seriously, rather always seeing me as whiny. I know they will get really horrible about it and tell me how awful I am and how I need to get over myself because \"he's still my brother and he loves you.\" I know that extended family on my side don't know anything about the resentment I have for my brother so there will be a lot of whispers as to how horrible I am for not inviting him to my wedding. I also know it will really upset my parents and put stress on them. \n\n\nSo WIBTA for not inviting him and should I just suck it up and invite him? \n\n",

      "description": "Me and my now ex girlfriend were in a relationship for 1 year and 3 months, for both of us it was the first \"real\" relationship. Previously, both of us only made very bad experiences with relationships and none of them held longer than 2 months. We both have a shitload of psychological problems and ironically, through that we became good friends, someday she told me that she had feelings for me and I also liked her so the relationship started. \nBefore a month she told me that, because of her more intesive getting depression she didn't felt good in the relationship anymore. But we always knew that this could happen anytime and even if it is hard for me until now we cutted it as friends, at least I thought because we talked about that many times before. \nWe're on the same university with very much similar studys so we see us often and have the same friends. I dealed with it and started a regular basic friendship with her. I thought everything is good but the next week's til now she is incredible toxic to me and makes my social life to an absolute hell. I lost the most of my friends because of this but i didn't dare to answer that with similar treatment because we both had our experiences with mobbing and I even got suicidal tendencys bc. Of that. I tell her and ask her to take care about that, she says that she would do and I think everything is good. Next week, nothing changed. I don't know what I shall do now. I think about cutting her out and do stuff similar to her. \nRight now I think about this and don't know further. If I don't do something I'm gonna fell back into depression and mess up my study again,  if I give it back to her I could seriously hurt her and bring her back. Right now I am very angry at her and I prefer to hurt her to save myself.\nI'm begging you, change my mind! ",

      "description": "So I was just on my way out of a carpark pulling on to an extremely busy main road. One of those cases where it's almost bumper to bumper, so in fairness to me you cut a little slack to drivers that are stuck. A tall van was pulling in to the driveway. I figured there was no space beside him so the driver behind him would have to give way to the van, therefore allowing me time to exit left (left side of the road driving here, so I wasn't cutting over a lane to cross side)....\n\nI was wrong. He had obviously sped up around the van trying to quickly overtake him, clearly I should have given way had I realised but it was too late and we were headed for a collision. I ended up fishtailing and speeding past him-after all I was in front of him the whole time unintentionally cutting him off. If I didn't speed up we would have crashed. A fair few seconds after it happened, the guy sped up and tailgated me and I started hyperventilating thinking he was going to road rage hardcore. (I have pretty bad anxiety and a history of panic attacks). I kept driving, and eventually the guy stopped tailgating, and later pulled in to a driveway much to my relief. Watching the dash cam footage, I saw him flashing his high beams at me after the near miss. I realise that maybe he tailgated to get a clear view of my rego. \nThis was still all on a main road with nowhere to turn off for a while, and I was so paranoid he was going to road rage I hadn't thought to pull over. AITA for not pulling over? I'll be honest, I'm not sure if that's standard for a near miss or only accidents? ",

So for the past few years, we've just stuck in our rooms while the relatives came, I mean of course we greeted them and did whatever, but after like 5 minutes, we would just chill until it was time to eat, and then go back into our rooms to play video games or whatever. My dad kind of gets annoyed, but mostly my parents are OK with it.\n\nSo AITA?

      "description": "To start, some backstory. So, me and my old friend (who I'll call X) used to be really good friends. I got upset at X because I felt like he was being a bad friend to me, and ignoring me all the time, so I brought it up to him and we had a friendship ending argument. We had drama going between us for a few months, and I found out he was cheating on his girlfriend with tons of other girls. (By cheating, it should be made clear that he hit on other girls all the time, and convinced them that he loved them, but because he already had a girlfriend, he was just leading them all on and breaking their hearts. My now girlfriend was one of these girls, which I didnt learn until later.) I lost all trust I had for him. \n\nFast forward to recently. My girlfriend and X were already friends, even before we were dating. We are all in high school, so she sees X in school sometimes, but the main place they talk is outside of school, because they are both in marching band after school. I had talked to her about X, and told her that I am okay with them being friends, but I dont want them being super close, not because I don't trust her, because I dont trust him. She agreed that she wont be too close to him, but they would still be friends.\n\nSo, one day, I happened to see her at her practice, and she was talking to X, standing really close together. I didn't mind it too much, but the next day, I saw them again and they were standing way too close for me to be comfortable. I brought it up with her later, when we had some quiet time. She said she was sorry, and blocked him on social media (which I thought was a bit excessive, but I didnt state that to her). \n\nA few days later, we went out to eat, and when I finished, I was looking at her snapchat (not snooping, just saying hi to some people I dont really talk to much myself) and found that she didn't actually block him. We had an argument about it, and it ended up with her fully blocking him and not talking to X at all in person anymore. She didn't want to block X because she didn't want to start problems with him. \n\nI also feel like I should of been more clear of how close I wanted them to be, or not be. I feel like I might of wronged them both. Neither X or my girlfriend is upset at me, (not really friends with X, we just have so many mutual friends that we talk a bit since we figured out our problems) but I still feel wrong about how I handled this whole situation.\n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting them to be friends, and destroying their friendship because I don't trust that he will not act out of line and ruin my relationship?",

      "description": "First time poster, on mobile, TL;DR at the bottoms, here we go!\n\nBackground: I’m a really awkward college freshman taking a Portuguese for Spanish speakers class. The two languages are really similar and people who’ve been exposed to Spanish (or pretty much any Romance language) usually pick it up faster. The professor is really great and the activities she makes us do are really fun. But I suck at socializing. I freeze up, I get nervous, I stumble and I piss people off. This one girl in particular \n\nI’ve had about two interactions with this girl. I don’t know her name, or a whole lot about her, but she has a bit of an attitude: an “I don’t want to be here bc I’m too advanced” kind of attitude. When she introduced herself to the class on the first day she mentioned something about how she had to be placed in this class bc this was the “introduction” course and not the “advanced” course. (Something along those lines, I can’t remember it verbatim.)\n\nOn the first day, the professor gave us introductory sentences ( “Eu me chamo ___ . Como te/você se chama/s?” ) to use and introduce ourselves to other students. The girl walks up to me and uses a different sentence than the one we were supposed to use ( “Meu nome é ___. Eu sou [transfer student/second year student idk]. Como é você nome?” ) I was really confused and I didn’t know how to respond bc I couldn’t hear her and I didn’t really understand what she was saying right off the bat. She kept trying to rush an answer out of me and I told her, “Dame un momento para responder, por favor (give me a moment to respond, please).” She made a face and I stumbled out a response and walked away. I didn’t want to speak to her anymore than I had to.\n\nThe second encounter I had with her happened today and the same thing happened. We were practicing interviews and she walked up to me with a very bored “I don’t wanna be here look” and told be to hurry up and ask her a question. I told her in English, “give me a minute, let me pick one.” I asked my question, she answered; she asked her question, I answered. We went our separate ways. \n\nShe always looks really tired and bored in class, so I’m thinking maybe she works a lot to pay for college and doesn’t get enough rest, so that’s why she has a bit of an attitude? Idk, I don’t think I should’ve been harsh with her. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Girl in Portuguese class keeps rushing me for an answer when we do speaking exercises, but I’m not  a fluent speaker yet. AITA?",

      "description": "Hello AITA, not sure what to say so I'll jump right in. \n\nI'm a junior at university in the honors college. This year I am in a combined literature/history honors class where there is an exit project that makes up 100% of our grade. I am good friends with one of the two professors so she made me team captain of the our presentation group. \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I have been a massive \"ball buster\" in getting people to get to meetings. I expect people to be on time and be productive. I need this A in order to keep my GPA up and I insist that my team help me get it. \n\nBut yesterday afternoon, the absolutely most amazing guy on the planet asked me out late. I am so smitten with him and have been for so long that I couldn't help but say yes. We had an absolutely amazing time and he was the perfect combination of gentleman and fun and I literally fell in love and know he's the guy I'm going to marry (I know this sounds dramatic but it's true). I had the most amazing time in life. \n\nBut I 100% forgot about our team meeting last night. My phone ran out of batteries while I was on the date so I didn't get to see the many (many) texts and calls my team sent me. They were pissed at me. When I finally got home and got my phone charged I texted back \"hey it's ok, I'll send you guys and invite to the wedding!\"  That made everyone even more mad at me and I was just given the extreme cold shoulder in class this morning. My professors want to see me this afternoon, clearly to discuss what happened and I'm scared because I need this A so bad. \n\nI am both on an extreme high from my date last night but equally scared shitless over what might happen. \n\nAm I the asshole for what I did or do I deserve to have a good time once in a while since I've been such a good student?",

To be fair, I don't directly ask questions, more just send conversation starters, but still, he used to respond to those.\n\nSo I was thinking of sending him this message.\n\n\"Hey, serious question.  When you don't respond to the messages I send, is it because you don't want to, you're too busy, or you just don't know what to say?\"\n\nI don't like to not know things because then I stress out about it, but I know he's the kind of guy who expects everyone to just take things as they come, and I feel like he might get mad if I ask him this.\n\nSo WIBTA?",

      "description": "I'm fat. Always been fat. Never been athletic. I was a book reading nerd. It happens sometimes. However, I have a good career, my own home, a paid off car, two lovely cats and a fiance of 4 years. He's Mexican. This is important.\n\nI live in Texas and my mom lives in North Carolina. I work in a financial industry and my typical work clothes consist of all black, black slacks, black cardigan or jacket, mostly black blouses and black shoes. Black matches easily, looks professional.\n\nI text my mom daily (I'm an only child and my dad is dead) and she asked to see my outfit that day. I mixed it up with floral print ponte pants, black top, black shoes.\n\n\"Colors look so slimming on you! They really hide your problem areas!\"\n\nGee, thanks mom. I told her \"How many times have I had to tell you to not make comments about my weight?\"\n\n\"well you just isn't know how to take a compliment, that's how I meant it, everyone has problem areas! That's how I take it when someone says that, now tell me something else shitty!\"\n\n\"I've asked you a dozen times not to make comments about my weight and you never ever ever do\"\n\n\"I hope you show some respect to your new HISPANIC family unlike me\"\n\nShe's made comments before and was real excited when trump was screaming about a wall, so I know she would prefer a white guy for me. I've had to tell her a few times to shut up with the racist shit. Doesn't get me anywhere. She also loves my fiance and is always saying he's a handsome hardworking man and treats me like a princess. I don't understand the logic. \n\nSo I hit her back with the \"Yep, you're a racist old bitch! Leave me alone until you can change your attitude.\"\n\nNow she's pissy and blowing up my phone for me trying to ruin Christmas, saying it's my fault and I have bad language.\n\nAITA for not just letting her spew her bullshit and telling my mom to fuck off at Christmas? If it was a stranger off the street telling me I had problem areas and making backhanded comments about my \"Hispanic family\" I'd tell them to fuck off too. Did I ruin Christmas? ",

      "description": "I come from a large, emotionally dysfunctional family. My sister is the best at this, however she’s always used me as a punching bag. She works hard and provides as much she can for all her kids, but has asked me for advice, input, parenting etc. She’s 11 years older than me, but somehow I’ve ended up having the sex talk with her son after she found porn in his search history (he was 12, I was 20), going to look for her other son when he ran away from home at 16, etc etc. To say that I’ve been over involved is an understatement. Her daughter who is a teenager now has been a handful of drama for a while. I’ve gotten calls before where my sister will complain about her and then give her the phone so I can talk to my niece about what she’s doing wrong. I’ve driven over to their house to help my sister talk to her daughter about her behavior. I recommended therapy for my niece to see if that would help, and when that didn’t help, my sister called me twice yelling at me and telling me she shouldn’t have listened to me because nothing changed. My niece yells at her mom, not doing anything that’s asked of her, smoking pot, skipping class with older guys, having sex (the last 3 things were things she had posted on social media) all starting when she was 14. My sister tends to not discipline until she finally flips out and then feels bad. \n\nDuring the holidays, after spending extended time with my niece and our family, I had had enough of her attitude and told her off (like really tore into her) in front of our family. She then texted me to tell me she didn’t respect me anymore and to never speak like that to her again, and I told her I was tired of her attitude and I didn’t care if she didn’t speak to me ever again, but I was done with putting up with her outbursts. \n\nMy sister called me a couple of days later and we talked about it. I apologized for yelling at her daughter when I shouldn’t have.  I told her that I loved them both, but I just didn’t want to be involved anymore and wanted to focus on my own family.  I had assumed that that was that, and that we (my sister and I) were ok. Initially, it seemed like that. Turns out we’re not and her and her daughter now see me as the common enemy. At family events, they blatantly try to make me feel uncomfortable, like they’re the mean girls from high school. It’s a completely bizarre scenario and everyone in my family agrees that my niece is out of control, but that I should be the bigger person and apologize again. \n\nSo...AITA? ",

      "description": "So Kingdom Hearts 3 just dropped very recently and I’ve been excited for it for however many years it’s been, just like everyone else. I talked to my friend once about how excited I was for and how I can’t wait to get it and everything. He said he was excited too and can’t wait to get it himself.\n\nSo fast forward to when it comes out I excitedly just post how I’m finally able to download the game on Snapchat and can’t wait to play it. My friend sees this and then asks if I’ve game shared with anyone, if not then I should game share with him so he can play KH3.\n\nPart of me wants to be the nice guy that I am and wants to game share it with him, but the other part of me doesn’t want to because he said he’d get it himself, yet he didn’t and so if I did share it with him, I basically would have paid $60 for something he contributed nothing to. \n\nGame sharing works both ways though so as he’d have access to KH3 and my other games, I’d have access to all of his games as well, but unfortunately he has nothing I’d be interested in that I haven’t already purchased for myself. I’m also a little annoyed he didn’t offer up the idea of game sharing for me when we had talked about how I had been saving up to purchase Red Dead Redemption 2.  We have very similar interest in games and I already have more in mind I can’t wait for to come out as the year goes by but I do not want him getting free access to every last one of them, yet I feel like that makes me an ass for feeling that way.\n\nTL;DR - Friend wants free access to a game I paid for that he said he was going to purchase himself, and I’d rather not let him have free access to it.\n",

      "description": "This happened a couple weeks ago. I was at a nice and very busy burger joint waiting on my to-go order to be made, so I sat at the bar and ordered a beer, which cost ~$5.50. I paid $6 to the bartender who gave me my drink, I had my beer and watched some of the games on the TVs. When I finished my beer it occurred to me that I never received any of my change. I kind of figured the barkeep forgot it since, as I said before, they were very busy. Makes sense, right? At this point I still intended on tipping the guy ~$2 for my $5.50 beer.\n\nNow its important for me stop here to note that I've held multiple restaurant jobs where I washed dishes and served tables. Because of this I am never stingy with my tips, and I would also never take a customers money unless they told me to keep it... although I wouldn't do that anyway even if I had never worked in a restaurant. \n\nSo, when he walks back my way I stop him and ask for my change. He practically did a double take at me, and asked in a derisive tone, \"Really? You really want your fifty cents back?\" \n\nAt this point I was peeved, and was assuming this is regular behavior on his part. I responded, \"Yeah. Did you just keep my money without my say?\" He didn't say a word and turns for the register. \"Well you can keep it,\" I said. \"I was going to tip you more until you made the executive decision to keep my money without my say.\" He completely blows me off, gets the change, places it on the bar while giving me a smile exuding passive irritation and says, in the same tone, \"Heres your fifty cents back.\" \n\nI repeated what I told him a second before, then left the change on the bar and made my way over to the other end of the restaurant to pick up my order. As I turned around, a couple of patrons were commenting on the interaction. I didn't catch what they said in its entirety, but they seemed to disapprove of me calling the bartender out like that.\n\nSo AITA for asking for my change back? ",

      "description": "So I just had a very infuriating conversation with my mother this morning about how she will start punishing me for not taking my brother to school, even if it makes me late. So let me explain a little bit:\n\nMy brother takes the bus every morning and that bus comes to his bus stop around 7:15am every morning. He has a tendency to miss the bus due to him being very slow to get ready in the morning. Now we live around 3 minutes from the school, but it easily adds up to 5 or even 10 minutes because of the awful traffic that we encounter when getting to school. So the latest we can leave without either of us being late is around 7:20 because the middle school (my brother) and the high school (me) that we respectively go to are across the street from each other. I park fairly far away from the entrance to my school so it’s another 7-10 minute walk to get to my class from my car. So if I leave around 7:20 with my brother, I am able to drop him off at around 7:25, and then I get to my spot around 7:28. And then I finally get to my class around 3 minutes before the bell rings (class starts around 7:40). \n\nSo this morning it was around 7:25 before I even leave the house so I don’t have enough time to take him to school and also not making me late. So I had to leave the house. Then I get a few very pissed off texts from my mother saying how I should have waited around for my brother and taken him to school, even if it made me late to class. \n\nSo I am wondering if I am being an asshole by not waiting for my brother to leave the house, even if it causes me to be late to class? Obviously if we can both make it on time, then I would be more than happy to take him, but it seems like I have to sacrifice my attendance for him being so slow getting ready in the morning.\n\nSo am I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "My Grandad’s health has been up and down for a while and he’s been in hospital for a few weeks now. We’ve recently been told he has pneumonia and that some of the food he has been eating and drinking (this is very little as he hasn’t been eating well since my Nan passed in 2016) has been going into his lungs. We’ve been asked about a DNR and the doctors have said that he’s deteriorating fast. I’m going to visit him tonight and I’m hoping that things will improve but they aren’t very sure.  \n  \nMy boyfriend lives about 2 hours train ride from me and we see each other nearly every 4 days off he has (he works 4 on and 4 off). Originally he wasn’t supposed to be coming on this 4 off as he had plans to watch the Super Bowl with friends at a pub (were in UK) and was seeing his Dad this Friday to celebrate his Dad’s birthday early since he would be at my house for his actual birthday. We’ve been together for over two years and it breaks my heart that he never got to meet my Nan, he gets on well with my family and I know my Nan would have loved him. I’ve asked him if he could come down this weekend on his 4 days off because of the situation and because we aren’t sure how long my Grandad has left. I’d like him to see my Grandad again before the worst happens (if it does), and if he does pass soon as the doctors are predicting, I would want him here for the support. We’ve just had an argument on the phone about it because I feel he’s being selfish and I’d drop everything in an instant if the shoe was on the other foot. He said he’s paid for tickets for the pub showing and wants to see his Dad as he hasn’t seen him since Christmas. I’ve told him I’m not completely sure if I want to continue because of how he has acted in this situation.  \n  \nI’m not sure if I’m overreacting because of how upset I am currently with my Grandad. AITA? ",

      "description": "Posting from a throwaway. \n\nProbably should add some background info before I just say \"hey I'm the c-word that dumped her loving fiancé!\" but even that may not make me any less AH. I'm looking for honest judgement as I think it might help me in my next relationship. \n\nI'd been dating \"Lenny\" since sophomore year in college. Regardless of what's happened, he is a great guy; he's great looking, great job in finance, amazing with kids, steady while being a lot of fun. We never really fought and when we did I felt we resolved our issues in a pretty even handed manner. I thought I really loved him. He proposed over Easter weekend last year and we were well into wedding planning for this summer. \n\nWe took a trip to Hawaii over his Christmas holiday vacation and we were having a great time. I have no idea why but there was an interaction he had with a waiter where Lenny just seemed like such a weakling, it's hard to explain why it bothered me so much but it was like and instantaneous wave over my body that said \"I really don't love him.\" I faked it through the next 5 days of the vacation but after getting settled in a home I very flatly told him I no longer loved him and I did not want to get married. I do feel bad but it looked like he'd been shot. \n\nWe went through all he standard breakup stuff of him wanting an explanation, wanting to get back together, go to counseling, etc... I did not want any of this stuff. In the background pretty much everyone from our common friends to my own parents and siblings think I'm some sort of awful witch who has started taking drugs. No one will listen that I just don't love him anymore. The worst part about this is that I feel very isolated from everyone I thought I could trust. \n\n\nI have started dating quite a bit and Lenny thinks this is probably proof that I was cheating on him which isn't true at all but since his word is gold and mine is dog shit at this point, it's further poisoned the well with my friends and family. \n\n\ntl;dr: I fell out of love with my fiancé and cancelled the wedding. Pretty much everyone I thought was friends or family has abandoned me. Happy to provide any info if needed. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have a friend i’ve known from childhood for maybe 13-14 years now. She’s from a family that isn’t neglectful but still doesn’t pay much attention to her. \n\nHer dad is black but her mother is white and her mother never tried to help her with her hair. She normally wears it back because people like to try to touch it without asking. \n\nShe’s the type of person who loves to be touched and cared for by friends but her hair is off limits to touch to most people but she doesn’t mind when i play with it absently (the playing w/ hair is a teen girl thing i know) but her hair is kind of, well, unhealthy because she doesn’t know how to care for it. \n\n\nLike most people I get into a youtube rabbit hole and when I was doing that a month ago I saw some women with hair like hers doing styles and curls by washing and wrapping it. \n\nThe styles don’t last more than a week so i was thinking of offering to style her hair because she’s been struggling with mental health and i know that when i struggle new hair gets me out of a funk. \n\n In the moments i’m not amazed watching the videos i’m aware of this “it’s not for me” feeling. The women in the videos tend to jokingly poke fun at white people hair tutorials and styles. I thought about the fact that that i’m a white person and i don’t want to be presumptuous and come across like a racist asshole because i assumed that i knew what was best for her. \n\n",

      "description": "Let me start this off by saying I'm a 25 year old male living at home with his parents and his older brother. My mom has always been a great parent - she's always the one who makes meals for us and does most of the chores at home. I would help around if she would ask, but she rarely does because she's a people pleaser at heart. In that regard, I love her as much as a son should love his mom. She would always put me first, and would treat me like I'm a 14 year old, which I'm getting really tired of. My mom also supports what life decisions I make, and she never really pressures me into pursuing significant careers (especially since I'm of Asian descent).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's where things get weird - my mom is a very judgmental person. She would often criticize other drivers for being terrible, even when they don't necessarily do anything bad. The worst part about this is that she herself doesn't have a driving license. She also can't take criticism well, *at all*. Whenever my dad jokes around, or says things about the meal being not flavourful enough, she would always get defensive and say \"You cook it then\". Even when my dad jokes about her taking too long to shop or whatever, she would never be able to laugh at herself.  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe last, most recent thing that happened was today when my dad was helping my mom with her computer while she was cooking. My mom often likes watching dramas, and she had her internet browser open of the most recent episode she was watching. My dad closed the browser, and when she went back to her computer, she complained and moaned about how she forgot which episode she was on. She commented how if she didn't make dinner, this never would have happened. My dad is a very patient man, and he explained how she could just go to her internet history to find the episode, but she wouldn't listen at all. \n\nOverall, she's a negative person. She has happy moments, but whenever she complains, it just annoys me. Am I the asshole for disliking her? ",

      "description": "Basically I said it during an argument(ish), my boyfriend and I both overslept for college (uk not us so age 16-18), i always wake him up which is why neither of us were up, slept late enough that given the long journey there was no point coming in. I explained this in a group chat to my friends, they were all like u skived lol, whatever cos it's not like we didn't and it's not like it matters (we missed 3hrs each of lesson time). My mum was cool with it.\n\nThis friend doesn't let it go tho, he doesn't leave it at that and says \"couldn't u have gotten a taxi\", at which point i said (quote) \"we don't all get paid £30 a week for doing fuckall\". And him and another girl in the chat were not happy about that remark. I'm referring to money he gets for being disabled, a bursary from the college (or money from the govt, or both, i don't remember). He has said exactly this, with that exact wording, himself on numerous past occasions. I pointed this out and apparently \"it didn't sound like a quote\" and \"it's like saying the n word, it's racist when white ppl say it\" (this came from the girl, who is white and uses that word herself frequently when referring to black people).\n\nI will point out that he seems to spend a lot of it on stuff not related to his disability, e.g. coffee, presents for people, maccies etc. His medication and treatment is fully covered by the NHS, the only things he spends his money on related to his disability is taxis and ubers cos he has trouble getting around. \n\nI personally think this is a waste of money, people are living paycheck to paycheck struggling to get by and he's spending their tax money on Starbucks. I obviously don't say that to him cos that would be pretty rude, this is the first time I've ever remarked on his disability pay as far as i recall. \n\nWhat do u think? Did i go too far? \n\nI also don't think the girl is in a position to say that to me, \"u can't say that bc it's as inappropriate as this other thing that i myself do all the time\". ",

      "description": "Before you even start, **YES**, I know it is annoying, but that isnt what I'm asking about.\n\nSo I have a teacher that insists on people asking questions during class (am in college English class), as she doesnt want to stick around when it's over. I am autistic, and so I naturally will focus in on one specific part of whatever she is talking about and get confused, so I will ask for clarification. She, in my opinion, absolutely sucks at explaining things, and so yesterday i wound up spending 5 continual minutes having her explain by asking different versions of the same question. Naturally, people were getting pissed, and the dude next to me says under his breath, \"Ima pray for you, bro\" and so I got upset because, damn, I'm just trying to understand what she is getting at so I can do the assignment. Please note, though, that i dont ask when she is lecturing unless it directly involves the lecture.\n\nShe doesnt pass out paperwork that correlates to the assignment, she doesnt write anything down on the whiteboard other than what our body paragraphs will center on, and from my experience she doesnt return emails. \n\nSo, AITA if I ask continouos questions until I get it? I know it pisses people off, but unfortunately i dont know what else to do and i cant bug her any other time because she insists it be a public forum type deal whenever questions are asked. I'd much rather be able to go in there and not give a shit about peoples opinions if i dont have to and just get my grade and get out, but If I'm an A-Hole idk.",

      "description": "A little context: I’m 15 and my sister (16) is dating a guy (17) and it’s almost their one month anniversary. She swears that this is her husband and they’re going to be married one day. I believe they’re taking their relationship a little too fast (she believes other wise as they’ve known each other since 5th) and I always get a little defensive when she bring up pregnancy. She talks about baby names, and if she were to ever get pregnant at 17. She tells me that since our mom got pregnant at 17 with our older sister that she’ll be fine because they lived “just fine”. Well, that might have been the case if the truth wasn’t that my mom hooked up with a stranger in a club, got pregnant with said stranger, and married a random man who helped her raise the child until she divorced him a couple years later due to domestic abuse. I told her this and this my disbelief she keeps talking about pregnancy and what if’s.\n\nTonight, around 11:00pm, I was talking to my sister trying to cheer her up after she was done crying due to her boyfriend thinking he found the right one and was very emotional about it. Fast forward a couple of minutes and she’s talking about what if she got pregnant and to that I said “but you won’t” and she turned around to me and said “but what if I was” and I repeated “but you won’t” again so she told me to get out of her room because she’s done with me. I then brought up what happened with our mother and how hard it was on her to have a child and how our whole family wouldn’t support her as they didn’t even like a photo of her giving a kiss on the cheek to her bf. So she wants to call me gay and stuff (which I am, I don’t understand who she’s hurting) and punched me once I noticed how she flinched while we were arguing. I hit her back and she kept calling me names and stuff like siblings do and kicked me out of her room. AITA?\n\nDisclaimer: My sister is like my bestfriend to me. I always know if anything is up and if she was pregnant, she’s not and she’s told me countless times she’s not and would not get pregnant at her current age. I support their relationship 110% and treat her bf as a brother but I feel as if their relationship is going too fast.",

      "description": "Ok so pretty simple going off the title but the backstory to this is: \n\nLast year my sister went to South Africa to visit some family and attend my second cousins wedding. She had saved up just enough money where she should be able to get through the trip, but it would be a bit tight. \n\nA week or so before she flew out I sold my car and had a decent amount of spare cash, so before she left I told her that if she thought she was getting low or going from run out of cash to just ask me and I'll send her some. \nSo about 2 weeks before she flies back she messages me and says she's running low on money can I please send her some. So I do, and transferred her $750 and with a message saying to pay me back when she could. All sweet.\n\nHowever, since coming back my sister has been in and out of work, contemplating/going to uni and hasn't had a particularly steady cashflow. Still all good, I don't especially need the cash so it's not a problem.\n\nBut since coming back and working occasionally, she's gone out multiple times a week with her new bf, and it seems like every other month she's going to a concert or a music festival. I'm not sure if she's paid for these in advance or if someone else is shouting her tickets or what the deal is with this. \n\nNow like I said, I'm not strapped for cash. I've got enough money coming in that I can pay my bills and have a hundred or so a week spending money. But there's a voice in the back of my head that's recently popped up saying she should be making more of an effort to pay me back. \n\nSo, WIBTA asking her to make more of an effort to pay me back, despite not really needing the cash?

He’s disrespectful of other members (mods included), makes bawdy jokes that aren’t funny in the slightest, injects politics in places they're ill needed, and beats dead horses in any and every argument he’s in.  Thing is, as far I’m aware, Steve hasn’t even been so much as given a temporary ban for his actions, only PM'd and told to play nice (which of course works as well as one would imagine.

      "description": "Long story as all these things usually are so I'll try to boil this down as best I can. \n\nBeen with fiancé for 5 years. I'm 27, he's 28. Great relationship but I tend to be on the untrusting side because of being cheated on in the past (boyfriend and TWO of my best friends...yuck). So around Christmas fiancé started exhibiting all the behaviors that my ex did. Cancelling dates, not being where he said he was supposed to be, not being at his apartment, not ever having his phone with him, turning off findmyfriends unexpectedly on and on. \n\n\nI tried talking with him and asking him if something is wrong, he said no. I was like \"oh, calm down Sarai, he's never given you any reason to doubt him\" which worked for a while but his shady behavior just got more and more shady. In all of this, I was awful to him. I was just moody, grouchy, I told him I didn't want him to stay over and not have sex. I had no proof of anything other than my intuition but I still took it out on him. \n\n\nSo maybe last week, I was sleepless in the middle of the night and just to see what he was up to and turned on findmyfriends and saw that like at 1AM on a Tuesday night he was at this really cool old converted warehouse that's half loft's/half artists space close to our towns bar district. I knew for a fact his ex-girlfriend lived in the lofts and I was like \"ohhhhhhh-kaayyyyyy….red handed.\"  So I screen capped it and was like planning on breaking up with him the next day. \n\n\nSo surprise, surprise he shows up at my place that same night at like 3AM which I was like you have to be fucking kidding me dude, you're going to fuck her in the same night you're going to try to fuck me? Not a chance and to make it even WORSE he got right in the shower. So I wanted more evidence to dump him so I logged into his phone and was going to screen cap all the incriminating texts, photos and videos and text them to myself. \n\n\nSo this is what I found which also requires some backstory. I love the modern take on twisted wrought iron garden trellises and gates. Like think they are the most amazing thing. Well as it turns out my fiancé has been taking welding classes so he can build us a trellis  that can be the backdrop for our wedding ceremony. Like massive amount of text messages between him and his instructor, pictures of the work in progress and practice pieces his done. There was even a text message that said \"it's getting harder and harder to keep this a secret, but I think the surprise will be worth it.\" And the instructor is teaching him in the loft spaces, absolutely zero mention of his ex anywhere his phone.  My stupid black heart about melted back into pink. I felt SOOOOOOO guilty for snooping. Like such an idiot and not only that I ruined this great surprise that he had planned for me. \n\nBut in all honesty I feel better knowing what is up. I don't have to worry that he's cheating, I can still act like it's a surprise and be just as delighted with his project. Most of all I've been so much nicer to him and we are back to getting along great. \n\nMaybe the ends justifies the means here...sooooooo AITA?",

      "description": "So next Tuesday all the regular physics classes are teaming up to have a 4-period assessment(which is definitely not a midterm) and I partnered with some people in another class but no one in my own. \nSince I was alone and there was also another girl alone in my class our teacher paired us up. Even though the project is in a week there is a few experiments needed to be done before the day of. Key word is before. Now in the past four days she hasn’t said a word and has been reading and drawing the whole time while I gather all the data on my own(most groups are of four because it’s a lot of work). So today my teacher comes over and talks to her, and she has the gawl to say she did the work. I show him my notes and charts of data saying I, too did work. So he suggests we go over it together. \nI look over and she answered one of the questions directly from the rubric, even though it states specifically not to do so. All she had was a formula, and she proceeded to ask for my notes. I tell her no she has to do it on her own, she’s done nothing this whole time, but I tell her a hint at what I did. For this project, despite working together, we all have to submit our own notes and calculations and versions of the experiments. She said she would do it all the day of. And got mad with me for not helping her more.  Like what?\n\ntl;dr slacker asks for notes, I say no",

      "description": "AITA for telling my mom she can’t smoke weed while she takes care of my kid?  I am pro-legalization.  I am fine with her doing whatever she wants any other time, she is an adult and can make her own decisions.  Neither my husband nor I have ever smoked or done any other drugs, but my whole family smokes weed regularly and sees nothing wrong with it.  \n\nMy mom is a very responsible person, and loves my child (1.5) to death.  She likes watching her overnight a  couple times a month. I thought that it was common sense to not smoke around children (second hand smoke, impaired judgement, etc) so I didn’t think it was necessary to lay out ground rules.  But as I was unpacking her clothes one day after a sleepover I smelt a strong weed smell and saw an ash/burn mark on her jammies.  My kid was on the path to adoption, but still in foster care at the time.  She was born addicted and had a very hard time withdrawing from her bio mother’s bad decisions.  All this paired with being an over protective new mom made me furious.  I called my mother and straight up asked if she smoked near my child, and she immediately admitted she smoked while holding my sleeping baby to help her relax.  She said she knew she shouldn’t have, and will never do it again.  I told her what would happen if she did, which included her visits being monitored and supervised.   She made no excuses and was so scared to lose contact with us.  During the conversation we also discussed that she needs to store her stash somewhere no child can get it.  A few months went by and my husband and I agreed that we felt comfortable again with sleepovers.  But every time she comes back her clothes smell of weed.   Mom’s house and vehicle does have a lingering weed smell pretty much constantly, and I realize the lingering smell can soak into her clothes and it doesn’t necessarily mean mom is smoking while taking care of her.  But ya’ll, the smell is pretty strong.   I want to get along with my mom and she really is an overall positive influence in my child’s life. But I cannot overlook this.  I think if I asked mom about it again that she would lie because she knows what will happen if she admits to it again.  Am I being overly paranoid about the risks of being under the influence of weed while taking care of children?  ",

      "description": "So I am basically the social organizer for a large group of friends (mostly from university although we're all working now) because no one else can be bothered. This group has gotten REALLY big over the years (like 30-40 ppl from only 10) which means it can be a pain in the ass getting people to come to places. \n\nRecently in the past year people have been really into boating events. We'd rent a big boat for a day and pay for food/drinks to be delivered and hang on the water with friends for a whole day. Its a blast but an absolute pain in the ass to plan. I've asked for help but no one volunteers, but everyone is always requesting these events to be planned, so I'm the one putting down deposits and getting everyone to pay me their fair share. \n\nSo this one big issue has cropped up. There are about 2-3 ppl in the group with clear social anxiety or some other anxiety that they claim makes them hard to commit to things. HOWEVER, they are always the first to volunteer and say they want to come to something, only for them to cancel last minute or make me chase them for money for WEEKS. I've tried instituting deadlines for payments but they are the biggest complainers and will post on our group page about it, causing people to ask me to give them leniency because they suffer from mental illnesses but still want to participate. \n\nWell lately I've just been texting people one on one and sometimes I seriously cannot be bothered to contact those 2-3 people because of the hell they've put me through. But now they've seen a couple of pics on social media and are crying out about injustice and how people like me exacerbate their social anxiety for excluding them. It's 50-50 with other people in the group. Half of the people think I am totally right for excluding people who've screwed me over in the past and the other half thinks I need to have WAAAY more care for these people because they are more sensitive to social rejection.

      "description": "First of all, this is my first time posting so I am sorry for any mistakes and my bad English, it is my secondary language.\n\nSecondly: TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n\nOkay, so I am currently on vacation with my family and we will be spending New year's in the United states, while my girlfriend is home in Denmark and celebrating it there. \n\nShe wants to go (is going) to a party, that a former friend of mine hosts, with some of her girlfriends. That troubles me, because of multiple reasons. \n\n1. I don't want to be \"the controlling boyfriend\", that is way too over protective, as I sometimes are, nor do I want her to go to the party because of the guests invited and the host.\n\nThe reason of that is firstly: \n- The host is, in my opinion, untrustworthy and have no sense of situation, which I think is troubling when I can't be there to make sure she is okay or be with her at the party.  \n\n- The majority of the male guests has no sense of boundaries and I am worried they will try to make her do a mistake, especially if she is drunk.\n\n2. The girlfriends she is going with are all single and they always drink way too much at parties and therefore, I am worried she will drink too much as well. She has gone to parties without me before, where we were an official couple, without any problems but my anxiety, but this time is different because there are fireworks, alcohol and a lot for people, both good and bad people.\n\n3. I get very easily jealous and insecure about her being with other boys. I try to not control her as I don't think that is healthy but this really troubled me, because I am pretty pessimistic and always thinks the worst is going to happen, which is why I came to the conclusion:\n\nThat, of course, I will let her go to the party, but ask her to not drink any alcohol because I am worried for her and myself. \n\nSo Would I Be The Asshole?\n\nTL;DR:\nGirlfriend is going to a party I can't attend, I worry for her way too much and are asking her not to drink alcohol as I don't feel comfortable with her partying with alcohol, fireworks and a lot of people without me.\n\n",

      "description": " \n\nI had a person I liked, let’s call her… Emily. Emily and Me knew were acquaintances for quite some time before I decided to start talking to her again after one of my friends had said she was cute. I had known her previously and have connections with her prior, and so I decided to text her on Instagram. Since we both had a exam recently I decided it would be a good opportunity to chat.  We ended up connecting thoughts over the exam, and so I decided to talk to her. I had given her gifts and talked to her before, so I thought it would turn into a good friendship. \n\nOver the next few months, I came to know her better, and ended up developing romantic feelings towards her. However, I was a coward. I was afraid of rejection, and so kept my feelings to myself. Now “Emily” was an amazing student. She outperformed me academically and I often felt cast out when talking about academics despite our similar thoughts on the matter. But, I still decided to play games with her, and chat with her about issues. We ended up communicating a few experiences that had happened to us in the past that were personal, chatted about life, etc. I didn’t want to ruin the relationship we had. But.. I kept feeling like shit. I knew it wasn’t right of me to feel this way, but every time she outperformed I felt a stinging pain in my chest as if I had lost. A friend I considered similar was so close; yet so distant, and this thought scared me to the very core. \n\nThe next month in November, I decided to confess my feelings. I wanted the pain to end… I felt like I was going to get defeated, but I had some hope. Short story short, I got rejected. I understood her actions, however I got called unattractive which was a painful experience for me. I said I understood, however, inside I felt lost. I can’t complain about the reason she did this, but I didn’t think she would be so blunt with her response. Maybe I was ugly, but I still felt worse… Now I felt like I wanted to restart our relationship. I decided to tell her we would start anew; a relationship without my pain, and she agreed. However… I felt horrible after my rejection. I hid my pain from “Emily” and decided to just try the relationship again. It was a huge failure… I felt even worse before.  \n\nI decided to distance myself, to try and end the pain but maybe I was just running. I didn’t want to be affected. I decided to end the relationship yesterday and went through with it. I told her she wasn’t to blame and this wall all my fault.. But “Emily” seemed rather angry over my reasons why. I communicated them to the best of my ability, but she seemed unsatisfied. Feeling ashamed I avoided disclosing the reasons why.. Now we’re trying to sort out the problems but I still feel the same about our relationship; that due to my inability it would inevitably fail. Am I the asshole for not wanting to talk with my “friend” anymore?",

      "description": "we’re still pretty new into the relationship, it’s been just over a week. we didn’t meet on an app, we met through friends and hit it off. \n\nwe really like each other so far, but i do have jealous tendencies that i’m working on. she left her phone unlocked and i saw the apps and admittedly got a little jealous at first but figured she just didn’t think about deleting it. i’m not accusing her of anything and i know it’s probably not that big of a deal, but it does kinda hurt a little cause it eats at my insecurity that i feel like i’m not enough. but she tells me how happy she is with me and how i’m the nicest guys he’s ever been with and that’s been enough for me so far to let it go and just focus on her. \n\nmy perspective is that if you’re in a relationship, you don’t need any of that, so i deleted mine the day before i asked her to be my girlfriend. maybe her and i just have different opinions on that. \n\nalso, i feel like an asshole for looking at her phone and invading her privacy. am i coming off as jealous and controlling?",

      "description": "Obvious throwaway is obvious. Regardless:\n\nI (19M) have a cousin (21F) who has quite possibly one of the worst tastes in partners of anyone I've ever met. Nearly every relationship she's ever been in has been abusive, either physically or mentally, or both, and both her exes and current boyfriend essentially either hoard her from our family or ghost her for weeks before rekindling. I have my own problems with that, but I would never cut off anyone because their choice of partners sucks. This however, does become relevant later.\n\nI also have a longtime girlfriend of 2.5 years (18F), who since we began dating has become very close with everyone in my family, particularly my cousin, and they hang out fairly often. I was cool with this at first, as I liked my cousin and was happy my SO and my family were getting along well. Fast forward nearly a year, and my SO starts telling me that when her and my cousin are hanging out alone, she gets a little inappropriate (She's never expressed lesbian tendencies, although my SO has told me she identifies as Bi. We are 100% monogamous.), which I'm weirded out by, but not upset over really; I trust my girlfriend. The main thing that angers me is my cousin apparently shit talks me behind my back to my SO and says how horrible of a boyfriend I am and how she deserves so much better, and then proceeds to scroll through Instagram to show her all the guys she thinks are \"hot\" and how my SO should dump me and go for these guys instead.\n\nLet me state here and before all that I have never once in my life cheated on any SO, past or present, nor will I ever, I have never hit, smacked, spit on, or otherwise physically abused my SO, I have never mentally or psychologically abused her, or given any indication whatsoever that I am the despicable scum my cousin apparently tried to paint me as. I will never claim to be the perfect boyfriend, and there's always room for improvement, but I felt this way out of left field and uncalled for.\n\nNaturally, I'm livid. Not just because my own cousin is essentially trying to sabotage what at this point is a long, stable relationship for absolutely no reason, especially given the fact that her choice in SO ha e literally the exact problems she paints me as having, while I have exhibited ZERO of their traits or behaviors. \n\nNot wanting to cause a big fuss, as our family is very closely knit otherwise, I never really discussed this with her, only privately with my Mom and Grandmother, but explicitly told them not to tell her, and I just kind of stopped making an effort to go out of my way to interact with her. I will be polite and cordial at family gatherings, and I'm still cool with my SO being friends with her, but I'm not sure I'll be able to completely forgive her for trying to sabotage my SO's and I's relationship because of what I suspect as her own jealousy and projection.\n\nSo, people of Reddit, I leave it up to you to decide if I am truly TA in this situation?",

Last night I went to bed with one and when I woke up this morning I could barely move as it got worse. By noon my medication drove it away. I could feel it coming back as I’m getting ready for bed and announce it to my boyfriend. I’m brushing my teeth getting ready for bed and my boyfriend is on the toilet reading his phone.\n\nHe stops me to ask if he can tell me one thing. He likes composers and orchestra music specifically from film. It’s pretty much the only music he listens to. I let him and he starts telling me about a composer who has done the music for the newest End Game trailer. However he then starts to go off on a while other tangent that I know will lead him into an hour long detailed biography of this guys life. My head hurts and it’s 11:30pm and I really just wanted to go to bed. \n\nI cut him off and tell him I really wasn’t all that interested which is the truth. He gets upset with me and I explain to him that my head hurts and I can’t really process any more information. It’s late and not really a great choice to have this conversation with me as I’m trying to go to bed. He gets huffy and shuts me down. He got pretty cruel when I tried to make it right so I didn’t hurt his feelings about it. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I feel bad and I want to let him tell me about the things he enjoys. I don’t want him to feel like he can’t. But I truthfully just want to sit in the dark and hold my head it feels like it’s splitting in half. \n\nI’ll take my judgement. I’ll try and clarify anything in comments. \n\n",

      "description": "Basically my parents are conservative Christians in a 'conservative lite' kinda way. They have strong 'traditional' opinions on religion, sexuality and gender (but not race or wealth) but if you need a play to stay, food, etc, they will absolutely give you any help you need albeit while trying to bring you to the Lord.\n\nMy siblings and I are very liberal, but while I am fine talking politics at work, with friends, etc, talking about it with my parents will inevitably end up heated, angry and uncomfortable. The most likely outcome is that everyone will be upset and no one will change their minds on anything. \n\nMy younger brother is very combative and will often bring up contentious topics for the sake of 'debating' my dad. I have asked him to stop picking fights, if dad starts it, sure go ahead, but to stop instigating. He feels that I'm just being a coward, and I should confront them on their views even if it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nOne of my problems with that is that those debates affect me personally. My brother is straight and cis-gendered male while I'm ace and non-binary. If he stirs up shit, it won't affect him beyond my parents getting upset at him. I'm can't walk away from my life if things go bad. \n\nSo am I an asshole for wanting to avoid discussing important political topics with my parents?",

I’m currently visiting my family for a few days out of town, and right now he just text me saying “the sink won’t even drain because of all the food in there, it’s disgusting, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU” and I responded “you’ve only done the dishes twice in the two years that we’ve lived together and you’ve never done the laundry so you can’t complain about how I clean”, then he goes on to text me about how dirty and gross the sponges are, and he said “how could you wash our dishes with those??” then he called me a bitch and said he wants to finally be done. I told him if he’s not gonna clean then he can’t complain about how I clean. We split the bills 50/50 and split the rent 50/50, although to his credit he pays for way more food then I do and he does give me rides sometimes since I don’t have a car (although I use Uber a lot), but I hate when he complains about my cleaning when he doesn’t clean a damn thing himself. Sometimes I tell him, “You never clean so you can’t complain” and sometimes he understands that, but other times he blows up on me like this. He also always ask me to bring him drinks and waters and food while he sits on the couch and rarely gets anything himself. All the household chores, even cleaning up after his dog, falls on me. Now he’s texting me calling me an idiot and a fat pig. Which is funny because I’m not even fat, but he loves calling me fat (even though he says I’m not fat at all) just because he knows it hurts me so he says it. I blew up on him and text him right now saying “all you do is gamble and do shit with your life, you’re a worthless man, you’re not even a man!!” And now he’s texting me and telling me to come get my stuff to move out. It really bothers me what he said. AITA for defending myself? I know what I said was mean but I’m sick of the name calling. I never defend myself and I finally wanted to tell him off good ",

She said she felt awful soon after and I apologized, hugged her, then left to the restroom to think of what I had just said and cried a bit more.

      "description": "Long story,  and no TLDR because I just put the key parts in bold, but I seriously appreciate anyone who reads all of this.\n\nMy roommate (we can call her Emma) and I share a 2 bedroom apartment. We split rent &amp; utilities down the middle. Our lease started on June 1st of 2018. We had shared a dorm room the year prior without any issue, so I  thought sharing an apartment would be no problem. She works \\~30 hours a week as a waitress, and her BF works about the same at his parents pizzeria, they both dropped out of college. I work 6 days a week and take classes full time.\n\nI wasn't living here fully over the summer, as I had a job that was over an hour commute, so I was only here on weekends, but I wasn't here at all during July and part of august.  When I came back in mid august, I discovered she had started seeing a guy (we can call him Dave). **Right away, he was spending the night here almost every night**, and had been for several weeks before I came back. So I came back and he was pretty much here every night, **without Emma asking me about it** or anything. **Side note: he has his own apartment, about 2 blocks from our place.**\n\nWeeks later, **I ask her about it, and if he could contribute. She immediately gets extremely defensive** and very snarky with me, saying \"well if you have a problem with it, Ill just kick him out then\", I say you don't need to do that, Id just like him to contribute, etc. etc. This conversation goes nowhere. **I eventually give up** and leave it. \n\n**Several months pass**, me just trying to stay out of their way. He progressively starts moving in more and more. **They now eat every meal here, he sleeps here every single night, has his friends over here, hangs out here all day when she's at work and he has the day off, even sleeps here when she is away**. However, he doesn't keep all his clothes here. This is Emma's only defense on the rare occasion I bring it up.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I finally got fed up after our landlord stopped by to confront us about Dave getting mail here and his car being parked here. **The landlord was clearly suspicious we had a third person living here**, and if he finds out about Dave, Emma and I **will both get evicted**. I had to lie to my landlord about Dave living here. Our landlord already hates us, because Emma got a cat without asking him first, and also had a huge party while I wasn't home that the police busted and called our landlord about.\n\nAfter that, **I asked them to both sit down with me and have a civil discussion about it. I request that he either stop living here, or contribute to rent. I finally got him to agree to pay the utilities.** Emma and I each pay $425 a month for rent, he will now pay $60 a month in utilities to live here. I thought I was being generous with this compromise. Emma's justification for this was that he \"stays out of my way\". Which he does, and I appreciate that. But **he's still here all day, even when Emma isn't, is here every night, even when Emma isn't. Yes, he is not very intrusive to me, but he still lives here**. You can be the least intrusive roommate ever, but you still have to pay your share of rent, in my opinion.\n\nDuring this conversation, Emma and Dave went on a whole tirade about me as well, **saying that I had no right to be upset with Dave for living here, since I leave my things in the living room sometimes and don't always take my shoes off.** **I don't think this is crazy**, I think leaving my jacket, laptop, and backpack in the living room of my own apartment sometimes is pretty normal and acceptable. And I do my best to take my shoes off 90% of the time, but I forget once in a while. **I'm a very clean person, and rarely leave a mess**. She frequently leaves the sink overflowing with dishes, leaves the bathroom a mess, clogs the shower drain with hair, doesn't clean up cat litter and cat food all over the floor, leaves spoiled food in the fridge, and doesn't clean up the huge parties she has when im gone. but I don't say anything about it because I really don't think stuff like that is a huge deal\n\n**This compromise lasted about a week, when they changed their minds, and agreed to stay a couple nights a week at his place, instead of him paying. The last 2 weeks, they've spent 2-3 nights at his place**. Great.\n\n**Today, he spent the whole day here, while Emma was at work**, and his apartment is only 2 blocks away. I confronted Emma about it when she got home, and **asked her that he please not be here all day when she isn't, I think its weird, and see no reason why he can't just hang at his place. She got EXTREMELY angry and defensive**, angrily gesturing to the living room, saying it was a mess (I had my backpack and jacket on the couch, and my laptop and a glass of water on the coffee table), and getting angry at me for hanging out in the living room all day doing homework.\n\n **I tried to be very civil about it, I don't want to be fighting with my roommate, but she escalated it so fast, Im wondering if I'm being the asshole here?? I must be doing something wrong, otherwise she wouldn't be this mad. Currently he pays $0 and spends 100% of his time here, except between 10pm-8am 1 or 2 nights a week when they sleep at his place, just so they can say they sleep there sometimes. Please tell me if I'm the asshole, and all advice is appreciated.**",

      "description": "tl;dr at bottom. I work at a small company, less than 10 employees, I've been there for almost 2 years. I've been doing this type of work (mostly landscaping, plumbing, and general maintenance stuff) for 17 years at this point. I've known the owner and his wife since I was about 5 and was good friends with their kids for most of my childhood, spent a lot of time at their house when my parents were going through a divorce but had a major falling out with their family (they were being shady with other peoples and no one wanted anything to do with them for years, i was just a kid so i don't know all the details). Anywho I started working for them and everything was great, they even gave me a no interest loan so i could get a car. It's worth noting that i have been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder that i still battle, but was really bad when i first started there. My point is they put up with a lot when i first started and helped me get my life together when i really needed the help. Fast forward, my boss and i have serious ethical differences, he will bait live traps with rat poison knowing much lager animals will eat it, kill animals caught in live traps inhumanly, leaving poison out where anyone/thing can get it, asked me to do these and other illegal things, he's a slumlord, the list is long i could go on for a while still. On top of these issues he tries to bully me into working when I'm not scheduled (interfering with the limited amount of time I get to see my kids) and has wildly inaccurate ideas about how long manual labor should take. So we had a blowout fight a short time ago about how long a job should take and when I came into work today I was informed that next shift a new hire would be starting that would be my superior. I just said OK and left since i had already clocked out. But now the fact that my boss has no respect for my experience, something I've known for at least 6 months, and is a total p.o.s. is really welling up inside me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif you need anymore info ask I'm not great at storytelling\n\n\\-I've been looking for a job because of the above issues but only for really good alternates and I interview terribly\n\n\\-I pride myself on my work ethic and have been praised for it from everyone I've ever worked for\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr\n\nboss but mostly his wife helped me through hard times, longstanding ethical issues with my boss, now they're hiring someone as my superior from outside the company, I've been there 2 years and have 17 years experience.

      "title": "AITA for lashing out at close friends over being toyed-with by an emotionally manipulative mutual friend?",
      "description": "AITA for yelling at close friends who told me to get over it?\n\nI feel inclined to preface this with a long exposition that I will TL;DR after (mostly because I've never really put it all out on the table in anything over than texts, and I feel like I need to)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn high school I made the mistake of falling early on for someone who would end up going on to be one of my closest friends by the time we graduated. I had had a lot of crushes over the years, but this girl, call her S, in particular was a close friend that I always found myself getting drawn back to despite ups and downs in our friendship, dating other people, etc.\n\nI pined over S for a good while, but she was dating another guy and I didn't stand a chance. Towards the end of my junior year, he dumped her. Flash forward a while and I was never confident enough to make moves, but in a turn of events that caught me off guard, S ended up initiating a date that would end in my first kiss. I had had feelings for her for years and finally she showed that she was interested in me as well. Immediately after, she seemed like she thought she had gone too far. She left to go to a friend's house and lied to her about having been with me to avoid suspicion. Definitely a red flag but I was too blinded by the butterflies and the sudden shattering my relationship-related lack of self esteem. We got together alone a couple more times over the next couple weeks, I initiated another kiss but she seemed hesitant. I confronted her about it and she said she had missed the intimacy, and did really like me but that she was too hurt by her ex to get into a new relationship. I responded unfortunately like an entitled teenage boy and was angry at her for a little bit, especially when she quickly got back together with the guy that had \"broken her heart.\"\n\nI got over it, we buried the hatchet, and I ended up in my first real relationship the following year, which ended on good terms because I was going to college. S ended things with her boyfriend for the same reason around the same time. We both go to college, and on returning for our winter break, all our friends had a Christmas party. I got drunk and tried to make moves on S, but her ex was there and they were apparently still hooking up while they were home (S always said she couldn't do long distance). I ended up being weirdly pushed to sleep with another mutual friend, which spawned a secret affair that ended pretty poorly, but that's a different story where I may or may not have been an asshole. Either way, I had feelings for S, not for the girl I slept with.\n\nThings eventually ended for good between S and her ex (she found out he had slept with the same girl as me while he was still hooking up with S. The following summer (6 months later), I still had feelings for S. Another friend ended up peeing on the floor of the host's house, and was thus removed from the master bedroom. S and I were the only ones still awake, and so we ended up sharing the bed. Yet again, I was surprised by her initiating moves, after which we went on late night dates and fooled around a bit before we went back to school. I showed her that I still had grandiose feelings for her and she was flattered by them and didn't shoot them down in the moment. The night before she left for school we talked and she convinced me to stay \"optimistic\" because had feelings for me and said herself that she had been \"taking my feelings seriously\" for the last few weeks. I stayed optimistic.\n\nThat year at school was pretty rough for me. We stayed in pretty frequent contact and it appeared that her friends knew about our history after a few drunk calls were exchanged. However, it was clear that she was not saving herself like I had been assuming I should. I got drunk one night and had a one night stand with someone (maybe a bit of childish retaliation), but as I sobered up I realized that I had fucked up and legitimately sprinted away from the girl's dorm as I started to have a minor panic attack that I had inadvertently ruined my chances with the girl I had wanted for years.That year was when I broke down for the first real time in my life. I repeatedly went home for breaks and holidays to find that S was distant and not interested in any of the moves I made. At new years I had given up hope, only to receive a text from S saying she regretted that she hadn't spent the night with me. This threw me for a loop and I confronted her about leading me on with messages like that and the rejection that she offered when I pursued. She apologized for having led me on and told me that she did still have feelings but she still couldn't start anything with me because she \"had ended things with \\[her ex\\] because of long distance\" so why would I expect her to start anything long distance with me. Fair enough, I forgave her because I loved her and wanted her in my life.\n\nI invited her to come to my school (much closer to our hometown than hers) for the night while she was on break. I took her to dinner and we spent the evening in each-others arms, but anytime I leaned in she pulled back. I confronted her and begged her to tell the truth. I explained that she meant too much to me to push her away but I was starting to crack and I couldn't keep taking it. Her self deprecation even tricked me into taking the blame from her and giving her a chance to tell me how she really felt. She told me she \"wasn't a confident person\" and that her hesitation had always been because she was afraid of rejection. I told her I loved her and wanted her more than anything. She kissed me and left, and we fell back into the same pattern as before.\n\nThe dissonance continued, flirtation and feelings of intimacy followed by swift nips in the butt when I acted in response to positive signals. Once, while sharing a bed with S and another of our close friends, I was in the middle and S reached for my hand, caressed it, kissed my knuckles and even put my finger in her mouth; I responded by leaning my lips towards hers (taking care not to move too much and wake the sleeping third party) and she pushed me a away and turned the other way and locked me out. I slept on the floor and left in the morning.\n\nFinally, at the end of an emotionally taxing year of being too far away for her to commit, she returned home for the summer, and I was working at my college about an hour away from her. Suddenly all the promises that petered out could be acted upon and I finally had my chance to be with her. She bailed on visiting me every time she said would, and she was too busy any time I tried to visit. Realizing that \"optimism\" and the \"when we are both in the same place\" was a crock of shit, she still meant too much to me. I gave her yet another chance to come clean. She told me \"the truth,\" that she had always had feelings for me but the distance was never going to become a non-issue. After all, she was going to be abroad for a year, and things hadn't worked out by that summer, so there was no way she could act on the feelings she had always had for me. She apologized for leading me on, and I accepted her apology.\n\nTL;DR Fell in love in high school with a girl (S) who went on to spend a year in college leading me on with false promises of having a chance to be with her when were at home together for the summer. During this time she used me for the occasional attention then pushed me away when I made moves. Her excuses for turning me away changed over time; first, she wasn't confident enough to go for me, then she admitted she didn't have the courage to disappoint me again by telling me that we never had a chance because distance was too hard for her. Her entire apology, on her third chance to come clean to me rested on the fact that she 1. had feelings for me but 2. wasn't willing to start anything long distance.\n\nAt the end of that summer, I traveled to Rome for a semester abroad. S was also studying abroad, in York, England at the time. I was there for two months when one day, she was tagged in a post by a guy also from our hometown. The two went public that they were officially in a long-distance relationship, and had been since two weeks after the conversation where she \"came clean\" to me. After a year of doubting myself, thinking I was going crazy because of the mixed signals, having the only two panic attacks I have ever had because I was being fed lies and I couldn't do anything about it, I snapped. I reached out to her one last time and told her to go fuck herself, amid a myriad of other choice phrases. I spit on every memory I ever had with her, on all the years I spent trusting her as one of my closest friends, only to find that she lied to me to protect herself from criticism for her selfish behavior, as if I would never find out. I haven't spoken to her since, even though she did try to make amends, and feed me the \"I never meant to hurt you\" shit that I fell for several times before.\n\nOur mutual friends were surprisingly supportive. I told them individually as it came up, but most of them acknowledged that I had to do what I had to do. Six months later, I was happier than I had been in over a year. Cutting the source of all my anxiety and feelings of isolation did wonders for me. When the time came to return for my senior year of college, one of the mutual friends invited me to her going away party. S was invited, and I told the host of the party that if S was going, I was sorry but I was not going to show up. The host implored me to reconsider, reminded me that I wouldn't see her for a long time, and guilted me into making an appearance. I arrived pretty early, and found my close knit group of friends (minus S) around a fire having a good time. I walked over and barely received a greeting from the lot of them, when half of them all looked at each other, then looked a",

      "description": "I was Invited to go out tonight with a single mother from work and her friend. Now, for some backstory, I work with the single mother, but not the friend I don't know her at all, and I've been talking to her for 2 weeks now, and we've seen each other around for a few months. Where this is, is about 30 minutes away from me, and she wants to get some food then smoke up in a car and chill basically. Now I asked her if we could do anything after the fact, like potentially hookah because at that point I wasnt aware she was bringing her daughter. She states she has a daughter so obviously no, and I say well give me just a minute, let me look and see if I can find something to do, and you see if there's anything you can find, I would love to hang out, but I would rather not drive to your city, buy my own food, then smoke you and your friend out (which would've happened because earlier in the day she said her and her friend needed to buy some) can we do it closer or at my friends house, this friend being about the same distance I would have to drive there. She says that's not going to work, and that I am selfish for not accommodating her and her child. That it shouldn't matter what she contributes because friends don't care. Now I feel that's unfair, because I would have no problem driving out there, picking them up just like I normally would, but i just feel if I do this, then our friendship will be based solely off of my effort, and I've had many different friendships where it has been one sided and I don't want that. Now I like this person and don't want to end our friendship, but I feel like now there is a rift because I would like 50/ 50 effort, and if what I described was not 50/50 effort or if I should then please give me feedback. Thanks guys! \n",

      "description": "So this happened about two weeks ago. I was really close with this one guy, we used to hang out a lot (online, bc he's from another country), watch films, play together etc. It was fun times and I really enjoyed hanging out with him.\n\nHowever every now and then, pretty much every time we talked, he would just give me compliments and praise me, all out of nowhere. Saying things like \"you're amazing\" or praising my looks, giving me pet names or even saying \"I love you\" several times (sometimes followed by a message that would say \"you're a great friend\" or something similar).\n\nNow don't get me wrong. It's extremely sweet of him and I was really flattered, however me being in a serious relationship with my boyfriend, I didn't really enjoy this kind of attention from another guy, even if he means it in a friendly way, it just didn't feel right. For weeks I've been thinking about telling him to stop, but didn't really wanna do it because I was scared it would affect the friendship, and I really liked having him as a friend. Then eventually after he unsurprisingly started giving me compliments out of nowhere during a conversation, I decided I'll try telling him. I tried doing it in the best way possible because I really didn't want to ruin the friendship, so I told him not to get me wrong, that he's a great guy and an amazing friend, but his compliments make me uncomfortable. He apologized and I told him there's no need to apologize, he doesn't have any bad intentions.\n\nAaand then I said I'd just like to keep the friendship without any misunderstandings, to which he replied \"there are none, lol\". A few minutes later he said he was a bit annoyed for me thinking his intentions were anything more than just friendly, he's a naturally affectionate person with his close friends and if he had wanted anything more, I'd know. Fast forward a few messages later, I apologized for bringing it up and annoying him, he apologized for making me uncomfortable aaand we haven't spoken ever since lol. He told me not to apologise, that there's nothing wrong with speaking my mind. But I do feel like it affected the friendship, which was the last thing I wanted. \n\nSo, AITA for speaking my mind? ",

A is not interested in a relationship with anyone and i am not interested in him beyond the sex we have.\n\nmy friends hear about D all the time. they have never heard about A because it's not a big deal to me. about a week ago, i went to pick up something i had left at my friend's house. i casually mentioned i was stopping by but not trying to hang out because i had somewhere to be after. this friend always needs to know 110% of everything so i ended up having to explain the existence of A. she was floored because not only did she not know i was hooking up with someone for a year, but also because she'd heard so much about D.\n\nthis friend texted our group chat about A and i had to explain to our other friends who A was. no one was surprised but one of them made the observation that i want D to commit to me yet i was sleeping with A. \n\nD is very important to me. he is my best friend. however, i feel like since D doesn't want to be committed that i am free to date or have sex with whoever i want. A doesn't mean anything to me. if D wanted a relationship right now, i wouldn't talk to or do anything with A ever again. i had never had a problem with this line of thinking until a friend pointed it out and now i kinda feel like an asshole.",

      "title": "AITA for asking my landlord for compensation if a broken window (from former tenant) is causing an insane heating bill?",
      "description": "I moved in to a 2 bedroom, ground level apartment last July. The apartment offers some great amenities that are hard to come by in my area: private backyard/deck, 2 parking spots, lots of storage. I realized soon after moving in that the cheap rent wasn’t too good to be true. My boyfriend and I have both lived in some pretty nasty student apartments, so we’re not high maintenance by any means but we have been frustrated with a few issues including black mold, leaking tub, leaking dishwasher, leaking ceiling, leaking sink, SPARKS coming out of outlets. You know, just small stuff. \n\nThese issues are pretty minor, but one that is not minor - the bathroom window is completely loose fitting and exposed to the outside. Fixing this was #1 on my list during the move in inspection. \n\nWe were reassured on multiple occasions that it would be replaced before winter came. After much nagging, in November - my landlord finally orders the window replacement. In January, it finally comes in. Now, 3 months later, he has been unable to get a contractor to come put it in. This is not surprising considering it’s been -15 degrees C and wet for since the new year. \n\nBecause of this, our power bill is absolutely ridiculous. I work from home, and despite sealing the window (DIY with recycling bags and duct tape) and bundling up, we cannot keep the place warm. Our power bill is more than our entire months rent, and is over 3x the regions average. \n\nI emailed my landlord to ask if he would be willing to discuss some compensation for this issue, and he replied that he “was shocked” that I would ask for compensation. He argued that because our rent is less than the local average, that he permitted us a pet and generally that he has been ‘quick to fix other issues’ that he doesn’t owe us a discussion on the issue any further. \n\nSorry for the rambling, I’m good at that. Am I the asshole for asking him to take a bit off our rent when he has been slacking for 9 months??? \n\nTLDR; landlord didn’t replace window for 9 months, causing us to have a huge power bill. Will not discuss any compensation. \n\n",

Me and the other 4 roommates take turns feeding her, but I’m the one who almost always cleans the litter box, which I’m okay with since I was the one who wanted a cat to begin with. \n\nI want to move out to live with my partner soon, and now I’m questioning if I should take the cat with me after all (partner is OK with it).\n\nProblem is, one of the roommates, Boots, moved in with us a year after we got Kitty, and they got pretty attached. Boots is the youngest among us (18) and they have severe anxiety and probably depression (they are seeing a therapist as of now). When we discussed me moving out and taking Kitty with me, Boots cried a little bit just thinking about it. \n\nI wanna take Kitty with me because, honestly? I like my cat, and I’m somewhat worried they couldn’t afford keeping her as she has some dietary issues that require pretty expensive food and regular visits to the vet. But I’m honestly afraid Boots is gonna spiral into depression if I take her with me; they once “joked” that Kitty is one of the only reasons they have to live.\n\nBy now I think maybe Boots needs her more than I do; all the other roommates are OK with me taking Kitty.\n\nWIBTA if I take the cat?

I felt that it would take me too long to pay off my debt and save up so I decided to get a part time job.\n\nIt pays minimum wage and I work 8pm-12am from Monday to Friday. \n\nThis doesn’t leave me much time to hang out with friends or family and they are all starting to feel it.

      "description": "Boyfriend (27M) and I (27F) had an argument tonight after dinner. I had picked out a new restaurant I wanted to try a few months ago and he had okay'd the menu and agreed to try it out with me. I made the reservation and we showed up tonight. It was a 6pm reservation so they were busy. Less than 5 min into being seated he was annoyed already and was unhappy with me, partly because the waiter had not come over yet, the restaurant was packed and noisy, and partly because he just does not like leaving the house. I told him I had been looking forward to it, I dressed up, had pre-paid for dinner (set menu), and that this is my first time at the restaurant too and I cannot foresee the situation. I told him I just wanted a nice meal out with him since most days we stay at home while he plays video games and I entertain myself. I told him that I wanted him to have some patience with the restaurant and to just focus on me and talk to me for a few hours while we're out. And that by being upset he ruined the night for me too. His response was \"Fine, go ahead, talk\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, dinner went by more or less uneventfully afterwards and when we got home, he knew I was sad and hugged me, and I started to tell him how I don't like how we pretty much just live together and don't talk and how he spends all his waking moments with his electronics. He said \"but we spend all the time together\". Yes, we sit side-by-side on the couch as he plays his video games and I'm on my laptop waiting to show him something funny I saw or share a story when he catches a break from one of the boss fights. His argument was this is because we are comfortable with each other so we don't always have to talk. I told him I didn't like him playing games that much but have to deal with it everyday because it's what he likes and he needs time to relax too. But I'm upset that every time I ask him to do something with me that I'd enjoy (trying new restaurants, going on a walk, etc) he agrees but puts on a \"I hate this\" face all time. And it kinda ruins the moment for me when I just want to spend more time together. His point was that we spend time together at home, and that I'm being unfair by asking him to act like he was enjoying doing these things when he clearly does not just for the sake of making me more comfortable. He now refuses to talk to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was not the first time he was upset at a restaurant. In his defense, the services at the past few new restaurants that we've tried have been subpar and the wait was long (\\~2 hours wait for the main course), but instead of just talking with me, he'd complain and tell me how shitty things are, how I have horrible taste in restaurant selections, and how it's a waste of money and we should've just stayed home. AITA for wanting him to do these things with me once in a while even when he doesn't enjoy it and not act out? Or should I just accept that we'll be couch buddies and let him be and find friends to go out with me instead so we don't run into this problem again? Thanks. ",

This girl alternated between making fun of me for not having a cellphone or fashionable clothes, and ignoring me entirely. The entire 9th-12th grade class only had about 15 students (I went to a small school), and so it was super obvious that she was shunning me. She was also a conservative Christian, and she loved to insinuate that I was a sinner/ heathen because I was left-leaning and loved science fiction. I tried to be nice to her, but it never worked. This girl had some issues at home (she was adopted as an older child, and she had some trauma related to her birth family), and so I tried to give her a pass. However, her behaviour really hurt me. \n\nNow: she got pregnant from a hookup right out of high school (very hypocritical; she used to shame girls at our school for not living “Christian lives.” I have nothing against sex, but you shouldn’t have a double standard for yourself and other people). Something went wrong during the birth, and she ended up dying. Is it bad that I don’t really care? She was a cruel, vain, hypocritical person, and her death is no great loss to the world.

      "description": "A couple months back was my birthday, and my mother decided it would be fun to gift me a DNA test. I was very excited since I’ve always wanted to find out more about my heritage. Thing is, as far as my family was concerned, it was an open and shut case since we already had a pretty good knowledge of my father’s side of the family, and my mother was 100% sure she was ethnically... let’s say Eastern European. Anyway, I took the test and all was well.\n\nUntil today, when I received the results. My Eastern European heritage was significantly different from what we had anticipated, with almost 20% corresponding with an ethnical minority in my mother’s home country. \n\nThis got me thinking, could my mother’s family possibly have miscalculated the percentage of “pure-bloodedness”? 20% is far too much to just be a miscalculation, right? Then I remembered that my mother’s father was hospitalized for several years following a stroke, and my mother was born shortly (too shortly) after his release, thirteen years after her sister. My mother also looks nothing like her father, and has very dark features. \n\nAll this has led me to believe that my only living relative, my very elderly maternal grandfather, may in fact not be my mother’s father. \n\nInstinctively I don’t want to ruin my grandfather’s life, but doesn’t he deserve to know? My mom will have an identity crisis for sure.... What the hell do I do???\nWIBTA for telling them the truth??\n\nTL;DR: Mother’s biological father probably isn’t her father. ",

      "description": "I've known this guy for 3 years so far and he has a habit of seeking attention by initiating conversations with uncomfortable topics. Let's call him A.\n\nHe reminded me of myself in 8th grade. I was an edgy idiot who lived for every opportunity to play devil's advocate and frequently shitposted on 4chan's /b/ board. I think he was a /pol/ denizen (as he calls himself and middle eastern people sandniggers). He tells me he's not racist on the basis that he hates everyone and thinks some groups are worse than others in certain aspects. His definition of racism is that there must be a belief of superiority. My definition is that there must be a belief of hierarchy, I just believe that his version is just a negative hierarchy. I.e. everyone starts at zero and certain groups just go further below zero. E.g. \"niggers\" are different from and below \"black people\". All \"niggers\" are black but not all black people are niggers. Yes he said this. \n\nI wanted to help him dig himself out of what I perceived to be a hole.\n\nTwo years ago, I defended him when he wanted to discuss the etymology of the word \"niggardly\" with a black student in a designated African-American themed house on campus, by giving him the benefit of excusing this attention seeking behavior with probable autism. Although I don't blame the student for reporting this, I think it was knee jerk. However,  he was within his full right because A was a guest in his room. I believe this was their first real and direct interaction as A and I totally go to the room to hang out with his roommate Max or Christian. My backing didn't help much as he was removed from the house and was issued a no-contact directive.\n\n However, his next living arrangement was with a Jewish student that straight up lied to get him out of the room. I explained the situation when he asked why A was moving into the room. He was welcoming at first and offered me a beer once I complimented his choice of beer/talked about stouts, but rescinded the offer in a snarky way once he learned I was not 21. I think it was a dick move, but I dont hold it to him as I wouldn't want to jeopardize graduation in year 3 uni either. He claimed that one of our (A and I) friends was smoking in the room.(against university housing rules, but I believe her when she says she didn't) He claimed that the room was a mess. (We were moving his stuff in so things were on the floor and in boxes) The last accusation was that A made a racially charged statement. (Saying \"Oh you're a Jew?\" when it was made apparent) For me that's a grey area because it totally sounds like something A would say, but intonation is key and determines whether or not it is derogatory. I chose to back my friend up regardless because of the other lies that this person made. Apparently he also filed a police report that couldn't be found when A and I looked for the records. \n\nThe end result was that A was moved to a single room and then given a higher bill because it's a single room. I helped him fight that too because he didn't sign up for it. \n\nLater that same year, he shows up to a BLM protest (that I was helping out with) with the intention of asking questions because he was \"invited\"(in my opinion he wasn't). He was just left on the African-American house's email list so he was sent an email inviting him to the protest that also had tons of information. When he showed up, he is recognized by the student as well as a TA (she was a little nutty but fell into his conversational traps in class e.g. got mad to the point of unprofessionalalism) and called a racist. They try to kick him out, non-violently of course, via collective body pushing. At this moment, he throws our mutual friend under the bus and says that she is associated with him which leads to her being kicked out too. \n\nMy roommate asks me to get him out, but I'm too late. On the way home I'm extremely mad and agitated while I explain to him that this wasnt the right thing to do. He defends his actions with the email invitation. Our friend is emotionally distraught and ends up punching him in the face that night. We both believe he showed up to get punched by a protestor, spencer style. Technically he got what he wanted. However, he didn't report her to the police no matter how many times she told him to. After this, he filed a police report against his TA but I don't think anything came of it. Don't quote me on that. \n\nI live with him now, but he doesn't believe he's autistic. I think he toned down the frequency of his trouble some conversation habits and 4chan browsing. He has a girlfriend without a green card so he stopped taking about immigration/makes fun of people getting deported less. He also toned down on self-deprecating racist jokes about the middle east as his girlfriend is vocally bothered by them. They're both middle-eastern. However, he still occasionally comes to me with things that he thinks I'll get heated about. Our mutual friend steve acknowledges that A does this to him too.\n\nE.g. asking me \"do you think that milk is racist?\" while fully knowing that a group of racists on /pol/ tried to make the act of aggressively drinking milk on front of black people a racist gesture. My answer if you care is along the lines of, \"if you do it to be racist, its racist\".",

      "description": "Today I was at the post office waiting for this guy to pull out of a spot. He took his time and as he finally began to pull out a city vehicle pulled right in and took it. The driver didn’t have a blinker on, he sped right into it a little too fast, and he clearly wasn’t looking where he was going. He just took the spot. To boot, he parked half way in a transit bus zone with the truck’s ass sticking over (it was a city street). There was plenty of room to pull ahead but nope, he cut me off, parked, and got out and walked away. I didn’t want to fight it out so I pulled away. As I did I noticed it was a city-owned vehicle, specifically an “Inspectional services” vehicle with city plates. \n\nI reported it to non-emergency because of the somewhat erratic and careless driving and not so much b/c he took a spot I was waiting for (though that burned me) but more because it’s a city vehicle being unsafe on the road. So am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "For some background: I am getting married this year which is awesome. What is not awesome is choosing who to invite. We are having our reception on a yacht  so we are limited on how many guests can come. It's not like at a reception hall where you can just add another chair. When they say this is the maximum they meant it. Plus we really wanted a smaller and intimate wedding. So we have our lists for both my side and his already planned for months. \n\nI am not close to all my extended family. I didnt get a long with all of them growing up. Rarely saw or spoke to them. There are just some fundamental differences between us. To me that's fine. I dont need a personal relationship with someone just because we are blood related. So there were a lot I didnt invite. I would rather spend my time and money on people I love. \n\nI did invite my favourite uncle who I'm extremely close to but I didnt invite his kids. I just cant be around them. I think he understands that as we've always fought like cats and dogs. He did mention my aunt was waiting for her invite too. Which is where things get complicated. I invited my favourite cousins but not their parents because we dont get along and their father has always been that creepy uncle. So although for my aunt her brothers,  her mother, some of her kids, and some of her grandkids are coming she was not invited. However I didnt invite some of my dad's other siblings and some of my other cousins, so it's not like she is the only one. I also didnt invite a lot of my mother's family either. Both side are literally too big it would put us over our limit and that's without my fiance's family. \n\nI'll be honest part of it is that there will be children and I never felt comfortable around him as a kid. My parents kept us separated from him as kids. As an adult I wont have him around kids. They are a packaged pair.  I also caught her snooping through my bathroom once when she visited, which left a sour taste in my mouth. \n\nSo am I an asshole for only inviting the family I'm close to? ",

      "title": "AITA for getting mad when my ex best friend ditched me for an asshole?",
      "description": "So it all started in June last year when I broke up with my online boyfriend of 4 months. I was friends with a guy from Philadelphia at the time (I'll refer to him as E for anonymity's sake). I did not view him as much more than a friend, so when it came out a month or so after my online relationship that he liked me in a more than friends way, I said I didn't like him like that, but that I wanted to continue being friends with him. Also, I'm from Southern England, so even if I did like him that way, time zones and other complications would have made such a relationship hard to maintain. He would portray himself as a nice, nerdy type of guy most of the time (though in reality, he's a discount Joji type fuckboy). However, I soon caught wind that E was salty about me rejecting him, saying that I was ugly (rating me a 4/10) and that I made him insecure. After several months of this and him trying to get me to pity him, I block him, which ended the friendship.\n\nNext I did what any girl would do and vent to her best friend (we'll call her T). I vent to T about the things he had said to me and she initially showed support. Also at the time, she was going to New York on holiday. However, it would later turn out that she got with E behind my back whilst they were in New York. I get mad because I had told her what E was like towards me, and she starts to defend him.\n\nBoth E and T also start to bully me, mainly in the form of slut-shaming. They said (though this is only a sample of it) that I was becoming an escort, would end up becoming a single mother with STDs, and basically implied I had slept with every guy I met at Uni (if anyone is interested, I've only slept with 3 men and properly had intercourse with 1). This was despite T having called herself a slut in the past. T had also told E about my private stuff and sent him photos of me \"by accident\". I get mad at them for this.\n\nAt the same time, I also start seeing a guy who I'll call A. A little bit of information about A for context: We were acquainted with each other prior to seeing each other, and he's Jewish (this will come handy in a minute). I had told T about him, excited that a guy was finally taking an interest in me. Upfront, she seemed interested. But behind my back, her and E would talk trash about him, calling him ugly, gross, and implied he was only using me for sex. Their evidence: him not being online much during the Shabbat period. E also made comments about his appearance, calling him a “pajeet looking motherfucker\" and \"forehead so big it's got its own phone code\". T's dislike for A was tame compared to E's dislike for A.\n\nE believes that Jews were responsible for communist regimes that murdered countless civilians (including members of his own family) in countries that were once part of French Indochina. So therefore, E started going on an anti-Semitic tirade. I get continue to get mad about it. T was silent throughout all of it, so I confront her about her silence, which she remained silent on.\n\nSo that's it. Fellow Redditors, am I an asshole for reacting like this?\n\n ",

I never was into it as much as she was, but we still had a fun time. We are both in the same grade and go to the same high school. There are these popular kids that are in are grade and they asked me to go see a movie with them. I said sure and that kinda turned into me hanging out with them everyday.\n\nMy cousin had dm me on instagram asking to play the video games we used to. I said no and she said ok. That’s when I thought everything was fine. But no. We used to sit together at lunch but the popular people asked me to sit with them so i did! My cousin doesn’t have that many friends, (she is a pretty quiet person) But she told me before that sometimes she liked sitting alone.\n\nFast forward a week and I haven’t sat next to her or anything, I kind of wanted to forget all about her but that wasn’t gonna happen sadly. She dm me again and tells me what’s your problem? I tell her to stop contacting me because she’s being annoying. She leaves me on read, but at school she try’s to talk to me and I walk away. (that isn’t bad right) She dm me again and says why did you ignore me?\n\nI tell her to leave me the f—- alone, she reply’s be calling me a bitch and now we don’t speak. I really don’t think I am in the wrong. But you guys tell me.\n\n",

Example: I was giving out free bonuses that two players had to share between themselves, Snakeman approached a newer player and told him what bonus to choose with him rather than asking him. He and this player often got into arguments, and I know the other player is a very nice person. I talk to Snakeman about his attitude in game and he says he will try to fix it.\n\n\nI get a job working next to Dwarven and slowly start to open up about D&amp;D again, he says he understands why he was kicked out though we still argue a bit when I tell him that I stand by me decision even though i regret the way I did it (essentially ghosted him). He blames most of the problems I had with him on his character and his now ex-girlfriend. I decide to give him another chance and he is invited back to next campaign, but continues being slightly disruptive. \n\n\nThe situation:\n\nOne session passes after my talk with Snakeman and my other friends still don’t get along with he and Dwarven. A lot of talking behind Dwarven and Snakeman’s back occurs, and I find myself having to defend their behavior even though I don’t really support it. Now, my motivation to play the game is dropping as I’m playing equal parts Dungeon Master and mediator between all of my friends. \n\n\nEventually, I decide that I just want to play the game without drama and decide to kick Dwarven and Snakeman from the group as I am closer friends with the others. So, I call a mandatory meeting, and I call each player into a seperate room for a one on one talk where I tell them if they are staying or leaving to avoid group conflict.  \n\n\nDwarven leaves without another word, slamming my door on the way out and ghosting me at work for weeks. He leaves our discord group. \n\n\nSnakeman understands but is saddened. My friend takes this to another level and kicks him from our discord group, to which he messages me asking to be let back in. I answer honestly, saying that I don’t have the powers to do so but that I would if I could. My friend refuses to budge and claims that we are better off without him. \n\n\nI have been running the game with much more ease since and all my friends are happy with the decision, but I still feel really bad, mostly for Snakeman. Am I the asshole? A lot happened and I couldn’t fit all the info so let me know if you need more.",

      "description": "This happened a few months ago but I still think about it. \n\nI was on my way home from the grocery store when I happened upon the very immediate aftermath of a one-car accident. Like, it really had happened moments before I came over the crest of a hill and I probably would’ve heard it if I hadn’t been jamming out to some music. A guy veered off the road and into a tree, head-on. When I pulled over the guy was still in the car, airbags deployed and everything. This was on a road with a lot of tight bends and hills and it had been raining all day so at first glance it seems like he hydroplaned and lost control. \n\nTwo other people in addition to myself had pulled over. They’re helping the guy out of the car while I’m calling 911. The driver is the only person in the car. The driver gets out and seems pretty disoriented. Understandable. This section of the road is pretty sparsely populated so I walk a few yards away from the scene to try to find a mailbox with a house number or a cross street to give the 911 dispatcher a more precise location. While I’m still on the phone, one of the people who also stopped came over to tell me she saw the driver throwing empty beer cans from his car into the woods. It didn’t occur to me to tell the dispatcher. \n\nWhen the dispatcher lets me go I return to the immediate scene and see for myself that the driver is indeed slinging empties from his car into the woods. He also starts to talk to me, which is the source of my moral dilemma. He tells me that he’s been in AA and he’d been doing really well, that he was in AA for the sake of his kids who he loves very much. He’s not totally plastered but it’s pretty evident that he’s been drinking. He keeps repeating that he made a big mistake. He’s crying a lot. I feel...really bad for him, honestly. \n\nSo a few cops roll up and take over the situation. Since I didn’t see the accident actually happen, they let me go. An officer walks me to my car which was about ten yards up the road from the scene. As we walk I’m grappling with whether I should tell the officer what I saw. When we get to my car I pull him aside and tell him I saw him trying to get rid of beer cans and that I suspect he’s drunk. Officer thanks me and says he’ll look into it. And I go home. \n\nSo...am I the asshole for ratting this guy out?  I guess the cops would’ve figured it out anyway, but when he was telling me that he’s been in the program and trying to better himself it really broke my heart. I dunno. ",

This is a completely unpaid student organization.

When confronted they refuse to apologize, and continue making jokes at our expense.\n- They blew up on the group chat one night calling an officer a bitch for asking why they were opening the conversation aggressively. At the meeting they called us to because of this they said we ignored them when they brought up issues, but every time they did it was as a joke.\n- On multiple occasions this person has spoken to our members and told them that other officers don't deserve their positions \n-Some of us are physically threatened by them and it's to the point where we dont want to bring up issues. \n\nThey have never apologised for anything they've done. When we being up serious issues to this straight person who's thrown slurs at someone and tells our officer base that we \"look too queer to talk to administration\", all we get is \"oh okay\" or \"alright\".\nThis person claims that they will try harder but theres been no change and recently they jumped way over our heads to start talking to some people outside of the school without our permission.\n\nI want to talk to a member of the organization to see if they'd run against this person at our upcoming election. The dude technically does their job but they make everyone super uncomfortable and multiple people want to quit because of their presence.  \n\nWould I be an asshole to try to ask a member if our organization to take this spot?",

      "description": "I had a short training session with two colleagues at work last week. Someone from the home office came in to show us how to use a program that is necessary for our jobs. I paid attention during the training. I made a couple notes of things that I did not understand to follow up on and asked questions on those at the end. At the same time, I was filling out intake paperwork for a medical appointment that I had a half-hour after the training ended. When the training was over (early) I left immediately to go to my doctor.  I didn't think anything of it at the time.\n\nToday, one of the colleagues in the training with me said that I had been rude to the presenter because they had 1) driven to give us the training and 2) asked questions at the end on things that had already been explained. I pointed out that I had not understood when the information was first presented so was asking clarifying questions. My colleague still said I was being rude. This training is mandatory for my job, so the presenter would have had to give it to us no matter what and they were the one who chose to drive instead of having us come to the main office (about a twenty minute commute). \n\nMy colleague is about six years younger than me and this is their first full-time job. It is not mine. We started about the same time. I wonder if they are overreacting because of their newness to the position. They also said that the presenter \"noticed,\" though I don't know if that means they made any comments and I did not ask.\n\nTL;DR -- I filled out medical intake paperwork during a training presentation and my colleague (who was in the presentation with me) thinks I was being rude.

We told him we didn't have any money (as our meals were covered by the college due to our meal plan). But he just asked us again alot more persistently before he was rejected again by my roommate. I don't usually keep cash on me as its just so easy to loose. But anyway later on, I was coming in from working on a project for class and I was stopped again by the same man. I don't think he remembered me even though it was only a couple hours ago previously. His story was alot more fleshed out saying that it would only take 19.75 at the local pharmacy. He pointed towards an ATM and said he was willing to beg on the ground for it. Again, I don't keep my wallet on me while I'm on campus since my school ID can get me anything here. I said again that I don't have any money and he said once again the price of it and that there was an ATM right in the building next to us (another school building). I decided to just to say that I don't get paid until next week, that was a lie. I don't even work. But that didn't even phase as he asked me one more time. I felt really, really, really bad. I could've just went into my dorm and get my wallet and take out 20 dollars to give him. I really could've but I didn't.

      "title": "AITA for wearing vanilla to work despite my coworker’s apparent aversion to it?",
      "description": "I work at a restaurant with a woman who, when I started working there nearly a year ago, approached me and told me I was going to make her throw up because I smelled like vanilla. Nearly everything I own is vanilla scented (subtly, like lotions etc., not drowning myself in body sprays or anything like that). She told me that she was allergic to vanilla so I apologized and said I would try to avoid wearing it but we rarely worked together anyway before.\n\nI wore it by accident a few times when our shifts overlapped and she was pretty dramatic and snippy about it and would make comments about being sick around me. It came out that she’s not actually allergic, she developed an aversion to the smell during a previous pregnancy years ago (which I do understand happens). I was a lot more sympathetic to the issue when she literally used the word “allergic” but I also understand that it makes her feel nauseous to smell vanilla after her pregnancy.\n\nNow, as of about two weeks ago, we work together every day. We have the same schedule and same days off. When I told her I got full time her response before any kind of congratulations was to tell me that my “vanilla days” were her days off (before knowing we had the same days off). I would have been completely okay with her pulling me aside and politely saying “hey, I’ve noticed you like to wear vanilla scented products and I just wanted to ask if you could please avoid it at work as I have an aversion from a pregnancy that makes me feel nauseous if I smell it” rather than being commanding and rude and dramatic from the get-go.\n\nTo be honest the way she’s been patronizing and telling me when I’m “allowed” to wear vanilla rather than politely asking have made me want to double down on the vanilla and wear it harder. I’m not that petty and I won’t do that, but I do feel like I shouldn’t go out of my way to avoid wearing a certain scent just because she dislikes it. Again, I’m talking vanilla scented lotion on my legs and arms applied 12 hours before shifts, not spraying myself down with sprays.\n\nThat said, I do understand that someone should not be made uncomfortable in their work place by being forced to smell a scent that makes them feel queasy.\n\nI genuinely don’t know the correct way to handle this. If she had been polite and respectful from the beginning I would be a lot more willing to make changes. In general she tends to be really patronizing and kind of rude to me, and I do have a bit of an inferiority/people pleaser complex so I can be bad at being assertive and standing up for myself. I do want her to understand that she’s speaking to another adult who is not inferior to her in any way. We also just have a weird tense dynamic now and I know it’s because of stupid vanilla.",

I dont usually bring up my partner of 4 years (25m) in conversation unless im trying to gtfo or if they prompt me. It could be something like them asking if im seeing somebody or if they could take me our for coffee/dinner/ECT. I find that men tend to treat me differently when they know i don't have a SO (as in more charming and flirt). I personally love the attention and being flirted with, and I find myself flirting back most of the time.\nI grew up with very low self-esteem and it took me years to build up the confidence i have now. So it feels nice to have \"validation\" from other people that i am attractive (or at least worthy of compliments).\nMore info: things are good with my SO. I wish we had more sex but he treats me well and worships the ground under me. I would never cheat on him. Hes the best.\n\nSo am I the asshole for letting men harmlessly flirt with me and not telling them i have a boyfriend until they ask?",

Some of this is because his body rejects a bunch of different types of food (lactose intolerance, his insides get all screwed up from spicy food, among a few others) but a larger factor is that he's \"very picky\" (again, his own words) which leads him to only want to go for the above mentioned foods. So when the group wants to go out for dinner once in a while, we're restricted to what he's able to/wants to eat. There was even a case where one person in the friend group wanted to go to this swanky Mexican restaurant downtown, but he fought it enough to convince the group to go to the local pub because they had burgers that he liked. I wasn't there, but if I were I would have pointed out to him that he could order a burger there and just take off the stuff he didn't like instead of changing the plans of the person's WHOSE BIRTHDAY IT WAS because he was more comfortable with the pub. To me, that seems incredibly selfish to not try and go along with the wishes of the person whose birthday it is. You're not going to find something you can eat at the Mexican place? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, am I a dick for not wanting to go places with this person or invite him over because he can't eat most types of food?",

I don't like basketball in general, but stunt-dunking during games is something that will always prevent me from watching becoming an avid basketball fan.\n\nAm I an asshole for seeing it as revoltingly disrespectful? I just see it as showing absolutely no regard for the opponent, and no regard for your own team. Disrespect to the opponent, because it implies that they're so easy to beat that you've got spare energy to fuck around. Disrespect to one's own team, because your bullshit could cause you to blow the play, and you'd turn points gained into nothing but burned seconds on the clock, and lost possession.\n\nThe thing is, 99 percent of the people who agree with me on these points are mean old motherfuckers. Okay. Let's get even more honest. They're mean old RACIST motherfuckers. They'll tell you to your face that they aren't just getting mad at 360 dunking because they hate black people, but it's always pretty obvious. Obviously, I'm asking everyone to take my word for it that I really *am* just pissed off at the lack of respect for opponents and teammates, and not some nebulous anger at young black men being \"uppity\" or whatever 1930s-ass bullshit word you want to pick from the 1930s.\n\nAnyway, I am wondering if I am the asshole.

My girlfriend said she had found a stray labrador a few weeks ago and was taking care of it. I was super excited because labs are my favorite and I have had nothing but them since I was a kid. It seemed like a good weekend.\n\nWhen we get there the grandma immediately yells at my girlfriend because we are a little late due to an unexpected flat. But, she calms down and my girlfriend says she is just grumpy cause we didn't call. Fair enough. I ask to see the dog and this is where it gets bad. The poor thing is locked in the root cellar chained to the wall. Piss and shit is everywhere because it hasn't been out for weeks. She has just been tossing it chunks of meat. I immediately get pissed off because this is neglect. My girlfriend tries to calm me saying she is old and from a different time. I am just like \"whatever I am getting it out now\"\n\nPoor thing is so excited to have human contact it just can't sit still. I rush it up to the bathroom to wash it off and grandma is just yelling about how it got everything covered in shit and piss. She keeps screaming at us to get it out of the bathroom because it is dirty. I really want to go slap her but my girlfriend keeps excusing her and I have a dig to clean.\n\nI keep it in our guest room and it is just the sweetest thing. Super friendly and amicable. So we leave it in the room because we have nothing for and we run to the store to buy food, collar, leash, bedding, etc. We get a call from grandma screaming that it has torn up everything. I just say I will pay for any damage just leave it.\n\nWe get back and dog is gone. The only sign of damage is a pair of my girlfriends jeans being slightly chewed. We go back in the cellar to find the dog again. Back in the shit and piss crying for help. She won't let it stay in the rest of her house anymore with how dirty and destructive it is. I say fine and leave with the dog.\n\nMy girlfriend is trying to calm me as I rage away with the dog and says she has just always been like that and not to judge her. And I am just so angry that I yell, \"The world will be better when she dies. It is a crime to treat an animal like this.\"\n\nMy girlfriend is in tears because she loves her grandma despite how abusive she is to her and animals. And I just honestly can't change my opinion. That was horrible animal abuse and I am disgusted by her. But, my girlfriend is just trying to keep peace and doesn't want me to hate her family. She keeps saying all this stuff to make things better but I just won't hear it. Too enraged.\n\nTLDR grandma keeps dog in cellar for weeks, I lose my shit and say her death is the worlds gain.

We are throwing a Christmas party and inviting a bunch of our friends. We invited her along and her boyfriend who works odd shifts. She is able to make it, her boyfriend is not due to work. So she asked us if she could invite a friend of hers along.\n\nThis isn’t a big problem to us. We like meeting cool people. But it seems strange to me that she just can’t come over and hang out with us without booking extra things to do later or bringing another person along. If I was invited to go to a party and my wife couldn’t make it, I would just go myself without needing to bring along another person in her place.\n\nAITA for finding it strange she doesn’t seem to want to just hang out with us without including other friends of hers as well?\n",

      "description": "Sorry for the format, im on mobile. A little backstory - my husband and I bought airplane tickets for my mother in laws bday so her and his little sister can come visit us for the first time since we moved back to my hometown. ( we’ve been living here for 4 years). I’m  pretty excited to see them. Later on that week, my sister in law texted my husband what flight we got, etc so she can buy a flight for her 10 yr old son to come too. I’m a little upset since she didn’t ask us if it was okay. But it’s fine. I love my husbands nephew. I’ve known him since he was 4 years old. He’s just like my husband: quiet, shy , keeps to himself but he can be quite the a-home sometimes lol. He’ll ignore you, scream at you and sometimes cuss at you. I’m just lil worried on how he will be acting around my family since he doesn’t know them at all. Plus we might have to pay for him, my mother in law and sister in law (my MIL is tight on cash and currently living paycheck to paycheck.) I’m not sure if my husbands sister will send money for him but I don’t want to ask. \n\nI would love for him to come during the summertime with his mom and her family so he can enjoy my parents pool and do summer activities with us. I brought this up to my husband and he thinks I’m being inconsiderate since his sister has 2 other kids (under age of 5) and it will help her take at least a little break. I understand completely; taking care of 3 kids at a time can be extremely stressful. \n\nAm I the asshole??",

      "description": "I went to refill my prescription at CVS the other day, and they told me my doctor denied the refill and said I’d have to call the office to get one. Mildly peeved, but whatever. It’s nobody’s fault. Yesterday, I called my doctor and asked for a refill on my prescription, and I thought all was good. Until I checked my Walgreen’s app, and saw they didn’t refill my usual medication, but a new, different type of the same medication used to treat PMDD. \n\nReasons why I am mad:\n1. The doctor never asked me about switching medications, and gave me no notice that he was going to switch my medications.\n2. My prescription used to be $3, and now it’s $30. I know some might think that isn’t too expensive, but it’s nice for me because the other prescription I get from him is $70.\n3. I don’t think my doctor knows I have PMDD. If I recall correctly (which I may not,) my gyno only has permission to share information with my primary doctor and not my psych. So my psych has no reason to know that I have PMDD.\n\nThis feels like the nail in the coffin. My psych is kinda an asshole and egocentric, and his office is so far away it becomes a pain in the ass just to show up for checkups. Because of this, I’m thinking about switching to having my primary doctor prescribe my two medications.\n\nAITA for being pissed, and is my decision to switch prescribers a little over the top?",

      "description": "Ok so way way back when I was like maybe 8 I was walking down the train tracks with my ex friend we lived right next to the train tracks and I would sometimes put pennies on the tracks so that they would get squashed and look cool. so Anyway we were talking and he thought that it was super cool and his dads birthday was coming up so he asked if he could have a penny to squash for his dad, I only had 2 pennies one for me and one for my older sister and I didnt want to go back to my house so I told him that I didn't have any he could use and that he should just go get one from his house and that I would wait here for him. He said that that was dumb and that I should just give him my penny I said that was dumb and that he could go get his own anyway we got in a whole argument and then we stopped talking I was sitting down by the track and he was throwing rocks at a tree just ahead of me I asked him to stop as I said he might hit me in the head he ignored me and kept throwing than he picked up a rock the size of like a 10 yr olds fist and threw it but the rock ended up hitting me. Now I probably wouldnt have cared about him hitting me in the head with a rock if he came and helped me up but he just ran away. So I was left there bleeding from my head and I didn't know what to do so I ran to my house and went to my mom, I ended up having to get stitches. I ended up never talking to him again and he never even said sorry. Now the reason I feel like I may have been the asshole is because I feel like the situation was easily avoidable and I really should've just given my penny to him. he threw the rock at my head but he did it on accident so is he really the asshole. \n\nIdk",

      "description": "I'm at college in the UK, so my friendship group is made up of teens between ages of 16 and 19. I'm kinda friends with a girl, we'll call her M, as we have some mutual friends. She has some form of anxiety disorder to the point where she has a panic attack every 1/2 days. From very brief discussions I know that it was caused by some trauma from a while ago. As a coping mechanism she participates in 'little culture', basically that she kinda regresses to a child like state (5 ish) and acts like a child for a period of time. She'll skip around the room, giggle like a child, move things around to make people kind of annoyed with her (she likes to describe herself as a 'bratty little') and carry around a soft toy that she refers to as her 'stuffies'. On a couple occasions she has watched TV shows for small children (teletubbies, Peppa pig, etc) on her phone at full volume whilst sucking her thumb. She talks about how she wished she had a 'daddy' (someone who 'parents' a little) who could 'punish' her. Everyone in our group is aware that she gets off to it.\nThe thing is, I don't care what she does at home. M is an adult, she can do what she wishes when it comes to the bedroom and in private. But the fact that she does all of it in public is embarrassing for our group as it draws attention due to the 18 year old who is hugging a teddy bear watching Peppa pig at full volume. But when I've tried to talk to someone else they call me an arsehole since she's been through traumatic experiences and this is how she copes, which makes me feel guilty for my opinions. It's just a really awkward situation where I don't know what to do, or even if I should do anything since I might be completely in the wrong.",

      "description": "The title may lead you to jump to conclusions, but please read the whole thing.\n\nSo this is a pretty long situation and it might get confusing, but seeing as this has been on my mind and I recently discovered this sub, I decided to make a post on here.\n\nSo about a year ago I was dating this girl I had known for a while for about a year. I was happy in the relationship, but also not at the same time. I was basically the only one who ever tried to start a conversation, plan dates, etc. She would also come up with excuses to avoid talking to me. I wanted to end our relationship but at the same time I didn't, because talking to her was one of the few things that made me happy (I suffered and still do from major depression.)\n\nSo, one day I started up a conversation like usual and all was well until I asked her if anything happened between us. She then replied with how she was going to break up with me and explained how she was going to break up with me because she rushed into the relationship too fast (which she said aftef we had dated for a year) and how for most of our relationship she didn't care about me in the way I cared about her. I handled the situation as civilly as possible, but I was of course heartbroken. After a while we said our goodbyes and went about our daily lives.\n\nAbout a month after we broke up, she had made a tweet on Twitter and I had replied to it with some sort of meme. I don't even remember what it was but I remember it really wasn't anything bad. The next day I wake up with an angry DM about how I was harassing her. Now, I am a pretty rude person, but none of the stuff I say is meant to be taken personally. She knew this from when before we were dating and during our relationship, so I found it odd. I replied to her saying that I wasn't trying to be mean to her and that I was sorry if she took offense to it. She had accepted my apology and asked me about my friends. I got worried because my friends had a reputation for being assholes. They had replied with stuff that was basically insulting to her. I had never told them to do this and I was pretty surprised that they did this. I told her that I didn't tell them to do what they did and that if I did anything similar again that it was purely ironic and not meant to be taken literally. She said okay and it basically ended there.\n\nFast forward to September or October of last year, when TikTok was huge. I, of course, thought the memes were pretty funny and I made an account to do some of my own. I stumbled across my ex's account and decided to make a duet with one of her videos. I didn't even do anything that was offensive, plus the only reason I did it was because I was under the impression that she would understand that I was being ironic. Some time passed and I saw on her Snapchat that she had posted a story where PEOPLE were harassing her. I had feared the worst because my friends had made accounts as well and we made stupid videos with each other.\n",

      "description": "So there was an event at a bar/club I bought a ticket for online, *pre-paid* - but when I got there, even though I had a ticket, they were unable to let me in due to \"max capacity\".\n\nI mean, normally I don't take it to heart and either wait or find somewhere else, but this was something that I paid for, so I figured it's not fair since I technically paid to be part of that 'capacity'. There were a few others in the same boat as me who they had to do that do who were also frustrated.\n\nEventually I got in, but I was super aggravated because I ended up missing over an hour of the event because of this, and while I was able to eventually enjoy my night I found myself leaving low tips, since I was quite livid (and felt I lost some of my money's worth).\n\nLater on I felt kind of bad because I realized it's probably not the servers fault. AITA though?",

      "description": "So I'll try keep this as short as possible, me and my gf have been dating for half a year, she now spends everyday at mine and sleeps over, I don't ask her for rent and she does not contribute to bills. I live in relative luxury compared to her rented room (which is a reason why we are always at mine). Top of line appliances etc, anyway she asked me if she could bring a bulk of clothes over to wash, tumble dry and iron. She brings over five bin liners of clothes which I didn't have a problem with until the clothes just have been sitting here for weeks on end. She gets around to washing most of them and ironing them all after much nagging from me but she left all the ironed clothes out across my living room and sure I am a clean freak but literally it was clothes everywhere she had left out and not bothered to pack anything up. After two days like this I tell her to pack it all up since I've had enough of being uncomfortable in my own living room. She gets in a bit of a mood and I just tell her that I hate nagging her constantly to clean up after herself to which it devolves into a bit of an argument about how she cleans all the time etc and that I am messy to which I tell her when I lived alone I didn't have half as much house work to do and she just says fine she'll go back to hers, she takes one bag of clothes and leaves. Am I really the asshole here? ",

We switched quite fast to Whatsapp, because both of us find reddit chat/messages bit uncomfortable. We talked quite a lot, had laugh, had troubles. But then he starts to be bit unpatient with answers (I really don´t want to reply right away). Then he wanted few photos what I am doing. What I am eating... still okay. But then he starts to be bit sexual, wanted my man stuff photo and things like that. I don´t really be nude, not even sending pics to stranger. He started with thoughts that when he comes we should sleep together in bed (I said NO!), we should bath together and doing massages each other. \n\nI was trying to explain that I am straight, Christian, male and I really can not do things like that. By his answers I deducted he was laughing at me.

Plus it’s just plain enjoyable for me.\n\n\nI kind of feel bad though, like in an unethical sort of way, how I’m acting like I’m a believer and leading others in worship, but I secretly don’t believe in god. I know that hypocrisy is a big issue in the church. \n\n\nI’m also sort of worried that if I come clean about not believing in god, they will no longer allow me to play in the band, or run tech.

It wasn't as awkward as it sounds now. I believe I small-talked for a bit before uttering the phrase above.\n\nNone of our colleagues took the comment seriously (mostly because she did not demonstrate any behavior that could point to social anxiety), but she has since blocked me from most non-work-related social media platforms and refuses to engage in any conversation.\n\nI could have thought about it more thoroughly before I said the sentence, but I doubt that the minimal, if any, repercussions that ensued could warrant such a drastic reaction from her.",

She told me that she was meeting up with her friends step brother in New York City to grab dinner. \n\nNow her “friend” is someone she hasn’t spoken to much in the last few months after a bit of a falling out. They’re starting to talk again but they haven’t really hung out yet to my knowledge. I have never met her friends step brother before and never even heard her mention him. So when I asked why she was getting dinner with him in the city she said “because I’ve known him for a really long time” and she could feel my concern growing. I got upset with her saying that if I were to pull something like this she would lose it and that there’s a huge double standard happening here. She’s telling me I’m getting upset over nothing.

My friend is very aware of this and has even attempted to help me when I needed it, however as our friendship went on she began acting more and more disrespectful towards me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had an argument in august when she defended someone who called me an attention w\\*\\*\\*\\*, even when I told her he reminded me of my father's actions, and told her she should be more understanding as she too, has had similar experiences as me. She said some very cruel words towards me and stopped talking to me for a few days. I apologized as I missed her friendship, and I assumed we'd be okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was very distant towards me afterwards, and my anxiety swelled up inside me and I began worrying if she hated me. At the same time, her girlfriend, my close friend, stopped talking to me as much so I assumed she had something to do with it. All I did was warn her that I'm starting to worry that she hated me, and she got mad at me again and blocked me. This hurt me alot as she didn't even allow us to talk things through, and it was around the time my dog died so I was already very sad. I started cutting myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy chance, we met again at the local mall. We make up, and she agrees to be friends and we discuss boundaries. I told her that her blocking me for no reason hurt me alot and worsened my earlier state, and that because of that I can't forgive her. But I was willing to be friends with her as long as we didn't get too close.

      "description": "I've been with my girlfriend for 5 years now, I wouldn't say weve had the easiest relationship but we've made it this far so I think that's saying something. \n\nThere is a woman I met at the gym(let's call her Jen) that I have been friends with since I started going there about 2ish years ago (it's a crossfit type facility so think lots of individual classes for working out). We have never  hung out outside of the gym, and never really been alone together besides short conversations by a squat rack or something. Jen left the gym because of the cost maybe a year and a half ago, and since then, the only way we have communicated is via Instagram messages, which my girlfriend can see if she wants to. We still talk regularly(once a day or so), honestly talk is a strong word, most of our communication involves funny gym memes, cool cabins, or cute furry animals. We generally talk positively about my girlfriend and Jen is well aware of my relationship. We have never crossed a line of flirting that I am aware of.\n\nI have offered numerous times for my girlfriend to meet her or do a double date or something but she doesnt want to.\n\nI assume this partially stems from the fact that 1. Jen and I have quite a few things in common and 2. She's somewhat cute. She's older than me and while yes she looks good for her age, there are reasons why if I was hypothetically single I would not be interested.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would definitely hang out with her(as friends) to do some rock climbing or weightlifting since we share those interests but I would never do that if my gf wasn't comfortable.\n\nDespite all of this, my girlfriend seems to loosely tolerate this friendship, but takes any opportunity to make fun of it or make it look suspicious. \n\nAITA for still being friends with this girl? Or is having \"girl\" friends just always going to be a weird and suspicious thing? Is this just my girlfriend projecting her own insecurities, or insecurities about our relationship? Do I need to put more work into our relationship to get rid of those insecurities? ",

He asks if i could work this weekend to train my replacement and I happily agreed. We went out yesterday and I pretty much just had him shadow me and learn the job. Today I shadowed him and gave him advice as we went. Now this being his second day he was pretty slow, which didn't bother me much except I wanted to be home in time for the start of the football game. About half way through the route I realized this was going to be a problem. Long story short I leave early leaving this guy on his second day to finish the route. Its not a difficult job and he pretty much had the basics down so I felt confident that worst case scenario he wouldn't screw things up. Our best accounts were completed and our last couple accounts were pretty much trash. Still now I feel guilty I ditched the new guy never to be heard from again.",

      "description": "So I (22f) slept with someone about a year ago. They gave me genital herpes. I later learnt that they knew they had herpes but didn't think it was important to tell their partners. \n\nSo fast forward to a few weeks ago. I met a guy (25m) and we start talking, we flirt over text a bit and we decide to meet up. Before anything happens I tell him I have herpes and give him something information on it, I also give him a couple of websites so he can do his own research if he wants to. I'm on anti-virals, always use protection and never have sex curing/immediately after an outbreak. \n\nAs you can guess, he catches herpes. This was always a risk, I told him this more than once, I even gave him a few days between telling him and us hooking up so he could research/let it sink in. I also told him explicitly that it was cool if he didn't want to have sex anymore.\n\nAnyway, he calls me up and tells me, well he shouts it at me. I understand he's upset but he's saying really awful things about me, blaming me for what happened. I try and calm him down 'cause I know they actual worst thing about herpes is when you first have it and you suddenly feel very dirty.\n\nHe calls me up multiple times to shout at me and call me names. At one point he asks me how is he going to tell his family (why???). After he calls me a diseased whore I tell him that I'm going to block his number if he doesn't stop and he says I should take responsibility for what I've done. I hang up, send him some forums for people with herpes so he can have people to talk to and block him.\n\nI spoke to a friend (she doesn't know him, didn't give her any details about him) and she says I should be more sympathetic 'cause it was kind of my fault?\n\nI feel like I did everything in my power to keep him informed and that ultimately it was his choice, the only other thing I can really do is not have sex with anyone unless they know their status which like 90% of people don't.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "This is complicated so please hear out the back story, tldr at the end. My boyfriend and I [both 25] live in a big apartment complex with a dog park that allows for a bit of a social life within the community. We get to know some of our neighbors. A girl started showing up with her dog and she was pretty obviously somewhere on the autistic spectrum, very sweet and friendly but slim to no awareness of social cues, personal space, things like that. I have no idea how old she is, I’d guess from 14-twenties. I think I recall her talking about a school dance so I think she might be in high school. She stares a lot and makes people uncomfortable so a lot of our neighbors avoid her. I’ve met her dad a couple times, he is also very kind and friendly.\n\nToday my boyfriend comes back from the park and says something like “[girl] is down there again with that guy who is always getting close to her, I felt weird so I left”. I had no idea what he was talking about and pressed for details, he joking said something like “idk he’s probably trying to smash” and I got really worried. Our balcony overlooks the park and I saw the 2 of them sitting on a bench, she was hugging his arm and leaning her head on his should as they both laughed and talked. I’ve met this guy once or twice and he didn’t seem to be on the spectrum as far as I could tell and I also remember him being an adult probably 20ish or college aged, to be fair I could be misremembering. My boyfriend thinks he is probably 16-19. My worry is this guy knows she can easily be taken advantage of. I am in no way a professional at identifying people’s various disabilities, intentions, measuring peoples capability, or even guessing ages. I just don’t want something terrible to happen to her.\n\nBest case scenario she found someone who understands where she is coming from, who doesn’t care or notice the things other people shun her for, and they are a couple of teens with a crush on each other. I really hope this is the case. \n \nMight I have a responsibility to say anything to anyone? My boyfriend thinks I should mind my business and they are just a couple of kids who get each other. I’d hate to steal this bit of happiness from her if it’s harmless. I got into plenty of mischief with boys in high school and wouldn’t want to take that from someone else. I’d hate to tattle and her parents make her stop spending time with him, especially since she has a hard time making connections and she seems to be happy hanging out with him. But if he could be taking advantage of her, I cant stop worrying about what could happen if I don’t say something. \n\nWIBTA if I speak up and wreck things for her?\n\nTLDR autistic girl seems to have a romance with someone who could potentially be taking advantage of her disability for his own purposes...but he might also just be someone who understands her.",

      "description": "First off, I've never owned a dog. I live in a relatively densely populated and popular walking area. Every week on trash day I wheel my trash can out in the morning and in the evening when I get back from work, there will usually be at least one bag of dog shit at the bottom of my empty trash can. For the first few weeks I just left it there and wheeled the can back into my barely one stall garage, because I have no outdoor property. But the stench of leaving the shit in my garage is unbareable, maybe it's because I've never had a dog and I'm not use to the smell of dog shit. But by the 4th day, the smell of rotten dog shit makes me dry heave as I'm heading to work. So now when I get home on trash day I just reach in the can take out the bag(s) and leave them on the street.",

Stop the van with just enough room for hatchback to reverse out and wait for the free spot.\n\nI see a white sedan coming from the opposite direction and make the same manoeuvre. There are exactly zero spots available. Reverse lights just engaged on the hatchback. Oh h*ll no! White sedan is crazy if she thinks that spot is hers. I put my blinker on just in case it's not obvious. (I probably should have done this immediately when I stopped. It was an oversight but in my mind not a fatal one.)\n\nWhite sedan is not phased. Persists in appearing as though she is entitled to hatchback's spot. The nanosecond hatchback is clear of my van, I'm in the spot. White sedan is honking and visibly in disbelief.\n\nI give her my best 'too bad, too sad' look and get on with my day. Am I the asshole here? Was my fatal error the delayed indicator justifying her entitlement to the parking space?

From then on we started hooking up on and off until she met her new BF.\n\nShe called me few months later to tell me she was pregnant. At first I was happy, because I thought she was gonna tell me that it was from her new bf she had been with but turns out that after doing tests, it was mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wanted to keep it, and by all means she could have : she was well off in life (stable job, no debts, fully paid 4 room app, living in the suburbs of a big city), always loved kid and would for sure make a great mom.\n\nI wasn't sure what to say, so I gave her all of my medical records since my family doesnt have a good one and told her to think about it carefully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the following days, I flipped the questions on all sides but came to the conclusion that I didn't want her to have our child.\n\nMy bad medical record scared me and while SHE was ready to be a mom, I wasn't ready to have a child of mine out there. She told me that I didn't need to be a father figure, that I didn't even need to recognize it as my own but the fact was that her BF, while understanding the situation, wasn't all too happy with it.\n\nWe argued for weeks about this, until we came to the point where having an abortion wasn't gonna be legal in our country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe half-agreed and we went through with it. After it happenned I was with them in medical care when her BF said that they should break up. I let them have their time and when he left I tried going back in but she literally shouted at me to disappear from her life.\n\nI let her know that if she needs help or someone to talk I was always there, like I always had been even before we were dating but she heard none of that and kept screaming at me while crying. We cut off all contact for 2 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(YEAR 4-5 and PRESENT) We made contact again, and even if we are not best of friends anymore, we still are good friends.\n\nNow I live with my girlfriend and she lives with her BF and his son, she's an happy mom. I got to talk with ex-gf's sister and learned that she went through depression because she felt she killed her baby by having an abortion and couldn't imagine getting her own anymore. I never got to talk about it with her and everytime I try to put it on the table she says \"Another time..\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for putting her through this while she could have safely ensured, alone, the happinness of her child?",

      "description": "Ok, first time poster here, and I've been having this thought in the back of my mind for a few days now, ever since I've have this conversation with a black co-worker of mine. Some backstory before I start though. I was bullied though out my middle school and high school life by other black people for how I walk, talk, act, and saying I'm not \"black\". This has cause me to become VERY guarded towards any black person I see (my Therapist says I have PTSD). Cause of this, I have used video games and anime to escape from my trauma. Thanks to most fictional characters of the media I prefer being white, and the white people I've interacted with, has cause me to believe that white people are kind, loving individuals, while black people are cruel, spiteful animals. Ever since I started working though, I've slowly come to realize that the world is made up of all kinds of people, good and bad, regardless of skin tone.\n\nBack to the topic at hand. I was at work, minding my own business, when the store manager (I worked at retail), a white man, started to asked some questions. I tried to answered them the best I could, but I got nervous while answering them. He told me though, that I told him what he wanted to hear, and to not worry about it. After he left tho, I started feeling guilty, since how I answered his questions, made it feel like I sold out my coworkers. So later, I brought this up to my black co-worker, the one I talked about earlier. He said dont worry about, tho he told me that I shouldn't have gotten nervous. I told him that the store manager was in a position of power, and therefore, had authority. He told me that I didn't need to respect that, just like how I dont need to respect police officers (being that my father is retired navy, as well as having both my mother and stepfather in corrections, you can see how that would offend me). I asked him why. He told me it's because all these officers (tho I'm pretty sure he only means white officers) are killing all these \"innocent\" black people for no reason, and cause of that, he hates cops. I told him that's because the media only focuses on the race, and never on the story, which always has two sides. He looked at me with a look of disdain and flat out told me I was a uncle Tom (apparently, it means I will sellout my own race, if it will put me on good terms with \"The White Man\").\n\nThat why I'm writing this post now. I mean, I know that I prefer white people (thanks to my bullying), and I know that we used to be slaves a long time ago (even tho that was a long time ago and that's no excuse for our race to act how its acting now), but that doesn't mean I'm going to exclusively snitch on black people only. A crime is still a crime. It just means I'm going to respect the officer. Why? Cause they exist to keep YOU safe.",

      "description": "\n\nAlright so before you get on and yell at me for anything. It's not exactly as harsh as the title might suggested it. So I was dating this guys let's call him John. John and I were an happy couple, I lived everything about him. His personnaility was amazing his physique was a tad feminine but I actually liked it a lot. I was falling in love pretty hard and we never really had a complete relation or sex. We've been together 7 months and he pleasured me but I actually never had the occasion to pleasure him in return. He has told me about 3 months into the relation he had a micropenis and was really shy about this so I didn't really mind doing cuddles and stuff without an actual penetration because I respected him and his insecurities. \n\nNow, foward to 7 months into our relation (about 2 weeks ago). I talked to him and asked him if I could do anything to make him more comfortable because I care for him and I wanted to show him it's not a problem to me. Which really isn't as I'm bi and I don't have any issues with sizes. He said no and told me in a really rude way that it was none of my business and I should just enjoy what he is giving me. I was really sad and frustrated so I left his place and went to a common friend of our. The friend told me that John made her swear to not say anything but in fact she used to be a girl and is on transition for 6 years now but never did the operation. I felt betrayed and lied too. I was so angry. I slept it off. \n\nThe next day I went back to his place and ask him to tell me the truth. He told me I was stupid and it should not matter. I replied it does matter if it's a lie. He told me I was an asshole and I should just love him the way he his and he shouldn't have to specify he was transgender. \nHe clearly soenst see my point and at this point I broke up with him. \n\nNow everyone seems to think I'm this transphobic asshole who left this poor person and his family are sending me messages almost everyday to remind me how awful I am and how bad I broke his heart. \nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here ? \n\n-sorry for my bad English I'm French and my grammar is pretty weak",

      "description": "This is some basic teenage bs and now that I read it its chaotic and some stuff may be irrelevant but idk, even few judgments would be great.\n\nLast summer I was on holiday at my godfather's . I liked one girl whom i ve kind of known from last year when i visited the same place. I didnt fall for her on first sight, but she was really sweet, interesting and pretty. We havent really stayed in any contact except following eachother on ig and stuff that comes with it. Anyways, fast-forward to this year, i ve developed crush (during the about year between two visits) on her but i didnt have much expectations. For the first 2 weeks i havent even seen her and i was kinda down about it and i decided that i want to at least meet her. On the next occasion i told my godsister that i liked her during last holiday, which wasnt entirely truth, but huh i didnt want her to know that i liked her right now because i would feel stupid and whatever. Next day when i went to pick up my friend from bus station godsister insisted that she would take me to it.  Long story short we met crush soon after, she was waiting for us on next corner even though they dont usually hang out together. When we picked my friend up they offered to take us to play pool which we accepted. After couple of games(i was playing best pool of my life lol) they said they were going for \"a little walk\". We waited quite long and played other stuff in arcade( i mean they left without even offering to pay for pool but that didnt really bother me much since we would have payed however but idk). After a while we went to grab some wi-fi and asked them if we should wait or what to which we got  \"oh you dont have to\". I was told later that they went to company where crush of my crush was and that that was the reason they left us. I did ask her and she told me that she had to go home because of training which i didnt really believe but directly towards her i didnt act hurt. I wasn't angry anyways, I just felt like a piece of shit back then. We continued messaging for a while, i recommended her himym(tv show) and we talked about that and some other basic stuff. I mistakenly spoiled her one episode(actually it was even a misslead) because i missread her message and i got \"FUCK YOU\". I apologized and  didnt want to say anything more about it bcs if i did she would have actually been spoiled. After a couple of days i messaged her hoping she had seen the episode by now  to explain it and sort it out but she didnt respond. I heard from her on couple of ocassions but nothing special. Recently I unfollowed her because I started feeling bad about my lack of self esteem and the fact that she was important to me but i really wasnt to her.\nAs I told couple of my friends whole story and reason I did what i did I got mixed opinions on whether I have the right to feel hurt and kind of angry since I ignored it at first in favour of having some kind of contact with girl I still liked. So AITA? ",

      "description": "Okay so my biology teacher is a male about 50 or so and he's said some really sketch things but I'm not sure if I would be overreacting if I reported him because if it. One time a few months ago we were talking about genetics and he said that one person (when it comes to procreating) can change everything. He then used HIV as an example and said that HIV \"started in the gay community.\" He didn't say that some people believed that, he said it as if it was fact, which it isn't. We we're also talking about chromosomes and such and he ended up talking about downs syndrome and said that some women want to abort if they know the baby will have downs syndrome and he said \"everyone has a right to live.\" This bothered me because he's giving his own opinion on a controversial topic and saying it as if it's fact.\n\nWe watch these YouTubers in class who are twins and make videos about biology and he has said that he thinks they're hot in class and that he wants to find where they live and stalk them and marry them (my friend actually told me this she has him at a different period but she wouldn't lie about that.) He also a few weeks ago told a student that \"it's hot because you're in here\" when she asked why it was hot in the classroom. When another student said that that was an inappropriate thing to say to a student he started accusing that student of thinking the girl he called hot isn't pretty. \n\nI think I might be biased tho because I really don't like him. He's recently moved me away from my partner because we we're both using our phones but it was before he had even started the class. I would understand if we were talking but we weren't. I just think that's a weird reason to move me for like if he wanted to punish me for using my phone wouldn't he take it away and not move me? He also moved me once because my partner was talking to me when he was talking but why would he move me and not my partner when she was the one talking to me? Honestly I feel like he's just got something against me and he doesn't like me because it seems like he always picks on me for the smallest of things that he let's other students get away with.\n\nBut idk would I be the asshole if I reported him? Idk if the things he said are that bad in my opinion they are but idk. Also I'm kind of scared that if I do report him the counselor will tell him I told on him and then he'll pick on me even more. Sorry this was so long. ",

She makes okay money, we’ve been getting by. She’s been babysitting on the weekends recently for a friend of a friend which has helped. \n\nSo the other day she came back from babysitting and talked about the Switch that the family had and that she and the kid she babysits had had a lot fun playing on. Since my wife is an LPN she works really hard and doesn’t relax a lot and so the idea of her having something to relax with and have fun with sounded really appealing. Husband of the year award, right? \n\nSo I found a used Switch on Craigslist and bought it. I got for 75 bucks cheaper than retail, so I feel it was a good deal. I surprised her with it this morning and she was furious. She said I had no right to spend her money on a gaming system. I thought when you get married it’s OUR money not your money. Is she being bitchy or am I the asshole? She keeps saying she was trying to save money but that’s what the babysitting money is for, I never ask her about that. Plus why would she be saving money without telling me? Seems fishy, right? \n\nThe shitty part is that when I turned it on this afternoon it didn’t work and the guy I bought it from isn’t responding to my texts or calls. I’m thinking about filing a police report but that’s for another post I guess. ",

It is mine and you arent taking my stuff\".\n\nNow if my sister or niece would have just asked me if they could have it I probably would have just said yes.

As I should have expected they would, things went poorly and now I'm stuck halfway across the country from my family. \n\nWhile we were married, we adopted several (5 cats, 1 dog) pets together which are now solely in my care. When we first separated, he told me he'd send me back to my parents', but I'd have to \"find something to do with all the cats.\" He told me over and over again how heartbroken he would be if they had to be adopted out, but also put forth no effort to find alternate solutions. This turned into a no-win situation, seemingly designed for the sole purpose of manipulating me, so I packed everyone and everything up, and I left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to now: I live with my boyfriend who graciously took in me and my entire zoo. We're in an apartment ten minutes away from my ex husband, tens of thousands of miles away from my family. I've been homesick since the day I left, I've cried every day this week over missing home, and cried for months and months before that over the same. Being so far from my parents has been extremely detrimental to my mental health, to the point where I regularly see a therapist for SI. \n\nBF(28m) has lived in this state his entire life. He hardly sees his parents (typically avoids them at all costs), doesn't live near enough to his friends to visit, and works a minimum wage job that he hates. He does have severe medical issues that require regular doctor visits, but he just recently decided to switch doctors and hasn't yet begun seeing them - or hardly settled on one. The lease on the apartment isn't up for another few months, but his roommate (30m) just moved out with his wife and still pays rent here...and I honestly think he'd eagerly cover the cost of early termination if we were to jump ship here. \n\nEvery time I bring up leaving he shuts down and either changes the subject or just gets sad and anxious and stops communicating. He knows I hate it here, he's known since we met that leaving was my end goal, and I've told him I want him to come with - but he's just dragging his feet, refusing to move forward.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for wanting to gtfo? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Additional info: \n\n\\-BF has said that he would be open to moving back home with me, he's just nervous \n\n\\-BF has $13k from his parents in a separate bank account for \"emergencies\" (which he has listed as: medical emergencies, accidental pregnancies, car failure, or *down payment on a house*) \n\n\\-BF's parents pay for nearly everything. Phone bill, medical bills, gas when we're in town, medical insurance, car insurance, and paid for his degree\n\n\\-I drive a small car &amp; can't transport even half of my things or any of the cats\n\n\\-Roommate is very well off, owns several businesses and just recently got married. His wife did not live with us)",

      "description": "Allright so here goes, I've been living with a woman for three months now and paid $495 monthly for rent and internet access. I mean I have a full time job so paying it isn't really an issue but I just have this weird vibe about the whole situation. First off i moved in the middle of December because living with my dad was hindering our relationship (now everything's fine). she told me the day we met that I could move in whenever I wanted because ''the room is empty anyways'' or something along those lines, so I did. A couple days later I asked to see the rent and internet bill just because  I think I'm a bit entitled to see that since im living here (right?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n She got very defensive (that's the vibe I got from her anyways) and mumbled something along the lines of ''I need to charge you this'' or something. She then told me that since I didn't pay for december that this amount would cover the rent for that month over time. So since im not one to be confrontational I said ''ok'' and got back to my room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I've been paying that amount for the last 3 months and I mean yeah its weird but at the same time she never asked money for groceries and she explicitly told me that what she bought was for the both of us to eat and always offers me a plate of whatever she's cooking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I met my downstairs neighbor a while back and we got to talking and I asked him what he paid for rent. He told me he pays 600 + utilities, I was a bit shook up but when I told him I how much rent I pay he told me that her rent was a bit higher because utilities are included in her lease. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso I mean now I really don't know what to do, I mean I live a pretty worry-free life since she pretty much does everything around the apartment and never asked a dime for groceries, but I just feel like something is off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nextra info: \n\n\\- I did not sign any legal documents (like the lease). \n\n\\- We have 10mbps of download speed, so I highly doubt we pay $100 for that kind of service.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So we went on holiday last year in July with a group of friends which was great but I'm wanting to go away just the two of us this year. We're both quite young, at 19, and still live at home with our own parents and don't have to pay anything apart from food. He has his car insurance to pay for but other than that, he likes to save his money for the future. This results in us not going places often so a week away would be great. \n\nHe is a full time apprentice and I've worked out that the holiday would cost about 10% of his wage from now to when we'd go away (about 6 months). I understand that it is his money and his choice but I can't help but feel frustrated and annoyed as I feel that it is holding me back from doing what I want to do. To resolve this I've considered going away with friends however I've lost contact with most of them as they've left for university and we wouldn't want the same type of holiday so my only option would be to go with him.",

I eventually confronted her about it because I didn’t feel comfortable about it at all. My sister had a tantrum and eventually after screaming a lot she finally caved when my mother got involved. \n\nFast forward a year and she’s still dating this guy that is absolutely terrible (broke her heart that I had to fix). She asks me if he could stay over for tonight and I say yes because they had recently gotten back together and I was happy she was happy. But now she’s using it as an free pass for everything and he’s been coming more and more frequently, I’m worried they’ll start doing it again.\n\nI confronted her again and she began throwing a tantrum again saying. “you can’t tell me what to do with my life” , “You don’t let me be me, I’m 25 for fucksake” and “that’s none of your business”\n\nTL;DR: AITA for telling my sister not to let her boyfriend sleep over in my moms house anymore.",

      "description": "Ok, so I (20M) went to a pre-drinks recently. In the UK, a ''pre drinks'' is what you do before you got a nightclub. You drink before going to the club at uni. Not sure its the same in America as you can't go nightclubs until you're 21.\n\nAnyway, a bit about myself. I am 6''1 and dress really well. I don't consider myself ''traditionally good looking''. I feel that I have to really put some major effort to look decent, so I put a lot of effort into quiffing my hair, smelling good and dressing well. If I don't do this, I don't think I look good at all. I generally did follow the advice I got on the internet (be as physically fit as possible and look your best; grooming, hair, clothes, smell, etc). Also not sure if my race is relevant, but to give as much background and context possible, I am quite light brown skinned (half Punjabi Indian/half Tamil Indian).\n\nSo, me and my friend (also 20M) went to this pre-drinks and while I was there I was talking with everyone and my friend comes up to me and he can't stop laughing. I ask him ''What's up?'' and he said ''That black girl over there said you must be gay''.\n\nI felt so furious when that happened, I dressed well to attract girls, and now one of them thought I was gay. Given that I was a bit drunk as well, I instantly approached her and said ''What the fuck did you say to me??'' and she said ''Huh??'' and I said ''You fucking called me gay? How dare you say shit like that. I'm not gay'' and she looks quite scared and starts saying ''Sorry sorry, I didn't mean it honestly I was just curious I'm sorry'' and she looked a bit intimidated. I said ''Good'' and walked off and continued with my night.\n\nNow I've seen that girl again, and every time I see her, she always makes a point to say ''Hi throwawaykljfslk'' but she says it in a scared sort of way. The friend who told me (20M), said that I reacted like an asshole, AITA?",

      "description": "My husband and I have a 7 week old baby. We’ve worked out a schedule so that we both get at least 6 hours of sleep a night by alternating shifts. I owe him a huge amount of credit as I know it’s not something all Dads do. \n\nI have dealt with post partum anxiety since giving birth and my he believes that I am irrationally worried about the safety of our baby/ accuses me of not trusting him. \n\nHe’s not wrong, at least on the trust end. The second day we were home I gave him the baby while I went to the bathroom. By the time I got back he had fallen asleep holding her. This scared me, and I talked to him about why it was unsafe (huge SIDS risk) and why we need to put her down in a safe space if we are that tired. He was defensive and accused me of overreacting. \n\nWhenever I bring something up like this he says I am being overly concerned. In some cases, he is probably right (I.e. I check on her in the night to make sure she is still breathing, which I know is irrational). I took this on board and am seeing a therapist and on anti-anxiety meds. \n\nThere are other things that I think are justified- like telling him not to place a loose blanket over her while she is napping, or asking him not to put things in her bassinet. I explain why we shouldn’t (the suffocation risk is small but why even take it?) and it falls on deaf ears. This contributes to my anxiety and has made it difficult for me to leave her alone with him.\n\nThings came to a head this evening. My husband kept encouraging me to go to bed. I was nervous but swaddled her and left in her bed where he was watching her. She was awake but not fussy, just lying quietly. \n\n I got up to go to the bathroom and peaked in on them. He  had taken her out of her bed and fallen asleep with her on his chest! I yelled and he was in such deep sleep that he didn’t wake up until I picked up the baby (who thank god was fine) and shook him. He became super defensive, insisting ‘its fine’ and ‘it was only for a few minutes.’ He said he had to do it because she wasn’t sleeping. \n\nI was NOT level headed and yelled about how dangerous it was, pointing out that it was only a few minutes because I checked (what if I hadn’t?) and that a baby can still suffocate in minutes. \n\nHe started telling me that I irrationally worry about everything before accusing me of not trusting him, telling me I am impossible to deal with and then saying ‘fine, I just won’t do anything ever!’ \n\nI have lost perspective on this situation. I have anxiety and he is not wrong when he says that I do not trust him with the baby.  I should be able to trust my husband and that it’s hurting him that I don’t. But I don’t know how to get over my worries when things like this happen, especially when he won’t admit that he made a mistake.  On the other hand, my anxiety tends to make me think the worst of every situation and maybe he is right that I need to start trusting him and not be so mad about this. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?

      "description": "  \n\nI go to school a few hours away from home and am graduating with my master’s this May. So, a lot of my family who're coming up for the commencement need a place to stay for a night or two. So far everyone who's coming up is just getting a hotel, but then the other day my mom decided to inform me she was staying at my place instead of a hotel. Now, I in general was not crazy about her staying over. Sometimes if a friend needs a place to crash after we've been drinking or something it's not a big deal but having my mom (and probably my sister) stay over in my one bedroom apartment and then having the potentially three of us getting ready on top of each other in my one small bathroom does not sound like a good time. I didn't completely rule it out yet though because I don't want to be unreasonable. But then she told me, as in did not ask, that because her back isn't great she'd also need to take my bed and I'd have to take the couch. This is when I told her I wasn’t doing that. \n\nI am not crazy about the idea at all, but even more than that I really think it's rude how she just straight up told me that this was the plan instead of asking me if it was alright. I would have strongly considered it if she'd just asked me too. Money is tight, so I get she doesn't want to spend it on a hotel for the weekend (they don't let you buy just one night during commencement) but I don't think that entitles her to my bed or even my apartment necessarily. I also really don't care much about the actual commencement ceremony. I'm just doing it because my family wants me to. So, it's not like it's some big thing she's bending over backward to do just for me either. If I'm doing it, it'd be nice for her to be there, but I'd be just as happy not going to the ceremony and seeing everyone a few days later when I came home anyway. She feels it's normal for a son to make sacrifices for his mother and thinks she shouldn't even have to ask me to do this, but I think that's absurd for her to just assume. I don't mind making sacrifices and helping when I can, but I think she's being unfair this time. No one else's parents are even asking to stay in their apartment, and even when my dad (who actually helps pay for my rent since I'm still in school) came up, he at least stayed on my couch (which was also after I offered once he said he was thinking of coming, he didn't have to ask).\n\nMy mom and I normally have a good relationship, and realistically it's probably settled since my grandpa was there and told me (after she'd gone to the bathroom, so she doesn't know yet) that he'd just get her a hotel room. But she seemed almost surprised this was an issue, and I'm really shocked she didn't understand how I had a problem with what she was demanding and the way she did it. So, I wanted to check. Am I being an asshole here, or is she really being a bit unreasonable.",

It’s usually for good reason too. \nAnna found out the man she was dating was married. Instead of leaving his lying ass, she just kept trying to get him to admit it. When he continued to lie, she reached out to his wife and they had a heart to heart. You would think she would leave it there but she’s still texting him because I guess she didn’t get enough closure just finding out and wants him to hurt like she hurt. But that texting turned to flirting and now she’s telling me she’s going to start smashing him again. \n\nAnd this is just one of Anna’s bad decisions. She refuses to communicate with people and expects them to do all the work. So this results in her expecting people to do things for her but not asking for them and then being mad when nothing happens. \n\nWe just got back on good terms but I want Anna to make better choices. Will I be the asshole if I call her out on her bullshit?",

      "description": "I don't really know where to begin, i'll just start somewhere i guess and i'll try my best to explain both sides of the story. \n\nI have this good friend, let's call him Sam, for over a year now. We bonded over a common interest, which is Pokemon GO (if you're about to leave after that, don't, because it's not about the game). At first, everything was fine, we played, we took walks and we got closer.\n\nSee Sam has a lot of issues with himself, ranging from low self esteem, to trust issues, which more or less began some years ago, when some friends took advantage and abandoned him, a girl who left him and he was in a very dark place in general. The thing that pretty much saved him was Pokemon GO, because it gave him an escape. After that, he divoted most of his time in the game; school, school projects etc all came second, especially if there was an event going on.\n\nBecause of the fact that he plays a lot more than me, we decided that we would share accounts, so that when i can't play he would play for me and vice versa.\n\nFast forward a year and things have... changed; Sam is grateful because i have helped him get over some of his issues (psychology is kinda my hobby), but some would say a little *too* grateful. He has basically taken over my account and does all the heavy lifting, because a) he doesn't \"want me to get tired, because i have less time\" and b) since he does it more \"efficiently\", i shouldn't do anything except call the shots.\n\nI don't think that's a terrible thing in itself, but when i DO get around to doing anything, either because i have time or because i'm closer etc, he goes berserk. He says that i must always tell him when i'm going to the city's centre to play Pokemon, so that he can come. He'll come even if he doesn't have time; if i tell him i don't want him to come, he thinks that i try to finish whatever he (we) started to do and take full credit (something i've *never* done about anything, let alone Pokemon).\n\nToday i went to the centre because i wanted to visit a couple stores and since i was there, i opened the game; i told him so and he was ok with it, since he had a job to do. Right as i was leaving, his job got cancelled and he ran like a madman to the train station to make it in time before i leave. He didn't make it and he was *mad at me*, because yesterday i told him i didn't have plans to go (which is true, i didn't have plans, but things changed) and that it's my fault he's angry. (clarificatio: this isn't the first time this has happened) \n\nI've told him time and time again that this is too much for me; even though his intentions are pure, i can't live with the fact that i'm basically forced to hang out with him, every time i want to play pokemon there, or else i'll have to deal with him going crazy.\n\nThis is extra hard for me, because until last year, i was in a very toxic relationship. The girl wouldn't trust me, especially when it came to having female friends (i've never done anything of the sort, so her suspisions were unjustified) and she would come with me wherever i went; if i said no she would assume i didn't want her.\n\nWhat happened today pushed me to the edge. I can't do it anymore; how can i make him see that bossing someone around like that and forcing them to a situation they potentially didn't want to be in, is not ok, even though he can't understand what's wrong with it? Aita for being extremely angry about what happened today (and not only today) and further more so because i feel there are times when i need to play alone? Is that such a bad thing? ",

I told her sure and that I charge X amount of money for it - she agreed. Few days later I finally get her laptop and start working on it. Turns out the HDD is broken and since it was a pretty old laptop she decided it was not worth replacing it, however she did ask me if I can recover some pictures off her drive. This is of course where I fucked up by not telling her how much I charge for it but instead I just asked where she kept the pictures and proceeded to try to recover them. After about 2 hours I managed to recover a 1 GB folder of pictures and she said that's all she needs. We agreed we'd meet in few days and I'd copy the pictures onto her pendrive. Today I realized I completely forgot to tell her the price so I wrote her a quick message, she replied with \"For 1 folder? No thanks :)\". That's fair since I didn't specify the price first so I replied with 'OK, let's meet on Monday and I will give you the laptop back\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I feel kinda bad because from her perspective it kinda seems that now that I own her pictures I can basically demand any price I want, especially since the pictures are probably of a sentimental value for her (with her kid).

(The child was staying over at her apartment.)\n\nI have nothing against casual use. I’ve done molly. However, given her history with drugs and child neglect, I was irritated she could be mistreating my nephews AGAIN. \n\nI called the police, told them what was on Facebook, where she lived, etc. They already knew exactly who I was talking about and knew the boyfriends name before I even gave it. \n\nApparently when they checked her place out, the boyfriend wasn’t there. She had deleted the post, and her two kids were sleeping. She apparently refused to let the cops in her apartment. \n\nWell now my in laws are mad at me. They’re claiming my SIL has changed dramatically since November, and I had no right to be making calls to the police about her when I know that such calls could result in her losing her infant and visitation with her second child. They are claiming I invented the whole Facebook post I saw. My husband saw it too, but they’re insisting I manipulated him to say what I wanted him to say. \n\nI’ll be honest: I knew full well that making that call could effect her chances with her kids. But I didn’t care, considering her past. This is not the first time she’s “changed” and then went back to what she was doing. November wasn’t even that long ago. \n\nI know what I saw. I called the police expecting them to find her high as a kite with a registered child molester in her apartment. \n\nAITA? Now there’s a chance she will lose custody of her third child since she had police contact, and apparently she never did the drugs she said she had. ",

      "description": "Am I the asshole for this?\n\nBackstory: My best friend, my sister and I decided to all move in together. Shortly after, my best friend and I began dating. (I can feel the judgement waves, cringe, I know). So it went pear shaped, we broke up. Amicable. Spent time apart. I moved on with my life as soon as possible so that I didn't drag my entire existence into living with my ex and being miserable. We had been in the new house 1 week at this point. \n\nNow, I (was) friends with his ex girlfriend. They were still friends. It was all calm. Then, he starts bringing her over and not telling anyone. I wouldn't normally care but we aren't allowed locks on our doors, he has since also left her in the house on her own. She's a snooper.\n\nMy sister starts an argument over text one night as he brings her into the house and tries to sneak her past me, while I'm standing in front of them both. This is probably the 4/5th time she's been here, and the 2nd time I've seen her walk through the door. This argument blows up. He calls me a drunk, says he does everything for us. \n\nSide note: I paid for all bills, shopping, sofas, TV, furniture, cleaned the whole house several times a week, because I was short on rent. I paid back in full. Also don't drink that often, I just had a fair amount of alcohol gifted all at once.\n\n It gets to me saying no one will stay at the house other than my sister's long term boyfriend (because she stays at his half the week, he's earned some live time in our place). He drops the bomb that his ex is now his fiance and she should be allowed to stay whenever she likes for however long she likes. I also knew it was her texting us (she excessively uses emojis, he doesn't).\n\nWe all agree that everyone will be made aware of visitors staying in the house beforehand. This brings more argument from the girlfriend, but we get agreement. \n\nEvery single weekend at 10:30pm I get a text saying she is coming over. Ok cool. He asks to have other friends over, I say yes, but I would like a weekend at some point without guests. He agrees. It's been 3 months. That weekend never came. \n\nMy sister has been staying at her boyfriends for 3 weeks (he had surgery). Finally, she comes home. Girlfriends car is outside the house. It's midnight, no text. He locked us out of the house, despite knowing we would both be home that night. They got engaged less than 2 months together after 3 years apart. She's a manipulative person, and in turn makes him a messy shit because they know it annoys me.\n\nWe had an inspection last Saturday, and they were going at it until 20 minutes before the landlord arrived. His week to clean, nothing done, I'm running around like a headless chicken cleaning because he hasn't done anything.\n\n\nI'm a uni student with a part time job. Weekend evenings are the one time I would like to be gross in my own home.\n\n\nIf you're still reading, I'm sorry. Am I the asshole for even asking him not to have her over?\n\nTLDR; ex bf gets engaged to his ex gf. Cause major arguements in the house. ",

      "description": "So 18 months ago my older brother passed away. It's been really tough on us and we've all had to find ways to cope, except my father. \n\nMy father deals with it by drinking. He drinks then he goes on these days long tantrums about how he's depressed and hates his life. He lost his job one time because of these episodes. \n\n Also, how he was the only one who loved my brother and that he was his \"baby\". I've heard him say many occasions say that he doesn't care about my other brother and I, only my other brother. This makes me  very angry because him and my brother would fight alot when we were younger. To the point of my father throwing him up against a door one time.\n\nYesterday, he came home drunk and in one of these moods. This carried over to today, were I had a doctors appointment because I might have ovarian issues. My mom was supposed to come along, because my dad can't be trusted to not get drunk when left alone, he tagged along. He ended making things alot worse and was not supportive of me.\n\nI feel like the asshole because I know he's grieving over the loss of his son, but he refuses to get help. He doesn't believe in therapy because therapists are \"quacks\" and that no one is going through what he went through. My mom found a group in our city with parents, like them, that get together and talk. He refuses to go.\n\nAm I the asshole for getting mad at him? At this point, I'm thinking about moving out but not financially stable enough.",

      "description": "Ok, obligatory I'm on mobile so excuse any errors bla bla...\nThis is gonna be a long one. My brother (23) has been dating this girl on and off for 3 years now. I will refer to my brother as Ryan and his girlfriend as Allie. I never liked Allie because when they first started dating she pushed Ryan away from all of his friends, made him quit his band, made him drop all his hobbies for her. I told Ryan that she was a toxic person and that I didn't like her after they had been together for about 5 months at the time. He proceeded to not talk to me for 9 months after that. \nFast forward to September of 2017. Ryan graduated basic training. He had been gone for a few months. He gets home and finds our that Allie cheated on him. She was the one that told him, I guess to keep him finding out from someone else. She first says the guy \"stuck it in\" then says that she was drunk. (She doesn't drink and has made this fact known to us multiple times) and then she says that the guy forced himself on her and nothing really happened. So who knows. My brother, being in his first real relationship, forgave her. Poor pussy whipped bastard. \nFast forward to now, January 2019. Ryan is deployed in Poland and has been gone for 7 months now. We still don't really talk since he forgave Allie and I pretty much hate her now. I rarely talk to her but my mom does and usually tells me some of the stuff Allie says. \nNow I need to derail for a second. My uncle, Seth, is a recruiter and is the one who recruited my brother. This is important. According to Allie, she tells my mom that one of the guys that works with my uncle Seth got her number somehow and is texting her weird stuff. Why she told my mom and doesn't go to my uncle Seth about it seems pretty weird. Then, according to my mom, my uncle Seth told my dad that he heard from some of the Army guys that Allie is cheating on Ryan with the same creepy guy that was sending her creepy messages. My uncle is not one to lie or make something up. My dad did not ask for more details and said that he didn't want to know anything else about her cheating. I believe my uncle fully and I believe she is cheating on my brother again. Of course there is no proof.\nThis is the same girl who also told my brother that the second he left for basic training his best friend at the time started hitting on her, and ending that friendship. She also said the same thing about one of Ryan's other friends when he left for deployment, ruining that friendship as well. It's like she has to have him all for himself and can't stand for him to have his own life and have friends. Of course, they have also broke up and gotten back together about 4 times over the past 3 years, and she also aborted his baby when she already has a toddler that her parents take care of, but that's besides the point.\nThis bitch is psycho crazy, has held my Ryan hostage in a room, accused HIM of cheated, and done many other crazy things that will make this long post even longer. You get the idea. Yet he is still with her and I don't know why! \nOk so now I think you know all the important details and maybe can see as to why I hate this bitch. I really want to tell my brother that she is cheating on him with the army guy, because he deserves to know. But I have no proof and the fact that he is still with this girl after everything she has done to him makes me think that telling him won't even make a difference. I feel like maybe he will learn in time but they also talk about getting married so probably not.  Sorry this is so long.\nTLDR: My brother's gf is cheating on him while he is deployed and I want to tell him but I don't have proof and don't want screw up our relationship as brother and sister more than it already is.",

      "description": "Tl;dr: wife had an emotionally draining friend she cut off after she admitted to being in love with my wife. AITA for not letting this ex friend talk to my wife?\n\nSome of you may remember a post I made a while ago asking if I was the asshole for threatening a restraining order on an ex friend of my wife who’d admitted to falling in love with my wife at the end of a very draining and needy friendship, my wife cut her off as a friend, and she continued to call and text for the (now) next 6 or 7 months and actually showed up at our house once. \n\nI admit I’m a bit of a softie and don’t have much time, as a 10 month old will take up a lot of your life, so we didn’t actually go through with the restraining order. Yet. \n\nNow she’s calling again. Every night or two, and when she calls it’s multiple times. I finally answered and she was just demanding to speak to my wife. Pleading almost. My wife was composing an email to this friend to try to explain why she had to cut off the friendship, and expected this ex friend to just move on rather than trying to get in touch for this long, but we hadn’t sent it yet. I refused to let her speak to my wife and told her that my wife would send her an email explaining why things had been cut off. \n\nSo we sent the email. My wife did, rather, I reviewed it for her because she asked me to, as I’m a bit more focused in my wording sometimes and she appreciates that. I hope this is the end of it. \n\nI feel like I was in the right. Defending my wife when she felt uncomfortable and trying to deal with this. She even commented that she thought I handled it well before she sent the email. But I still feel bad. So, AITA here?",

      "description": "I have this good friend, call her A, who can be a little annoying sometimes. She'll keep me up all night when she gets too drunk and then doesn't apologize for putting me through that, is late to a lot of things, doesn't understand sarcasm (which is big for me since I use it all the time lol), and doesn't get a lot of social ques. Overall though, we get along pretty well and I can overlook a lot of her aspects that annoy me. \n\nI'm currently in college and I have a lot of exams this week so I have been basically doing work all the time, only really to take breaks when I eat. I go to a pretty intense university so everyone understands when you have to bail on something to do work. Today, some of my friends were planning a low key dinner to a close restaurant. A overheard and asked if she could come, which we said yes to. We were originally going to go at 6, but A asked to move it to 5, which we agreed to. 5 o'clock rolls around and my friends and I are still grinding away on problems to prepare for our exam, we were making a lot of progress so we did not want to stop and get dinner at that moment, however, A texts us and asks us when we were getting to the restaurant. I say sorry and that we'll be there soon, but apparently A had to leave by 5:30 so she left before we even got there. She seemed pretty mad that we were going to be late and said that the only reason she went was to eat with us. I immensely apologized and told her we didn't show up on time was because we were doing work, but she still still seems really mad at me, like completely ignoring me mad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that  I should not have been late, but I am annoyed that I put up with a lot of annoying behavior with A, but she gets mad the minute I do something that's not great. So is A allowed to be this mad at me? AITA for being late?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I'd like to start off by saying I don't go to movie theaters or live theaters very often, because I have serious auditory processing problems. I'd usually rather wait and watch something at home with subtitles, because otherwise I can barely understand what is being said, ESPECIALLY if there's singing.\n\nMy boyfriend is amazing with me about this. If I whisper a question in his ear because I'm confused, he explains it quickly and quietly. He's wonderful and always tells me if I'm too loud.\n\nSkip to today. It's our 4 year anniversary tomorrow, and we're staying in an AirBnB out of town. I bought us tickets to see Miss Saigon, as he's a huge history nerd, and I love musicals. I picked cheap nosebleed seats, literally the top row of seating in the theater. It was less than $100 for us both to see it.\n\nAs soon as intermission started, a woman in the row ahead of us leaned and introduced herself, all smiling and friendly. She asked our names then passive aggressively told us we ruined the first half for her, she's never met someone so rude in her life, she paid good money for these seats and we need to read the book on manners. She told us she was moving seats because of us.\n\nWe were too shocked to say anything to her, but the people around us looked sympathetic towards us. One woman who was sitting even closer to me than the rude woman was said she only heard me once, when I was laughing.\n\nWe both spent the rest of the play uncomfortable. I said nothing to him and I had no idea what was going on for most of the second time. \n\nReddit, AITA? I just wanted to understand the play, and all the assisted listening devices were checked out by the time we arrived. I don't know what else I could've done if I wanted to have any grasp of the plotline.",

      "description": "So. Everyone in my family knows that I’m a night owl. I’ll wake up around 7am on weekdays to say bye to my husband before he leaves for work, and then usually go back to sleep until 12-1 (I’m disabled and so do not work). On weekends, my husband wakes me up with a quick breakfast so I can take my meds, and then I go back to sleep. This is known to all of my family.\n\nWell this morning when my husband woke me up saying my sister was here. I was super confused because she doesn’t drive and our parents had church so I knew they couldn’t have brought her, and the busses aren’t running and she’s too broke for an Uber or lyft. I checked my phone and had 7 messages from my younger sister. \n\n“Hey.. you awake?”\n\n“I’m bored as fuck and don’t want to work on homework.. wanna chill? Feels like forever since we’ve really hung out.”\n\n“Okay don’t hate me but I’m going ahead and walking over. I know it’s far but I feel antsy and the walk should help me mellow put before I’m there”.\n\n“So I’m at Safeway. I got a free coupon on the monopoly thing and won two free donuts. What kind do you want?”\n\n“Okay I grabbed a maple bar and a buttermilk bar, and I grabbed a crueler for [my husband]. Be there soon-ish!”\n\n“Damn people are driving crazy out here. Some guy almost ran me over while I was trying to cross the street! Oh btw my eta is about 35 minutes”.\n\n“I’m outside..”.\n\nShe came in my room, said surprise, and handed me the bag of donuts. “Pick one!” Barely awake, I just stared at her and was like “dude WTF did you walk all the way here? I would have went and picked you up”.\n\n“I tried messaging you but you never responded and I felt the urge to just get out and come over. Are you mad?”\n\n“..... not really, but I kind of didn’t want to hang out today.. wish you would have waited for me to see the messages so I could save you the trouble”.\n\n“..... oh. Um. Okay. Well I guess I’ll just head home then. Sorry I didn’t wait. I didn’t think you’d have a problem with it.”\n\nI felt like a complete and total asshole and said “dude come on I’m not letting you walk all that way here and not hang out. I just wish you would have waited so you didn’t walk all this way.”\n\nShe started shaking her head and put the bag of donuts on my bed. “No, it’s okay, I should have waited and I’m sorry. You can have the donuts, they’re too sweet for me anyways. I’ll just go ahead and go home, I don’t want you to feel obligated to hang out if you aren’t feeling up to it.”\n\nI said “come on [sister], I’ll hang out, even if just until mom and sad get out of church and they can come pick you up.”\n\n“Nah, I don’t feel comfortable hanging out when I know you don’t want to. It’s okay, really.”\n\nMe: “ugh okay well at least have [my husband] give you a ride back home. I’m not letting you walk all that way back.”\n\nHer: “dude no it’s okay, if I can walk here I can walk all the way back home.”\n\nI got mad and said “[sister] don’t be stupid. Just have him take you home. It’s freezing outside”.\n\nInstead she just left shaking her head and walked out. I asked my husband to go pick her up and drive her home, but he said no. I want to go pick her up myself, but I’m terrified of driving on ice/snow in my truck after a horrible accident I had awhile ago. I’ve been texting and calling trying to get her to come back over, but she’s not answering.\n\nThis has ruined my day and made me feel like a major asshole. Am I?\n\ntl;dr: sister showed up unannounced (since I hadn’t read my texts as I was asleep) with donuts after walking 6+ miles in the freezing cold, expecting to hang out. I told her I don’t feel like hanging out and wish she’d waited to actually ask me instead of walking all this way. She got upset and insisted on walking all the way back home despite my husband being able to give her a ride back. AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for skipping a really good friend's birthday because I would have felt uncomfortable if I went there?",
      "description": "(before you read I have to apologize if there are grammatical errors in my post. It's not my first language and feel free to correct me because I'm trying to become better.)\n\nSo the thing is that I became part of a quite large friend group. The most loud people in this group were born in February so one guy decided to organise a huge party for them all. One of my best friends (let's call her Rachel for now) from there had her birthday now as well. She is the cousin of the guy who organised this huge party (let's call him Ben for now) which might be important later.\n\nAt first I was excited to go because most of them are nice people. (Note that almost all of us are between 18 and 20 years old and here you are considered an adult at the age of 18). The organisations turned out to be pretty problematic and the first problem related to why I ended up not going was that a good friend of mine wasn't allowed to invite anyone even though she had her birthday just now as well. So I decided to organise a surprise party for her which happened last weekend.\n\nThe surprise party went rather well with about 15 people, the birthday girl was surprised and almost everyone came who was invited. Which included a guy I found interesting lately. Even though he comes out fine with the girl who had birthday, I invited him so we could talk. I'm pretty bad at emotional stuff, don't have much experience so I couldn't handle it well. And a few drinks later Rachel told him about all of my feelings towards him. Which resulted in him going home and telling that he is not ready for something like a relationship. I was devastated.\n\nI missed my last bus home (we live in the countryside so the public transport isn't always available and I don't have any relative in the town unlike most people there) so Rachel said I could sleep with her at her cousin's place. I said it would be great since I wouldn't have asked for it myself just would have started my 10 km long walk home (I wanted some time to think and I love walking in the night, especially since the crime rate here is pretty low).\n\nAbout six months ago Ben told he wants to be my boyfriend and we talked about it and I told him that I don't want him. We were still in the same friend group though. Ever since I heard him say he likes me from time to time but it stopped after he got a girlfriend so I was confident that nothing embarrassing would happen this time, especially since Rachel slept there as well.  I ended up helping Rachel walk there (she's a decent girl but one guy wanted to get her really drunk this time).\n\nAt first it was nothing extraordinary, we put Rachel to sleep and proceeded to make some tea (it was about 2 am at that time, only the two of us were up). Then he brought some strong leftover alcohol (I didn't drink all night, I felt responsible for the people at the party) saying he can see that I'm sad, let's talk about it. I told him about all the problems I had recently (messy relationship with family, ex boyfriend and this recent thing with that guy I found interesting) and got a bit drunk myself as well. You might guess where this is going by now. We went to watch a movie but I was really exhausted so I told him that I'll be sleeping. At first nothing happened but then he tried to straight forward fuck me. I am not someone really attractive, I never had sex and I didn't do anything charming to him so I had no clue what he wanted. I could barely stop him and I felt like a complete piece of trash. I had to remind him that he has a girlfriend. \n\nIn the morning I left with an early bus and he told his girlfriend what happened (nothing, I didn't let him do anything but he would have done anything if I let him). Not many people know about it since they could talk it out with his girlfriend and they have stayed together. But after this I felt like I shouldn't attend his bigger party yesterday even though I have talked to his girlfriend and told it all to her and she wasn't mad at me (it's her birthday as well though). Even though Rachel knew about this she still said she is disappointed that I'm not going and gave me tiny hurtful hints about me not going there. I bet that I'm going to hear about not going so much, not only from her. The party was really big (with more than 50 people) so I could have avoided them and could have still checked in for one hour but I felt like it was useless so I didn't.\n\n(I've had more than enough problems with this friend group lately. They can't seem to act like grown ups and I'm looking forward to next year's university where I can leave them all behind. Still I want to come out well with them because they are mostly kind people.)\n\nSo AITA for not going to her birthday party?\n",

I went back down stairs and saw them bumping uglies, rather than causing a scene I just went back upstairs to collect my thoughts. I ended up leaving to just get away from them and didn’t see Sarah again until work, she said that she didn’t realize that I had a kid and was sorry for leading me on.

      "description": "This is a long, sorry!*\n\n* am Canadian\n\nAround this time last year, a coworker ('X') left the team and I was tasked with learning their job and training a replacement who joined us 2 months later. Oh and I'm still maintaining my regular fulltime job, except now I'm not taking breaks, eating lunch at my desk and logging about 20 hours of OT each week. \n\nTwo weeks later I land an interview for an internal posting that I had applied to before 'X'left our team. I email my manager to let them know about the interview and she calls me right away in a panic, demanding to know why I'm applying for another job. I offer reasons why the job would offer better growth, better pay, etc. My manager passive/aggressively ends the call and we don't talk for a few days. \n\nLater that week, it's my yearly performance review and my manager says that she can see me trending toward a promotion in the next 6 months. \"Keep it up, great work etc.\" I walk away from the review thinking that perhaps now my career prospect is looking better if I stay put. So I do. Fast forward to today. It's been 1 year and another two full review periods (semi annual bs). \n\n'Ok, a promotion didn't happen after my first review so it must be coming this time!' I think to myself.\n\nNope. My manager tells me that she still wants to 'wait and see' for the next 6 months even though she 'loves everything I am doing' and to (again) 'keep it up!'.\n\nSo that's now 3 reviews where my manager has dangled a promotion. It feels like I am always going to be strung along by this illusory bullshit if I don't get the fuck out.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to quit for the next good job that comes along?",

      "description": "We have been dating ~2 years.  In the beginning i had my own place and we never hung out at his place.  he spent 5/6 nights a week at mine and still paid them rent even though he was never home (I was even doing his laundry) .\n\nDue to circumstances, i moved an hour away to live with my stepmom and drove down on my days off to see him usually 2 or 3 days at a time about a week apart depending on my work schedule. this was never an issue to them at the time.\n\nAfter a year up there, i came back to town, i also had to buy a new car and i still have allot of bills to pay for so im staying with my grandma who lives 40 minutes from him until i can get on my feet and get a place with him.\n\nSince he works till 6pm and i work at 6 am its hard for us to see each other after work and then go home. And the traffic going from my house to his work is WAY worse than if I leave from his. usually its me going over to his place and leaving for work at 530 am. \n\nWhen i am there we often are out of the house til 9pm. We shower together and make it quick to be mindful of the water bill. we can both get in and out in under 10 mins. Im never at the house when hes gone.  im a \"leave it better than you found it\" kinda person, and to be honest.. they are slobs.. I clean the whole kitchen when i cook. They have even made jokes about how \"its nice when you make him food because the kitchen becomes spotless.\"\n\nIf im going to the store for something i always ask them if they need anything,last week the list they gave me was Like $12 and when they tried to pay me i said dont worry about it. When my bf food shops with them he pays half the bill even though his is 1/3 of them. So even if i did use any of it, milk, eggs etc, my bf paid for half of it anyways and I never use the last of anything. Also the couple who he is RMs with, she has a great job but her boyfriend hasn't worked in 3 years. he finished school and just stopped doing anything but smoking weed and playing games all day.\n\nmy bf pays them 400 a month for a room that already has a closet and dresser full of stuff that they still haven't gotten around to clearing out even though hes been there for 2 years. So i find it ironic that the girl is saying that we are taking advantage of them, when obviously her bf is taking advantage of her. my bf is trying to get his debt paid off before moving out because his work has a slow season and he cant afford rent and his loans when its that time. I am polite to them, we hangout together,  Theres never been any sign that theres a problem between me and her. I cant imagine her being jealous of me. \n\nI just don't understand. Me and my bf have started showering at the gym too instead of at his place since that's their main reason as to \"how im costing them $\" with my 5 minute showers.\n\nLSS: AITA for spending 3 nights a week where my bf lives even though he pays them rent money and im respectful when im there, and im not eating their food or racking up their bills.",

      "description": "AITA- I've known this kid (let's call him Aidan) for a couple months and we've talked on occasion. More recently we've gotten close enough to discuss his past relationships and how he's been taken advantage of in multiple ways (nothing physical) and has been just falling in with worse and worse people. This dude needs to be in a relationship to feel loved and he falls for people easy. That combined with his lack of standards makes him an easy target for people who just want to be awful to him.\n\nToday he informed me that his latest girlfriend has cheated on him and is now sending all their mutual friends after him because he \"hadn't been spending enough time with her\" and things of that nature. He wants out of the relationship and I'm currently helping him work up the nerve to leave her.\n\nI find him attractive and I like talking to him and getting to know him better but I don't necessarily have a crush on him. I know he's crushing on me and since I'm not currently in a relationship I could totally ask him out and save him from future shitty relationships. I do have a bit of a thing for another guy but I'm not looking for anything super serious now so I'm not actively pining after him. This dude and I are barely even friends so it wouldn't impede another relationship at all.\n\nWhen I brought this idea up to my friends they said it was an awful thing to do and that I shouldn't date a guy just to save him from getting hurt but I've honestly thought about dating him before this. Am I the asshole for wanting to date a guy to save him from getting hurt in the future?",

      "description": "My best friend is a guy, 18 years old, and I'm a girl, 17 years old. We worked together and basically were inseparable. Last spring, I started to develop a bit of a crush on him, and it honestly felt mutual. Summer came, and I was traveling tons and not working much. He completely stopped talking to me, there wasn't even an argument or anything, he just completely stopped replying to my texts and I couldn't get ahold of him. During this time, I met a different guy and we instantly clicked and started dating, still are. After the summer ended and I was working more again, my best friend and I were forced to spend time together again and everything was good, he had a thing with this girl and we were even closer than before.\n\nCouple months ago, things with him and this other girl ended but him and I were still close and our friendship was going great. He got drunk one night though, and told me he really likes me and ditching me in the summer for her is one of the biggest mistakes he's ever made. \n\nWe stayed friends anyway, but I didn't really take into consideration that he actually liked me, so I would put my head on his shoulder and snuggle anyway because he's my best friend, it's what we did.\n\nThe other day he told me he doesn't think we can still be friends, or at least as close as friends because it hurt him too much to be close like that knowing it's all platonic. I told him he needs to do what's best for his mental health, but I'm really missing my best friend. \n\nAITA for secretly wishing he would've just kept putting it up with it so we'd still be friends?",

      "description": "  \n\n Before I start this I need to say that I love my mother with all my heart and appreciate everything she has ever done for me and apologize ahead of time for all the text, theres a lot of things that needs to be accompanied by context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this kid of started my senior year of high school. I moved to a North Carolina with my mom because, I was living with my dad at the time and I knew my mom would need more help with my little brother because she was starting a new job. Everything was fine and my senior year went by normally, I ended up talking to a Army recruiter and signing the doted line to be in the Army reserves (shipping out that summer). I also got accepted into UNCC.  My mother then told me she was moving back to our home state of Florida because she didn’t like her job, keep in mind I was supportive but also felt kind of betrayed because everything I did was on the preconception that my mom was staying in that state. She left with my little brother 3 months before my graduation and left me in North Carolina by myself with no other family around. I graduated, went to basic training and AIT (advanced individual training), graduated and started to attend UNCC. I was all alone in NC and it took me about a year to realize I wanted to move back to Florida because I was depressed. I finally got my chance when I went down to Florida for the holidays where my Dad’s fiancée’s brother told me about his electrical apprentice program where they essentially teach you to be an electrician and pay you while doing it. I talked to him and he told me he would give me a call when I moved back down there. So I asked my Dad’s fiancée if I could stay with her for a few days until I could secure the apprenticeship and get my own place. She said yes. \n\nSo, I told my mom the plan and she was all for it and everything seemed to be looking up. I went back to North Carolina, got a moving truck and made all the preparations to move (payed my last month of rent, put in my 2-week notice, etc.). The day before the move I talked to my Dad’s fiancée to make sure she knew what time id get there but she said she couldn’t house me anymore and gave me no reason why. Also, her brother wasn’t returning my calls.  I was shocked, I told my mom and asked if she could help me out for a few days where she generously agreed.\n\nI moved into my mom’s house where she and her fiancée said that they were not going to ask anything of me except that I need to clean the house whenever I saw that it needed cleaning and that I need to be actively looking for a job while they are working during the day. I agreed of course, and everything was great for about a week.\n\nI was upstairs in the spare room, where my things were being stored, which included my computer, applying for jobs when my mom came home and yelled at me for not “beating the pavement” and not truly looking for a job. I told her that I was actively looking and applying for jobs online where the majority of companies posted their job openings. She got mad at this and told me that they would have a talk with me when they got home.\n\nWhen my mom and her fiancée got home they sat me down and started talking to me. They told me that I needed to be out all day looking for a job and that they didn’t want me there during the day because they are trying to move into a better house, so they need to save money. I tried telling them how I saw it and that I will go to the library and use their computers instead to save them from a high electricity bill, but whenever I started to speak I couldn’t get in a sentence without being interrupted by my mom’s fiancée. He ended up telling me that my opinion didn’t matter and that he didn’t want to hear what I had to say. I told him not to talk to me like a child and afford me the same respect as I show him. My mom tried to defuse the situation, but her fiancée shushed her.\n\nAt this point I was furious, my mom is easily influenced by her partners: when she was with my dad they were really irresponsible and that’s how I was born, when she was with my brother’s dad they were abusive, physically, mentally and emotionally and now that she’s with this guy her life has gotten better but she seemingly has completely lost any will to stand up for herself much less her children. \n\nAt that moment I looked her fiancée in his eye and told him not to shush my mother, this got him heated. He stood up and I stood up to meet him, I wouldn’t let any man come into my mother’s life and push her around like that. He told me to get out and I was happy to oblige. I was going to ask my mom if she agreed but she wouldn’t look at me and didn’t say anything when I got my things and left.\n\nI slept in my car for about a week and dipped into debt to get the place I live now. Just a week ago I went back to my mom’s house with my landlord to get my mattress and the rest of my things. When I got there, I found that my mom brought out my memories box. The memories box basically holds items in it that tracks my growth up until my graduation. It supposed to be for my mother to keep so she can look back at my sibling’s and my childhoods when we move out. So with my mom consciously making me take it, she was erasing me from her life and showed me she me she was disowning me. I also found my high school graduation pictures in the other boxes she gave me as well so I don’t even think I have any pictures in her house anymore. I grabbed the rest of my things and closed the door without saying anything. I haven’t talked to her since.\n\nAm I the asshole? I can answer any questions in the comments. ",

      "description": "I don't even know where to begin but I guess I'll try to make it short and sweet, or not. Back in June, I decided to do music full time even tho prior too this has always been a passion of mine, something that makes me extremely happy and fulfilled since I was about 4 years old I knew I wanted to be a singer! Growing up I was a pretty good,quiet kid, as opposed to my sister (she had actually gotten pregnant at 14) and skyrocketed into a life of being a stripper and full time prostitution. My mother started to become verbally abusive to me when I was about 17, this was around the time I had my first real boyfriend and for some reason she thought this was rebelling against her image of me and it only got worse from there, we barely talked, barely hugged or said I love you to each other, \n\nI became very fearful of my mother and her mood swings, she started demanding that I pay some rent and I did my best to oblige as I was working part time and barely made much, once I didn't pay her and she told my sister ( my sister is a very unhappy violent individual at times), to which my sister came into my room while I was asleep , woke me up and proceeded to interrogate me , I had explained that I was confused about the whole situation and then she just started punching me in the face, my mother stood there and did nothing for about 3 min and then broke it up, I was heart broken .\n\nMy mother has called me a bitch in heated arguments that she had started over petty matters such as a dish in the sink or an uncleaned bathroom. When I was 19 ,I was raped and decided to take it to trial,she offered no comfort in the situation and was more so mad that the first person I called when it happened was my best friend. I had a cat at the time that my friend had given me a while before all this and my mother said I could keep it at the time, then all had changed after the assault. When I was going through this tough time, she kept telling me I had to get rid of the cat which I had loved dearly and didn't understand why she had chosen such a time to do this to me. I had told her I would try my best to find somewhere for him to go because I was busy with court meetings.\n\nOne morning, I had left to go to one and she called me blowing up my phone yelling at me about how if I didn't get rid of him she was going to do it herself, low and behold she did and texted me in the middle of my meeting \"the cat is gone\" I started crying right in the middle of it and couldn't even explain to my lawyer at the time what was going on because it was all so sporadic and evil .\n\nEven then, I still let it go, and tried to make amends with my mother to which she always blamed me for the assault and shouted demeaning things to me I still tried to give her the benefit of the doubt unlike my sister who eventually cut off all ties from my mother claiming she hated her. \n\nNow I'm starting to see why. My mother hates that I do music full time but never once have I heard her criticize my sister for her choice of job, she calls me lazy and offers no support or even wants to listen to my music or asks me about my shows and how they are going, anytime I bring up a show it's always \"are they gonna pay you\" to which I explain that the money is not important to me at all. She tells all my family members that I am disrespectful , rude, and unwilling to work but she leaves out the fact that I have been working tirelessly hard towards this since I was 15 \n\nAm I the asshole for never speaking to her again?  I have tried to understand her but now thinking deeply, I woke up this morning with a deep anger at how much her abuse has caused me to be insecure and cautious of being myself, my father walked out of my life when I was 11 and this further wounded me. At this point I want nothing to do with the aspect of parents. I'm ready to never speak to her again. I have voiced my hurts about the situations to which she responds that everything was my fault. I'm hurt, I'm tired and I don't know what else to do ",

      "description": "Even before I was officially engaged, I made it explicitly clear I and my fiance didn't want a traditional wedding.  My family says that's fine, have a non-traditional wedding.  Well, cut to now when we're about to get married, and my family is constantly hounding me for doing traditional aspects of a wedding.  For starters, I don't want to wear a veil.  I don't really like them to begin with, they're not my style, and they're also a bit sexist.  Another thing I don't want to do is have my dad walk me down the aisle.  \n\nNow I love my dad.  He's a great guy.  I just don't like the idea of having a man walk me to another man and give me away.  I think it's pretty sexist.  I would like to meet my husband at the end of the aisle as a human being, and not as a daughter or female, if that makes sense.  When I told my dad this, he said that was okay and that it was my wedding, so I could do it the way I wanted to. \n\nWhen I wrote the wording for the invitations, I showed my parents to make sure it looked good, and my mom got mad because I didn't say that they were hosting the wedding.  They're not.  They've given us money, but made it clear it could be for whatever we wanted.  It's also a bit outdated to say your parents are hosting your wedding, in my opinion, especially if the wedding isn't formal.  I had the invitations made with just my name and my fiance's name anyways.  \n\nWell, a week or so ago, the invitations came in, and since my mom was handling the RSVPs and invitations, I only put her name on the return address.  Apparently this was a big issue because it meant that my mom was single and that my dad wasn't a part of the wedding process.  My mom demanded that I get the envelopes remade with my dad's name on it as well, and my dad said that I was shitting my parents by not including their names on the envelopes.  \n\nWhen I talked to my sister about this, she told me that I was in the wrong about the names, the invitations, and not being walked down an aisle.  She even told me that she would let the veil issue go if I let my dad walk me down the aisle.  Umm...what?  \n\nAnd it's not like I haven't made compromises with my parents.  I had my fiance ask for my dad's permission--which, again, I was against because I'm not property.  I also ordered corsages for my mom and fiance's mom to wear at the wedding so they can feel honored despite the fact that there's no wedding party.  \n\nSo am I in the wrong on any of this?  I don't feel like I am, but would like some opinions outside of my conservative family.",

Basicaly, he is just a pot smoker witheout job since 2 years, too lazy to make the adequate paper for having funds, not paying his electricity bills or his rent, etc. But I don't mind and like him besides that (but damn, sometime I really wanted to slap him in the face, hoping it will wake him up), and he's helping me to do grocery, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasicaly, we ;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* gave him a bit of money\n\n\\* pay several time for food and drink because he have nothing\n\n\\* let him sleep here\n\n\\* using my car several time besides the fact he don't have a driver license\n\n\\* pay him fuel\n\n\\* stocking his furniture\n\n\\*been here for him everytime he was coming without warning us, even at 5AM or when we're working (remote jobs) and listen to him for hours\n\n\\* giving him weed\n\n\\* etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome weeks ago, police started to investigate about the small cannabis traffic in the town, so he completely freaked out, stopped smoking, and his paranoïa/complotism is worser than ever(pharma lobby, nuclear bomb...).\n\nHe come here for a full day everytime now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYersteday, he send me a long sms asking to stay here in exchange of chores, etc. I took the night to think for an answer, since it was obvisouly no and that I hate conflict, and still wanted to help him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've arleady hosted friends and it give me really bad memories.

He answered \"same for you, dude\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a very solitary person, since I'm a lot autistic and don't understand the how to.

AITA for telling her the joke?\n\nSo to put everything in perspective, she is very shy, and I'm also shy. We have known each other for several months. She likes biology and topics related to animals, and her family also has a lot of cats as pets (key element to the story).\n\nSo this morning she gave me this book about animal behavior so I could read the first chapter and tell her If I liked it or not, but the day passed and I didn't tell her.

She studies full-time and works two-part time jobs, and I work full-time. Recently she’s become so lazy. Her room is an absolute mess, she only sweeps/vacuums when I tell her to, and when she leaves the house she doesn’t empty out the rubbish like she’s supposed to. I work a full-time job, so it’s hard for me to do absolutely everything. I sweep and do dishes when I can, but I really need her to pull her weight. A few weeks ago my sister had a mental breakdown and literally wouldn’t stop crying for three days. She wouldn’t talk to anyone in the family. I tried confronting her about it but she wouldn’t tell me anything so I told her to go to a doctor. She has to take control of her own health. Well, I don’t believe she ever visited the doctor. She stopped crying but she’s still annoyingly lazy. Last night I had about 10 work friends over for pizza and drinks. This morning she had to leave at around 7am. In the morning I told her to clean all the rubbish and empty the kitchen bins before she left the house. When I woke up today I noticed that she put the wrong type of garbage bag in the bin. She clearly couldn’t be bothered to find the right ones. So when I came home tonight I confronted her about her behaviour and told her she was become lazier by the day, and that she needed to get a grip. And then she started crying again! For no good reason. She needs to understand how to take constructive criticism in my opinion. However, when I was telling my boyfriend all of this, he told me that I was being way too harsh considering everything that went down. But in my defence I believe that her mental health and laziness are two separate things, and that she needs to pull her weight. I told her that she shouldn’t work or study if she isn’t capable of doing simple household chores. AITA?",

However, it’s uncomfortable, it takes so much longer than just feeding the baby (about 30 minutes a session), and my boobs are always sore afterwards.  I hate to do it.  My husband asked her if it was ok to bring the baby, since he is a breastfeeding infant, but she said no.  This isn’t an issue - it’s her wedding and if she doesn’t want a baby there that’s her prerogative.\n\nMy question is this: would it be an asshole move for me to stay through the ceremony, the pictures, and dinner, and then excuse myself and go home so I don’t have to pump?  My husband is staying to be his dad’s DD either way, so if I left right after dinner he would still be staying.  ",

      "description": "I know this question has been asked before and I know the typical responses, but try to hear my point of view. My(M31) wife(F33) and I have been married for 11 years, together for 14. We have always had our differences, I am very driven, up early and ready to go/ she sleeps until noon. I move quickly to get things done/ she takes a full day to accomplish anything. Shes very religious/ I am not. Shes overprotective of our son and I feel like she and he both need to distance themselves and let him grow into his own personality. She can barely keep the laundry done and I can finish all of her house work in 3 hours. I work 65 hours a week and she hasn't worked since we met. This is not to paint a picture of how \"awful\" my wife is, it's not that shes a bad person, shes just very VERY different than I am. Her sister(F27) on the other hand, went to college, got a career, up early, healthy eater, still very religious, proactive, excercises, keeps clean, very organized and social. We share similar tastes in movies, music, nostalgia food etc. My wife and I had always been at odds about our differences and just assumed that that's what made us who we are and the sex was great so it kept everything held together, but eventually the sex wained. At first it was only once a week, then once every two weeks, then once a month. Now we go months without sex and shes gone from 139lbs to very close to 250. Shes destroyed her body, doesn't want to touch me and is always scowling at me but swears she loves me. I started having feelings for her sister about 6-7 years ago and I can keep it at bay if I stay away from her but recently shes been going through some hardships and I have been there to help her and its welling up inside me to the point to where I just want to tell her that I have feelings for her (I know she doesn't feel the same, and she would never hurt her sister but the feelings are still there dammit). I know that everyone is going to say it's just a crush and that she would never betray her sister and I'm a POS for catching feelings and I am aware of how messed up it is, but I still feel it.",

      "description": "Haven't posted here before, but hey, here goes. It's a simple issue, but with a whole lot of background, and probably not all that interesting. Please ask if something is unclear, as I am emotional while writing this and probably glossed over some things. \n\nBackground:\nMy older sister and I have always had a relationship where she tells me to do something, and I do it, cause she's older and I have been a weak person. If I didn't want to do things for her, she'd be mean and nasty, making me feel horrible(telling me I was being disappointing and so annoying etc). Until recently I have been depressed(I got proffesional help and a BF, helping me a lot), and any interraction with her would usually bump me down a couple notches, making me worse, knowing I could never be a good sister to her. \nThough she has gotten better lately, after she got a guy, a kid, and a house, she doesn't ask me to do things as often, but if I am not following her plans to the t, she insults me, mostly on Messenger, either in the family-group or one-on-one. Today is one-on-one talk.\nI said yes to watching her cats a month or two ago, since her fam is leaving for a vacation, and her house is on my way to work. I thought \"Sure, I can go to Uni in the morning, hurry over to work afterwards, and drop by after I've been at work, not too big of a task. Done it before, after all. \" \nWrong.\nWhen I told her my plan of attack on this thing, she got mad. \"Her cats needs to be fed twice a day, morning and evening. Once a day would NEVER have been enough, she has told me this a million times before, I should be routinated by now, she shouldn't have to tell me this every time.\"\nI understand that cats need food, but I have not gotten this explained to me. If I have, it must have been years ago, when I lived near her, and I could just drop by, and didn't have to make a 30-60 minutes detour cause the busses in her area is pretty scarce. She has offered me to sleep at her place so i can feed them, but I never connected this to be because they needed to be fed twice a day. I might just be dumb here, I don't know, she offered me to stay at their place before, so I could have a break from my parents when I lived there 5 years ago, I thought it was just hospitality carrying on. \nWhen I tell her I can't drop by twice a day to feed her cats, since I have Uni and work, she becomes really mad. \"They're leaving in three days, it's such a bother, and I have been told this so many times. She is incredibly disappointed, and she can't believe I only fed her cats once when I have been caring for them before. If she knew I would do this, she would have never asked me, since I would be useless.\" \n\nAnd, to be fair, THIS she has told me that once before. I got asked to feed them before, about two years ago, and did such a bad job on not getting the key from my mom, which i had no idea she had(!!)\" traveled for 45 minutes by car to feed the cats, see that the door was locked and the key was not in the usual place, went and bought cat-food and left it outside the house. I then sent a message to my sister and let her know before I went out with my roommate and newly gotten BF to a restaurant to celebrate something I can't remember, because of the following event. Five minutes after sitting down, I get called by my sister, where she yells at me for \"being a useless cat-feeder and that she was putting so much trust in me by letting me feed her cats. There was no way she would ever let me feed them again, as I was so bad at it.\" I cried in the restaurant, in front of my Roommate and BF because of her cussing me out. I had to travel another 45 minutes to get the keys, then the 45 minutes back to feed her cats, and then apologize to her for being such a bad cat-sitter. \n\nTldr; Older sister wants me to sleep at her place so I can feed her cats twice a day, and surprisingly I have a life that doesn't make it possible. This is the second time she calls me a useless cat-sitter, and I'm basically an asshole for making her find someone else to watch her cats.",

      "description": "So I’m a student at a pretty big university. I have a couple of hours in between my first two classes of the day, so I usually try and snag this small sound proof study room to get some work done in between classes. So this particular day its empty, so I rush in and shut the door and unpack my stuff. This study room is big enough for maybe 5 people. It’s a circle and it’s around 10 x 10 ft, maybe smaller. I start doing some work for class (this particular assignment I was drawing sketches) when another student that I didn’t know opened the door and sat down and said “you don’t mind, do you?” I was so shocked that someone would come in to such a small space with someone they don’t know that I just looked at them and didn’t say anything. She pulls out some fast food from her bag and starts eating loudly, to where I can hear her spit sloshing around. That sound grosses me out so I’m getting pretty angry when her phone starts vibrating, and to my surprise she actually picks up  and answers the phone call. She talks to the person on the phone for about 30 seconds and then hangs up. Then, she starts playing music through her headphones and typing away on her laptop. This whole time I’m just trying to do my sketches, but I’m getting more and more fed up with her behavior. I can hear her music despite the fact that she is wearing headphones, and her typing on her keyboard is echoing throughout the study room. I decided Ive had enough but I couldn’t ask her to leave because I technically hadn’t said no when she walked in, so I opened my laptop and started playing a random YouTube video pretty loud and pretended like I was playing attention to it. I felt her immediately look up at me but I pretended I didn’t notice until about 20 seconds pass and she says “do you have headphones or anything that you can put in?” I said no (i actually did) to which she replied “well can you turn it down a bit? It’s really distracting.” I again said no and added “I shouldn’t have to turn my stuff down when you’re the one who came in here with me. I was here first and can do what I want.” She rolled her eyes and put her headphones back in so I turned the video up as loud as it could go. About a minute passes and she again asks me to please stop to which I reply no. Then she packs up and leaves and cusses me out on the way. Am I the asshole for technically allowing her to come in but then changing my mind and being annoying so that she’d leave? ",

I don’t like it either, I want to be able to eat everything and I have been broadening my horizons, but its difficult in a public environment while I have food in the first place.\n\n\nI am not one of those people that eats only chicken tenders with fries, but it is my go-to if nothing appeals to me. But this happens every single time I am at a restaurant, even when I am trying something new and I like it.\n\n\nWhile I am eating, my mom will push something in my face and tell me to try it. Sometimes I will try it, even though I know it’ll make me gag. Other times I am eating my food and am just not interested in what my mom wants me to eat. I usually give a polite no, but she never really takes no for an answer.\n\n\nIt will often devolve into an argument, with me firmly saying that I’m not very interested, and her repeatedly telling me that I just have to try it. She will frequently say that I am impossible to deal with, and this is all my fault. She gets very upset when I just don’t really want to eat something when I already have something in front of me to eat. Sometimes she will tell me that I don’t love her, and that she’s an awful mother when I won’t try something. I tell her that her doing this bothers me, and I have explained that I don’t want to start violently gagging in public, and that I just want to eat the food in front of me. But usually she’ll do it again and the cycle continues. She sometimes will make me try a food I already tried and don’t like.\n\n\nI just want to eat in peace and not have every outing devolve into a massive argument.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I was married for 4 years and had a child. Biodad (BD) raised daughter for 2.5 years and did not work, despite my pleading for him to get a job and put her in daycare. He refused on the grounds he didnt want strangers raising her or risk her being abused. BD has 4 other children with 2 different women, prior to our relationship. He saw them on 2 occasions in the 4 years we were together. Daughter met them on one of these occasions when she was 2. \nBD was controlling, meaning I could not go out with friends without him, I had no privacy (my phone and journal were monitored), he encouraged me to have little contact with family (who hated him) and when we argued, my things were broken. I eventually came to my senses and kicked him out, to which he fled to his home state immediately. He had a new gf within 2 weeks, so I filed for divorce. I was awarded full custody and child support, he received supervised visitation. He has not attempted to see his daughter since the day he left, although has made approximately 10 sporadic Skype phone calls across 4 years and sent 1 gift. He has also made all child support payments, with the exception of 4 (likely while he was between jobs).\nBD and I do not speak regularly, nor have I spoken to his other children in 4 years. I do not keep pictures of him around, nor do I speak of him, except when daughter asks. She typically asks what his name was and then forgets. She is getting smarter, last week she asked if he doesnt live here anymore because we didnt get along. She has no knowledge of siblings and does not recall meeting 3 of the 4 siblings when she was 2. Siblings are various ages, 8, 11, 15, and 16 and all live in different, very distant states. I worry about how and when to tell her about siblings. I believe I am NTA for not encouraging her to have a relationship with BD, as he appears to be a deadbeat and makes little attempt to reach out. I believe it would be harmful to encourage this, given his inconsistency. I believe its very likely he has even more kids with a 4th women, given that past behavior is a predictor of future behavior. \n\nSo, AITA for not encouraging her to have a relationship with 4 half siblings?",

This was a big deal for a 15/16 year old hermit, who had never gone to a party before (pathetic I know...) It was ideal for our big group of friends, as there were about 15 of us going. Then a few weeks before the prom, I was doing a drama lesson, which ran into lunch time. After this, I got lots of people in my friendship group coming up to me asking if I was okay. Then R (close friend) mentioned T SLAGING me off to practical strangers. I asked R why she would do that, and apparently I had invited a girl I didn’t like much to the after party. I did no such thing. I got angry but couldn’t find T anywhere. Later on my friends said that she uninvited me because the party was being held at HER boyfriends house. (This bitch...)\nWhen I got home, I saw a text on my phone from T. This is the actual massage she sent. \n“Hey I’m really sorry about the miss understanding I didn’t mean any harm I thought you’d been inviting people which I guess would be ok if we didn’t have a limit of people but I was in a bad mood so sorry if I upset you !”\n1. We didn’t have a limit that I knew of\n2. She wasn’t in a bad mood when I saw her\n3. I never got an in person sorry\nI was nice, bit my tongue and said it’s okay, but for her to talk to me. It’s never been the same. We still talk, but now she is just annoying and horrible in my eyes. I see all the negatives about her and feel like a terrible person for hating her. So AITA for hating someone for a small thing they did a year ago? ",

I am generally an anxious and private person, I only like showing off pieces when they are finished.

I don’t draw pornography or anything, I just personally don’t like people watching me draw.\n\nBut when I ask people to not look over my shoulder while I’m drawing, they usually look confused and hurt. Sometimes I can sound very firm when I ask them to stop looking over my shoulder.\n\nI’m not one of those people that assumes that people are watching me when they aren’t actually, I usually don’t notice unless someone explicitly asks me what im drawing or leans over my shoulder.\n\nAm I the asshole when I ask people to not watch me draw?

She is an education major and her professors are insane. Today one of them quoted an article of some sort in which she dropped the N word with a hard r. Not once but multiple times and made everyone uncomfortable. The other professor constantly brings up political issues and will debate them amongst other students instead of teaching. Along with this she will discuss grades of other students and students present in class aloud in the open. She also has harassed and been publicly degrading towards other students. \n\nWhen I first heard about this and as more info I got, I got pretty enraged because this is just ridiculous. Over dinner my girlfriend told me more stories and I just had it. I told her as soon as I could I would be telling the College President. We are a small college and I can openly walk into her office anytime. My girlfriend because visibly upset and pleading me not to because it was her career on the line. I explained that she would never be mentioned nor could anyone ever know it was her who told other people. I even said if they did they’d be even more in trouble.  Instead she of quite upset at me for wanting to rat her out. \n\nSo am I the asshole here for wanting action to be taken? The department chair of education here sees nothing wrong as well.\n\nTl;dr: Girlfriends professors drop n word with hard r and other brings up political debates and harasses other students.

I've been experiencing it since I was a little kid. I'm not a dog and I don't want to be pet. Regardless, no one likes being touched without their permission. Especially when they get all in your face. It ruins your hair and it's gross. I've been experiencing it since I was a little kid. I'm 19 now. It's an invasion of space and privacy. Honestly, it's more than just about hair and space for a lot of us. But I won't get into that.\n\nMy boyfriend's work had a cute little winter party thing that you could invite guests too. One of the people I met was a coworker of his who was definitely a little weird (with how she dressed and acted). Not that there's any wrong with being different. She's her own person, and I respect that. \n\nShe told me she loved my hair and reached out to touch it. I just backed away and told her not to do it. She apologized and I smiled at her and told her it's all good. \n\nSo at this party there's snacks and everything. She keeps on trying to sneak up to touch my hair. And each time I dodge her and tell her to chill out. I told her that I was being serious and not to touch me. Then she said \"It's so fluffy, I'm gonna die\" and STUCK HER CHEETO DUST, BLACK FINGERNAILS IN MY FUCKING HAIR. \n\nSo I said \"Bitch you just might, if you don't get your dirty ass hands off me\". She looked like she was going to cry and just walked away. She left the party. I didn't feel bad about it, I told her multiple times. My bf thought it was funny and we moved on. \n\nFast forward to the next time he's at work. And everyone is talking about his crazy girlfriend who threatened to kill one of the coworkers. His manager called him in and asked him not to invite me to anymore events. The girl is apparently very \"sweet and harmless\" and didn't know any better because she's just \"off\".\n\nIf she does have a developmental disability (btw \"off\" is a terrible way to describe it) I WOULD FEEL HORRIBLE. But as for as boyfriend is concerned, she's just strange. But these things aren't disclosed to other employees\n\nHe still stands by me, but his coworkers are talking about how I'm crazy and \"tried to kill her\" and the situation still. Making work annoying for him. I doo feel bad that I made work annoying for him and I think I should have controlled myself more for her sake. But he stands by me, because I did tell her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

One of her important meds was running out, and my wife did research and found a place to order it online. We used my name and email, but her phone number, at her insistence.\n\nMeds ran out, and she got a bit mad at me for not keeping on top of the order. Made a big deal about how clearly she'll need to be in charge of this. On the website, it just said it was stuck on the \"prescription filled\" phase for 2 days.\n\nYesterday, she called me, upset, having finally gotten a hold of them on the phone. She says that they claim they tried to call her about an issue with the order, she says she never got any calls. I call them, angry and certain that they're screwing us around.\n\nLady at the company insists that she's called several times, and mentions that the name on the voicemail wasn't mine (wife didn't take my name, also she rarely answers the phone). I figure that she's unlikely to know that if she didn't call, apologize, and resolve the order. They just needed $4 to ship it refrigerated.\n\nHead home. Wife left her phone on the counter, and I know that she's lied to my face before, so I check her voicemail. It's an iPhone, takes 2 seconds to see multiple voicemails from the company there.\n\nI ask if she's sure they never called her. She says \"definitely.\" I ask if I can take a look, and she gets defensive. I tell her I saw the voicemails myself, and she flips through her phone and begrudgingly admits that there are voicemails.\n\nI apologized for checking her phone. She won't apologize for telling me to call the company and raise a stink (when they did nothing wrong) and now insists that she just didn't see the voicemails. It takes 2 seconds to do this, and she had been worried and stressing about this med.\n\nI feel like she didn't check her voicemail all week, got sheepish when she called them and they told her they'd been trying to reach her, and blamed the company so she wouldn't look bad. I just wish she'd stop insulting my intelligence and admit it.\n\nReasons why I'm IATA: checking her phone, putting her on the spot catching her in a lie, not just letting it go.\n\nReasons why SITA: lying to me, putting me in a bad position, not acknowledging the above. If someone claims that my wife is lying, I'd rather be able to get indignant than think \"well, maybe she is.\"\n\nReasons why EITA: this sounds petty when I write it out.

After I already turned around and sat back down, his travel companion tapped my shoulder to tell me that I was the rude one for not asking before reclining my seat because the guy is six feet tall. (How would I have known that?) I tried to say that it was still rude of them to push my chair like that, and after some back and forth, she finally settled on her judgement that \"we were both in the wrong.\" I still feel wrongly accused since I have never heard of asking for permission to recline a seat.

The leasing office had messed up his lease amount he was paying monthly in the system so he was paying $5 less than it actually was.\n\nNext, when we went to the leasing office to obtain the forms for someone to takeover his lease, they mentioned that half of February’s rent would be paid for if someone moved in by January. We clarified this on four separate occasions.\n\nAdditionally, he stored the apartment furniture in a storage unit because it is pretty outdated, and he loves his ikea furniture.\n\nNow comes the fun, I found this girl on facebook and advertised everything as stated above. We were pretty desperate because all of his monthly income was going to rent. We offered to pay her signing fee on top of my bf’s fee.\n\nThe leasing office tells us as she is signing that the half off rent deal was only for new residents moving in, not individuals taking over a lease. We tell her we can pay the half of the rent for February. Next, they tell us that the system has messed up and my boyfriend’s rent is actually $5 more than we advertised. His account will be docked for the money that the system did not include. He offers to pay the extra $5 for this girl’s rent every month as she is freaking out.\n\nShe moves in and everything is fine. Then she tells us that the furniture stores has bed bugs. The leasing office never checked the apartment before she moved in, but we cleaned the room before she did because she was not happy with the dust on the floor or dishes in the sink.\n\nShe goes to the office to tell them there are bed bugs in her room. They charge her $500 to fumigate the room. She freaks out and calls us to tell us she is suing the office over mistreatment (she has no grounds to sue as the contract she signed does not allow her to sue them). My boyfriend again offers to cover this fee but explains that we cannot provide her with half the rent we are covering this expected cost. Am I the asshole for not paying half of her rent anymore?\n\nTLDR boyfriend and I told a girl signing his lease we would pay half of her rent ($312), she found bed bugs in her apartment. The leasing office charged her $500 which we offered to pay but can’t pay half of her rent anymore because of this.",

      "description": "My friend and I are both students in the same major and so we ended up having a lot of the same classes, which was nice at first because most of our classes are on the opposite end of campus as the dorms and we'd often walk there together.  Recently, however, we've been going together less and less because she always goes before me.\n\nI'll admit I'm not super quick about getting out the door, but I have been putting effort in to leave when she wants to and a lot of times I can't because of other restrictions.  For example, she and I have two different classes that end at the same time, and we both have to go back to the dorms to pick up our stuff for our next class, but my class is a little further away from the dorms than hers.  She would have to wait a maximum of five minutes for me to get there, and it's not like she'd be late if she waited for me.  The class we have together is 1.5 hours after our previous classes, but we go early to do prep work.\n\nShe'll still sometimes (keyword: sometimes) wait for me to go to our other shared classes, so it's possible that her going ahead for this particular class is because it's the most important for our major so she'd want as much time for it as possible--but I'm still not entirely convinced because as I said it would take no more than 5 minutes to wait until I get there and we'd still have 1.5 hours to work before class.  Am I justified in feeling a little offended or should I just chalk this up to different priorities?",

      "description": "I live in Boston and my brother, who's two years younger and a senior in college, has decided to visit with his girlfriend for a few days later this month. This past Christmas we were both home with our parents and he brought up that he would be visiting Boston come March. I said he was free to crash at my apartment with me and my other two roommates. I told him that we have a pull out couch in our living room that him and his girlfriend could sleep on. However, this turned into a screaming match where my brother and mom yelled at me and told me how selfish I was for not letting him sleep in my bedroom (while I sleep in the living room). After about 20 minutes of this, I gave in and said \"sure, they can stay in my bedroom\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this past week and I started to rethink having him and his girlfriend stay in my bedroom. He said he would clean the sheets and everything, but the whole thing still weirds me out. My two roommates (who I each share a wall with), said they also feel uneasy having my brother and his girlfriend sleep in my room. So, I texted my brother a few days ago about how I feel pretty uncomfortable with the whole situation and would much rather they crash on the pull out couch in our living room. The living room in our apartment is connected to the kitchen, and basically comprises the entire communal space in the apartment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis set off a string of texts from him about how selfish and self-centered he thinks I am and how he would now need to pay for an Airbnb. He also said that his girlfriend doesn't want to stay in the living room. I get that I said he could stay in my bedroom over Christmas, but that was after being yelled at for 20 minutes by him and my mom. I should have given him more than a 2-weeks notice, but I am not sure if that would've changed his response.",

      "description": "I don't know how to condense this properly, it's a *long* story and I'm frustrated even as I write it, but I'll do my best:\n\nMy parents think that I'm pushing my son too hard to be social. He's 7 and not uncommonly complains about not playing with other kids in the neighborhood. We have it pretty easy now considering we had to move back in with my parents and I now usually work nights while my parents watch him after school, so they see him more and they're more in control than I am at this point. (It's worth noting that my parents, as grandparents are wont to do, spoil the shit out of him, but then complain that he's becoming entitled, lazy, and selfish.) Just today, he was complaining about a neighbor kid not being able to play with him this afternoon. Later, while still light out, a bunch of kids were outside playing- including the original neighbor kid! I encouraged him (strongly, got him to put his sneakers on, go outside to see for himself) to go out with them, but he ultimately refused- he'd rather stay in and play with the iPad, xbox, Tv, whatever. It bothers me because he is unhappy when he doesn't get to play, but when he has a chance he chooses not to, even when I'm covering all the bases- *there's a kid you usually play with, I can go out and hang around til you feel comfortable, this is what* ***you wanted to do-*** meanwhile my parents seem to think (as soon as he cuddles up to them, no less) that I'm pushing him unfairly.\n\nI totally get social anxiety and the sort of nuances that are perceptible only to children in these situations, but I don't want to encourage behavior that is lazy or cowardly. The neighbor kids are mostly nice (if they're being mean to him, he's not admitting it, although we have all always been very supportive of him), and the worst I can note is that *my* kid has been starting to do inappropriate things that he must be seeing on TV- for example, just today, he made the \"jerking off\" gesture to me. For no reason. I know he doesn't know what it means, but I think he's coming off as weird, and I do want to encourage his social development in the real world as opposed to the internet world.\n\nAfter the argument about going out to play, my parents immediately made him comfy and rejected my premise. So he took one step out the door and turned right back around. Now I'm the asshole in this house, but...really? They'll scream at him for not listening the first time, but then give him whatever he wants. Maybe I'm harsh, but at least I'm consistent. I think I might need to move again. I don't mean to come off as ungrateful, I do appreciate them taking us in, but if things go on this way, it might be doing more harm than good. I don't know. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for getting mad at an acquaintance-friend who I was helping out with a place to stay who disrespected me and my home and then held them to the previously agreed upon rent agreement?",
      "description": "FYI, this is kind of a long one.\n\nSo, I have an acquaintance-friend (we'll call her AF; she lies somewhere between just an acquaintance and my closer-but-not-inner circle of friends. AF was moving back to my town, after having left for a couples weeks due to being forced out of a bad living situation, and so I said that she was welcome to stay at my place for a month or two until she gets herself settled. She doesn't have a car so I made a just-shy-of four-hour round trip drive to pick her up and bring her to town. The ride was given with the agreed upon expectation of gas money. She gave me $17 on the spot and agreed to give me more at a later time. It took 3/4 of a tank to make the trip which for me is about $25 in gas. We also made an agreement that my offer of her staying at my place was not free and that she would be expected to pitch in on rent and utilities, chores, and would have to buy her own groceries. For the rent and utilities, we agreed that she would pay 1/3 each month she stayed. I have a roommate as well, so that would have made the housing costs split evenly three ways. \n\nAF was also bringing her small dog, which I was cool with because my dog would have a dog-friend and who doesn't like having more dogs around, right? Again, I set an expectation that I was not going to be a dog-sitter and that she would have to take care of her dog as any responsible owner should. No using my dog's food, crating the dog if she had to leave the house and no one else was there (my dog gets the run of most of the house but I didn't know this dog well enough to trust it that much), and letting her dog out often enough to prevent accidents (and clean up any that did occur). \n\nSo, I bring AF down to my place last Wednesday and I lay out all of the rules and expectations of the house. Nothing crazy, just clean up after yourself, put things back exactly where you got them from, don't take over space with all your stuff, don't mess with the thermostat, keep doors and windows locked, just basic stuff. Well, in the span of 5 days, she just took off for 24 hours and left me with her dog, without asking me if I was willing to dog sit, to hang out with her friends. When I asked her why she didn't just ask me, and I would have agreed to dog sit, her excuse was that I was sleeping (I had fallen asleep on the couch) and that because she HATES being woken up she didn't want to wake me up. I said you can't apply yourself to me like that and that you should have just woken me up and asked because I would have said yes. But because she didn't do that, I woke up the morning after she left to having found that her dog had peed on my bed and shit on the floor. If I knew I was going to be dog sitting, I would have woken up early to make sure to let her dog out. I should mention, the dog is a year-old chihuahua with separation anxiety problems. \n\nThis was not the first time that her dog had peed and pooped in the house since it had arrived. When I texted her to find out where she was and when she was coming back, she said she was waiting on a ride from her, \"flaky friends.\" I thought maybe she had gone out of town but it turned out that she was just on the other side of town, which is my little Appalachian town is walking distance from my house. Apparently, she didn't want to walk because it was, \"too cold,\" and she, \"didn't own a winter coat.\" It was in the 30s. We have taxi services and Lyft in my town (it's a small town but also a college town) that she could have taken. I let her know that I did not appreciate being forced into dog sitting, that her dog had made a mess and that she needed to get back ASAP to take care of her pup. Also, while I was unwillingly dog-sitting I was forced to give her dog some of my dog's food because I could not find the dog food that AF has said that she had brought. It was dark by the time she finally made it back.\nAlso, in these past 5 days, AF left my front door unlocked and open twice, in the same day. After I had already reminded her that she needed to keep the doors locked, even when people are in the house. I do not keep an open doors policy and this is a college town where burglaries do happen. There had been a couple in the neighborhood just recently. Just this morning, I woke up for work to find that she had fallen asleep (she was the last one awake last night) with the door unlocked and open. She probably went out to smoke and then got distracted by her phone as soon as she came back in. She's always on her phone. I sent her a text from work telling her, once again, that she absolutely cannot do that because it's a security issue, a health hazard for my pet Bearded Dragon and Ball Python because of the cold air (in the 20s at night), and a waste of my heat. Also, she stays up late and sleeps late and upon waking up that morning I also found dog poop on the floor. Again. For the third or fourth time in 5 days. So then, today, I come home from an eight hour day of work to find my front door unlocked and open and no one home. My roommate was probably at work, she has an evening afternoon/evening restaurant schedule and I have a 9-5 schedule working in a local government office, and AF was nowhere to be found. Oh, AND her dog was not crated AND there was more dog poop and pee on the floor. At this point, I was furious. I sent her a text asking her, \"Why the hell did I come home to an unlocked and open front door,\" that this was, \"Absolutely unacceptable and a huge violation of my home,\" and, \"What the hell was she thinking?\"\n\nFrom there, I finally decided that after only 5 days I realize that AF is immature and disrespectful of my home, myself, and my property and that she is no longer welcome to stay. I tell her as much and that she would have one week to find a new place to stay. I also state that I would be returning a pro-rated amount of the down-payment she had made for the third of December's rent that she had agreed to pay. I told AF that I would divide what would have been to total for rent and utilities into a daily rate, keep 5 days' worth, and return the rest. I also said that I was going to add an additional $5 for the rest of the gas money that she owed me. \n\nAF proceeds to inform me that she already found a new place, was moving out today, and that the reason she left the door unlocked (and not open according to her) was because she got a call for a job interview and they wanted her to come in right away. She said that she woke up to that call and HAD to leave but no one was home. I never gave her a key so she was unable to lock up. When I asked her why she didn't just contact me to let me know, because my office is a ten minute walk from my house and she could've come to get my key or I could've gone home during lunch to lock up, she had no answer other than that she had to get to the job interview. Then as I tell her that she left my house, my dog, my property unsecured and in potential danger she just went on about how she'd had such a bad day because she had to walk 45 minutes in the cold to get to the interview on the other side of town. By the way, she did get the job, for which I congratulated her. I retorted that all she had to do was ask and I would have loaned her a coat. In fact, I had an extra winter coat laying around the was left behind by a previous roommate. Again, she had no response other than that she had to get to the interview. \n\nFrom there, I made it clear to AF that she was irresponsible, disrespectful, only thinking of herself, and obviously not someone I could trust with my house. I reiterated my plan to prorates the money she had already given for rent and bills and return the balance. AF then proceeded to accuse me of being greedy and unfair because I was mad, that I should only be allowed to keep $50 because she thought that was all her time here was worth(btw the total I did keep after my calculations was $63), and that, \"I thought you were trying to help me,\" and that I had, \"turned it into a hustle.\" My reply was, \"Yes, I helped you by bringing you here and giving you a place to stay but I never said it was going to be free. In fact, we made an agreement and I'm holding you to it. Also, if I was being greedy I would take extra money for the fact that I had to give your dog my dog's food and for all the dog messes I had to clean from my bed and my carpet.\" So, AF had her friend she was moving in with come and get her. I helped AF gather her things, made sure she didn't leave anything, even gave her that extra winter coat my old roommate left behind, and she was off. Before she left, I asked her if she truly understood why I was so upset with her and why I felt that I and my home had been disrespected. She said that she did but I don't truly believe her. Knowing her, I can almost guarantee that she's spinning it to her friends that I'm the greedy bad guy who turned an offer of help into a hustle and then kicked her out when I got mad at her about something that she probably doesn't think is a big deal. Needless to say, AF has definitely dropped down the rungs from acquaintance-friend to just an acquaintance, at best.\n\nAnyways, what do you think? Am I the greedy asshole here like she claims?",

      "title": "AITA for standing in front of a shorter person at a concert?",
      "description": "I went to a concert last weekend and had an interaction that is still nagging at me. I truly don't know if I was the asshole. Sorry for the length, I want to include all the details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr A shorter guy at a concert tried to prevent us from standing 4 feet in front of him to protect his view, but we stood there anyway because we felt his request was ridiculous and entitled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a general admission show, where the entire ground floor is just standing room. My partner and I arrived about 5-10 minutes before the band would be starting. We are both on the tall side (I am 5'9\", he is 6'1\"). We found a decent spot to stand about 3/4 of the way back from the stage, but as I was looking around, I saw a pocket of empty space up ahead that would put us 10-15 feet closer. So we maneuver into that pocket of empty space. Immediately a guy behind us taps my bf on the shoulder, and asks us to not stand there because he can't see over us. I would guess the guy was maybe 5'4\" or so (I'm going to call him \"the short guy\" from here on out, which I don't mean as an insult, just a description). And he was not especially polite, but rather kind of bratty about it. My bf was rather surprised by this request, and he responded \"um, alright, would you like to switch spots and stand in front of us?\" To which the short guy replied no, he can't see over the people that were standing in front of us either. **Important note:** there was at least 4 feet of empty space in front of the short guy that he was trying to protect for himself. Meaning, when we went to stand in that spot, there was no one immediately behind us, just the short guy, 4 feet behind us. It is not like we pushed through the crowd and parked ourselves a few inches directly in front of a much shorter person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he also refused to switch spots with us, my bf was sort of flummoxed, so he grabbed my hand and started to move us to another spot behind the short guy. Up until that point I had just been a confused observer. But when my bf tried to actually move us out of this guy's way, I had to stop us. I said to the short guy (rather incredulously I'm sure) \"hold on, excuse me, so you are you really expecting no one to stand in this space in front of you for the entire show???\" He kind of shrugged like yep, so what. He then also gestured to some people seated in chairs several feet behind him (in the ADA section) and said \"they might like to see better too,\" but I suspect he was only using that to further his cause, since there were already other people standing in front of them, himself included. I stared at him and he stared at me for a few tense seconds, then my bf was like alright, sorry, we're doing this - and we returned to our spot 4 feet in front of the short guy. BF turned around and said \"sorry man, you're still welcome to stand in font of us, but we're standing here.\" Short guy looked annoyed and pissed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not normally confrontational but something in this situation ignited me, and I spent the rest of the show feeling like the short guy was staring daggers into the back of my head and wondering if I just pulled a major dick move. But it's a general admission show - is someone really entitled to a bubble of space because of their height? Am I not allowed to stand in certain spots because of *my* height? Obviously I think the answer is no, but curious to get others' perspectives.",

She was obviously extremely hurt, but then to make matters worse she found out it was with a guy who was half my dads age and not much older than me. We’re not homophobic but my mom felt even more betrayed and like he had been lying to us about who he was all this time. My dad tried to play the victim card claiming how hard it was to keep it a secret that he was gay and that he didn’t want to destroy our family which is why he did it behind our backs. I think everything he is saying is bullshit tbh. Yes coming out is hard but we deserved to know and my mom shouldn’t have been betrayed like this. I also find the age gap really repulsive. \n\nFor this reason I’ve barely spoke to my dad since finding out. I live with my mom, I refuse to see him and I don’t answer his calls.

      "description": "Hi AITA friends, to cut the chase short, I started working in the auditing field (tax) a couple of years ago. I met my current GF when I first crossed the threshold to our (soon-to-be) shared room at work and fell in love. She was stunning and we fell for each other when we got to know each other. Things got steamy and semi-official by the third year we worked together. We've had our ups and downs, but each time we came back for each other's company. However the problem I encountered again and again was drinking. She was a working alcoholic and drank until total stupor a couple of times a week. For the past few years I hid her drinking habits. I took her to customer meetings drunk and left her in the car explaining to the customer that she was car-sick etc. Now I understand that I'm part of the reason for the escalation, I should not have done that. I had my problems and drank them away together with her (got sober 2018). Last year our working conditions changed, and we no longer worked together. I could no longer hide her drinking problem (which was wrong). In my country the use of alcohol (and overuse) is however shushed over. Over the past year the days when she has been late to work and not responding to any of my messages has increased tenfold. Today was another day when she was late to the work (by a large margin) and didn't answer any calls etc. (Lync) for the whole of the day. I know that she met another alcoholic friend last night. I sent her a couple of texts this morning and she did not answer them until the evening and she did not sign into Lync the whole day. We had a planned meeting which she skipped. I asked our common superior if she had received any word (she had not). Later in the evening she finally answered my messages and accused me as being stalkish and too clingy. I agree, I look at Lync constantly and watch when she arrives to work. So today was the first day I went ahead and asked our superior if my GF had called in sick. That was not the case and our superior said that there will be repercussions.\n\nSo, the AITA question stems from when I talked about the alcohol overuse of my GF to our common superior? AITA for asking my GF if she's okay and what she has been up to? Am I the asshole for not trusting my GF and talking to the management about this issue? Should I keep shut about my part in this? My GF is not in any risk of being fired. The main step our superior can do, is direct her to the doctor. Any input or advice would be dear to me. She means the world to me in work and at outside work.\n\nPs. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, also i hope didn't sound too niceguyTM",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I went on a trip over a long weekend (3 days, 2 nights). Throughout the entirety of the trip planning, I asked for his input - what kind of activities he would like to do, what kind of food he would like to eat, etc. He had a few opinions here and there but for the most part left the planning to me (which I was more than happy about.)\n\nA couple days before the trip, he tells me he has just one request for the weekend - that we go to a bar to watch his NFL team play on Sunday afternoon. I had already made brunch reservations by this time, and had excitedly told him about them. He asked if I could cancel the reservation and pick somewhere with TVs where the game would be on. I told him I didn't want to, as I had done a lot of searching and was really excited about this particular restaurant. \n\nI told him I wouldn't mind if he watched the game on his phone. He argued he wouldn't be able to find a stream and his phone would run out of battery. I told him I could easily find him a stream (thx /r/nflstreams) and I would pack a mobile phone charger. He still wasn't satisfied with this. I called the restaurant we already had reservations at and asked if they had a TV we could watch the game on. They had one and they said they would put on the game if they could. My boyfriend insisted they wouldn't have it because it was out of market. I finally told him he could feel free to go to a bar to watch the game, but I wouldn't join him as I wanted to spend the weekend enjoying our vacation destination, not sitting in a crowded loud bar watching football, which we can do any weekend. \n\nHe got very upset with me over this argument and asked \"why I even bothered asking for his suggestions if I wasn't going to take them.\" I tried to explain I meant suggestions that were more in the spirit of the trip, and that if he had brought it up when we first decided to take the trip, I would've been more willing to take the football game into consideration (but still would not have wanted to spend \\~4 hours of our relatively short trip watching it.) \n\nWe ended up going to the original restaurant I had planned, he watched it on his phone with no issues and was content enough, and it hasn't come up again, but I still think about this argument a lot. Was I being a bad girlfriend for not taking his one main request into consideration? ",

      "description": "Our oldest son, G (27), lives about 2 miles down the road and joins us for dinner often.  He's a single guy and we enjoy having him.  He has a young German Shepherd dog (male, neutered, about 1 year old) that he has been training pretty rigorously.  The dog is good, for the most part, and we enjoy him.\n\nTo give an idea of our home, we have two teenagers who still live at home, two spayed female dogs (a very calm border collie and less calm dachshund) and two cats.   There is plenty of space for everyone, but G's dog will follow our dogs closely until one asserts dominance. They won't play with him and growls ensue if he gets too close.  You can tell it's tense.  It's basically like they have to figure out who is alpha every single time G comes over with his dog.  The cats don't care and the dog is afraid of them.\n\nI also usually feed our pets at 5pm.  Often G will be at the house with the dog before I get home from work, so I can't feed the dogs until after dinner (or he'll eat all their food and the cats' food in about 20 seconds).  He also chews up all the bones and toys, but that's no big deal.  Usually it's a bone that our border collie hasn't wanted for a week.\n\nWe love our son and his dog is a good dog.  I don't want to offend our any, but having the dog over during dinner time is wearing me out.\n\nTLDR:  WIBTA if I ask our son not to bring his dog, who stresses our animals out, over during dinner time?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So, a little background, I don't live at home with my parents, I live abroad but all three of my brothers , 11, 17, 18 years old all still live at home. Even since before I moved out in the mid-end of 2017, my youngest brother's best friend (He's the same age as my youngest brother) has been staying at my parents a lot, every free weekend or holiday (this includes the ENTIRE summer holidays more of less). \n\nSo here's my problem, I don't like that my parents need to spend so much extra money on feeding and housing another kid that isn't even theirs, the kid is nice enough but when I went home for Christmas I found him opening our drawers and going through the snacks we have in the kitchen as if he was at home, this pissed me off a bit, mostly because you don't really do that at someon elses place, right? I couldn't even get a proper family evening without this other kid being there when I was home for 2 weeks over Christmas other than Christmas eve.\n\nHis parents also make no effort in paying for him even though they use my parents place as a hotel for their kid. They even go on vacations and just leave their kid with my parents. This boy has 2 older siblings one who's around 25 (give or take) and another who's 20 so they are very capable of taking care of their younger brother when the parents leave for their little vacations.\n\nI also think my brothers, not only the youngest, is starting feel a bit smothered by him constantly being there, the same as my parents.  My nan has also commented on that she thinks he can stay home for a weekend at least. \n\nThis kid joins everywhere, extended family birthday celebrations, family outings, he even joined my parents and youngest brother to watch my two other brother play in a football (soccer if you're American) cup, this trip takes abour 4h to make so they had to sleep at my grandparents who live about 2h away from the city hosting the cup (the games were stretched over about 3-4 days I think) but my parents got train tickets that would get them there and back to my grandparents so they wouldn't have to take the car or bother with parking, meaning they had to pay the kids ticket, too, and to be honest I don't know if his parents paid for these expenses but I honestly doubt they did.\n\nI've talked to my mom about this how it's not her or my dad's responsibility to almost raise this kid but as the nursery teacher she is she can't help but taking care of him, I understand that his home situation might not be ideal but should it be my family's responsibility to take care of him? In my opinion my parents are too kind and giving way for this kind of behaviour.\n\nSo am I the ass for thinking he can spend at least an entire weekend at home or for his parents to compensate at least a bit? I get that I'm a bit of an ass, me being an adult thinking like this of an 11 year old kid but genuinely my biggest problem is probably his parents who allow this without a second thought.",

And now that we have graduated, my other friend and I found jobs. Other friend recommended a job for her boyfriend and I gave some tips in acing the interview to my friend to relay to her boyfriend. He got the job and seems happy. However, my friend confided in us that she suspects the guy is cheating on her. He is always talking about a certain female co-worker and my friend said that he has never heard him talk about anyone like that. She considers breaking up with him and told us that she is sure of it because she isn't happy anymore. We back her decision up because the guy had PREVIOUSLY cheated on her but she took him back. I said that I won't support it if they got back together. I noticed that she always makes excuses for the guy's toxic treatment of her and I saw how the cheating screwed with her way of thinking. Now, she told me that she was only PMS-ing when she wanted to break up with her boyfriend. I got quite irritated because I just know that she will go back to him and continue their toxic relationship. ",

I told her I never intended on hurting her and that I’m trying to do what’s best\n\nI feel terrible about it and whenever I walk into her friends they give me looks as if Satan walked around the Earth.

      "title": "AITA for Being Harsh to My Coworker in Public Spaces?",
      "description": "AITA for being rude in office spaces to my coworker/friend who has (and a series of previous mishaps) have given me a ton of extra work?\n\nSome necessary background on this: 1. We work in education, so a day missed or a day late is a BIG deal, because we have to cancel class or shorten it. 2. This coworker is my direct equal, not a Teaching Assistant or a Sub or anything like that. We \"team-teach\"; that means we both are the regular lecturers for the class. We are both paid as if we are solo-lecturers for the course. 3. Despite the assignment, it is common knowledge that this coworker has no prior experience wit the topic/skills we're teaching. She's meant to be learning how to teach this class by co-teaching it with me. 4. The department we work in is supposed to be really congenial, so my \"rudeness\" is quite obvious.   \n\n\nNow, on to the spark to the flame: \n\nTo being with, this coworker has continued to be unreliable and unprofessional throughout the semester. She's missed 6/12 class periods entirely, (1 for a wedding, 1 for therapy session she scheduled during our class time, 1 for lateness \\[she ended up cancelling the class because she was so late and I was out sick\\], and 3 for the latest issue \\[described below\\]). She's regularly late, never attends our scheduled weekly meetings, and consistently causes issues for students by not responding to emails in a timely manner. She has also only graded 6/150 assignments in our class, because she does not dedicate time to learning the skills she needs to grade (image this as someone who's never worked with ceramics before grading a students lasagna tray; she has no idea what we're looking for). \n\nAbout a month ago, we sat down with our superior and had the come to jesus talk. We decided the final would be graded 50/50, no matter what. All looked like it would improve. It did not.\n\n  \n2 weeks ago, she gets a minor injury from a fall off of a bike. She texts me the day before our class, letting me know, and saying it shouldn't affect her work. The next day she misses our class again, saying she's going to get check for a skull fracture. The following day, she says she only has a minor concussion and no skull fracture, but that the doctor says she should take 1-2 weeks rest to recover. Conveniently, those 1-2 weeks are the lead up to our final project, where she would learn skills she'd need to grade our students. She says the doctor has ordered her not to look at screens. Conveniently, our work primarily deals with using a computer software. The takeaway: she cant grade finals. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am angry about how flippant she's being about the extra work it gives me. I will grade all 100 of our finals, as I have nearly all of the other assignments so far. Obviously, teaching is tiring, but I'm already getting paid to do that-- I'm particularly angry because extra grading is extra work not scheduled into my pay, and my coworker continues to get paid at my pay rate despite not actually performing any job requirements. \n\nSo, I'm being rude, because I'm angry and frustrated and feel disrespected and unfairly used.  I am particularly insulted by this extra-ness because I have memory issues as the result of an actual brain injury, something her spottiness exacerbates. It feels insulting to me that she can get away with making life difficult for me because how her behavior interacts with my condition, but I'm expected to make her life easier for an arguably less severe one. Maybe I'm cynical, maybe I'm just a bitch. You decide.\n\nSo, here's where I risk being an asshole. The big issue is that we work in a small department, and social issues can get out of hand as big gossipy deals. I know that showing that I'm angry in our office spaces means creating a divide in our department, essentially. But I'm doing it anyway. I can't hold back my frustrations any longer. I cold-shoulder her, I don't hide my unhappiness in front of our coworkers, and I don't show sympathy for her illness. She's acting like nothings happened and there's no change to our previous dynamic (a friendly, albeit obviously strained professional team). Meanwhile, I don't talk to her unless she talks to me, and I call her out for misrepresenting how hard she's working (ie, \"Yeah, it must be tough to get 2 weeks off during the busiest time of the semester).  When she tries to joke with me I tell her  I'm not in the mood because I'm tired from all the extra work her absence has caused. The works, essentially. I'm just rude, in our office.\n\nSuffice to say, she's now very upset because I'm not pleasant to her in social spaces (I'm always perfectly cordial during class, if she shows up). I'm getting flack from coworkers who want me to let it die because it makes our office interactions awkward. Our mutual friends think I'm being a dick for not believing her concussion deserved 2 weeks off of work. I'm hearing from all sides that I'm being a total asshole but I really think I have to stand up for myself, and as she's never in our class I have to show her how upset I am at how disrespectful she's been to me somewhere. Maybe I just picked the wrong hill to die on.   \n\n\nAnywho, here's the question: AITA for causing strife in the department and making my coworker feel bad in public?   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She keeps calling me my deadname and says \"he\" instead of \"she\" like I prefer. My instant reaction when anyone does this is too correct them, doing so helps me feel more valid as a woman. When someone calls me a man, and I don't say anything it feels like I'm agreeing with them, which leads to hightened depression. My mom says I shouldn't correct her, because it's difficult for her to accept this all at once and she needs time. I get that and I'm not saying she has to start calling me my new name, it just helps me to correct her so I feel better. She thinks it's rude and selfish, and I'm just trying to feel valid.

      "description": "I've been using Tinder for a few weeks now. My profile picture is a picture of me at the store that I used to work at. A customer came in with a pet pigeon and let the bird sit on my arm, and then I asked him to take the picture with my phone. I didn't use any filters. You can see me from my midriff up to the top of my head, but tbh I was wearing a sweater. \n\n\nI am a 5'8, 162 lbs female, btw. \n\n\nI met this guy on Tinder and we hit it off. He was really funny and we had some hobbies in common. We agreed to go on a date downtown, to look at pigeons, because he said that he also liked them. When we met he was completely different from how he was over chat. He didn't say anything to me on his own and just answered questions with simples yesses and nos. He seemed angry the whole time and left the date after about an hour, saying he was supposed to meet his friend.\n\n\nI thought that maybe he was shy in real life, and texted him afterwards to thank him for the date and ask him if he had an omay time. He didn't reply for a few days but this morning I got this text:\n\n\n&gt;just a headsup not everyone is into big girls, u should rly let guys know ahead of time so they dont get put on the spot. Just my advise. Hope u find what ur looking for, best wishes.\n\n\nI feel really embarrassed after reading this text. I didn't mean to put anyone 'on the spot'. I know I'm not thin, but I'm also not *that* heavy. It never occurred to me that this was something I had to disclose before meeting someone. But I do remember reading some posts online where people were similarly disappointed that a date was bigger than they let on. Am I one of those deceptive dates? AITA?",

      "description": "So for a bit of context, I work at a grocery store in a small town where you know everyone’s name, and even if you don’t, you recognize the face. I’m a cashier, and to break up the monotony of the day I try my best to make each transaction a little different and personal rather than saying the same script over and over hundreds of times. \n\nWell about a week ago now, I had an older lady I have seen before once or twice come into my line to check out. I had just finished checking out a family friend and was in a rather good mood. Now this lady seemed sour from the start, and as I was checking her out, I made a comment saying the type of microwaveable meal she was buying was really good. Then this interaction happened:\n\nC-Customer \n——————————-\n\nMe: “oh those meals are really good! I just had one for lunch yesterday and you won’t regret getting it.”\n\nC: “excuse me?”\n\nMe: “I was just saying I really enjoy those meals is all. They are actually pretty tasty surprisingly!”\n\nC: “you shouldn’t talk about a customer’s purchases. It’s extremely rude and makes us uncomfortable. \n\nMe: “oh I’m sorry ma’m, I didn’t mean anything by it.” \n\nC: “think about what you’ve done and how wrong it is. I cannot stand young people today. You millennials don’t think about other people or being polite anymore. I would get your manager but I’m in a rush. Count yourself lucky young man.”\n—————————\n\nI finished checking her out but actually started shaking a little. I really don’t like confrontation, and I was terrified this would somehow make me lose my job. A weeks gone by with nothing bad, but the situation is stuck in my head. One of my friends said I did nothing wrong, but another said it is rude to comment on purchases. Am I missing something? AITA here?\n\nTLDR: Lady calls me rude for commenting on how I liked a meal she purchased ",

(Which I think makes sense, if thinking rationally..)\n\nYesterday when we went out she noticed that I always space out and stare into emptiness, so she told me in seriousness to stop with this since I look like someone crazy psycho. She also said \"Everyone normal human looks right and left when being outside. Why do only you look at one spot then?\". I replied with \"I think it's because back then in middle school I was always starring at the floor since I felt intimidated by my classmates\". Then she probably got annoyed at this stuff again and said \"Look at me, I didn't grow up with parents and I still was able to live happy. I had it worse than you. So I don't understand why you always have to be dragged down by your problems.\" \n\nHer life story is indeed worse than mine and now I feel like trash, because I don't want do be a depressive burden, but at the same time it makes me more depressive because apparently I'm crying over small unnecessary matters.

I had just got my license and my first car, a little Kia, so of course i was pumped to drive it to school. A few of my older friends also drove to school most days so i assumed those free spots were first come first serve for students.\n\nAfter the school day i went out to my car and saw a large note taped to the back window, and masking tape across the windshield. The note said something along the lines of \"this is private parking, if you park again you will get fined and towed.\" I was confused so i took the note to the principals office to ask what it was about. The VP sees me there and invites me into his office where he explains pretty snarkily that students don't have access to parking and that I can't park there. I explain that plenty of other students park there and no one else used the spots so i didn't see what the big deal was. He basically shrugged it off and sent me on my way. \n\nMe being a rebellious little shit, i kept on parking there and kept getting the notes and the tape. Seeing as i was never gonna get towed, and from my point of view was now just petty, i started taking the notes off of my car, and then sticking it on his car, seeing as he almost never parked in the VP designated parking spot. My school doesn't have cameras in the parking area so he never knew it was me.\n\nAfter a while i wanted to test if this was directed just at me, seeing as other kids who'd park rarely ever got the same note and tape on their cars. One week where my parents were away, i drove my moms SUV to school and parked where i always did with the Kia. At lunch, the VP walks up to the table I'm eating at and smugly says \"well I'm glad you finally learned your lesson and didn't park here today.\" I kinda just said \"haha yeah man\" and went back to eating. \n\nWent out after class and boom nothing on the SUV. Next day i did the same thing with my dads Pickup truck. Still no note or anything. Next day I'm back with my Kia. Surpise, theres the note and tape. I do my classic put it on the VP's car, and he happened to be watching me that day. Caught red handed, can't really defend my actions. He pulls me into his office and starts grilling me on being disrespectful, and says \"its not nice to put something on anyones car without permission from the owner.\" That really pissed me off since thats what he'd been doing this whole time. \n\nSo tell me, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I work shift work- 12 hr days and nights from 6-6.  As is the nature of most shift work there are different daily/weekly/monthly tasks for each shift. These tasks are not employee specific, whoever is working that shift that day is responsible for completing the task and signing off on it. There is a general understanding however if a casual employee is working a shift where a particularly “difficult” or specialized task is due then they usually leave it for the regular staff, which is fine. I’m talking about regular staff who have been here for years in this post.\n\nI’m pretty type A about my job and I have fairly high seniority. I do both days and nights but mostly nights which means a lot of the paperwork type tasks and scheduling falls on me, because day shift doesn’t have time for a lot of that sort of thing. That’s fine. But the other employees who work nights flat out refuse to do any of the “difficult” tasks (I’m not exaggerating on this, a lot of them think they can just come in and nap on nights) and it has somehow become “my” job to handle all of them. Tbh I liked this at first because I like things done my way and I feel the way the other employees do certain things is pretty abysmal, despite me showing them the correct way over and over. However the tasks have increased over the years and I can’t keep up anymore. I have brought this to my managers attention and all she ever says is “I’ll talk to them” and nothing ever changes. I tried telling the other night staff that I can’t keep up and they need to start pulling their weight- I even offered to show them how to do some of the specialized tasks AGAIN but nothing changed. There had been some turnover and I’ve trained the new night workers who seem agreeable but the work is still somehow all left to me. There’s a running joke that certain tasks are just “____’s job so don’t worry about it.”\n\nI take a month of vacation every year. The past few years I’ve tried to get as much work done ahead of time before I go because I know if I don’t there’s going to be a shit show when I get back. As I said the work has increased and I’ve been incredibly burnt out. Even if I wanted to I could not get more than a weeks worth of work done ahead of time before I left for holidays this year (work that is supposed to be everyone’s job, not just mine).  I knew this was going to be a problem but I figured it would be a good time for the other employees to figure out how to do some of this stuff (stuff I have shown them how to do before but might prove a bit challenging if you are out of practicing for NEVER DOING IT).\n\nWell it’s been just over a week and they’ve already bombarded me with calls and texts because they can’t seem to figure anything out. I told them not to bug me on my holidays and blocked the number, not before my coworker called me an asshole for not taking the time to walk her through something that she should have been doing all along (not to mention we have a manual on this particular task and a support person you can call 24/7 if you have questions). So am AITA here?\n\nAlso: I feel it’s worth mentioning that I don’t have a pay raise for change of title for doing any of this extra stuff, I just have pride in my work and don’t like seeing our workplace in disarray.\n\n",

      "description": "Last night he came home from work and I was in the shower. When I came downstairs he was sitting at the table on his laptop and he seemed really stressed. I said hi and went and gave him a kiss and he said hi and kissed me back but he carried on doing whatever he was doing and didn’t really acknowledge me. I sat on his lap and was like what’s up? He was like it’s just work, so I started to unbutton his shirt and kiss him and I was like forget about work now. He was like Im sorry I can’t I really need to get this done, I was like well it can wait you’ve been working all day. Then he pushed my hand away and was like for fucks sake. I was like what? he was like I told you I need to get this done, do you ever listen? I was like wow...I’m sorry, and walked off. I grabbed my keys and went for a drive. He rang me like 5 mins later and I didn’t pick up so he messaged me saying he was sorry he snapped at me and told me to come home. \n\nI dunno if I’m being oversensitive but it upset me was because he knows I’ve been having a hard time recently. I get really low at times and when he’s been at work all day I kinda expect his attention to be on me when he gets home. \n\nI know he’s stressed out. He just taken over this company and has a lot to sort out. I know he works hard so he can give me and his daughter the best life possible, and I really respect him for how hard he works but I didn’t like the way he spoke to me when I was just trying to make him feel better. And he’s never turned down sex before so it was just really weird for him...\n\nI stayed out for a while and when I got home he said he was sorry. I said it was fine but I was going to bed. He tried to have sex with me and I pushed him off and said I wasn’t in the mood.\n\nWas i the asshole for not listening to him when he said he was busy? ",

      "description": "So here's my story. My mom divorced my father about 10 years ago. She then married my step-father, who seemed like a good guy for the first few years. My mom and him had my step-sister. It was after my mom's maternity leave end that things starting going downhill. He left his job to start up his company (it may or may not be relevant to say that my mom is 45, step-dad 43, me 16, and my sister 4). He never got much done, only some research from the library/online. My mom makes OK money, but not enough to cover the expenses of a day-care age child and a pre-uni teen. We have to constantly borrow money from our relatives, which my mom takes as a sign of defeat. He recently 'looked' for a job, and did not even land an interview. He doesn't give a shit about our financial crisis and insists he can make enough for a 500K house in less than 2 years. He even stole money from my and my sister's money (\\~$300 total before noticing since my sister does not use her money), so we had to store me and my sister's money in the bank. He denied the theft. He broke my computer and his own, costing over $1,000 to replace/fix. He denied this. Even worse, he forced my mom to spend 5,000 on a wedding this year, and keeps on pushing to spend more. I recently bought some $70 headphones, and he got mad. He accused me of wasting money (it was mine) and said i waste too much money on 'useless' extracurriculars and lessons. I snapped and told him to \"man up and get a job\". AITA?",

He doesn’t require physical help but more company and reminders to take his meds etc. My daughter and I will be touring several colleges out of state this summer. I have sold my fathers house went through decades of items to move him in with me plus all the work required to move him out of state to my house all on my own with zero help or offers from my brother or sister. My brother wants nothing to do with any of us because we are still in touch with his ex wife and mother of his children. My sister lives on her own by herself, no kids, no pets, no job, no SO nothing. She has a cleaning lady four days a week provided by the state because she has a handicap (CP) which just affects her walking pattern. And also because she is a hoarder and doesn’t clean up or throw anything away. I have cleaned her apartment too many times to count, spent God only knows how much money on her over the years for various things, bring her to my house for every holiday, take her out to eat and the movies every time I’m in town etc. finally for my question. I am considering telling her if she can’t get her house clean enough for our father to stay with her for a few days to give me a break from him and so I can go out of town with my daughter than I’m done with her.  It would cost her nothing and my father even said he would pay her some money each time he stays at her place, which she definitely could use. I think it’s extremely selfish for her not to at least try to help me. I have done everything she has ever asked of me and now I need her help. I even offered to help clean the place for him. She is the only family I have to ask and she knows this. She also knows I’ve been taking care of our father alone all this time. Please give me some advice! ",

      "description": "So it’s my 16th birthday today and to sum it up it’s been a bit shit. \nIt started with me waking up at 9 while my parents are at work (of course this is all good, I like my alone time anyway) I don’t see my mum till 11.\n\nI go into the lounge and she’s set a nice array of gifts on the table with balloons and a banner and she seems quite excited about it all, as was I. \n\nI open the presents and my Dad comes from work (he works in a live in restaurant) to watch a few and the presents are really nice and thoughtful and above and beyond necessary as I didn’t ask for anything. I thanked her profusely and gave her a hug and all the lot.\n\nAfter that, I didn’t see my mum properly until around 5, she seemed to be slightly snappy at me so I generally kept me distance until we went for dinner with my Dad. \n\nIt started off quiet and I suggested we play cards. My mum refused. I complained as I thought it would be fun and ignite some conversation I jokingly said ‘it’s my birthday’ and she then claimed she already spent loads of money on my birthday. \n\nThis put a slight damper on the evening but we managed to move past it when we had our meal, which was generally pretty poor. My mum was being kind of argumentative but I changed the subject when this happened and nothing erupted. \n\nWe went home and did the whole cake thing, she got angry at my dad for not singing and then she wanted a photo of us. I made a mistake with the photo and I offered to take another but she replied ‘if anything every happens you’ll wonder why we don’t have any photos’. After that my Dad cut the cake and they sat watching a TV drama which they know I hate. \n\nOn top of this, I didn’t get any birthday messages from the people I’d expect. I called it a night early and my mums upset that I’m being cold. \n\nOverall I just feel like my mum used her gifts as a compromise to treating me like it’s my birthday. A birthday is a once a year occurrence where it’s about me for a day and I don’t think it’s too much to expect a little extra kindness and attention but am I being ungrateful and over dramatic? \n\nTL;DR My birthday felt insincere due to not being treated as such and I think my mum used presents as a method of self-approval and as a replacement for genuine kindness, nostalgia and family bonding (as a birthday should be) ",

      "description": "So some back story, I was in Ecuador for school for 2 weeks. It was kinda stressful and definitely took a lot out of me.\n\n When I was coming home, my girlfriend asked if she could come over, I said yes, but I don't want to do anything crazy I just want to relax and have some downtime since I'd basically been doing things non stop for the past 2 weeks in Ecuador. Then she asks if my friend could come over as well because I live with my sister and she had been trying to set my sister and my friend up for a couple weeks. At first I said no because I knew I would be tired from traveling and plus I was stressed because I had gotten behind on a lot of work and my friend was not a very relaxed person, he is more of a do all kinds of crazy shit kinda person, breaking things and me constantly having to stop him from doing something stupid. But she pleaded and pleaded and said that if he came over she would help control him and that we wouldn't have to do anything too exciting we could just hang out on the porch etc. \n\nAnyway the day finally comes and so I get home and I see every one and then I go and sit down on the couch to relax cause I'd just been flying for roughly 16 hours. Everyone immediately starts ragging on me about how I'm being boring and I'm usually not like this and how we have to do something exciting. I look to my girlfriend because I thought she would step in to help me but no, she starts saying the same things and saying that I'm being a buzzkill. I tried to defend myself to no avail. Then, when I tried to talk to my girl, she won't talk to me because I wasn't excited enough to see her. By this point I was pretty pissed and when I unpacked a 110 dollar rum I had bought in Ecuador, every one flocked to me asking for a drink. But as I said I was pretty mad so I said no, there is beer in the fridge. My girlfriend cried because I was being mean but I honestly just felt betrayed. \n\nWas I a bit extreame? I felt that my actions were justified as I had previously told her multiple times I didn't want to do anything too insane.",

      "description": "I ordered -- or tried to order -- a new iPhone over the phone with a representative only to, according to her, have the computer glitch, so she cancelled the order...or so I thought. We ordered a second iPhone on the spot, only to have the first order end up going though. I used my boyfriend's credit card with his permission given and now both orders have come through, so he has been charged for both devices.\n\nI spoke to another representative a few days ago and they actually stopped the original iPhone order during transit and had it sent back to the shipper, which is who it's on its way to currently. My man will now have to wait up to ten days after the warehouse receives the 1st order to get a refund. This entire ordeal has had him super pissed off at me and T-Mobile and myself very stressed out to the point of tears due to his reaction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis reasoning is that it's my fault -- partially, at least -- because I \"should have known better\" than to trust what these people say, since we had another incident 2 years prior. My reasoning is that it was different this time because, unlike last time, I got consistent information with the 2 representatives, so I thought it was OK to go ahead and order another phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I should have waited a couple of days to make sure the charge for the 1st iPhone didn't go through but that never even occurred to me -- I honestly believed it got canceled and he was not going to be charged for it.\n\nI've been in tears more than once over this whole fiasco, mostly due to his rage. AITA? Is he? Perhaps we both are?",

My mom works two jobs so she isn't around often which is why my house is where we all meet. The problem begins with my one friend, let's call him Steve, and his tendency to break things and make a mess. Recently he's been going over the top, breaking things, making messes, and then not cleaning it up. For example, within the past week, he's broken my shower curtain bar, stained my carpet, broke a laundry drying rack, and left various dirty dishes around the house for me to clean up.\n\nThe problem begins with the fact that Steve has tried to take his own life. He's tried twice now and I don't want to do anything that could cause another attempt. I've mentioned to him multiple times that he can't keep making these messes and breaking things but he never listens. My mom is getting fed up to coming home with the house being a mess, and I don't know what to do.\n\nI'm considering not inviting him over to my house anymore, maybe just for a couple of weeks so he gets the message, but I don't want to be the cause of another attempt at his life.",

I decided I’d try and become friends with her whilst flirting and see what happened down the line and she seemed into it. We really hit it off and were constantly talking, even going out for lunch together from time to time. A few months later we even started FaceTiming/calling each other in the evenings and I begun to fall for her. \n\nA couple months later I decided the time was right to ask her on an official “date” I was sure she was going to say yes but when it came down to it she was very non committal in her answer - “I’m busy at the moment but maybe in a few weeks”  I thought that’s fair enough, not a no I’ll try again. We were still talking on a daily basis so I asked again a few weeks later and got a similar response.  \n\nI tried a final time and on the most recent occasion confessed to her that I have developed feelings for her and I couldn’t be her friend anymore. She told me that she “adored” me but she wasn’t sure what she wanted and is not in a place to have anything romantic currently. I like and care about her so much I just wanted to know if I had any chance at all but she would never say for sure. Finally I decided that it was too much for me and told her I had to stop talking to her. \n\nI feel awful and do miss talking to her but I can’t be her friend, I’ll always want something more...Am I the asshole?

      "description": "I'll start of with some context. I (23year old living in The Netherlands) got a job which requires me to travel to the UK every once in a while. About a year ago I met this girl (22 yo) there. We get to talk, we enjoy our time together, create a friendship and exchange contact information to stay in touch while I was back home. \n\nWe chat for hours daily. Sending random stuff, talking about work, school,..., Sometimes randomly flirting with eachother etc. During our chats she made clear however that I'm a good friend of her and that her feeling are platonic. No problem for me, since I wasn't that interested in her anyway. During another deep talk she mentioned she completely dislikes the idea of long term relationships.\n\nSome time passes by and as I help her through some hard moments, I started getting feelings for her. They were clearly one sided because I was still the 'best friend', so I kept quiet. Not much later (about 5 months ago) she (accidentally) let out that she recently met a guy and started working to a relationship. It had hurt, but what can I do...? After some talking she also reveals the guy is from Denmark (and came to the UK for some sort of conference) and it's basically a long distance relationship. This hits even harder because I thought the ldr (which she said she disliked) was something that would make it impossible between us. Clearly, she disliked the idea if it included me.\n\nAfter a month of hearing stuff of how nice the guy is etc (and me dying from the inside), they get into a fight and I have to spent another few weeks comforting her etc. She was completely broken and swore she would never get into a ldr again. (Bad luck for me I guess). After a bit she got back up and things seemed to be alright. It was back to our fun messages and talks without any mentions of other people.\n\nLast week I found through a friend and with the help of social media that the 2 are trying a ldr again. It was also clear she was hiding this from me. A pic of them together was posted on his Instagram on the same day she told me she was busy because she \"had to meet family\" that night. It just sucks, I don't know how to explain the feeling but I feel like it will continue as long as I'm with her. So I have pretty much decided I'm going to cut her off. (I'm pretty sure about this decision which is why I'm not posting it on the relationship_advice subreddit). The only thing I'm not sure about is how to do it. I feel like telling her my feelings might mess her up now that she's just gotten into a new relationship again, so I think I could just disappear from the picture and let the 2 be. (Also, if they get into a fight again, I don't want to be the one having to comfort her again in all honesty)\n\nTl; Dr. Crush is seeing other guys and clearly not interested in me. This kills me so I'm thinking of cutting her off without any explanation.",

He gets VERY angry when you move a car out of line, and so I generally try to respect “his” toys and leave them be. \n\nAnyway, he had a bunch of flash cards (numbers, alphabet, etc) and they were in a big messy pile. I was sorting them out while he was playing in the room with me (with other toys) when he came over to look at what I was doing. I could tell he wanted to mess up my neat piles, so I asked him very politely and seriously not to mess up my piles. He got a mischievous look on his face and then batted all the cards all over the room. I got up, walked over to his cars, and said “I asked you not to mess up my cards, and you did it anyway, so now I’m gonna mess up your cars” and I calmly scattered them all around. He flipped out and started crying, and I explained to him that if he wants people to respect his things, he needs to be nice to other people too.\n\nI was trying to use this as a teaching moment for him, but I honestly just feel bad about the whole thing in hindsight and wonder if I made the right move. In the moment, I felt like it was the most appropriate way of teaching a toddler, since his language and comprehension skills are not completely developed yet.

As I wasn’t expecting to have to cover them with no chance of being paid back. She then told me that maybe she should move out because she can’t handle having a roommate who is going to press her out over the rent.

      "description": "Backstory: I saw my brother cry for the first time not over death when I left for college in 2013. He has been in drugs and such since then but I think he has his life straighter at this point. Ever since I left he has a hatred towards me because I would side with my mom (single parent of 3 boys) and show her respect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to last month: I asked him to be part of my wedding this coming April (Groomsman). He said he would when I first proposed to my girlfriend in June 2018. Now we picked a wedding date not on his birthday because he threw a fit about it. So we picked out the following Friday, which turns out to be his girlfriend's 21st birthday. I said sorry but that's the date we picked and saved up to 8k when booking at this venue. So he is all mad about it. I told him if he wants to make a big deal about it great she doesn't have to come. And now he is not coming cause supposedly I don't want his girlfriend there.\n\nAITA for wanting to cut ties with him if he doesn't come to my wedding over a birthday party?",

      "description": "Context:\n\nI've been living in my apartment for about a year and a half now. About 3 months ago one of my roommates' (A) girlfriend moved in with us. She brought 3 guinea pigs and a rabbit. I didn't want the animals, but A really wanted her to move in, so I okay'ed it on the condition that they stay in their room 100% of the time. When she moved in, she took control of all cleaning and put up a board of chores that everyone must do once a week. I didn't think this was a bad idea, and wanted to avoid confrontation, but I thought it was strange and honestly kind of rude for a newcomer. She is generally very picky about how she wants the apartment environment. Prior to her moving in this was never an issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere I'm at right now: \n\nSometimes, in the morning, I'll leave dishes in the sink with the intention of doing them when I get home after class, or I'll leave dishes in the sink before I go to sleep and get them either in the morning or after class again. Regardless, I never leave dishes in the sink for more than 24 hours. She very regularly sends passive-aggressive texts about dirty dishes in the sink. Roommate A has just changed his patterns and now washes his dishes immediately after use, and Roommate B just doesn't want to deal with her shit so he does it too. I honestly respect that she wants to keep a clean apartment, but I also feel like I already compromised quite a bit for her, and I honestly think this should be a non-issue. ",

      "description": "So about a month and a half ago, my boyfriend (21M) and I (19F) broke up.  We'll call him EB for Ex-Boyfriend.  It was a pretty good relationship and we decided we wanted to try and stay friends, but first we decided to give each other space in order to heal up and move on. Before this point, I sometimes messaged him to see if he was doing okay, but I would end my messages with \"if you need me to keep giving you space, that's fine just let me know\" and we would have some short, but non hostile conversations. \n\nSo fast forward to the other day.  We reach out to check in and see how we are doing.  I ask him how his holiday was, he asks me how I am.  I tell him I got called into my sorority's disciplinary program for issues with alcohol, and making offensive jokes. (I know offensive jokes are only tasteful in some situations.  I wasn't making the jokes to any of the girls, but to my friends, and someone overheard them and reported it to the disciplinary program).  \n\nAfter I told him that, he sent some pretty hurtful messages.  This is how our conversation went (I'm shortening some of the messages, but I'm keeping the context and not trying to make the messages biased):\n\nMe: Yeah I got called into the disciplinary program again.  \nEB: Yeah dude, they don't want you around anymore.  They want to kick you out, but they don't have enough so they're waiting until you quit.   \nMe: It sucks, I really loved it when I first joined.  \nEB: I think they got sick of you tbh.  Your shitty behavior spirals out of control when you aren't being monitored.\n\nSo at this point, I was getting pretty upset.  He brought up a few very personal things, that I felt like were inappropriate for him to talk about since we are not dating anymore.  So,then I called him out on something that happened right before we broke up.  Basically, the last time we hung out, he really wanted to have sex.  I really didn't, but he was pretty persistent.  I was stern and said no, so he \\*did it himself\\* if you get my gist.  I told him that it felt like he knew he was going to break up, so he wanted to get one last round in.  EB's reply was this:\n\nEB: No, my balls were just full.  The fact we had a hot and cold sex life sucked a lot and caused me a ton of frustration in the relationship.  I figured it was considerate to rub one out rather than try to force myself on you, which I'm not sure was an unintentional pattern.  You treat people like things, and this is an example of that.\n\nI didn't reply to this.   I honestly felt pretty hurt by that.\n\nA few minutes later he says:  \nEB: All I have been is nice to you since the breakup, and you've only treated me like shit.  Never talk to me again.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for calling him out on something that really hurt me when we broke up?   ",

      "description": "Two months ago my girlfriend and our dog moved into a new apartment complex. We selected the unit that was adjacent to the dog park and were very excited about our new venture. On move in day we noticed a cat and food dish besides our stairs. I dismissed it thinking the cat belonged to a neighbor but our dog did not dismiss the knowledge of a cat outside.\n\nThat evening we went out for a walk to relax and the same cat was by our door. Two cats across the street and several under cars or on top of cars all checking out the new dog in the neighborhood. As we walked we noticed the same white styrofoam food dishes scattered around the buildings.\n\nFast forward: we learn there is a cat lady who does a great job caring for this quite large feral community. \n\nSo why is it a problem. We can not keep a blind or curtain on any window longer than a day. There are approximately 6 cats within site of our windows and/or that sit on our balcony railing and the dog go bonkers all day and night long. He chases from 1 window to the next. \n\nWe asked the lady the remove the dishes from our building and she did. They eat somewhere else and comeback here to rest and sleep. \n\nWe started filing complaints in the office and some organization is trapping the cats after 3 months. There are an estimated 20 cats on property. I feel like the asshole but there has been little serenity in my home since we moved in. I also feel horrible for the people that loved the cats.\n\nAITA",

As well as help at the customer service desk when they get busy, while also occasionaly getting on a regester to get my line down.\n\nNow reccently they've been pulling me to do loader jobs like cart gathering by my self(Over 85 carts), as well as making me go and unlock propane and grills which are jobs for a manager. \nThis is maing me fall behind on my work and then they get mad when the orders are not done in the morning. Making the opening coworker take care of it. Exspecting me to work over time hours for the loader jobs and my regular jobs without compensation. I cant stay over time because i have college work to do.\n\nNow AITA for wanting to tell my managers I dont want to be doing loader jobs and to stop pulling me away to do other things making me fall behind on my job?",

This is something i havent done since high school. I obliged because its not a moral or principle thing for me, just preferred trimming to shaving. I did it a few times and each time it resulted in severe irritation and discomfort no matter what methods i tried or tools i used. It was so bad that i went to my gyno and she was like \"please dont shave anymore.\"\n\nI stopped shaving since then and now my bf asked me (nicely) tonight if i could shave my pussy and my legs going forward. I havent shaved my legs because its been cold and i dont care but i said i would going forward, but i refused re: my pussy because of the irritation, time necessary to do it and the vulnerability to stds (we are nonmonogamous). He got kind of upset and said it was distracting for him when having sex because it caused \"friction.\" A fight ensued. We never fight, but its worth noting that one of the only other times we have has been about something similar.\n\nNow we are not talking and going to bed silently. AITA? ",

      "description": "Hey guys, gals &amp; all in between. My GF and I have been going out for 3 years, its been great for the most part dotted with the usual few tiffles every couple experiences once in a while.\nThe other night I was out in the company of an older couple who I know (I'm in my was, they their 50s), but she didn't yet. They wanted to meet her and so I offered her the invitation for when she had finished work. \nShe arrived down an hour or two later on with her friend and we all got talking, but she was being a little overpowering to say the least.She is quite a theatrical person in ways, and has been told on occasion that her voice is too loud.  I caught her a couple of times interrupting my older male friend mid-sentence to launch into what she had to say and I noticed his (mild, subdued) annoyance, compared to how he had been with me earlier on. \nAnyways the night goes on and we say our goodbyes, they tell her what a lovely girl she was and it was a pleasure to meet her.\nAs we are walking home together I try to bring up that I believed it was rude to talk over people and that she had been a bit domineering in the conversation. I must stress that I tried to approach it tentitavely as she has a tendency to take things to heart very easily. She flipped out, the argument persisted all the way home and she ended up sleeping on the couch. \nShe is still not over what I said (this was about 4 days ago) and I have apologized for hurting her feelings &amp; bought her roses ,but she claims that I am shattering her self-confidence and that she doesn't feel she knows how to speak around people now.\n\nI admit that this is not the first time i have let her know how i feel when i believe she is wrong.\nIm of the opinion that one of the most important things about relationships is that since you inevitably spend the most time with your other half you both have a duty to keep eachother in line and on the road to self-improvement. She feels that I am being too hard on her and \"she will never be good enough so we might as well call it quits\". Its tough to talk her out of these situations because when she is emotional i try to stay calm &amp; speak logically, in an attempt to bring her back down to my level, but she sees it as me being condescending.\nShe made a reasonable point that \"everyone\" talks over eachother, and tbh I have caught myself doing it out of excitement before but I immediately notice myself, she seems completely unaware of herself at times.\n\nAITA?",

I recently discovered this subreddit and want some honest feedback for how i handled the situation and how to better go about things in the future. Constructive Criticism is always a good thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially this girl and i started dating and were together for about a month. One night my friends and i went to a basketball game at our university and came back and started drinking and goofing off to have a good time.\n\nMy Gf was at her friends place drinking with his friend group. I didn't think much of it and was hoping that she was having a good time and was looking forward to seeing her for our date the next night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround midnight or so we stopped our on and off again friendly texting and i didn't think anything of it. I didn't hear anything from her again till around 1 the next day when she admitted she got drunk and spent the night on the guy friends couch at his apartment. She said she very heavily debated telling me as she knew what the optics of it looked like, but also swore nothing happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat made me beyond upset though was that she and her friend (who hadn't been drinking), drove all their other drunk friends back home. While she decided to go back to his place to spend the night instead of being dropped off. She said she did this because they are in the same club together and had an event the next morning and since his apartment is right next to campus it would be much easier to just spend the night and get up in the morning and go to it, rather than drive from her apartment which is a decent ways away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understood where she was coming from here but she still told me that the reason she didn't tell me the night off was that it would likely hurt my feelings. And then she decided to do it anyway and risk that. I felt like she overstepped huge boundaries my doing this and as a result i completely snapped at her cause of how upset i was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize i need to better control my emotions and be more calm in that scenario. I was the asshole for how i got really mad at it, i apologized, but i know apologies don't always make things right. We broke up the next day as we just couldn't see eye to eye on the getting drunk and sleeping at another guys apartment thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas I the asshole for getting upset at the drinking and falling asleep at another guys apartment?",

He visits his elderly parents every year over Christmas, and in the time we've been together, I've driven him to and from the airport for these trips. I don't really like driving, and find situations like airports, where there's lots of traffic and lane changes and crowded parking garages, particularly stressful. There's also a distance factor: my boyfriend lives 30-45 from the airport depending on traffic, and I live another 25 minutes away in the opposite direction. I could spend the night at his place and shorten the drive one way, but it's still a long drive home for me.  I'd like to get out of at least dropping him off this year - it's not like we do a big goodbye, I just pull up to the curb and he gets out.  But this does seem like the sort of thing a girlfriend is supposed to do and I feel guilty not wanting to do it.  ",

I get about three replies asking if they can keep it. One is J. I’m reluctant at first and say no. J claims that he not only suffers from sleep anxiety and would use CBD in it, but also that his dad has a nicotine addiction that is ruining his parents marriage. I agree, but am extremely reluctant. Eventually I cave and throw it back into the dumpster, telling him my mom found it.\n\nFast forward to now, and me and a friend are talking in a group chat. Somehow the idea comes around that it was a dumb idea. He starts getting extremely mad at me. Saying I do not understand (multiple people in my family have died or are dying from nicotine addictions, so I take a lot of offense to this) and that I was being a dick. I truly didn’t understand why he was being so mad. I point out that it was morally right, but still dumb. And he gets even more defensive. Things have kind of cooled off, but I’m now curious, AITA?",

      "description": "First, I’d like to say that my girl friend’s kid is great. She’s a sweet kid, who accepts me, so no problems there. My girlfriend and her ex share 50/50 custody of the kid, so she’s only around half the time as it is. The problem is that recently my girlfriend took a new job that requires her to travel out of town every two weeks. So now, whenever she is in town, it’s also her time to watch the kid. She and I recently moved in together, and it’s a pretty small place. The kid wants to hang out with us all the time (she’s 7), and my girlfriend lets her watch all of her kid tv shows and cartoons right in the living room where the main tv is. So basically, if I want to watch any adult or non-G-rated TV shows, I have to wait until the kid goes to sleep - which feels like never. Everything has to be baby friendly, so we can’t even have a normal adult discussion until the kid goes to bed, which, once again, seems like never. Every minute that I would normally spend with my girlfriend I now also must spend with her kid. We don’t get more than five minutes alone together lately because, right after the kid goes to bed, my girlfriend has to go to bed, too. So AITA for just wanting some time with her to myself without the kid around? Is it so wrong to want to watch a normal adult TV show, curse every once in a while, or slap my girl on the rear without having an audience - none of which I can currently do by the way because everything revolves around the baby. Is it so wrong of me to want to watch something on TV besides Mama Mia and Bobby Spongiepants or whoever? It was cute for maybe five minutes. Now It makes me want to hurl my TV out the window onto the asphalt five stories below. ",

It always pissed me off a bit but its just one part of him that I don't like so I deal with it. The more I hung out with his friends the more misogynistic jokes and stuff I found him laughing at and when I'd ask him about it he'd just say they're just jokes who cares?

      "description": "Alt account. This happened a couple of months ago but I’m still annoyed. \n\nSo my partner and I decided that we didn’t want a big first birthday party for our daughter because over the years we have been to many parties and they aren’t something we ever really enjoyed going to let alone want to host. So we decided to just have a fun day with our daughter the day before her birthday and then have family drop in and see us on the Saturday which was her actual birthday. \n\nMy partner works some weekends and I was invited to go to my brothers house for lunch on the day after his birthday being a Sunday and the invite was just for lunch and to give my daughter a present, my parents would also be going for lunch as they had a prior engagement on the Saturday and couldn’t make it to see us on her birthday (which I was fine with).  My partner was working and they knew this and it wasn’t a problem. \n\nSo I get to my brothers house and there is a balloon tied to the letter box which I didn’t think much of at first, when I get inside there are balloons everywhere and birthday banners and a full party setup. I was a bit taken aback because this was not what I would consider a  normal lunch as I was pitched. I had an alright time and left to go home. \n\nI am annoyed that they threw a party without telling me and also without my partner being there.  I feel as though that they have disregarded our choice to not have a party and throw one anyway to show us up. \n\n",

But it’s not like I complained and brought it up, I don’t ever like talking about it.

      "title": "AITA for not visiting my grandmother in the hospital or going to her funeral.",
      "description": "It’s a long story, so please bare with me. \n\nMy father has always been very possessive, manipulative, and materialistic. When I was young he would say things to me like, “You better come to lunch with your grandparents, because they’re very wealthy and if you don’t spend time with them they won’t put you in their will.” After my mother divorced him, basically anything he owned was made possible by my grandmother. When she bought a home with her new husband, she gave her previous home to my dad for free. This really tainted my relationship with both of them, because every interaction felt like a transaction. \n\nWhen I was a teenager, my mother projected a lot of her problems with my dad onto me. This made it very easy for my dad to manipulate me into hating her, because her accusations made me identify with my dad more and, having heard them all before, he knew just what to say to make her seem like the antagonist of my life. For this reason, I moved out of her house, and lived with my dad for most of High School. After I graduated, my older brother moved in and reignited abuse that I hadn’t suffered since before he moved out of my mothers house when I was in middle school. With this, I began to notice the ways in which my dad was irresponsible, and that it was making it harder for me to be self sufficient and go to college. I decided to move back in with my mother, because I knew she would be kind, but push my ass to be more productive. My father viewed this as a great betrayal. He kept gifts he’d given me for himself, including the truck he’d given me for my 16th birthday. He contacted me less and less. Even ignoring my birthdays. \n\nThis put a wedge between me and my grandmother. I began to think often of middle school and the months before my grandfather died. He had long been incontinent and grew increasingly senile. It made me sad and I pitied him. It was not my intention for him to notice, but he had. He asked me if I hated him, and it tore me apart. I was too young to understand my feelings or know how to respond. Before long, he died. As an adult, I resolved not to let my grandmother ever think I hated her because of what happened with my dad. I visited her on her birthday and told her what happened with grandpa, and that I would always love her. Still, part of me always remembered what my dad had said. I had to have a good relationship with my grandmother, or she wouldn’t put me in her will. Am I only doing this for that reason?\n\nSeveral months later, my brother contacted my mother, and told her that my grandmother was sick. By then she was already in the hospital, and couldn’t recognize him. My brother criticized me for not visiting her, but I didn’t want to see her like that. To me it didn’t serve any purpose to see her in pain. To look on her with pity, and know she didn’t recognize me. Months went by, and anytime I heard from my brother, through my mom, he would say she was still sick, maybe better in one area, but worse in another. \n\nUntil one day I received an email from my dad. She had died, several days before the date of the email, and the funeral was tomorrow. Ultimately I chose not go. My excuses were that it was short notice, im irreligious, my dad would lord his disapproval over me, and I was better off grieving alone. That same young part of me, instilled by my dad, wanted to go, because what if she left something for me in her will and I wasn’t there to claim it, but I refused to let that fantasy define our relationship, our final words together had been enough of a goodbye. I wouldn’t let my dad ruin a time that was meant for me to grieve and remember her for the love we shared. \n\nSince then my brother has said that he is depressed. He lives alone in the house that my dad vacated so he could move into my grandmother’s newer home. He believed that she would surely leave something for him in her will, because he’d spent so much time with her, and of course my dad had used the same manipulations on him, but apparently she left him nothing. Everything went to my dad. \n\nMy heart tells me I made the right choices, but I’ve always worried that maybe I really was a jerk. Especially after I saw a similar post where a guy didn’t want to go to his relatives funeral and everyone told him he was wrong and should go. \n\nI genuinely want to know what people think. Did I do the right thing, or AITA?\n\n",

You didn't have a problem ordering expensive food\". She looked shocked and said \"I just want to know. You're supposed to tip 20%\" and rolled her eyes. We walked to our cars and the whole way she didn't say anything. When I said bye she ignored me.

      "description": "Had an argument with a close friend of mine this evening and I just feel conflicted about the whole thing. \n\nFor some background, we are both 24 I'm female and he is male. We dated for a few years but our breakup last year was mutual. We both suffer from depression and that was the major catalyst in the end of our relationship although everything is still practically the same between except for the emotional stuff. He checks out of the conversation anytime it heads that way. \n\nAfter our break up, I moved back home about 1,000 miles away. We text a lot, and game a lot together when we have the free time. This week I've been laid up after a minor surgery and asked him to game with me since I was bored and unable to work for 5 days, or even walk around for that matter. Yesterday he said he would hop on in a bit but he had a stressful day so he was just relaxing. I chalked it up to just a long day at work and didn't think much of it.\n\n A few hours later he invited me to a game but he didn't actually want to do anything, he told me that his car had been towed earlier that day and he had been dealing with that  but didn't say much else. I got quiet and he asked if I was upset and I told him \"no\" but he could tell. I felt like a jerk because I had pestered him when he was dealing with other stuff but I just didn't know.  He apologized for inviting me for nothing and  he said that he might be back on later but I just logged out after he did and went to bed early. \n\nToday I texted him and apologized about my reaction the day before and he accepted my apology but he said that I had been hurtful towards him. I told him that I would just like a little more communication because I have no idea when he works or what's happening in his life. I had to ask his roommate to check in with him a couple weeks ago because he had been really depressed, anytime I asked how he was doing I just got \"eh\" as a response. This had gone on for over a week and I was worried and she had noticed it too.\n\nI expressed my concern about his depression and told him that he can't rely on weed all the time to fix things and ignoring his problems and shutting his friends out isn't going to do anything either. As hypocritical as I felt, I told him that he needs to see a therapist.\n\n He told me that he has been feeling introverted and doesn't want to make any commitments right now and that he doesn't owe me or anyone else a constant update. I told him that I didn't want any commitments I just want him to talk to me. I feel like I start  up a lot of our conversations and all I tend to get from him is an \"lol\" or \"nice\" unless we're talking about a subject he  brings up. A lot of it feels really one sided. (On the inside I was thinking \"I've been an introvert my whole life but I still make time to tell you what I've been up to\") \n\nHonestly, it wouldn't be such a big deal but he is my closest friend still, I live in the middle of nowhere and I work nights so my schedule never matches up with anyone near me, no one likes to make the drive up here and I can't spare the gas money to go to town all the time. My best friend ghosted me months ago so he is the person I'm closest to and most comfortable with talking to at length about anything. \n\nI feel awful and I'm sure he's mad at me but I don't believe I was being an asshole, or I at least hope I wasn't. I care about him and I'm worried about him. I am frustrated that I live so far away and I feel I'm just bothering him all the time but I just want to help him. I feel more useless than anything. \n\n",

      "description": "Please don’t answer this solely based on the title, I’ve rewritten it so many times and it still doesn’t quite portray what I’m trying to say.\n\nSo the story is basically this:\nHalf a year ago, I started working in a new place, and generally people were very welcoming, and in them 2 in particular, we’ll call them John and Jane.\nWe 3 got along really well and spending time together since all of us usually worked longer than the required hours.\n\nEarly on I caught on to the fact that John fancies Jane, it was clear by the way he was acting around her and by stuff he would say to me that would imply that he likes her. A lot.\nBeing a generally nice person, I told him my honest opinion that he should ask her out because the dynamic between him and Jane was pretty chill and I wanted to see them both happy.\n\nSadly, John’s feelings for Jane weren’t reciprocated and she rejected his offer. That’s the first complication in the story. John and Jane grow a bit more distant from here on, but still good friends.\n\nNow the second complication came in the form of me starting to develop interest in Jane. Now since I knew John was head over heels for her I decided I’d rather not act upon my interest. What happens next is us sitting in the cafeteria and the subject of how many girlfriends I’ve had comes around. John drops a bomb saying that if I wish I can get another one, and continues to explain that the dynamic between me and Jane seems like it’s going in that direction. I tell him that I can’t do it since he crushes on her. That’s when he tells me he tried and got rejected. At first I’m obviously upset for it not working between them but since he tells me it’s okay I decide I’ll find a chance and ask her out.\n\nSome time later an opportunity arises, and I ask Jane to join me for lunch on a day neither of us works, she agrees and everything seems great. A few days after this date I ask her out and she explains that while she had a lot of fun on the date, she is not in the right mindset for dating, and I am the one to understand her since we are both “careerists” and don’t have much time for personal life beyond work. We agree to stay good friends.\n\nWhen I tell this to John, he seems relieved, and honestly, that rejection kind of lifted a stone off my heart knowing I’m not going to burden him every time he sees us.\n\nMe and Jane stay really close, to the point friends of hers from other departments ask her if we’re dating. Same goes for my friends.\n\nSince John’s a close friend of both of us a lot of people, including our bosses, ask him that, curious about what he knows.\n\nNow since John’s a good friend of mine, I told him when we went to watch a concert together for example, or about the time she let me stay at hers after my then-landlord decided to change the lock on my apartment for no apparent reason.\n\nA few days ago, John decided to talk with me privately. The first of all he wanted to express how good am I of a friend to him and how he’s grateful for having me, but went on to the subject I somehow knew he’d get to: me and Jane.\nHe says seeing me and her so close aches him a bit, and that for a while now he has been jealous of me and there that deep inside his heart there’s a small bit of  hatred for me for being what he couldn’t with the girl who has been the first one to actually love. John knows I’ve been rejected by her just as he was, but he still insists the one day me and her are going to be together. I apologize, knowing it won’t change anything but still feeling I owe it to him.\n\nI definitely don’t think he’s an asshole for feeling the way he does, because having your first crush on someone is a mighty feeling and I know I’m at least a bit of an asshole for not being more sensitive around him when talking about it.\n\nNow those of you that have read it all and endured through my awful writing, do you guys think I’m an asshole or is it just me who feels like a dick since my conversation a few days ago with John?\nI know at the end of the day Jane’s a human and she will decide what shape her romantic life takes, but this whole story really makes me feel bad because the way John feels and I wanted to know if it’s just a passing feeling or if I should act to make it up to him somehow.",

I told my wife that me and my workers are having dinner out and going to go back to my manager’s condo unit to get drinks afterwards. My manager lives in the same condo as I do so it’s pretty much a convenience. When we went for dinner, my manager said that he wasn’t able to tidy up his condo unit hence we had to get drinks elsewhere. We went some place nearby (something like 5-8km away from the condo) to get drinks. My wife asks me where I was and told her what the change of plans had been. All of a sudden, she berates me about being unfair and being a liar.    \n\nSo, AITA for doing this? I didn’t go home late though so I thought everything would be fine.",

      "description": "Sorry if the formatting sucks, I’m on mobile. \n\nMy boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been deciding what we want to do for the Super Bowl for the past couple days and we decided on going to my dads house. I’m super laid back so I didn’t really care what we did. After we decided, we hung out all morning and had a fantastic time just drinking coffee and hanging out, per usual. About 5 hours before the game started he said he was going to take a nap before the game and asked me to wake him up an hour before kick off so he could get ready and we could leave our place with some extra time to get to our destination before kick off. I agreed and he proceeded to go take a nap. \n\nFast forward a couple of hours, I set a timer for myself (I’m reading a really good book and I get pretty sucked in) so I know when to get him up. I know that he’s a deep sleeper so I gave myself enough time to actually wake him up. I go in, lovingly wake him and tell him that if he wants to go he had to get up and get ready. He sits up, looks me in the eyes, and says that he decided he didn’t want to leave and that he would rather sleep. Okay, that’s fine, I said I didn’t care if we watched it at home anyway. I’m a big Pittsburgh fan so I didn’t really want to see the pats get another ring anyway. He goes back to sleep. \n\nAn hour later I go in to let him know that it’s kickoff. He springs up and asks me why we didn’t leave. I told him what he said to me an hour earlier, and he freaks out that I listened to him. He continues to say that I am blaming him for not going even though I said from the beginning I don’t care what we do. We get in a huge argument that ends with me being upset because he said some things to hurt my feelings but he expects me to apologize for blaming him for us not leaving on time. \n\nSo redditsphere...

She got off early and said she was on her way, as I hadn't planned for her to get off early we weren't there. She said it's fine, her boyfriend who was going to drop her off had somewhere to be but she was fine sitting in the hallway outside my apartment and playing with the cat that roams the halls very often. I then tried to kind of rush my boyfriend out of the store, not terrible just telling him maybe we should head out soon, but he was talking to a seller about books. However he's not a big reader, he's more into audio books so I thought it was pretty unlikely the end of their conversation would end up in  purchase for him. However he continued to let her lead him to different spots of the store so she could talk about her personal book recommendations and even went to the computer to see if a book she was talking about was in store. It was so we stood around talking about it, after we discovered he least owned it for years and hadn't read it. But after they talked about the book the seller said she'd let us go since she knew we had someone waiting on us. Once in the car I found out he was mad because I wouldn't let him talk to her longer. Am I the asshole for rushing him out because I had a friend wanting on me? ",

I got an extra role but that's on me for not showing up to rehearsals last year.\nI know a few special kids, being one myself, who really wanted to audition but didn't show up to any of the workshops, which was required for you to audition no matter what (I even had to stay late on my birthday for one). Despite showing up to none of the workshops, they still got parts. They just got in effortlessly when there are people who went to every workshop and were so excited to get into the play and didn't. I find it annoying.\nI also noticed one special kid follows every teacher around and practically stalks them (he admitted to stalking one) yet faces no consequences. I find that kinda weird too.\nKeep in mind, being a special kid I get detentions for skipping a special ed class once when I know kids who have skipped it since the beginning of the year and face no consequences. This has happened with multiple other things. I know kids who are getting straight D's who still do chorus and band yet I'm banned from both for getting B's and C's.\nTLDR; AITA for being angry at the way my school is so unfair with the way they treat special ed kids?",

      "description": "I (**23M**) match with a girl (**20F**) on Bumble near my town, she has a pixie cut and it seems like we have things in common and she’s cute. Turns out she’s actually from Pennsylvania and doesn’t have a car.\n\nEventually we agree on a night I can drive the (1 hour 15 minutes to her house) to pick her up to go to her “favorite Thai restaurant”. I make the 1 hour 15 min drive over to pick her up. As soon as she gets in the car she has a terribly awful smell to her. I immediately realize that I don’t feel physically attracted to her, but am still willing to just have a fun dinner. \n\nAnyway, I drive 20 minutes from her house to the restaurant. We sit down in this small Thai restaurant (which had decent food!) at a table probably 3-4 feet away from another couple. We look at the menu thinking about what to get. Out of NOWHERE she exclaims that we are just \"**Not gonna work out.** We can go to a cheaper restaurant or you can just drop me off.\"\n\nI'm confused as fuck as it's only been 5 minutes. She then explains that I don't have the same aura as her, my aura is too rigid, that she's deep and most people aren't as \"deep\" as her, and that she couldn't ever possibly date someone who doesn't appreciate music as much as her. At first, I laughed nervously because I truly believed she might've been kidding and she just had a weird sense of humor. So I tell her, let's just eat...we're already here (AND I drove an hour+ to get here! Why not at least enjoy each other's company as friends/acquaintances?)\n\nFinally after the awkward forced conversations, I ask the waiter for separate checks. She then flips out on me saying, \"Are you **fucking SERIOUS?**! I didn't bring my wallet.\" I am taken aback and apologize if I did something to upset her. She says, \"You better be fucking sorry. Are you **TRYING** to waste **MY** fucking time?\" (Wasting her time being in her parents house without a car...?) I still am so stunned that at that point I just apologize and explain that since we never established who was gonna pay and because she made it clear nothing is gonna happen I thought it would be reasonable to ask for separate checks. I still try apologizing again and tell her I only had the best intentions...saying absolutely nothing mean or negative.\n\nShe tells me that I said in a text I would pay (not true), then tells me she'll Venmo me. I go to drop her off and try one last to not end on a bad note. She then tells me, \"Maybe next time you should talk to your date about who's going to pay. I'm sorry I'm so INTENSE.\" To which I reply as she shuts my car door, \"*Good luck.*\"\n\n**ALSO**: She claimed to be \"uber feminist.\" I tried to text her with my Venmo info, turns out she blocked me.\n\n**TL;DR**: Drove an hour+ to go on a first date with a girl, she tells me within first 5 minutes that it’s not gonna work because we have different \"auras\". Then flips out on me after I ask the waiter for separate checks.",

      "title": "AITA for demanding an apology from my boyfriend's friend for pressuring me into professing my feelings?",
      "description": "My boyfriend of six months has this friend (we'll call him Joe) who has always had an affinity for pushing my buttons. Not an issue in the least; I am not sensitive to that kind of thing, and I enjoy the banter every once in a while. One habit Joe has gotten into recently that I like much less is that he likes to put me on the spot about my relationship in front of a group of people. Sometimes he'll do it to both boyfriend and me. The first time he did it was very early on in our relationship when we were still defining things. We were out with a group and he asked us \"so, are you guys boyfriend and girlfriend now or what?\" I was mildly annoyed - it wasn't his business, and the group setting was the wrong choice, but I easily let it go.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree weeks ago, Joe and I and some other friends of boyfriend's were at dinner. There are six of us sitting in a booth. Boyfriend gets up to go to the bar. Joe immediately starts with the questions - how are things going, are you happy, etc. I play along. Then Joe takes it up a notch and goes, \"do you love him?\" That makes me really uncomfortable - of course, Joe does not know this, but that sentiment wasn't something I'd shared with boyfriend and I wasn't ready to do so. I am sure I'm making some weird face in response, and Joe goes, \"Oh, you do, huh?\" All eyes are on me, I feel cornered, so I admit to it and say that boyfriend doesn't know so would he please not say anything. \"You should tell him,\" Joe says. \"Tell him tonight.\" Boyfriend comes back from the bar right then, so the subject is dropped. Boyfriend notices what is apparently a weird look on my face. (I'm not an all-star poker player, if that' s not apparent.) \"What's up?\" he asks. I brush it off. He asks again. I mutter something about feelings. \"You might as well just say it,\" boyfriend says. So.....I do. My idiot self quietly professes my love in front of four other people (who, for the record, are not listening and do not know what is going on). Long story short, it was a bad night. Nuclear meltdown in front of all these people. Not a good look for me. I was embarrassed and ashamed at my own behavior, but also REALLY pissed at Joe. I couldn't help thinking this wouldn't have happened if not for him. I'd had enough of this behavior, and now it was affecting my relationship in a negative way. Joe texted boyfriend later that night and asked if everything was okay. Boyfriend told Joe what happened (a disclosure I was unhappy about, so that was a whole other thing between us). I told boyfriend I intended to ask Joe for an apology next time I saw him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to last night. We are at a Christmas party. Joe is there. \"I need to talk to him,\" I say to boyfriend. \"I've got to get this out.\" I wait until I've accumulated some liquid courage (my first misstep). Up until that point, Joe is acting very nonchalant, greeted me normally and made some conversation about other things. I ask Joe if we can chat for a couple minutes just the two of us. He agrees, so I pull him to the side. I just come right out and say he owes me an apology. I say this calmly. He gives me an incredulous look. \"For what?\" he seems to genuinely wonder. I tell him it wasn't his place to do what he did, to put me on the spot like that. I tell him he is making my relationship harder, and that my feelings are none of his business. He gets very irritated. \"I didn't make you do anything,\" he says. \"These were all your decisions. If he doesn't love you, that's not my fault.\" This really gets me going. I am no longer calm. I start screaming at him, saying how out of line he is and how he needs to treat me with more respect. He screams back, says he has no reason to apologize, that I'm ridiculous for even asking, and eventually just walks away. I am astounded and very hurt. I honestly expected him to apologize immediately, but maybe I am just way off the mark on who's in the wrong here. Is he right? Am I just projecting my own issues onto him ...like an asshole? ",

      "description": "We are Japanese/Korean and I feel in general Asians are typically against tattoos. My family fits right in that category and is not a fan of them but I didn't find out just how strongly my mom was against it until after I got my first.\n\nI got my first tattoo with my mom when I was 17. I got a few butterflies on my shoulder, and she got the same on her right butt cheek. She got it there because she didn't want my grandma to ever find out about it. My grandma actually found out a couple months later at the sauna and she gave disapproving eyes but didn't make anything of it. This whole matching tattoo was actually my moms idea that she brought up randomly when we were hanging out. Right after we got our tattoos, before we even left the shop, she made me promise to never get any more tattoos. I was hesitant but I agreed just to get her off my back.\n\nAnyway, I'm 26 now with quite a few more tattoos that I've gotten since moving out many years ago. I feel really scummy about it but I believe it's my body and I have the final say with what I do with it, despite our promise. Every single tattoo I've gotten since then I've told my mom about my plans first in person because I don't want my mom to find out randomly and be surprised. All my tattoos so far have so much personal meaning to me so it hurts knowing she hates them. \n\nEvery single time I plan on discussing with my mom about future tattoos my heart sinks to my stomach and I feel absolutely sick and anxious beforehand because I know how she'll react. She tells me every time \"You promised me! Oh my gosh, you're gonna be one of THOSE people covered in tattoos\" with such disappointment in her eyes then she'll give me the silent treatment for a while.\n\nEarlier today I told her about my plans to get a matching tattoo with my husband next month and she was more upset than she's ever been, probably because all my other tattoos are easily hide-able and this would be on my forearm. She asked me how I can keep betraying her and intentionally hurting her. How would I feel if my son purposefully went out of his way to hurt and disobey me?\n\nObviously I would be absolutely devastated if my son intentionally hurt me in the future (he's only 2 and a half now). I don't feel this is a situation where I'm trying to intentionally hurt her though, but I know she see's it that way.\n\nI don't think it was a fair promise to make at such a young age and about my body no less, but I still feel like such a asshole each and every time I break it. I don't know. AITA? ",

For the past three months, I have run a Super Smash Bros Tournament every meeting. We usually have an \"on week\", with a ranked singles tournament, and an \"off week,\" with a different type of tournament. Usually, it's just unranked doubles.\n    \nThis week, I decided that we should play something that isn't smash. No one minded the change. The suggestion of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe came up, and plenty of people loved it. This was great, because I am planning on helping the class above me run a fundraiser with a Super Smash Bros bracket and a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bracket. This, however, also lead to the problem at hand.\n     \nI posted my idea on how a tournament should be run, and said that that's how I am going to run it. I got a response from one of the freshman, saying that a tournament was stupid and \"why can't we just play 12 player FFA\". After explaining my reasonings, mainly how I need practice running a Mario Kart tournament, one of the other freshman say that the concept I came up with had never been done because it was stupid.\n      \nI've left them an open challenge, saying that I will tell them the resources we will have for the fundraiser, and they can come up with a ruleset and it will be put to a vote. They have yet to respond. Am I the asshole for defending my method of tournament?\n     \nTL;DR : I'm the school's go to tournament organizer.

I start to mention how there's a lot extra and she should go ahead and help herself. Instantly she mentions how I *must* wear pants so the other room mates and neighbors do not see. She also has family coming in for a few days here soon and \"I need not be around because they have children\". The other tenants have already taken notice, don't seem to mind as I am always respectful and courteous of them/the house and always provide decent encounters and conversation.\n\nI blew her off at this point! \"Yeah, I'll do what I can\" and put the Turkey back up out of hands reach. Proceeded to go into my room and close the door on her still trying to day whatever she was saying to me.\n\nIcing on the cake was when I texted my family about the situation, they responded that they don't mind getting me more pants? Am I missing something?\n",

      "description": "So my \"best\" friend (lets call her Em) and I are both in the same veterinary program (were both 21 F). The instructors sometimes assign us to do some extra duties for our facility like laundry, office duties, and cleaning. I've had a really rough week. I learned over the weekend that one of my family friends was in the hospital with 4th stage cancer that had spread to her brain. To make my situation worse, my sick friend was in the palliative care unit at the hospital where my mother works (who frequently visits her as well). I haven't spoken to my mother in 2 years since I ran away from her abuse and manipulation. So I was in a really stressful spot as I planned my visit to the hospital. I had two very embarrassing breakdowns at school this week, and \"Em\" saw them both. My instructors recommended I take some time off to gather myself, and I took that recommendation and took the week off. \"Em\" on the other hand lives at home with her father who loves her unconditionally. I really wish she would understand how great that is. I don't have that kind of luxury. Because of my living situation I obviously qualify for financial aid...but she complains when she doesn't receive financial aid even though its for people who really desperately need it. She seems to complain at petty things- the fact that she cant get A+ in all her courses (she only gets A's), how stressed she is that the program is unorganized, how she thinks the instructors/classmates hate her. In my eyes, its petty. But as a friend I never tell her that. I just sympathize. Even when its not genuine. I understand its not fair to compare our problems, so that's why I don't say anything. But its hard for me not feel annoyed. SO anyways. Both Em and I were assigned cleaning duties this week. I wasn't in school this week, and I figured that since my best friend Em knows what I'm going through, she would be happy to cover for me and do my part (which isn't much work, just some light cleaning and restocking of items). Right? Wrong. I know my friend is bad in helping me emotionally through my problems, cause she just doesn't understand the pain of most of my situations, but she was actually pissed at me for not helping her clean. like actually so pissed. She even said shes not going to help me in a video assignment we agreed to help eachother in.. She flat out said \"TBH, I dont want to help you\". She also said \"We're all going through stuff.\" Correct. Everyone is going through stuff, but I figured as my best friend she wouldn't mind cleaning knowing I was having a really rough week at home. I don't feel like the asshole. But shes making me think I should be. Am I the asshole? Any advice on a situation like this? ",

      "description": "Here is a little background info before I get into the actual incident. Every day my boss walks past my office and turns my lights on after i have asked him repeatedly not to. This has been on going for over 2 years. Its not like I am sitting in the dark, my office has 2 large windows and plenty of natural light coming in. The lights just bother my eyes and I find it annoying to have them on while the sun is still out. He flips on the lights whenever he walks by and says, \" you shouldn't work in the dark, its bad for your eyes\". This happens more than once a day sometimes. I just get up and turn them back off after he walks away.\n\nSo yesterday i was already frustrated with another employee that has been making a lot of mistakes that i then need to clean up and do damage control with the customers that are being affected. This effectively doubles my work load for the day. I had a headache already from this and then he walked by and turned my lights on and said, \" it's bad for your eyes to work in the dark\". So at that point i had enough shit to deal with and I snapped at him, \" I am an adult I can decide what level of lighting is appropriate for myself. If I need a babysitter to tell me something like this why do you trust me to get my job done and fix other peoples dumb ass mistakes with minimal oversight. Turn the fucking lights back off I have a headache and just dont need to deal with this on top of it.\" He said no, then told me to come see him at the end of the day. I just got up and turned the lights off like usual and went about my day.\n\nWe had a discussion at the end of the day and he said that I couldnt speak to him like that whether or not any other employees were around and that I needed to respect him as my boss. I agreed and said that he also needed to respect me as an employee and as a person. \n\nThat's where it was left, and things seem to be normal as we are both pretty reasonable and we both came to an agreement. When i told other people they said I was being a dick and should have just let it go. This is my usual course of action he just happened to do it when I was having a bad day already and that was just the straw that broke the camels back. I agree that it probably wasnt the best decision to do it considering he is my boss but AITA for it?",

But eventually, I realized he was using soft manipulation techniques on me like saying my name a lot and guilting me into doing certain things. But I didn't really care, because he was so sweet and charming. But then we started talking about politics and mentioned David Irving (the holocaust denier) an I blocked him there and then. But I felt so guilty about it because it occurred to me that some people read books that they really disagree with just to know about history-- for example, I'll have to read a bunch of WWII documents in AP World history.\n\nSo I unblocked him today and messaged him. It was going well and he said Irving was a crackhead. It was actually quite nice, but then he mentioned he likes the idea of British Fascism because it's \"way different than other European fascism\" I waited a little while and blocked him. I feel bad because I didn't even bother to argue against him or change his mind (something I'm very good at) and I just ran away. Am I the asshole?",

I met my current gf at my friends birthday just randomly ad we were at several bars and she has been amazing the last couple of years I have no complaints as she seems to understand me. However I have joined a therapy group designed for men in the town we live in and so far I have just been telling her I am going to another martial arts class, I dont know why I can't tell her but I am scared to due to my past however I do love her and want to be honest so it makes me feel really guilty not telling her my group has been of no help in this matter so please tell me reddit if I am the asshole here ",

      "title": "AITA for telling his wife that he got me pregnant, and for reporting him so he’ll lose his medical license?",
      "description": "Very long, telenovela-type story here. I meet a guy off Tinder, he’s an out-of-town medical resident visiting my city on a hospital rotation. We meet up a few times before he returns home (400 km away). I figure that’s that but he continues to text me daily and asks me to come visit him. So I do and I very stupidly have unprotected sex with him and take plan B the next day. He’s a doctor and I basically trust his judgement. \n\nFast forward a few weeks later and I’m at my own doctor for a routine visit. She gets me to pee in a cup and I am shocked to find out I’m pregnant. At this point me and Tinder guy are still texting 20x a day. I call him immediately and tell him the news. \n\nHim: Well, you have to abort it right away.\nMe: And what if I decide to keep it?\nHim: Then never speak to me again. I don’t want to know the child exists. \n\nClearly I should have ended contact with him then and there, but I was scared, hormonal and hopeful he would change his mind. We already have plans for me to visit him another weekend so I do so. During my visit he puts it in my head that we could have a long, happy relationship together - if I have the abortion. The cards are already stacked against me raising a child on my own so eventually I agree to terminate. \n\nSurprising no one but me, he ends it with me (over the phone) the day after the procedure. He cites work as the reason, saying he’s already on probation for some unethical stuff and he needs to focus on his residency. I accept the news calmly but start wondering what the hell this guy is up to. I look up his public record but can’t find his registration information anywhere. My friend helps and manages to dig up the fact that Tinder guy gave me a fake name, lied about his age and oh yeah — he’s married. I call him to confront him. \n\nMe: How would your wife feel if she knew about this? \nHim: You mean my ex? Yeah we’re separated. Go ahead and tell her. She probably won’t want to reconcile with me but whatever. \nMe: And what about your residency? What about your probation? What if I reported that you swipe Percocet and submit your own urine under a patient’s name so you can get faster test results? \nHim: Please don’t do that. (He starts crying) \n\nSo I make the decision to call his wife’s office and leave a message with my name. She calls back thinking it’s work related. I tell her I want to talk to her about her husband, and she can call me from a private number if she wants to discuss it further. Basically I’m putting the ball in her court. Next thing I know, Tinder guy is calling me in a rage saying that I hurt his wife’s feelings, they’re back together and he told her everything. (Btw this is 2 days after he said they were separated.) I made her cry at work and he’s going to file a restraining order against me. \n\nI tell him not to worry, the next time he hears from me will be through a formal report. I file the complaint about his unethical dealings (faking his identity, taking narcotics from work, falsifying test results) and now I’m waiting for the state licensing board to schedule a hearing. \n\nSo AITA for basically trying to ruin this guy’s life? On the one hand, his drug smuggling and lies didn’t bother me while we were seeing each other, so clearly I didn’t think they were THAT unethical. So I feel very conflicted having reported him out of spite (and probably misplaced hormonal feelings). On the other hand, he’s already on probation for “something else,” his ability to manipulate and lie to people is pretty worrying in a neurosurgeon, and it would be irresponsible not to report what I knew. \n\nTL, DR: Met a doctor guy on Tinder. He lied to me, got me pregnant and broke up with me after the abortion. I contact his wife and report his shady dealings to the medical licensing board. ",

      "description": "Context: I am male to female transgender and do go by a name other than my legal name.\n\nI have been out of the closet for nearly two years this coming March and have been using the name Valerie since October a year and a half ago. I am far from passing but starting medical treatments as soon as this Thursday. Most of the time people are pretty good about using my name and pronouns and I'm pretty forgiving of slip ups depending on the situation but I had one person who kept using my deadname \"by mistake\". \n\nBack in August I finally decided I wouldn't even respond to my deadname, unless it was someone who I wasn't out to yet, so I tried to ignore this person as long as I could. This weekend I snapped, I was out shopping for clothes with some friends in a forever 21 and she kept calling me 'he' and 'him'. I yelled at them in the store and put the things I had grabbed back before storming back out to drive home.\n\nWhen I got home I started feeling really guilty because I've never really gotten so angry at anyone to the point of causing a scene. I haven't talked to her since nor have I heard from most of the other people I was out with, the one that has talked to me said it was pretty shitty of me so I decided to post here.",

I asked my mom (politely) to ask them for receipts to get them returned so I could buy something else and my mom all of a sudden lost it.

      "description": "So this happened 2 days ago while I was working at a restuarant, a couple came in about an hour before we closed around 9pm so it wasnt busy and I was able to chat with them, she was extremely talkative from the second she came through the door until she sat down at the table, she was with a guy that had is arm around kinda lower hip area so I assumed they were on a date or something. I was busy working on side work and I noticed them leaving so I told them to have a good night, then she walked up to me and handed me a piece of paper, I had a feeling it was going to have a number on it but it also had a note saying \"you were the best part of the date I'm on...lol. would like to see you again:)\" with her name and phone number on it. I was pretty surprised that she would do that in front of her date so I just kinda stood there for a min, then one of my co workers came up to me and told me this girl told her date she was going to leave her number for me. I still have the note but I'm not planning on messaging her back, I've been cheated on twice and that's never fun, even if you are going on a first date with someone I feel like that is such a shitty thing to do to someone. Should I still message her saying I'm not interested?\n\nNot a throwaway so I'll be ready to answer any question and take any criticism. Thank you for your time.",

      "description": "My best friend started developing her eating disorder around September of 2017 after some events happened. Her eating disorder got pretty bad but she began to recover with the help of a doctor around April of 2018. In November of 2018 she started an account to document her progress in recovery. She accidentally pressed the \"Confirm\" button for linking her new account to her contacts. I happened to find it in my suggested friends list, but I didn't follow her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I talked to her about and asked her if she would like me to simply block the account and act like it never existed. She said yes, so I blocked it on my main account. She was also glad that I had told her she accidentally linked it to her number, since she didn't want other people from our school to find out about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, I'm sometimes really concerned about her. I had an account that was private and had zero followers, and I would block everyone from our school on it. I would use it to rant/vent/write journal entries in it. I started to use it to check up on her account. It was usually just rants and pictures of food she ate that made her out of her comfort zone. I was really proud of her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe also had a tellonym (a website that lets you anonymously send people questions and they publicly answer it) and I asked her if she liked anyone. I personally have had a little crush on her that's on and off, but I was just curious. I was thought that she might've been into me, but turns out she liked another dude. I broke my own heart. After that, I just kind of stopped trying to drop hints that I would like to date her. I also felt guilty that I had taken advantage of her trust like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "So a little bit of background here, I've known my friend since 5th grade (currently in 11th) and we've had a on again off again relationship. I've known his ex since I was little, and I hung out with her and her small friendgroup this summer. She's really nice and actually cares about people. So my friend was staying overnight one night and told me that he was going to ask her out that night. I had known about his crush on her for a while as we had talked about it a lot before, and I kept encouraging him to do it because it was obvious they had feelings for each other. So he asked her out and she said yes, and that happened around 2 months ago. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, where he was in the school play, where he would interact with another girl, and that's how they met. So my friend asked his girlfriend to prom around the same timeframe, and she accepted. So 2 sundays ago, him and this girl (not girlfriend) went to a party and got super drunk. They immediately hit it off and became \"really good friends\". I was perfectly alright with this, and felt good for him that he had made a really good friend. Well, it turns out that when I was filming a video on saturday, I was told that he had broken up with her very suddenly, and that he had cheated on her (which was incorrect). I immediately tried calling him, didn't get an answer, but he texted me and I asked about what happened and then we left it at that. He didn't want to admit it, but he broke up with her to go date this other girl that he had talked to for a week. I texted his ex to say that I felt sorry for her and what he had done to her, and she said that it was super sudden and she had no idea it was coming. He asked me the next day if I supported his decision, and I said that I thought it was an irrational decision based on getting drunk with this girl that he had not even talked to prior. I was just pretty upset that he would throw away this sweet girl that he had been \"so in love with\" and had been dating for 3 months for someone he met when he was drunk and had talked to for a week. I have stopped trying to make conversation with him as much (as he never starts any) and he has made no attempt to talk about it with me, even though he told me he would. I haven't called him an asshole or anythinf, but imo, that was incredibly wrong to do, especially since he always told me how much he loved her and how she made him so happy. AITA here? \n\n(I forgot to add that at the same party, he said \"Man, I love [her name] so much\" to my other friend. They were still dating at the time).",

      "description": "Apologies for length (tldr at the end) and here’s some backstory- L and I have been friends for a couple years, and it was only when I moved to a different state that things got weird. \n\nIt was super hard on L because I was pretty much the only friend he was willing to leave the house for and he was always telling me he wished we’d become roommates. I was doing great after I moved but every time I mentioned my new job, home, friends, etc L would either make it about him or just ignore it completely and go on about how depressed he was. That was my first red flag that this friendship maybe wasn’t as supportive as I thought. \n\nI went back to visit a couple weeks ago and my friend let me stay at her place while she was on vacation.  She invited L to stay over for a couple nights so he could have a little staycation, which was so incredibly kind of her considering she’s only met him once. L was ungrateful and negative the whole time. The second he walked in, he started complaining about every little thing. Her decor, the dog fur on the couch, the lack of food in the fridge, the closet doors didn’t shut right- the list goes on. \n\nI was pissed considering she let him stay for free and his constant whining made me not want to spend a second with him. He barely asked about my life and just complained endlessly about his. I paid for our food and Ubers because he was broke and I didn’t get a thank you. I brought back a few pieces of cake from a bakery and he ate all of them without asking. He didn’t even apologize when I told him I was going to save one for myself. \n\nI should have spoken up but he was doing so shitty mental health wise that I didn’t want him to feel bad about himself. Instead, I flew back home like nothing was wrong and started ignoring his messages. But then he sent me a flurry of texts about how he really needed help and was considering treatment programs but didn’t know where to start. That’s when I started feeling super guilty but still didn’t reply. I haven’t sent anything back for 3 weeks and don’t plan to. A break from talking to him made me realize that a lot of our friendship was just him using me. But I know it sucks to have a good friend stop talking to you out of nowhere. \n\nAITA for resorting to childish behavior and ghosting him? \n\nTLDR; stopped replying to a friend after he whined and complained during our vacation. I feel bad because he has bad mental health issues. AITA?",

      "description": "There’s a guy in my class who’s been in a few of my classes for the past year. We are not friends by any means, I simply just know of him because he’s been in my classes.\n\nWe have 2 classes together this semester, and he has this annoying habit that is really starting to get on my nerves. Me and my friend will be having a conversation between the two of us (before class) that has absolutely nothing to do with him, and EVERY SINGLE CLASS PERIOD he butts into our conversation and goes, “what? What are you talking abut?” Most of the time we are talking about a class he isn’t even in. One day we were literally on the opposite side of the room as him discussing a test we got back, and he shouts “Which question are you talking about??” Another day we were discussing hotel options for my friends vacation and from across the room he goes “What??” Like dude, I’m not talking to you!! I’m getting frustrated because I can never have a conversation with my friend without him listening to us and I feel like I have no privacy.  I’ve never said anything to him besides “oh, nothing” or “we’re talking about a different class” but I’m about to nicely just say “oh I wasn’t talking to you”\n\nIt just drives me crazy that he constantly eavesdrops in our conversations and tries to butt in. \n\nTl;dr\nAITA: guy in my class constantly eavesdrops on my and my friends conversations, tries to butt into every conversation we have when it has nothing to do with him.

      "description": "This is gonna be a long post, so please skip to the bottom if you want a tl;dr.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have this friend, Sam, who I have known since high school (we are 24 now). Sam is a fun person to be around and we share a lot of interests, but he also takes advantage of people and tries to be the center of attention all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam is always broke because he is addicted to video games, smokes weed and is unemployed. Sam guilts people into driving him places, buying him food + covering his entrance fees. If anyone refuses, he whines and says that it's not his fault that he doesn't have a job because of school. This is true, but everyone in my friend group has gone to school, and we all worked or accepted that we didn't have disposable income to spend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe way that he guilts people into paying for him is also really shitty. For example, we will all be making plans for dinner and then hanging out at somebody's house. The message will make it clear that the dinner is optional but people have to pay for themselves, but the event afterwards is free and people can drop in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe lives with his parents so we all know he could get a free dinner if he wanted. However, Sam will just show up and then say that he can't pay. At that point, our order has already been taken and it's awkward to force him to leave, so me and my gf end up covering his portion. He has yet to pay me back, and I think at this point I've spent at least 5 hundred bucks on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam also makes events about him. I have seen him do this at birthday parties, people's graduation parties, etc. He steals the spotlight by not letting anyone else talk for hours. He also constantly smokes my weed, even though I use it for medical purposes (ovarian), then gets moody and goes on these angry rants or just puts in headphones. He has never offered me any money for the weed he uses, he just smokes as much of it as he can get his hands on. He will get the munchies, and then refuse to share the food with other people, even though it was food I bought for everyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am getting really fed up with this, but he has recently been reaching out to me to hang out. I have tried bringing up issues I have with him and he flies off the handle. He can not handle criticism, he gets really angry. I want to stay civil with him because he is part of a larger friend group and it would be really uncomfortable if we hated each other, but I also don't want to hang out with him one on one or let him into my house because I feel really used. WIBTA if I just kind of faded him out of my life by deferring hangouts and saying I'm busy? I'm moving to another state for work soon, so we will only be seeing each other when I come home on vacation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: one of my long-time friends constantly uses me for money, weed and transportation and ruins people's special events. I'm tired of it but don't want to start shit with him. WIBTA if I just kind of phased him out of my life?",

      "description": "So, first of all.. I want to get this off my chest: I will make this post gender neutral as I really don't want people taking sides based on sex/gender.  \n\n\nMe and my Significant Other have been living together for 5 years and are getting married next year (yay!). A peculiarity of my SO is their family weak spot. If their family requests money, then bam... money is given away, if their family DOES NOT ask for money but call my SO directly and say ''I need to pay some bills'', then my SO takes it as a queue indicating that money has to be given.   \n\n\nMy SO has told me stories about how there was a necessity to start working at 16 and helping family when a money shortage was in place, but instead my SO's debit, credit or Groceries card (we receive Grocery Bonus cards that allows us to pay for groceries on top of our regular paycheck, super normal here) were taken away by their family so they could manage the expenses, instead. Long story short, when my SO gave them the credit card to fix a car problem they never paid the debt back and ruined my SOs credit score, we moved in together soon after that, but my SOs family keeps demanding money passive aggressively by guilt tripping my SO.   \n\n\nA couple of days ago, my SO received a yearly Christmas bonus which is given by law in our country which was used to buy a much needed laptop for school and still had money to spare for other expenses. My SO came back home one day and this statement came up while we were talking about our day: ''I saw mom and gave her 500bucks'' I was appalled and just responded with a ''WHAT?, WHY?'' and the only response I got was ''She said she needed money''. I said it was very inconsiderate to just give 500 bucks away without checking with me first.. not because it's only my SOs money, but because we are a couple and not taking financial decisions together has often caused hardships with our budget. Realizing there was nothing we could do and how money was lost, I let it go and kept doing my daily things.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, today my SO came back home and said ''I need to go to home depot and buy Christmas Ornaments and lights'' and I asked how come since we didn't have a plan to buy a Christmas tree.. and my SO said ''My mother asked me to buy them because she wants to put up a tree and have my niece see her first Christmas Tree''. I snapped at that moment and said it was a stupid decision to take yet again without checking in with me to see if I was okay with it or not, specially after giving 500 dollars away which I know we are never getting back and how money keeps being throw away and that's why we've been having so many issues with bills lately. I let my SO know that they should just stop spending money without telling me about it because of all the bad decisions that are being taken recently concerning money.  \n\n\nI explained that their family is being incredibly inconsiderate for asking money time after time, and it's not our fault my mother in law doesn't have a job and doesn't want to get a job worth a damn and we should not cover her needs in spite of having a husband who should be taking care of her instead of asking my SO to budget in expenses that do not belong to us. I told my SO to talk to my mother in law and tell her to get a damn job instead of leeching off a couple who is trying to get married and stop asking for money all the time. My SO refused, so I called my mother in law and tried to talk to her by saying we can't give any more money and how she should have thought twice before blowing out the 500 my SO gave her.   \n\n\nNeedless to say, it is kind of a shit storm, but I am just way too tired of my SOs family taking advantage of my SO, and my SO not accepting how these decisions are being taken way to lightly and as a couple, we should BOTH be taking them.   \n\n\nAm I the asshole here? :/ ",

      "description": "So some preface  \n\n\nBack when i was looking for a room to rent, my girlfriend suggested finding a bigger place. She said she would contribute a quarter of the rent. She was still living with her parents at the time but she would basically come over every thursday to sunday. Basically every half of the week. I attested at first but she convinced me after we found a decent room that was located at an ideal spot.  \n\n\nFast forward to today, she's hardly paying a quarter of  the rent anymore due to her change of careers (which i was completely supportive of). She started freelancing, and after joining this particular agency, she has been overwhelmed with work to the point where she almost never does any chores. And i find myself doing twice the load of laundry and basically maintaining the entire place on some occasions completely on my own.   \n\n\nI guess i got a little annoyed with that fact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I feel like i am housing a freeloader, and i know that's not the case. i try to sympathize with her and i acknowledge the fact that she has a tonne of work to do but the thought still eats in to me.  \n\n\nSo after doing the laundry, i decided to text her and suggested that she started doing her laundry at her own home (they have a domestic helper). She wasn't really mad but she told i could've told her how i felt about this situation differently. We came to a decision that i would do my own laundry and she would do her own but in the same apartment.   \n\n\nAm i the asshole for giving my suggestion?",

We have talked about having kids, but haven't gone forward due to her anxiety about the whole process, and my fear of committing to the whole lifestyle of being a parent.\n\nI work full time and then some, as my job keeps me busy (60, 70 hours a week). My income pays for basically everything.\n\nShe has been pursuing a career in photography for some six years.  She's made headway here and there with some good clients and jobs, but mostly she travels around and takes photos for her portfolio (meaning there is no paying client).\n\nI have suggested focusing more time on actual marketing, or hiring an agent or joining an agency several times, to get a more steady workflow going.  Or even just having business cards for the times people ask for them.  But it seems like she doesn't want to work harder than she is now.  Sometimes I suggest that, if this career isn't growing into something productive/a means of actually supporting our economic needs, she might need try a different career path.  But she won't consider any other line of work.\n\nI'm coming to the view that she so reliant on my income and safety net that she feels no need to make her career an actual career.  This makes me feel taken advantage of.  I've communicated as clearly as I can that this situation makes me feel take for granted, taken advantage of, etc. Even so, it seems like it doesn't affect her actual behavior when it comes to working.\n\nI get that it's a competitive world, and photography is not easy.  I don't want to ask her to give up on her dreams or her passion.  I also can't feel okay feeling like I'm being used.\n\nSo, I'm thinking about divorce.  Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I’m 20 and my sister and her boyfriend are 24 and 25 respectively. They’ve always had an open relationship, and everyone in my family is well aware of this.\n\nMy sister knows that I’ve always been very attracted to her boyfriend and that the feeling is mutual. She has joked about us sleeping together before and implied but never explicitly stated that she wouldn’t care if we did.\n\nI was staying with my sister for a few days and me and her boyfriend ended up having the house to ourselves for a few hours. We ended up sleeping together. It felt very natural and not like a big deal as all three of us are very open about sex.\n\nWhen my sister came home, I mentioned what had happened, and she got a very hurt look on her face. She went into the other room and started crying. Me and her boyfriend were shocked and both went to go talk to her. She said that what we did was totally inappropriate and told us both to get out. Neither of us had expected this. They have a very casual relationship when it comes to sex (they sleep with other people all the time without even mentioning it to the other) and, like I said before, my sister has implied that she would be okay with it if we slept together. I pointed that out, and she just said that this was different and again told us to get out. We both left, and she hasn’t returned my texts or calls since then (this happened Friday night).",

      "description": "Hi all: a bridesmaid advice question for everyone.. \n\nI (30, Aussie, living in London) have a great friend of mine (also, 30, Aussie living in London) who I asked to be my bridesmaid when my partner proposed in August 2018. She said yes, and couldn’t wait etc. \n\nThrough one thing and another it’s taken us 5 months to set the date, and we’ve found a place back in my partners hometown. We were always going to get married back in Australia, and my bridesmaid had been involved in the search (seeing photos etc). \n\nThe date that is available is December 14th. And this is where things get tricky. I told her the date, and she said ‘that’s going to be really hard for me to make’.  Basically because she can’t go back to Aus without seeing all her family (in Brisbane/Sydney) and flights to all those locations are at least $3k return in December. \n\nI can appreciate that she wouldn’t want to go all the way to Aus and not see her family. But also: I didn’t realise coming to my wedding would only be possible if she saw them. \n\nI’ve found flights for less than half the price (which are direct, and don’t include extra side-trips to different family members). But she says her family will basically never speak to her again if they find out she’s been in the country and not been to see them. \n\nI only had 3 bridesmaids.. and now will only have 2 if she decides the trip isn’t possible. Should I just get over it? Am I being unreasonable? \n\nSorry for the rant! ",

      "title": "AITA for confining my feelings to my boyfriend who has major depressive disorder?",
      "description": " \n\nSo my boyfriend developed major depressive disorder during his time in high school and still has it to this day. I don't really have a problem with him having said disorder, but I've wondered if his condition has affects how we communicate and process what we say to each other.\n\nHe had told me that he had gone through multiple treatments in the past (for 2 long years) but haven't had much progress. He, however, can still be a good mature person despite having aforementioned disorder. So I treat him like any neurotypical person, just with more patience whenever he has bad days.\n\nWe don't many major problems, besides being in long-distance, which to him is a big problem. We have met online and have yet to meet 'til we can afford to fly to each other's countries. But he has only been in geographically close relationships, so the experience has been new and difficult for him. He often tells me how the distance really affects him emotionally, and how it just brings down his mood when it's been on his mind. Myself, I'm not affected as much, so I try to accommodate a lot to make it worth it. I try to talk with him often, send pictures, videos, and recordings to comfort him. He doesn't reciprocate the same in frequency, but I didn't mind.\n\nBut then we have problems when either of us have something holding us up from spending time with each other. For him it can be family outings and hang outs with his friends. Myself, I gotten sick over the holidays and wasn't able to spend time with him one night. And the communication problems start during this time.\n\nBeing sick with fever, I didn't understand why he couldn't keep me company over the phone. Eventually I find out he switched plans and decided to hang out with his friends instead of with me. To clarify, we agreed to hang out that night but I got sick during the day. So as I saw it, since I told him I was sick, he didn't stay to keep me company, despite me telling him that I wanted him to stay.\n\nI should also clarify that he didn't make plans to hang out with his friends that night, and only to spend time with me. So I became pretty upset when he decided to not talk to me all of sudden once I told him I was sick.\n\nLater he clarified that he needed time alone, which I wish he told me he did sooner. He told me he didn't talk much to his friends and just stayed in a voice chat with them without making much comment. But what made me so upset was that he was so quick to change plans from being ok to spend time with me to immediately leaving without telling me why.\n\nFor one, I didn't try to be aggressive with him. I didn't accuse him of leaving me, but I felt abandoned and I need to communicate it to him.\n\nSo, as I learned from several educational videos and books about communicating in a relationship, I told him \"I feel abandoned,\" instead of \"You abandoned me.\" You know, using \"I\" statements when communicating about things you dislike.\n\nWhether or not it was true, I'm fine with being told that it isn't the case. However when I did, *he* became upset as if I really did accuse him of abandoning me. Eventually *I* had to be the one to apologize *just for telling him how I felt.*\n\nI find it a strange situation considering we just end up becoming upset with each other just for feeling upset. From then I just kept apologizing to him and feeling like I was in the wrong for even *feeling abandoned*. He would tell me that knowing that make him overthink about why I felt that way. Like \"what did he do wrong?\" and such.\n\nSo now I just decided to stop confining my feelings to him. Or when I do, I have to say a disclaimer \"May or may not be a *valid* feeling\" just to show I may not mean what I say. I'm not violent or aggressive when I talk to him about my feelings. But a simple \"I feel (insert negative emotion)\" is enough to make him upset, even with a disclaimer. And I don't mean to make him the bad guy in our situations, but\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling him about my feelings despite how much it apparently affects him? ",

      "title": "AITA for giving my gf a reason to be insecure",
      "description": "So a little backstory between me and my girlfriend. I am skinny, she is not. She is self conscious about her weight, because she knows my type is not usually girls like her. In the beginning I was a massive dick to her and almost didn't give our relationship a chance because I could not see myself with a bigger girl. I have since realized she is perfect for me, and I love her just the way she is. She forgave me, even though I didn't deserve it, and decided to give our relationship a chance. We've been together for nearly 2 years, during which I have tried to convince her over and over that she's perfect just the way she is (to make up for my horrible assholery at the beginning), but sometimes moments like this come up where I give her insecurities more ammo.\n\nOkay, now for the situation at hand. A while back she was browsing her facebook in front of me and singled out a girl, asking if I thought she was hot. I said yeah. That was a mistake. Since then, every time she has her facebook open in front of me and she sees a post from this girl she feels the need to point her out as \"the hot girl,\" and saying if I friended her she would kill me. Because of this, I knew her name on facebook.\n\nSo one day, out of boredom, I look this girl up on facebook. Just to look at her pictures. She doesn't even have many public pictures, just a handful. But for some reason I felt compelled to look her up. Maybe it was that \"forbidden fruit\" aspect of it, where my gf pointing her out all the time made me more curious about her. **Now, this is when I must make it clear** that I would **never** cheat on my gf, **ever, for any reason, with anyone**. She was my first, and I love her more than I thought I was capable of loving anyone or anything. The only reason I looked this girl up was to check her out. I had no plans of initiating conversation with her or anything like that. We're not even friends on facebook.\n\nSo cut to tonight, my gf and I are laying in bed and I pull up my phone to check facebook in front of her, to check out memes and shit, and I go over to the search bar to search for a meme page. Lo and behold, hot girl's name is in the search history, and my gf sees it. She tries to play it cool when she notices, like it's no big deal, but it doesn't take long for her to start crying. She becomes non-communicative, as is usually the case in situations like this, and no matter how hard I try to explain to her that this girl means absolutely nothing to me, it's not really helping the situation. She eventually packs up the few things she brought and leaves (we don't live together), barely saying another word in the process. Her last words when I told her I just wanted to know how she felt was, \"How do you think I feel?\"\n\nI don't know, reddit. Part of me feels I did very little wrong here. My gf doesn't get mad at me for watching porn, so why should she be mad at me for ogling an acquaintance of hers? This person means literally nothing to me. On the other hand, another part of me realizes how I'm basically feeding her insecurities, making her think she's not good enough for me by checking out other girls, even though I don't intend to do anything with them. And I think it might hit closer to home for her than normal because it's someone she knows and explicitly told me over and over again not to contact (again, I didn't). She feels I betrayed her, but I'm not sure I did.\n\nSo, AITA? Lay it on me; I can take it.",

      "description": "I feel so childish for having to ask this.\n\nI’m in the last year of my A levels (17) and met a new girl to our school during a biology field trip. She seemed nice enough and I quickly became friends with her as she seemed alone and my friend with me appeared to be avoiding me.\nIt turns out she was not avoiding me but my new friend (I’ll call her A from here on).\n\nIt turns out that A isn’t well liked in her house (boarding house) and is considered really weird. I’ll admit that I can see why, she obviously has some undiagnosed anxiety and maybe paranoid delusions as she come out with really odd questions and is constantly thinking that everyone is out to get her. Apparently she was really difficult to room with because of this and now she really only has one friend other than me.\n\nNow we’re back for another term I’m trying to balance keeping my old friends, none if which like her ( a few r e a l l y don’t like her) and being nice to her because I don’t want her to feel alone. \n\nShe is getting bullied. Not by anyone I’m close to and she’s not told me anything directly so there’s not much I can do but try to keep the staff informed. A struggles to understand normal conversations and so she is really gullible. The girls tend to take advantage of that and persuade her to do really weird things which only make her paranoia worse when she realises she’s been tricked. I’ve tried to persuade her to go to the school counsellor but A is convinced that the counsellor is also just being mean to her and now A won’t listen to any of her advice.\n\nSo you can probably see why I want to help and stay her friend but whenever I’m with her, I can’t be with all my other friends because A really irritates them.\n\nIt’s really childish but I’ve had to say stuff like that she can’t come to lunch with me and that makes me feel awful because I then see her eating alone at house. I’m having to avoid her in between lessons as well now as my friend are finding it weird that I hang out with her so much.\n\nIn short, AITA for trying to avoid her, and if so what can I do to help?\n",

      "description": "I'm part of a family of five living in a small two room house in an equally small town. My mom is disabled and can't work, while my dad has been working on and off the past ten years or so while he goes to college (his college history isn't important). Before i graduated highschool I got a job, and at the time was the only person employed in my house. Now I love my mom and do all I can to help her about, even dropping anywhere from 50-80% of every paycheck I made on helping pay bills to stop her from stressing. \n\nNow early last year my brother dropped out of college and moved back home. Ever since he has left the house less than 35-40 times, and won't help pay for any of the bills, since all he does is sit around yelling at his video games. Before going to college he had physically abused me, and everyone has been afraid of him since, but mom wants to love her son, so she lets him stick around nonetheless. Well recently he had yelled at her with quite provocative language ending with him supposedly getting kicked out (i spent an hour crying with mom just to calm her down after). Now he can't be bothered to get a job, and knew mom would forgive him, so he quickky came back to live on the couch.\n\nAfter talking to mom about how he needs to go she came up with her own creative response; charge rent. It would \"force him to get a job to stay, and then he'll have the funds to leave home\". Well this mandatory rent extends to me as well so he doesn't feel unjustly singled out. Now my parents are only asking for about 200 a month, but up to this point i had already been paying several utilities by myself, and our power bill was in my name, around 300 dollars of my measly 400 dollar fast food place checks (with the rest going to food, mainly work lunch and dinners), so triple that at the minimum.\n\nI hadn't been able to save much at all because I put my family first, and now they are requiring me to give them my money to make sure my abuser doesn't get upset. \n\nAfter mom informed me about how I now have to pay them, I haven't wanted to give them another single cent. I've always been a giving person but once something is demanded of me I no longer wish to give anything more than asked, especially after I put off college to help pay bills until my dad finally graduates. I've told my mom my views and she seems disappointed with me now, and won't talk to me anywhere near as much.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I’m in college. I have a girlfriend, we’ll call her Alice. Our friends: Karen, Sam (Karen’s BF), and Cait (Alice’s roommate). We’re freshmen. \n\nSo, two times (one last semester, once this February), I have blacked out drinking and thrown up. Once was on Alice’s bed, and the other time was in my own bed. There was a third time, but that was for pure stomach reasons, that was also in my room. My friends have always helped me clean up. There was also an incident in January when I was drunk and had a mental breakdown (it was a long time coming) but eventually calmed down and said all I wanted to do was sleep. I got admitted to the hospital after Cait called the cops, then got discharged.\n\nSince the hospitalization and the sickness, I’ve been verbally apologizing nonstop. I also buy cookies when we all hang out, I don’t ask them to pay me back, I’ve run a few errands, I’ve provided alcohol and a party space, etc. I’ve felt terrible and I insist on apologizing for my mental health as well as the two times I got out of control when drinking. I insist that they don’t help me clean up, but they don’t listen and help me anyways, which I am extremely grateful for and they insist it’s nothing.\n\nFor the past two weeks, Cait was being passive-aggressive towards me because we ran into a situation where I was told I couldn’t drink (after not having one in a while), but she was drunk. \n\nAfter a confrontation and argument, Cait makes rules: I should never come to her and Alice’s room ever again, no matter if I’m drunk or not. She says I abuse alcohol and that she doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore, and she shouldn’t have to justify that. I say she should because I really care and want to be friends and I don’t understand why this is still a huge problem. \n\nMy points: I feel bad for the events and I accept they’re my fault. I’ve never asked them to clean up for me. I try to make it up. I feel like I’m being treated like a child. I feel like we should just be straight up and talk about this rather than be petty. I’ve been apologizing and trying to change. I am right for getting angry at being called an alcoholic/etc. Cait isn’t listening to the but just points out petty details and ignoring how upset I am. I don’t feel heard/seen and understood. I propose I’ll work on my drinking and control, I want us all to work on communication, and I want my drinking to stop being policed so I can do it myself.\n\nCait then says she will never get drunk with me again, she doesn’t need to watch over me (I never asked), she will not let me drink in her/Alice’s room ever, Alice shouldn’t have to take care of me, I can’t come to their room for a week, cookies and favors (in addition to apologies…) mean nothing. She’s been ignoring me since and is still upset. Alice is scared of her, but her and Karen don’t seem to be mad at me. I’m talking with Karen tomorrow.\n\nAm I the asshole here (compared to Cait,) for thinking these rules are unfair?",

      "description": "Tldr at bottom\nSo I posted this $1,000 best buy gift card on Craigslist for $800. I got a couple offers offering below this number and a guy offering to pay me $750 to deliver it to him, saying the $50 less offer + delivery was to insure he didn't have to wait on some random buyer. (Logic, right?) \n\nThen one guy offers my $800, asking to do a 3-way call with the automated service so he may hear the balance on my card. I thought that was weird so I didn't reply. He texts again, and I text back so I don't seem like a scammer saying someone offered me $900.\n\nThe guy then offered my $950 (*little bit of a red flag*) I tell him I sold it and I'm sorry. He proceeds to tell me how lame it was of me to sell the card to someone else when he was willing to offer $50 less of the cards value. At that point I'm glad I sold it for this guy's sake, that's just not a good deal.\n\nI again tell him I'm sorry and that It was a dick move to sell it to someone else. He pointlessly replied \"you need to learn how to handle your business better, kiddo\". It was a Craigslist ad.\n\nHowever there another layer to this event! I didn't have a $1,000 gift card. Wait, don't call me the asshole yet! I posted this ad to test if anyone *would* pay at least $800 for the gift card.\n\nBecause I've been trying hard as hell to sell this Microsoft laptop for my mom, worth $1,000, but no one is willing to pay more than $600 for an in shrink wrap item. So.. the plan was to return the laptop to best buy for a gift card, then sell that gift card. That plan crashed and burned.\n\nTldr: told a guy I sold my gift card elsewhere, dude got butt hurt and called me kiddo, but it didn't matter in the end because the gift card never existed. Until after returned my laptop for it. *I was testing the market ok?*\n",

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nDated a girl in college. Her parents were alcoholic dicks. She was very shy and kind of down on herself. Was jealous toward my female friends, but I chocked it up to insecurities from her home life and (foolishly) assumed they’d tone down in time.\n\nShe smoked weed for the first time with me, loved it, and started buying her own much larger supply. Was defensive if I suggested cooling it (like I was a hypocrite for making any distinction of healthy use of an illegal drug). \n\nThings get worse. More neurotic and jealous. She’d  be rude to my female friends and later say I was emotionally unfaithful for having any. I just kept reassuring her with growing irritation. There was only so much I could explain away by her insecurities before I was just enabling them.\n\nWe broke up. She got into stronger drugs. She was beautiful, though, and at some point heard this from the wrong people. Became an escort on a website to fuel her ever more expensive habit.\n\nHalf a year after we broke up, I heard that she was getting friendly with some other guy in my program. My first instinct was to fill him in. She predicted this and called me up to ask that I not share any of it. She’d told him we had dated. Anything else was her own baggage and I had no right to undermine her.\n\nFor better or worse, I promised I’d respect her wishes. I barely knew the guy and not exactly a conversation I was chomping at the bit to have. The dude actually came to ME to ask if I was okay with them dating. I just said we hadn’t worked out and wished him well.\n\nSome months pass. It was 9:00 am on a Saturday and I get an unknown call from the new guy. (Didn’t even have his number.) She had broken up with him and said there were things about her past he just wouldn’t accept her for. She spilled the beans and told him to ask me if he didn’t believe her.\n\nI’m fuming. Not at him, but at her custom brand of self-deprecation and warped logic mixed with bad history being used as ammunition to get out of her relationship with him and putting me in the middle of it.\n\nI confirmed it all and explained I didn’t think it was my place to share her personal stuff before. Said I’m sorry and it sucks over and over until he hung up. I was probably the last person he wanted help or sympathy from.\n\nI wonder if I lacked common decency for not giving this guy a heads up. There are health risks involved. I heard from our shared friend that she had hoped to make me jealous and got bored quickly. I made a choice to respect her privacy (and chance to redefine her future) over this dude’s chance at a clearer picture. So, dear reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR- Dated a girl and introduced her to weed. She got into it hardcore. We broke up and I learn she got into stronger stuff and became an escort. Someone I knew started to date her and she asks I not reveal what I know. I don’t, only to be asked by the guy to confirm it all when they had a nasty break up.",

      "description": "I have an eclectic set of hobbies and monetize them to support myself when applicable. One of my hobbies is party/event/wedding planning. Mostly done by word-of-mouth and it's people who know people, rarely close friends at this point. I have a structure to the agreement process, including a contract that outlines my objectives, responsibilities and most importantly, my compensation.\nOne day a colleague at my day-job was asking me about prices for wedding planners as she was recently engaged. She asked about prices for anon planners and then added that she would feel more comfortable with someone who knew her personally. She then proceeded to ask me if I would plan her wedding. She is a very last minute person and likes making choices but not coming up with options. She outlined a price and I agreed since we were friends. \nThis was my first mistake. I was lazy about getting the contract to her since I knew she was fine with it; after all, she set the price. No sticker-shock possible. \nI started setting up meetings with different professionals; baker, photographer, dj, etc. Even going to the venues and helping her ask practical questions and such. \nAt about 1 month in I got the contract to her and she said she would need to review it. Fine. \nAbout a week later she lets me know that her mother thinks the price is ridiculous and that a planner is pointless. \nThe bride being in her early 30s apparently not making her own decisions yet agreed with her mother and decided that she didn’t want my help.\nI was angry to say the least. Before I could inform each of the professionals that I would no longer be handling the wedding my wife had contacted most of them. Professionals each asked if I wanted them to back out, I told them not to as there was no reason they should lose out on a payday. Most telling me that they were no longer giving her my contract price but returning them to standard pricing.\nI avoid all conversation about the wedding with the colleague and if she tries to bring it up I change the subject or dismiss myself.\nWhere the Asshole comes in is that the wedding is less than 2 months out now, and the Baker asked me if the wedding was still on. I told her it was and then the Baker informed me that the bride had not submitted the order for the cakes/cupcakes yet and that she's nearing a point where it's too close to the wedding to place a large order.\nI wondered if the bride had gone a different direction but today she brought up the Baker and the wedding cake and was mentioning the dessert but clearly did not have a clue she is nearing the deadline.\nAITA for not telling her nothing has been ordered and that she's probably not going to have a wedding cake at her reception?\n\nTL;DR She hasn't ordered her wedding cake yet and is almost too late to do so and I know this, she does not.",

My best friend is VERY smart. She’s in the same classes I’m in, and they’re mostly all honors/AP classes (putting that in for context so you know I understand her class material). \n\nBut she’s lazy. She doesn’t try. She used to be a straight A student and now she has two Ds and a C. Me and her parents know she can do better, she just doesn’t try. I know she doesn’t because she always jokes about how she doesn’t study. Instead of taking ten minutes to look over notes, she plays video games (Nothing wrong with playing video games, I play them too). \n\nYesterday I caught her doing her homework that was due next period with five minutes left of lunch. I said \n\n“______ why didn’t you do that at home or during study period?” \n\nShe says \n\n“Really, OP? How is your love life going?” \n\nAnd it really hurt me because she knows I hate when she says stuff like that, because my love situation is not the greatest right now (issues with a person that is super important to me) \n\nAnd it made me think that maybe me being on her for her grades is making her mad. I just know she can do better and I want her to do her best so she doesn’t settle for anything less than what she deserves. \n\nI admit I do talk to her about it around friends, but my other friends are on her about it too. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.\n\nSo here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. \n\nI immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas birthday so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. \n\nWe were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.\n\n\nChris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. \n\nBoth families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. \n\nAnyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. \n\nI broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. \n\nBeing the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. \n\nEveryone in the room looked horrified. \n\nMy mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. \n\nTim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. \n\n\nThe rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...\n\n\nI am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n",

However, he’s made me feel extremely uncomfortable at various points in the last year before we lived together and even whilst we’ve lived together. \n\nSo, before we moved in, Josh lived with my boyfriend for a bit, and egged on by two of their friends, made a move on me despite knowing full well that I was still with my boyfriend. He put his arm around me and pushed his crotch into my side and got *very* close to me, and I stated that I was hella uncomfortable with that, after which he apologised. \n\nFast forward to living with Josh now, and there’s  been times where he’ll come into my room uninvited and lie on my bed next to me, shifting so that his head is on my shoulder and watching whatever I’m doing on my phone, occasionally still doing the crotch thing. I told him again that I wasn’t comfortable with it and I would much prefer it if he knocked, after a good few weeks he got the message. \n\nAnd now, any time we spend together he’ll have to cover his crotch for... reasons, I assume. Idk what to do. He’s not great with girls and I’m really not sure how I can help him, or if the issues will escalate if we continue living together. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nP.S. any advice would be much appreciated, especially if I’m the asshole.

      "description": "This is a bit of a long and convoluted story, but essentially, I'm friends with a girl whose life sucks right now. Her little sister is suicidal, her parents are retirement age but broke, and she's deep in debt at a college she hates. We've been pretty good friends for two years now.\n\nOver the past 6 months or so, though, she's changed. She's started making fun of me for everything. I think she's lashing out in anger at her life and taking it out on me because I'm a chill guy and I'll take it. But she's taken it way too far in certain circumstances, like making light of how my grandparents fled from Eastern Europe to the US to escape the USSR. She also won't let me talk about anything I'm interested without telling me how much of a nerd I am. She won't let me finish talking before she cuts me off, laughing, at how much of a nerd I am. When I try and ask her not to talk about those situations, or to not cut me off, she projects everything back onto me, saying I make way more fun of her and she's just defending herself. She takes over every conversation, talking about the stuff she likes, or talking about the emotional problems she's having right now. I've shrugged it off up to this point because she was, up until this point, pretty fun to hang out with, and I know her life is rough. I don't mind her teasing for the most part, and I know she's having a rough time of it right now and therefore not going to be fun and excited all the time. Up until yesterday, I figured it was my job to be a good friend and be there for her.\n\nBut it all came to a head last night. She was hanging out in my room and I turned some music on, and she immediately started whining because I was playing some of my music. She mocked it and said it was trash; I brushed it off like always. But then, she told me she had something for me: she gave me a poster of the flag of my grandparents' home country while it was occupied by the USSR, and made a joke about sending me to the gulag. I asked her to stop joking about that because it's not funny, my grandparents could have died, and she again said that I tease her for all sorts of stuff, she's just defending herself. I told her she won't let me play my own music in my room, she won't let me like stuff because it's nerdy, and she's making light of everything my grandparents and family went through. She stormed off and has been giving me the cold shoulder all day. Honestly, I'm sick of being treated like a therapist whose job is to sit there, take all her crap, and not have any interests at all because they're \"nerdy\". I get that she's going through a hell of a lot, but I'm done.\n\nTLDR, friend of two years gets increasingly rude and touchy to me in particular, but I think it's related to personal issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I stopped being her friend?",

      "description": "Background context to start with: Our work is 24/7, there's a lot of downtime so we get to browse youtube/reddit etc when there isn't any work to do. We try not to *overdo* the amount of internetting we do, but sometimes it's hard. There are different sections, we're one of the best and we always take over from the same section who aren't quite as good, we're a lot more efficient and better at our jobs than them but we try not let it get to us.  \n\n\nAnyway, when the supervisor of the other section was leaving he saw I had youtube up and basically said that I shouldn't be using it too much. My coworker (CW) said something like, \"don't tell us what to do when your section is even worse when it comes to internet use\" something kinda passive-aggressive like I can't remember exactly and in my opinion, it was calling him out unnecessarily. The supervisor said he knew and would be speaking to his team about it tomorrow.   \n\n\nThis was a few days ago, fast forward to today and CW comes to my desk and mentions the previous supervisor's comments. I started off by saying that that probably wasn't the best way to handle it and giving a snarky response to him wasn't helpful with interpersonal relationships. He said that he doesn't have an interpersonal relationship with him (he resents so many people he works with), after a bit of back and forth he said that he wasn't going to bother telling me that thing he came over to tell me (pertaining to internet use) and that that will be the last time he stands up for me.  \n\n\nFrom my perspective I was just criticising the way he talked down to the other supervisor, and suggested there were better ways for him to have mentioned it. I get this other supervisor is not as competent as others but I feel that his comments were not going to help the situation in any way, so I told him so. He then proceeded to be, what I felt, was a very childish response (coming from a guy who's like 5 years older than I am) and didn't say a word to me for the rest of the day.  \n\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So this is definitely way tamer than a lot of the posts on this sub, but whatever. \n\nFor context, I'm in my 20s and my main gaming buddy is like 15 years older. I'm in a casual relationship with no kids, whereas he's married with young kids, so I naturally have much more free time than he does and generally end up advancing in mutually owned video games faster than he does. \n\nLately my buddy is getting super passive-aggressive with me in his comments and sometimes started rage-quitting from our games and claiming his Xbox malfunctioned. \nFrom his comments, it's seems he doesn't like it when I unlock things in the games faster than him, or kill enemies that he wanted to kill, or score more points than him, or generally outdo him at anything in games, which is fairly common because I have much more time to play than he does so I will usually progress faster.\n\nLately I even started intentionally holding back periodically to wait for him and he still gets upset any time I complete any objective instead of just waiting patiently for him to come and pick up the loot or kill the boss or do whatever else the objective was after I've cleared the path and done all the heavy lifting for him, which obviously isn't fun for me. \n\nIf this behaviour were coming from anyone else I'd just call them out on it. But for extra context I'd add that he's been dealing with depression lately. He's in therapy and taking medication and without getting too deep into his personal business he is genuinely having a tough time psychologically and has confided in me already about how much he values our gaming time as a coping mechanism.\n\nSo it's like on the one hand I want to sculpt the gaming sessions to be as cathartic as possible for him, just to be supportive. \nBut on the other hand, gaming sessions in this format where I cheer him on and he practically plays solo until I'm allowed to help him out once he gets overwhelmed is a chore to me. It's like playing with a child instead of an adult.\n\nHow should I even proceed here? This isn't a usual conversation that healthy adult friends should need  to have? I feel that a direct confrontation might be unadvisable as a lot of his depression is stemming from conflicts where other people accused him of selfish behaviour, so I don't really want to pile in on top of that and possibly drive him further into a negative spiral. \nIf this is one of his few only outlets for stress and a coping mechanism for self esteem or whatever they I'd like to be supportive, but I'm also cautious about enabling negative behaviour and of course I would also prefer a solution that doesn't turn our games into a negative experience for me. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar position from the opposite perspective here? \nKeen for feedback on how to deal with this, preferably subtly.\n\nThanks!

      "description": "Hello everyone. I would really appreciate some insight and I will do my best to describe the situation and be as brief as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend and I started dating about a year ago, and when we started dating her main ex boyfriend of four years re-entered the picture and started texting her. At that point they had been broken up for over a year. He was 10 years older than her, and at one point she thought he was the one. He dumped her because his heart was not into it, and she told me many things about the guy that made him sound kind of like an emotionally unavailable and troubled individual. Let me clarify this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe told me he didn't really want sex much, she did. He wasn't very affectionate, she wanted that. He barely said he loved her, she complained. He didn't want to travel and do things with her, she did. So when we met, in my head I was like \"holy shit, this is the complete opposite of me, I'm all the things she wants, this will be great!\" Well in time, resentment grew because she couldn't reciprocate, and also still responded to this guy, and STILL does our entire relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur entire relationship he has been in touch with her. It's very platonic, but he is obviously still madly in love with her because a few times he has asked her to see him, has admitted he made a mistake, and misses her, etc. She never reciprocates, but still allows him to talk to her. She said she feels bad, but I feel he is just a pest and I'm in a love triangle. I have asked her to cut contact with him because it makes me feel really uncomfortable, and I truly feel he can't move on with her responding. She even reached out for his advice on voting day, saying he was the only person she trusted with politics. I thought that was inappropriate, because in my eyes that would give him some confidence that he is still valuable, but who knows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe thinks I'm being insecure, I think it sucks she can't let go of someone who was apparently such an asshole to her, and ironically can't reciprocate all the things I give her when she told me she wants it. It's very confusing. On top of this, she responds to RANDOM strangers on IG who message her, nothing inappropriate from her side, but I tell her to ignore them... it's weird. Why does she need to do so? I can't help but think it's all attention seeking behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind we are in our early 30's, so this behavior is mind blowing at this point. This came to a head and we have broken up over it, because I can't handle the random dudes in her life and her ex, and she says she can't let go of him. So this led to us breaking up in a messy way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking these things? Am I am \"insecure piece of shit\" as she put it? Thanks.",

My boyfriend is hardly anything like anyone in his family (which I'm thankful for). \n\nEveryone in his family is a racist Trump loving gun slinging animal Hunter kinda person and I have never liked people like that for pretty obvious reason. My family is nothing like his. Even my boyfriend sometimes hates them but then they are nice to him and he lets it all slide. One night we were hanging out with them playing a fibbage game and one of his step Brothers literally wrote in the N word for every answer because he thought it was the funniest thing in the world. That was basically my last straw of never wanting to talk to these people again. They are small town people that are obsessed with drama and talk shit about everyone they know. \n\nLike I said we are moving into a house we are renting soon and I'm already worried about having to see his family too much or having them try to come over to our house. My boyfriend has told me many times about how badly they treat him sometimes and how much he dislikes them but then someone does something nice for him and it's like he forgets it all. I'm just not like that. \n\nHe wants to throw a house warming party and mentioned inviting the family but I'm really uncomfortable even being around most of them. \n\nAITA for thinking like this? ",

      "description": " \n\nI organized a weekday get-together. I told the people invited that we will be hanging at my home from 6:30-9:30 p.m. Then I would like everyone to be responsible (read: sober) and out of my house by 9:30 p.m. as I adhere to a strict bedtime! I have a very close friend, we’ll call her Katy. She is a homebody and suffers from chronic pain due to a head injury. This makes planning with her understandably difficult. She seemed receptive to coming to my place when I invited her. I gave her the details, and she told me she cannot commit until the night of as she does not know how much head pain she’ll be in after work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe evening of,  at around 7 p.m. all of my buddies, barring Katy, had arrived. We were pouring cocktails when I sent her a message asking her if she’s coming down. She sent one back expressing her annoyance with me bugging her all day about it, and now that she is home from work she wants to take a shower and eat dinner before assessing if she feels like coming over. I realized I was neurotic, I put my phone down on the table, and started engaging with my buddies. I got buzzed and really involved with my guests. I didn’t think to check my phone until around 8:30 pm.-ish. Katy had sent me a text at 7:45 saying she had showered, but wouldn’t get there until 8:30. She asked me if it would be dumb for her to show up at 8:30 unless we had decided to keep hanging past 9:30 p.m. The second text from her came right around 8:30 saying she was frustrated to not hear from me and “bummed that I disappeared.”  I texted her that I was sorry and that I put my phone down once everyone had come over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I share her side and the subsequent heated discussion we had, I’ll say that to me I was annoyed she wanted me to be on call. I wanted to disconnect and be with my friends who had showed up. I did just that and I forgot about my phone. I felt that if she wanted to come she would have. She knew, 6:30-9:30 p.m. I said sorry, finished my night, and went to bed that thinking nothing of the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn’t respond to my text and.... we didn’t talk for 5 days. This is uncharacteristic. We communicate semi-daily. I got anxious after day 2 which I’m sure didn’t help. Eventually on day 5 I reached out... and by reached out I immaturely asked her “Am I getting the silent treatment?” I totally pissed her off. I apologized. I then began asking her what was going on. She told me I can be a shitty friend sometimes. She felt I had forgotten about her that night. Once I finally got to the meat of it she told me that she couldn’t relate to someone who wouldn’t apologize for upsetting their friend then going 5 days without reaching out and further hurting them. On top of that, me breaking the ice with “am I getting the silent treatment” in her view, was me making it about myself. She told me that this kind of behavior especially over the past 5 days had made her “really evaluate the friendship”  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel a mix of guilt and anger. This statement came as a blow to me. I wish to give some reasoning behind what I feel prompted that. To be frank, I struggle with some mental illness. I realize this is not to excuse ass-holery. During this school semester I have been inconsistent with my emotional and physical availability to those who care about me. These plans falling through could have really set her off.  This isn’t some deep secret though, she knows intimately well my progress/struggles I’ve made with medication/mental hygiene. Hence things like the strict 9:30 cutoff time for my hangout. This leads me to the end of our texts. I got raw and explained the state I’ve been balancing this semester. I hoped that could help better apologize/explain why my inconsistency may have led her to feel this way about our friendship. She only said “interesting.” I said that felt calloused. She told me I should seek professional help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nIt’s been a few weeks and she’s trying to talk to me like nothing happened. I may be overthinking this. I need some objectivity on my actions.",

      "description": "I came out to my mom as a boy (after feeling this way for a year.) She said she's supportive but doesn't really show it (doesn't use right pronouns, constantly says she thinks I'm not trans because every girl goes through a phase of being trans, she doesn't let me bind, etc.) So one day she said the thing she's been saying everyday since I came out \"[Deadname] I really don't think you're a boy. I mean I went through the same phase for a few months.\" and I responded \"I really don't think it's a phase.\" Well then I asked my therapist how to tell my mom to stop talking about me being trans and treat her like her normal son. Well she gave me a paper on how to be more assertive and while my mom and my therapist were talking my mom kind of understood what I wanted her to stop talking about and I kind of got a bit anxious because I thought my mom knew but I didn't know until I got in the car and she said \"FINE. I'll stop talking about it.\" well that was a lie, because she still talks about it EVERYDAY. It makes me feel bad when she says these things. And one day I told her \"I don't WANT to be trans. It seems too hard\" and she said \"Then you're probably not trans\" and I started thinking \"what person WANTS to be trans with gender dysphoria and having to spend thousands of dollars to be the gender I need to be. Would I be an asshole if I uncame out to her and waited until I'm 18 to transition?\nTl;DR my mom says she accepts me as a trans person but her actions tells me she hates the fact that I'm trans. Would I be an asshole if I uncame out to her and transitioned at 18",

So recently (after my birthday) I told him that he could either quit it or be woken up by being tossed in the snow every day to wake him up.

      "description": "This happened back in high school (90s). I never thought I was in the wrong, but I was reminded of it the other day, so I'm here to accept my judgement from the community. \n\nI had been dating my girlfriend at the time for around a month or so. One night, while on the phone with her, she mentioned that she was going to hang out with a guy friend of hers, and I didn't really think anything of it. The next day at school, during lunch, she admitted that she cheated on me the night before. I'm probably the least jealous person there is, and I never really had a problem finding dates (not bragging - I was no Jonathan Taylor Thomas), so I told her I didn't want to be together anymore. No hard feelings. There were plenty of girls I would cry over while listening to Glycerine by Bush, she just wasn't one of them. \n\nThe next night she called me like normal, we talked about school, I was a little perplexed, but whatever. She let me know she wanted to keep dating, but that I would have to \"make it up to her.\" I was blown away, but honestly interested in understanding what she meant. She said I could fill her locker with flowers, write her a poem and post it on Geocities, you know, a grand gesture. I told her I needed to think, and ended the conversation.\n\nThe next couple days I tried ducking her, but she'd pop up out of nowhere wondering if I'd figured out how I was going to \"win her back.\" Finally, I had a smartass idea: I told her to wait by locker after a specific class of hers and \"I'll show you how much you mean to me.\" I didn't show up. She found me later, and was none too pleased. \n\nHer: I waited for you and you didn't show up.\n\nMe: Well yeah, to show you how much you mean to me.\n\nHer: But you never came. \n\nMe: Exactly, you mean nothing to me.  \n\nOnce the realization hit her, she started kind of silently crying, called me a dick, and walked away. I was smugly satisfied with myself, and I didn't see her again until things blew up randomly months later. \n\nAITA here? While I always felt her betrayal and her weird mind game warranted some kind of \"no uncertain terms\" response, I now wonder if what I did was cruel, because it hurt her more (a lot) than she hurt me (almost none).

Time passed and I did not want to seem rude or something so I haven’t said a word about the money, this was roughly 4€ and as time went on I decided not to give the matter a lot of time so I just moved on.\n\nNow, last week he asked me again If I could lend him 5€ for a paysafecard ticket for a game and although I had some doubts I agreed to do so, again he said he would give it back. Again, that same night he told people how thankful he was for a friend buying him a skin on a game and all that. He was talking about other friend. This pissed me off for sure, again I decided to just let things go by and wait to see if he would give me the money. The next we meet up he said he had the money but no exchange for it so he was not able to give it to me. I was like “It’s ok, don’t worry, next time.” This went going for several days and still I didn’t say a word about it.\n\nI must say that his financial status is a lot higher than mine, and also bugged me the fact that he could ask for change ANYWHERE. Right now I just think that he does not want to give me the money back.\n\nI also start to think that I was just dumb for agreeing to this guy.\n\nTL;DR: A friend asked me for money two times and said that he would pay me back but he either does not say a word about it or he just puts up excuses like “Sorry I don’t have change so I can’t give it to you now” even if he had places available right where he was for change.",

      "description": "A little context, I (F) work in retail. My gf worked here as well for awhile, but has since left the company.\n\nOne of our repeat customers has asked repeatedly about my girlfriend, where she works, can I get a message to her etc. While she worked here, he hit on her pretty hard, to the point that she would always find a urgent task in the back anytime he came just to avoid him.\n\nWhen he asks me about her I state our usual company policy that I can’t discuss her personal  information with anyone. He pressed and hilariously said the were ‘talking’ and lost touch. (I know this to be false, the man is 30 years her senior and more directly... a man.) \n\nHe has continued to ask my coworkers about her, as well as other locations in the area. (Transferring from store to store is common and my position sometimes requires me to be outside my home store, so I hear this from others I know.) The last time I spoke to him I was less than polite when I told him if she wasn’t contacting him, he should probably take this as a sign she wasn’t interested.\n\nNow to my dilemma. I shared this information with my girlfriend, hoping to make her laugh a little. She became a little upset, saying I should have told him we were dating, or at the very least he didn’t have a shot since she’s gay.\n\nI’ve always been of the mindset that it’s not my place to disclose anyone else’s sexuality. I feel it can be an incredibly private thing, and in such a small rural town deep in the Bible Belt it could be dangerous. Also, in this particular situation we have had problems with stalkerish creepy guys so we are understandably tight lipped about others information.\n\nWe have since resolved it and came to the compromise that I will tell him I delivered his message, and if he presses I’ll tell him she isn’t interested in making new friends.\n\nWe still disagree on the matter, so I wonder, was I the asshole?\n",

Because of my busy schedule I try to keep my workouts no longer than an hour. I found the upper/lower body split to be a perfect fit but that’s another topic. \n\nI encouraged a few friends of mine to be more aware of their health and at least begin exercising if not eating properly (one quick note, we pursue a Computer Science degree which means we spend most of our time sitting on a desk). They listened to me and paid for a gym membership. I did a few workouts with them and in the beginning it was exciting to have a buddy to go to the gym with and chat with them during rest periods. However, I noticed that my 1 hour workouts eventually turned to an hour and a half because I got distracted chatting and my rest periods became longer. I fixed this quickly but then as I am more experienced than my friends, whenever they had any questions or needed help they turned to me. We are friends and I did not mind. Furthermore, I am more than happy to help others become fitter but then this had an impact on my already busy schedule. I was not able to complete my workouts in 1 hour again. Currently, I feel like other stuff are of higher priority and cannot afford to waste time. This reduced my productivity levels and eventually I got frustrated with going to the gym with my friends. So I continued working out without them and we barely meet in the gym. \n\nI never spoke to them about this but I want to note that I am going to share how I feel about it after the holidays as everybody left now. \n\nRight now, I feel like an asshole instead of a friend and would like to hear what you think?",

Then She let me know that she wants to experiment with other people while there because she has not been with anyone else before me, and sees it as a good opportunity to gain experience. I have had other sexual partners in the past, but never been with anyone for as long as I have been with her, we’ve been together for three years. I am upset and distraught thinking that she will be sleeping with other people while overseas. AITA? It’s not like I’m not curious about other women, but I haven’t ever cheated on her nor would I want to. Now I don’t know what I will do during this year apart and I don’t know if our relationship will last. WIBTA asking her not to go? I feel like it's not right to keep her from living her life, but I feel like it's unfair to me. Is She the asshole, or am I?",

      "description": "I (female) don't know if it matters but the someone is my male boss. This makes me worry IATA even more because of boundary issues inherent to the relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast March I went out for drinks with colleagues and managers to celebrate a software release. My boss and I have always had an attraction to one another and truly incidentally found ourselves alone after everyone else bounced. We paid cash while everyone else had cards. The wait for change took so long they brought us two more rounds on the house. This ultimately resulted in sloppy drunken messing around (not even sex). We mention it once with whoops and have never breathed a word of it since. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had always been a bit more involved in one another's personal business than a boss and subordinate should be. That's continued because, hey, we've left that one night in the past where it belonged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMove to now. Part of his side of over share has been centered around his tumultuous on again off again relationship with the mother of his child. She struggles with mental illness and is truly abusive, as in verified by court records taken to jail multiple times for assaulting him. He's shown up to work with huge bruises, scratches, and looks positively wrecked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeeing this I have offered both support and pressure to leave. I've said things like this is hard to watch, offered a place to stay with the kid, and followed online guides on how to best help someone in a DV relationship. That said, what I am doing seems a little female white-knightish in my own thoughts at times. This bugs me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI worry that IATA because a. it isn't my place b. we messed around and c. the attraction is still obviously there on both ends, evidenced by things that aren't relevant here.

And then someone at our table goes \"mayyyy you\" and so I was like what the hell? May I? And he goes two glasses of water from the toilet bowl coming right up! So I was like uhm okay weird, so he brings out our water and we ask if we can get an order of mozzarella sticks, and AGAIN our waiter goes \"can you?\" and at this point I'm getting a little pissed off and my girlfriend is getting irritated as well, I guess I should mention we are a young group the youngest being 17 and oldest being 21 so I feel like there is no way this waiter would be correcting an older group so I'm a little annoyed at this point and for the rest of the meal was kind've blunt and rude to him. In fact at one point he asked us what we were doing on the Friday night and we told him we're heading to a play a soccer game after this and after he goes on for a few minutes telling us how he used to play soccer for years and at the end of his story I bluntly said \"didnt ask\" LOL. I usually ALWAYS tip over 20% but this is the first time I've really not wanted to tip over 20% so I believe I left him something like 10%.

      "description": "That probably sounds a little click-bait ish but I can honestly see either side here. My boyfriend (21m) of 2 years is a very humorous person. He's constantly making jokes and sarcastic comments and I (23f) do so in return. Overall I am a less sensitive person now than I used to be and am thankful to him for that. \n\nEarly January I got an IUD put in. The hormones have been messing with me but from what the doctor said I think it should level out in like 6 months. In the meantime, I've been a bit overly sensitive. Some of my boyfriends jokes have been kinda upsetting me. Jokes that wouldn't have been too far before now feel like too much. \n\nToday I made dinner in the crock pot while he was at his first day of his new job. He got home and put a serving in a bowl. I don't know why, but that upset me. It upset me that he used a bowl instead of a plate. I told him that. I said \"I have no idea why but I just got upset that you used a bowl instead of a plate.\" I said it in a joking sort of voice because I thought it was kinda funny and very stupid. He said in a sarcastic sort of tone \"you know what I'm upset about?\" And in a slightly less sarcastic tone \"that you didn't put any seasonings in this.\" That seemed unnecessarily mean to me, especially since I did season it. I told him I did season it  and he rudely said \"it doesn't taste like it.\" I don't remember how I responded but he gave a rude sarcastic sort of appolgiy. \"I'm sorry I wasn't as nice about that as you'd like it to be.\" Yelled and rude. I called him a dick and went to eat in the bedroom. \n\nWe reconciled but I asked that he be a bit more sensitive to me while I'm out of Ballance like this. The text I sent said\n\n\"That was legitimately hurtful. I know I've been sensitive lately, but maybe that doesn't have to mean that I have to be overly apologetic for how I feel. Maybe it should mean that you be more sensitive to how I'm feeling. We know why I'm like this right now. It's not my fault. It'll probably even out in a few months, but in the mean time can we just work with it instead of ignoring it?\"\n\n\nHe replied\n\n\"Sure\"\n\nThis argument isn't the only thing. It's just been jokes and comments that ordinary wouldn't be a problem. We make jokes at each other's expense all the time. But as of the past 3 or 4 weeks (since I got the IUD) a lot normal stuff feels over the top. Jokes about me talking too much, jokes about my breast or butt, jokes about my mental illness (schizoeffective disorder depressive type), even jokes about the cat not liking me as much have been upsetting. \n\nI ignore a lot of it. I push off that I feel upset because I know that it's probably just hormones or I otherwise think I'm being dramatic. I am self aware and I do try to compensate. \n\nIt might not just be the hormones. It's been tough lately. We're both switching jobs, my last bit of family is moving out of state soon, we're coming up on the 3rd anniversary of a particularly traumatic sexual assult that always makes this a hard time of year for me. \n\nHe's incredibly loving, hugs me when I need it, holds me when I cry, but he isn't very good about cooling it on the potentially hurtful joke/ comments. He even gets a bit defensive from time to time when I try to call him out on stuff. \n\n\nSo, AITA for expecting him to change how he talks to me to be more sensitive for this time? Or is it a reasonable request seeing as it's a change from how things have always been? ",

      "description": "So, I (24 YO) have a friend from college whom I see about once a month, maybe a little less because we're both busy with work. She lives and works in a city with a great downtown: lots of restaurants, bars, museums, and nice places to walk. This city is also fairly close to where I live, so whenever we hang out, we end up meeting somewhere in this city after we get out of work. Now, this friend of mine is very extroverted and sociable, so she has *a ton* of friends that all live near her (it's a college town). What's more, she's worked in a number of restaurants and bars in this city, so she knows a ton of the locals. \n\nI, on the other hand, am pretty introverted and have only a few close friends. Now, I don't begrudge this person for having a thriving social life. But whenever we hang out, one of two things happens: We plan to meet at a restaurant, and friend makes no mention of bringing anybody else. Then, when we arrive at the restaurant, friend has two or more other people in tow--sometimes acquaintances of mine, sometimes people I've never met before. OR, if we go to a bar, friend *invariably* sees at least one other person she knows, and we end up joining them.\n\nAgain, I'm not upset that my friend has many other friends besides me. That's normal and healthy. However, I really hate it when she agrees to hang out with me and shows up with 10 other people. It changes the dynamic of the situation completely. I want to hang out with my friend to see *her*, not make small talk with a bunch of randos or listen in on conversations I know nothing about. I also have to admit to feeling a little slighted... Like, do you hate being with me so much that you feel you need to bring other people to keep you entertained?\n\nI was considering asking her to make our next meeting us-only, but I don't know... I don't know how she'd take it. Is this a reasonable request? AITA for *only* wanting to see my friend and no one else?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This is an ongoing argument I've got going with my family. It has been my long term aim to become a full time ESL teacher (and I already have my qualification), and more recently I've begun to actually look for a job. \n\n  Now the problem comes because i simply have no interest in going to certain countries. In particular I've got no enthusiasm whatsoever for going to China, Vietnam or most other places in the Far East, partially for reasons of distance. But my biggest reason for not wanting to go is, because I'm going to be actually living full-time in a foreign country for any sort of job like this, is that I don't have the remotest interest in actually living there, nor in the language (language lessons in the native language or languages are often an included part of the job benefits), nor the culture of most of these countries. I did have a passing flirtation with Japanese ages ago but this is it. \n\n  This has caused a number of small but frequent arguments with my family who, admittedly enthusiastic to help me, have seemingly missed out the part where I expressed my wish not to go to China, Vietnam, Indonesia etc. They've so far argued that: \n\n* I should just do it for experience. \n\n* I'm making assumptions about countries I don't know anything about because I've never been there. \n\n* I might find on going there that there is something for me to enjoy. \n\n* I can 'always come back home'. \n\n* That I can't be picky about my first ESL job. \n\n* that it's somewhere they'd love to experience themselves and as they'd never have chance, I should go.  \n\n   On the reverse, I feel that they're trying to steer me into making a poor decision for their own sake. They're not the ones who, if they do end up somewhere they hate, aren't going to have to live for at least some months there because yay, contract terms. \n\nSo, am I being an asshole for digging my heels in about this?

      "description": "This constantly weighs me down and spending my first Christmas completely alone is really making me think so I need a little perspective. I apologize in advance if this is so long, I just needed to get it off my chest. TLDR at the end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a 23 year old female. My mom has always had some sort of mental illness. She does not believe in mental illnesses and therefore has never been diagnosed but me and my younger brother were always emotionally abused when we were younger. I remember my brother, in tears, asking to be loved and my mom just demanded that she fed, clothed and educated us well so she did not know what else we would ever want. We were almost products. She strictly monitored our leisure time, had opinions on our friendships and scolded and beat us for not studying. It is really no fault of hers. I think she is completely incapable of the sort of familial love me and my brother want and truly thinks that she is doing all she can to be a good mom. However, I recognize the effects that kind of upbring has on me. I feel very shallow emotions, stemming from a childhood where crying made her angrier. I am too conscious of reading the \"mood\" of a room because I've always had to tiptoe around her. I can easily change my mood and personality to fit the situation, which is something I hate about myself and I still have pretty severe trust issues. \n\nAs I grew up, I learnt how to have a life (and actual friends) without her influencing me. I stopped bringing my friends to my house so I did not need to hear about how she thought my friends were ugly, rude or just gossiping about their bad grades. I spent a lot of time at school \"studying\" and went to see my first movie with friends in high school. I bought my own clothes for the first time. At eighteen, I finally came to terms with the realization that my family was not something to be ashamed of, and told a friend of my family situation for the first time. I went abroad for college because I needed to, mentally. I was finally figuring out exactly who I was and gaining a personality and starting to hate lies with a passion. Interacting with my mom while having an opinion was getting very heated. Right before I left, there was a lot of screaming, mugs being thrown and my belongings being destroyed. \n\nCollege was amazing. Being able to relax at home felt amazing. Going to the mall with my friends on a whim was fun. More importantly, I was distanced from the constant negativity of my mom. I found out that I am a very easygoing, optimistic and occasionally pretty ditzy person and I liked who I was. I was /good/ at my major and I made amazing friends. What alarmed me the most was that I started to feel. I cried for the first time in a movie while in college and now I bawl when watching The Big Sick. I stood up for myself and recently, I told someone to his face that he was a piece of shit instead of letting him walk over me in a group project. That felt so good. I will always be guilty for the large school fees and the debt will bite me in the ass eventually but I would do it again. \n\nI'm in my last year of college and graduating soon. I have my life together. I have a well paying job lined up in a city I am already familiar with. My mom, however, is making plans to eventually move here, overseas, to retire and live with me. She is near retirement and imagines that they would live here on a visitor's visa (3 months at a time, you only have to pop in and out of the country periodically to renew it) and she could take care of any children I would have while I work and not take maternity leave (because my career is important). I panicked. I do not want to live in the same city as her (preferably not the same country) and if I do have children, I will never let her interact with them without me around. I plan to be single (can't figure out if I'm asexual or just emotionally dead inside), adopt two kids and as many dogs as I can and game till I am 90, all things I know she will hate. \n\nI know I am not an asshole for distancing myself from her as a child. However, as an adult, it's been eating away at me. She looks back at my childhood of lies and thinks me and my brother had the best childhood ever. She thinks I am very close to her. Because of her two-faced personality, she does not have friends who she can talk truthfully to so she sees our mother-daughter relationship as very strong. I don't hate her. Our relationship improves greatly with distance and she is fun to talk to if she is happy. As I am an adult, she tries to control me less so we get along better. However, I have gotten worse at letting her inane comments slide and every time I visit her, I get angry so, so much and all that pent up anger kills me from the inside. I want to stay abroad and away from her but she will grow old. I know I should not abandon her but I really, really want to. Money wise, they will be fine. We live comfortably back home, they are very healthy and I plan to always support them financially. However, I don't want to have to interact with my mom more than need be. AITA for avoiding my mom now? We might be able to have a functional mother-child relationship now but AITA for not wanting to even try?\n\nMy dad and I have never been close so I don't mind losing him. Tbh I kind of blame him for letting all the crap in my childhood happen. My brother and I are super close so I will never lose him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR, my mom is emotionally abusive and I grew up twisted. Distanced myself in college but now that I'm graduating, I want to distance myself from her permanently. Mom still loves and misses me. AITA for wanting not to speak to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read through all that, thank you for your time!",

As well as when we are in uni he starts singing k-pop songs without knowing those actual lyrics. I just want my old friend back, not the one that would say \"nani\" after everything I say.

      "description": "So background. About 2 years ago my childhood friend came out to my state to hang out with me for a week. While here he tried to grope my girlfriend while I was at work. She didnt tell me for a about a month afterwords due to how it would affect my relationship with one of my oldest friends. Needless to say after I found I stopped talking to or associated with that person. Anyways I think that is the end of it. Turns out my brother has been hanging out with him regularly back in my home state and now that his wedding is approaching and I'm suppose to be a grooms men he tells me that I can expect this dude to be a groomsman as well. I'm kind of taken aback and this whole wedding was suppose to be me and my family traveling to see the rest of my family. Now I dont want to put my girlfriend in a position to see him standing next to me like he is part of the family when I hate this dude. My brother says this isn't about me and i need to learn to make peace with someone I've known for so long but the thing is why is the burden to make peace even on me? This guy hasn't once tried to apologize for his actions or explain them, just started hanging out with my brother and his fiance instead after i dropped him from my life. So I guess am I the asshole for not wanting to travel across the country and be a part of my brothers wedding because he is having this guy be a groomsman?",

My brother was told on Friday (4 days ago) that he was automatically entered into a tennis competition within his school because he enrolled last year (not sure about the truthfull-ness of this info as a school can’t enroll someone like that without asking) except that my brother (13yo) left his racket at his grandparents house who lives interstate.\n\nInstead, he wants to use my racket which cost me $330 out of my own pocket that I saved. All things I buy, I take good care of and I don’t want damaged, so when I loan out items I make sure they aren’t given out lightly.\n\nHowever whenever I play with my brother in tennis and I win against him, he always goes through tantrums and mimicks players on tv by hitting balls out of the court and smashing his racket on the ground.\n\nIts mainly for this reason I don’t want to loan him the racket, even though he claims he wont do anything like that at school.

He is a really smart, but is a bit lazy and has previously done the same thing previously.

      "description": "I'm a student living in a shared house with 2 friends. We've had a lot of complications with one friend in particular, we'll call her Rambo. It all started when we first got our house. In the past, she has been quite emotional regarding small things. At its peak, it was her threatening to self-harm. For instance, when receiving small criticism, like when my friend confronted her about eating her cereal, this led to a very stressful and dramatic few days of being ignored. She has since received counselling and has otherwise been a model housemate. \n\nWe were planning to live in a big group house together whilst we're all finishing up our studies (7 people). Before we could make proper arrangements, we realised that 2 of our friends (Rambo and John) were beginning a new relationship. This relationship came around very quickly and moved very fast, especially considering John had just come out of a serious relationship a few months before where he was planning to live with his previous gf. They've now been in a relationship around 2/3 months and we're deciding where we're living at the moment. At the point of moving in they will have been together for about 10 months\n\nAt the start of their relationship, they were denying actually being in a relationship. Whenever we would bring it up, this would result in them getting annoyed at us which we feel was quite an immature response. We're worried that this kind of immaturity may show when they have their first argument. If at some point they do argue, and it's a big one that leads to a potential breakup, we're worried this will create a negative impact on the house overall.\n\nBefore they were official, John went on a night out with my other housemate, we'll call her Rocky. Before they left, John started insulting Rocky's appearance and calling her a sloth, which she unsurprisingly took offence to. Now she's on the fence regarding living with him. John is quite an asshole in general. For example, he's insensitive to other people's feelings. When one of our friend's (Adrian) grandmother died, John responded with 'Adrian doesn't even care' even though John hadn't seen Adrian face-to-face. This just seemed insensitive. \n\nAnother issue is that they can be very inconsiderate. When John stays over, they are very loud (having sex, giggling and play fighting) well into the early hours of the morning, effecting Rocky's sleep as her room is directly below theirs. This has continued despite Rocky bringing it up several times. \n\nRambo is a very close friend of ours, so we don't wanna hurt their feelings by just outright saying we don't wanna live with them. But we're worried this kind of behaviour will continue, as mentioning things to them before has done nothing to solve it. \n\nTl:dr Roommate has just got into new relationship with an asshole, now we're worried about living with them next year. \n\nSo please tell me if IATA for not wanting to live with them.",

      "description": "Some background info here: I am in High School, and this is about me getting kicked out of my lunch table because it was \"too crowded\".\nNow the people at the table were people I know and can talk to easily, so it wasn't like they were strangers, and I had been going to school with them for the last 6 years.\n\nAnyways, the table had enough room for all 9 of us and everyone had a good 2 feet of room for themselves. But after a certain point, some of the people decided that there wasn't enough room for everyone. These people eventually got the group to do a vote to kick out people. They all voted against me and my friend(who also sat at the table, and everyone got two votes to kick out two different people). Everyone voted against me and my friend and forced us to leave. They also told us that we weren't social enough and that we either just do homework during lunch or go on our phones. However, I always see them going on their phones and doing homework for their classes. Our lunch is 50 minutes long, and I always make it an effort to not use my phone and be more social for at least the first 30 mins., but they all go on their phones, so I end up having nothing to do besides go on my phone. I was pretty confused about this whole me \"being anti-social, and contributing nothing to the conversation\" part, but I didn't want to confront anyone. They then said that I shouldn't come back to the table. I said, \"fine, whatever\".\n\nFast forward to the next day, and it's lunch period again. My friend and I walk into the lunchroom( We usually get there pretty early, and there isn't a whole lot of people in the lunchroom at that point. We decided to see what happened if we sat there again, and we decided to sit back at that lunch table. Everyone else came and saw that we were still there, but no one said anything. No one brought it up, but we kept getting awkward stares and looks. Eventually, they bring it up and tell us that we are no longer welcome, as there wasn't enough room. My friend and I get up and move to a different lunch table, and we don't have any other friends in that lunch period.\n\nAt this point, I'm feeling pretty hurt and humiliated. So, my friend and I just sit at a lunch table by ourselves. Fast forward a couple of weeks, and I see that two new people are sitting at that lunch table, and have taken our spot. Now, I was just flat out embarrassed at this point, and kind of mad that they kick us out for not having enough space, but they add two different people to the table anyways. \n\nAITA for feeling salty about me and my friend getting kicked out, and not just accepting the fact that they didn't want to sit with my friend and me?\n",

We were smoking weed and having a good time almost everyday after we get back home from work and on weekends. It was unresponsible but fun living that had to end.   \nI have a stressful job where i have to push my limits almost every day. The best way that i know to release the tension is to get high.

Only at my friends house.  \nUsually  i go to my friends house from 8pm, we are hanging out until midnight. I sleep for couple of hours and go home. But my GF is very mad at me for doing this. She is complaining every time. I am saying to her to threat it as my hobby(lost almost all my hobbies due to long hours at work and low energy after it). But she refuse to.  \nAITA for doing this? Should i stop?  \n",

      "description": "I was their only grand child for such a long time, and they'd always give be everything. They'd buy me so much, they'd give me treats, they'd play funny games with me and so on and so forth. Basically treated me as normal grandparents would to their young grand child.\n\nThe problem was they continued to treat me this way until I was maybe 14. They always offered me chocolate when I came over, they'd babytalk me occasionally, they always wanted me to sleep over at their house for no reason other than they wanted to see me. I started to express my discomfort about it when I was probably 10 or 11, but they wouldn't stop. It really set a distance between me and them, because it made me very uncomfortable.\n\nThey have now stopped, thank God. I'm treated much better now, and in a more mature but still familial way. However they do still push to have me sleep at their house (I'm 16, so I don't really want to) and sleep in their bed when I do, and other little things, but nothing bad.\n\nThe thing is, I still feel distanced from them because of how I was babied, and it makes me a little bitter around them. My baby cousin is one, and they treat her like how they treated me for years. That's when you're supposed to baby kids. But hearing them speak to her in that baby tone makes me uncomfortable because that's how they treated me for so long.\n\nI love them very dearly despite everything, they've always been good to me. I never tell them how it still bothers me from time to time. But AITA for still being bitter about it?\n\n",

      "description": "For starters, I Love my grandma and she's amazing with her pets(mostly chickens) \nMy dad wants to give her a dog, which is not a very good idea. She's very small and almost our entire family lives on the same place, so everyone is always on grandma's. The puppy always wants to be at someones feet, if we are not careful, all the time, we'll probably step on her. On that house, everyone is always in a hurry, they won't pay attention. And a small piece of everyone, are entiltled brats.(lots of stories, but that's for a another post)\nThey are horrible to my dog, they run around so she will chase them, but when she gets tired they force her to get up, poking, pushing and screaming. And to make things worse, my dad is a hell of a entitled uncle(yup, not their dad, my dad). Even if he claims to Love our dog, he'll let them do those horrible things, but screams at ME when I tell them to stop\n\"Don't be a brother and let them play, they're just kids\". Once they messed up my dog so bad, that she  didn't eat for two whole days, but hey, they're just kids.\nWhen one of the little shits got a dog, they played with it for like a week and forgot it, cause \"it isn't as pretty as yours\" They still play with it sometimes, but the dog hates them all and it's starting to get agressive, unlike mine. Imagine what they will do, to a small, cute and new puppy, that wouldn't be able to fight back\nThat's only some of the reasons why I don't think sending a puppy there is a good idea. I Love my grandma, but she doesn't have the condition to take care of the puppy neither the enviroment. I've getting some angry looks from my father because of that and he thinks it's unfair of me, especially because my grandma really wants a dog\nSo, Am I the asshole for not wanting to send the puppy there?\n\nPs. Grandma doesn't even know  we are giving her a dog, nor that we have one.",

This afternoon (3 PM Sunday) I walk-in, put my name on the sign in sheet, and wait patiently. Waiting area is fairly full. Shop closes at 5pm. No one says anything about not taking anymore walk-ins or appointments only. More people walk in after me, as well. There were three barbers cutting. Two barbers leave early leaving one guy to finish his appointments *and* the remaining walk-ins. He gets in an argument with the second guy when he goes to leave and continues ranting while cutting heads. I started wondering if I should just go but I'm starting a new job tomorrow and need to look presentable. I would have left at any point had they just said something.

      "description": " \n\nBit of backstory:  \nSo I work part time and schedules for the most part are pretty random. Sometimes you can request certain days that you want to work, and so I always request Sunday, Monday, and Friday(and almost always get them). Our schedules always come out 1-2 weeks in advance so we have time to memorize our schedules. We use the when I work app which makes you confirm your schedules before you take them. This has worked very well up until last week. I always check my schedules when I get them and then the day before my shift just to double check everything.   \nWhen they sent out the schedules for this week (October 29- November 4) I was scheduled to only work Friday November 2 and Sunday November 4, both from 4pm-8pm. This caught me by surprise as I wasn’t scheduled for Monday as I typically am, but I confirmed them anyway. So Sunday October 28 arrives and I had a shift that evening. I checked my schedule for the next 2 weeks as I had arrived to work early. My schedule was as previously mentioned.   \nMonday after school my mother had an extremely important meeting that she couldn’t miss. This meeting was from 5:00-9:30 and was half an hour away from were we live. Since I didn’t have work my mother told me I had to babysit my siblings until she got home. Everything was fine until about 5:15 when I got a text from my GM asking if I was running late to work. As I wasn’t scheduled for work I was very confused and asked if they texted the wrong person since my next shift wasn’t until Friday. They said no and sent a screenshot of the When I Work app saying I had a shift from 5-9:30. I checked the app and it asked me to confirm a shift for Monday 5-9:30. This shift had not been there less than 24 hours earlier when I had last checked. On top of that my Friday shift was changed to 5-10:30 and my Sunday shift was canceled entirely. I apologized but told the GM that I couldn’t come in as I had to babysit my siblings. They ended up working down a member, although luckily the store wasn’t too busy. AITA for not showing up?  \nTL:DR   \nDidn’t show up for work due to a last minute schedule change I was unaware of and had prior obligations to fulfill. Store was down a member the whole night.

      "description": "Okay so let me start this all at the beginning of what caused this event to occur. Me and my friend, let's say Lily for anonymity, have known each other since the fall of our first year of college. I started to like her after a couple weeks of talking, and I asked her out. But she said no and I was pretty cool with that. \n\nFast forward to about a month ago in January, and we are still really good friends. We were talking one late night and one thing lead to another and we planned on going on a date during President's Day weekend. Although she would answer my question, \"Will you be my girlfriend?\", after the date as she wanted to see how things went. But disaster strikes and she has to go into work on the day of our date as she forgot her work started that weekend. After she told me that she went completely radio silent the next day and for the following week or so. But she finally started texting again on Friday of the following week and Saturday we had a Skype call.\n\nTo my surprise Lily explained that she had a boyfriend now that she had met somewhere in the middle of that week of radio silence and didn't completely understand what was wrong with that. I was visually and verbally frustrated of course and we ended the call since I really couldn't speak more. I asked her, \"What was your answer going to be after the date?\", and she said, \"Yes.\", and I just couldn't believe that and couldn't understand this complete 180.\n\nShe ignores me for half a week only reading my messages as I was just asking to talk. We finally talked last night and I got what I needed out. I wasn't hostile or angry toward her. Just upset and I really couldn't be mad at her because I cared about her a lot. She understands what she did was wrong and is having a discussion with her boyfriend about what to do and how he feels about it. Mostly the conversation was just me asking questions of why she did things and explaining my feelings on the situation. She explained that she didn't mean to hurt me and she had met this person in class and developed feelings quite fast. It still is strange to me and frustrated me, but I still care for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would you guys have done in this situation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Last week I went to Taj Mahal. Anyone who has gone there would probably remember the flock of locals who swarm tourists to be their tourguides and/or photographers. Our hired driver already warned us that their initial asking price will be 10x the actual value so either haggle to the end or just ignore them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo 1 man repeatedly bugged us to take pics of us with his camera, put the photos on a thumbdrive and a DVD for a lovely price of 2000 rupees ($29). Despite us refusing each time, he still followed, and eventually offered to take pics for us. We told him to just take the pic with our camera, but he still took 20 snaps with his own camera in the end. At the end of our trip, he pestered us again to buy his snaps saved in storage devices at the initial asking price. We told him for the last time, we do not need them as we have the pics in our own camera, but we would like to thank him for taking pics of us so I tipped him 500 rupees ($7.25, judging from the local price, enough to buy 4-6 meals). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, he took the money, clicked his tongue, pocketed the money and walked away. I felt like shit now, as we are kind of touring and we could probably do our part for local economy (which looks really poor by our standard), but at the same time, we have limited cash with us and rather not give away that much for something we don't need.

      "description": "Loooooooong.\n\nI met a friend about 6 months ago on a night out. We immediately clicked and have a lot in common. We share a similar past of violent exes, hers recent, mine 8 years ago. \n\nHowever; she brings no end of drama to herself. She jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend. The relationships are toxic entirely, and the boyfriends move into the family home after weeks each time (3 boyfriends since I’ve known her). I am a stoically single human. I love sex and getting with guys, but I cannot process having sex with someone I love due to past trauma so I am pretty settled I will be single forever. Each time she comes to me asking for advice as she says she appreciates my opinion and each time I do not want to be that single girl that makes her friends break up from their exes. But these guys are genuine dickbags. Most recent one was super jealous all the time. Always calling me asking g whether she was with me (she was), my friend gets so mad she beats him up (I was super mad at this as I have been in a physically abusive relationship and abuse is wrong regardless) he steals her car and smashes it into another car. Loads of other dramas too but she “loves him” and keeps coming to me to get advice. Even on Xmas day she finds out he is cheating on her with 4 other women and calls me in tears and I have to say that I cannot deal with it on Xmas day and she should go home to her parents. (I live alone, she lives at home)\n\nRecently my mental health took a real turn for the worse and I quit my high paying, senior role with no notice on the spot 2 weeks before Xmas. Since then I’ve been shutting myself away to try work on myself. New Year’s Eve we were meant to go out to my friends house and she lies and says she can’t as her mum is telling her she needs to stay in. Her mum messsges me worried that she is back with this latest dickbag, so I know she is lying and she ditched us to go with this guy that 2 days before we stop everything to support her dealing with. I feel utterly betrayed, to Ditch me for this guy who cheated on her to go sit in a field and smoke weed with him is a huge betrayal to me when I have done so much, at the detriment to my own mental health to support her. \n\nShe messaged our group chat today wanting to meet up this weekend saying she has ditched this guy for good and she just wants to be with family and friends and get better. Which is great. But I just can’t get over it that quickly. It’s been 6 months if her self inflicted drama and she never cares about anything going on with me. When I quit my job she literally wa alike “oh that’s not good” and carried on talking about her stupid boyfriend and her self inflicted issues that could be solved easily by just staying away from him.\n\nAITA for telling her today that I need to re-evaluate our friendship? I feel like I am too unwell atm to take on more of her stuff. She is messaging now saying she couldn’t cope without me and feels so awful and she will make it up to me. And I’d like to think this is true, and a small part of me wants to be there to help her get over her demons and get on the straight and narrow. But right now, I jut can’t. The reason I think it’s an asshole move is because she doesn’t have many friends. She says I am her best friend, to everyone. If I leave her she will likely just get back into another toxic relationship. So, AITA for cutting her off? \n\nTLDR: friend who causes her own drama with relationships is always pulling on my emotions to support her. This has been difficult for me as I am suffering with MH atm. I want to cut friend off even though I know this will leave her alone. ",

      "description": "Hey, first post here, I'll try and keep it on the shorter side.\n\nSo I'm 27M and have been with my 23yo GF for about a year and a half now. We moved in together last October with the understanding that she doesn't make enough to split the rent, but we would figure something out.\n\nI only make $2500/mo and the rent alone is $1500/mo. I (foolishly) agreed to let her pay for the Cable and the Electric bill each month because I know she doesn't make that kind of money just yet...she works at a private kindergarten that pays some shit like $10/hr. As it turns out, our cable bill is legit under $5/mo and cable is $140/mo.\n\nSince we've been *dating*, she's always complained/bugged me about wanting to go on vacations. I would always tell her, I can't afford that, I have to save up for the apartment. Now it's, I can't afford that I spend more than half of my monthly income on rent.\n\nSo about a week or so ago, she randomly texts me a picture of $50 flights to Fort Lauderdale and a link to a $50/night AirBnb. I text her back saying I'm sorry I wish, but I just can't afford it right now.\n\nShe goes, \"Okay, surprise, I'm going to get it for us as a special treat!\"\n\nFast forward to tonight, we're getting dinner and drinks, and I ask her (bc I genuinely forgot) if she still owes me money that I've lent her. She goes \"yeah I still owe you $160\", so I'm like okay cool just making sure. \n\nTHEN she goes, \"but if I'm paying you that back, I'm not paying for your vacation to Florida.\"\n\nI legitimately felt like I wanted to cry. She's my first legit girlfriend, and no one's ever been that nice to me and offer to take me on a vacation (not counting family trips when I was like 12-16).\n\nSo I said, I can't afford that because I have to pay the whole rent every month. She goes \"sucks for you guess I gotta find someone else to go with. **I** pay for the dinner bill **and** tip, and just stop talking to her.\n\nWe get home, and it's been snowing outside, my boots are wet. I walk maybe 10 feet into the apartment so I can sit and take my shoes off when she goes \"can you stop walking everywhere with your dirty shoes.\"\n\nI immediately snap back, \"Don't tell me what to do in MY house when I'm the one who pays for it.\"\n\nNeedless to say, she didn't like that very much...went into the bedroom and hasn't come out since.\n\nSo reddit...AITA?",

      "description": "My brother and I both have toddlers. My mom babysits my nephew full time cause both parents work.\n\nAbout 2.5 weeks ago my kid got sick, nasty and super contagious disease. Contagious for up to 3 weeks. We agreed to keep the boys apart for three weeks.  No issue. Son's symptoms cleared pretty quickly and we agreed we would both get together with the family for Thanksgiving, even though it was just shy of the 3 week cut off.\n\nThen my husband got it. I called the family to say we were going to not join holiday festivities in case hubby was contagious (it was only a week to Thanksgiving). My brother decided the boys had to be apart for and addition 1.5 weeks. Ok. \n\nWell, by Thanksgiving, I knew that if my son was contagious it was only going to be if he got saliva on something and someone else put it on their mouth (like a toddler). So I called my mom and we went to visit her. Cause she's not a toddler and not going to chew on his toys.\n\nWell, my brother was really upset and got into it with our mom (not me) because he thought she'd get it and infect his kid.\n\nTurns out he thinks my kid gave it to me and I acted as a carrier and infected my husband. And I could still be contagious. \n\nBut my guess is that, since I work with kids and there were a few other cases at that work, I acted as a carrier and have it to my son. So I assume I'm not contagious any more cause that was well over 3 weeks ago. \n\nMy brother never said it was me he was worried about. So I never thought twice about seeing my mother for the holiday a few hours before she went to see the rest of the family. And I never explained what I thought happened \n\nSo AITA for assuming that I'm not contagious and that I was fine visiting my mom? (We left husband safely sequestered at home).",

It's something I'm passionate about and so I've poured a lot of energy into it in the last few weeks, and it's starting to go well because my boss is coming to me for things like rush jobs.\n\nThat was what happened today. One of the others submitted a piece of work that was, bluntly, awful and the deadline for it to be done is tomorrow. My boss asked if I could get in there and rework it, and I did it, mostly by scrapping 85% of what was there and starting from scratch. So far, so straightforward.\n\nI was ready to stick that with my other work to be invoicing when I found out why the other guy's work was so late and so bad - his father died. Now, I feel conflicted about invoicing my work - I absolutely did the work and did it better, but by charging for that the other guy is probably going to lose out.\n\nSo, would I be the asshole for invoicing this or not?

      "description": "Sorry if this ends up being a long post, I’ll try to condense it as much as possible.\n\nAlso this is a throw away account since other ppl follow my actual one.\n\nso I’m friends with this girl and we’ve been friends for about three years now. we met in college bc we were roommates as freshmen, then sophomore year we got our separate apartments, and now we are juniors and roommates again. \n\nDuring freshman year, we had some struggles with our friendship, but it was nothing more than just some dorm-sharing girl drama (easily annoyed by one another, feeling left out, not liking each other’s friends, etc.) which is mainly why we didn’t live together sophomore year. but then we became closer again and decided to live together junior year again in an apartment.\n\nShe has a boyfriend who is super overly possessive and doesn’t like when she goes out to parties or basically does anything (i’ve tried to have nights of just hanging out in the living room with her but she always ends up going back to her room by midnight bc he wants to facetime her). I’ve constantly tried to get her to come out to parties with me or do other things, but she always either blames her boyfriend or last minute says she doesn’t feel good or is “tired” and wants to stay in instead. Thankfully, I’m bar-age so I can go out to the bars with other friends if she bails.\n\nHer bf also comes down to visit her every. single. weekend. (I wish i was exaggerating, but i’m not.. and the weekends he didn’t visit, she went home) and when they visit, they never want to do anything. They usually just sit in her room for hours only to leave occasionally to make food or go out to eat.\n\nI told her that I kind of considered living on my own for senior year bc her boyfriend was always here and even when he wasn’t she didn’t want to ever do anything with me. She explained she was kind of hurt by me saying this and it was a wake up call to her to try and change her patterns and make the most of her college experience. Bc she agreed to this, i agreed to resign our lease with her for next year.\n\nthings were relatively okay up until about a week ago when I felt I was being very helpful and generous to her; offering her rides to go get groceries (she doesn’t have a car), driving her to her internship so she didn’t have to deal with the bus, giving advice on things with family, helping her with resume stuff, etc. So when I asked if she’d maybe want to go to a party with me that following weekend I figured she’d maybe say yes since I was pretty generous to her and this was something I wanted to do, right? Nope.\n\nI was pretty annoyed that she gave the same “my bf wouldn’t be happy if I went” excuse when I asked but I just eventually shrugged it off and decided maybe we can just do something the next night instead. I suggested it, she said maybe, and then her boyfriend announces he’s coming to visit her (even though she saw him last weekend and will see him again next weekend for valentine’s day). And, yup, you guessed it, they were in her room the whole weekend. Oh, and they also smoked weed to the point where I could smell it through the whole apartment (i don’t mind the smell, it’s just a little distracting and annoying to smell it at 1am the night before Monday classes). \n\nI basically decided that I’ve given up. I’m done offering rides, suggesting to do things together, trying to be a friend, etc. bc i feel like i’m just being used or taken for granted. I’m literally her only girl friend she has, and i’m kind of starting to maybe see why. \n\nBc I’ve given up, I didn’t text her this morning about walking to classes together (we have the exact same schedule since were in the same major) and she didn’t end up even coming to class. Why? bc her boyfriend stayed at the apartment until 3pm Monday. \n\nTL;DR: AITA for basically giving up on a friendship that started off my freshman year of college, bc my friend has basically chosen her boyfriend over me and let’s him control her life despite me offering lots of assistance and help for her?",

      "description": "So some background, I’m a college student and I have been friends with this person for 4 months. We send a lot of memes to each other. So about 3 weeks ago my friend was complaining how I never ask them to hangout, I personally thought I asked them to hangout enough and they always said they were busy, but I said I would try to ask more.\n\nNow it’s been about 2 weeks, since then and we’ve hung out one time. I’ve asked a lot to hangout, but they always said they were busy. For the past week I’ve been trying a lot to hangout and talk with them in person, since I want to talk about something important and our friendship, but I keep getting told no. This weekend comes up, I ask if they have just 20 minutes to meet up to talk and they say no, but next week they think they can. \n\nToday, I was really frustrated about how I was trying to hangout/talk to this person a lot, but they said no so many times, so I made this image in a meme format and sent it to them. For reference the top is what they sent me 2 weeks ago and the bottom are texts from between yesterday to about a month back. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/coBW9Od\n\nThey got mad and said I was being really petty. \n\n\nFor reference, we live less than a mile away and they only have class 3 days a week. I really wanted to talk about it in person, but they just kept saying no to every chance, so I called them out. I know this post is from my side and that it can be biased, especially since I made the picture with the texts, but I don’t think it strays too much from the truth.\n",

      "description": "I already know this is going to be controversial but I really want reddits opinion on this. \n\nI think it is important to note a few things. \n1. my parents are divorced. Following the schedule, I take the bus to my dad's house, and my mom picks me up around 6 on her weeks. No matter what, I always go to my dad's house.\n2. My dad is low middle class. Far too often he forgets Or can't afford to pay bills, he has dropped me from his phone bill, and I'm even used to coming home and realizing that the power Or wifi is turned off. \n3. He got the two dogs when they were about 6 months old and they just turned 1. \n4. The dog in question, nicki, has decreased motor function (cerebellum hyperplasia), and because of this, it's very difficult for her to walk.\n5. I haven't acually confronted my dad about this yet, but I am really considering it.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can state my side. The reason that I think we should get rid of her is because of the stress she puts on our family. My dad has anger issues, and while he doesn't hit or cuss (very much), he still has a short temper, and more often than not he just yells at nicki when she whines. Speaking of which, she can get provoct to whine very easily. I've seen her whine for a multitude of reasons: 1. there is something *near* her( not even in front of her, I've seen her whine, and upon me moving something more than twice her body length away from her, she would stop whining) 2. She knows my sister is home, but can't see her (I've seen her move across the house to my sister's bedroom and just lay in front of her door, all while whining the whole time.) etc. That said, she also can't really hold her bladder. Assuming she hasn't pooped and peed all over the living room and entrance, she can't really get over the 2 inch or so height gap between the walkway and front door. And this is also another reason I want to get rid of her. \n\nThose of you who have kids know how I feel, having to wake up at 3 am to clean up poop and pee, getting home to a huge mess, constant whining no matter what you do. It's hard to deal with. I hope that this post isn't too short, or that it blaitantly makes me look like a douche.",

If one device in our network streams netflix in 1080p, others can barely look at videos, nothing more than 480p is possible.\n\nThere is not much we can do about this internet situation, it's just that the cables are quite old and due to us living in a valley mobile internet is just as bad. It's really annoying.\n\nThen there is my sister, not knowing about technology, just watching netflix all day on her smart tv she got for christmas. And im okay with watching youtube in just 480p and waiting a little longer to browse websites.\n\nBut when I want to play any online game (I mostly play about 1-2 hours, not all day) that is even remotely competitve it's just not fun. My ping spikes to 300 and I just lag out completely.\n\nThat is why I have to block her from the Wi-Fi, (our router doesnt have Qos, so i have to block her ip adress completely). Most of the time I only kick her out for the time I want to play my games, but honestly I sometimes forget to put her back in after I stop playing.\n\nMost of the time she doesnt even look at her TV and is on her smartphone, or she is even already asleep. I tried talking to her, but she doesn't get how that's an issue to me. \n\n\nSo, what do you think, AITA for kicking my sister out of our Wi-fi network while I play online video games? ",

Now Im feeling actually quite shitty about the whole situation but in the end I also feel like a total gutless asshole for quitting over the phone.\nBut I also have a whisper in my head that I could not have done anything else anymore and I'm not to hate for breaking off via phone so AITA?\nI just want to know If I should also hate me for breaking off over the phone or only for kinda destroying her. (she was really attached to me but as stated I don't see any future as partners and it's better this for the Long run) ",

      "description": "Obligatory *was.* And by that, I mean almost *twelve years ago.*\n\nWhen I was in second grade, I was part of a super Protestant charter school down South. Nice complex. While I wouldn't call it strict, there were very mouthy staff, and God help you if you breach dress code or get the slightest bit dirty. I didn't really \"get\" Christ, but it gave me some place to be, so for the first grade it went okay.\n\nThen I moved to second. There was a new challenge.\n\nLike many others, I had tormentors, but one I didn't take as seriously was a gal. We'll call her Dixie. I think she's why I picked up a swearing habit. Bitch was a redhead twice my size - and made sure I knew that, because she wanted me to know that I was *beneath her*. She'd trail behind me in the hallway, repeat  hide my homework behind bookcases I couldn't possibly reach without unleashing my most autistic form. Now if this was adulthood we wouldn't be having this discussion, but I was a second grader. You just didn't do that shit.\n\nMe, initially rational (and a snitch I guess), decided to tell the teachers that *hey Dixie is being annoying, can you please make her stop.* After promising that, the principal decides to up and do nothing.\n\nThe bullying got worse. I mean, thanks to her, I got to know what mud tasted like. At this point, something had to be done, and the only question was *what?* The teachers were always watching me because unlike Dixie, mama decided to let the teachers know I was an angry little shit. Add to that me skipping all the God segments to fuck off and do whatever, and you got a faculty that didn't really want much to do with me.\n\nOf course, getting Dixie to leave me be meant taking more creative measures than smacking people upside the head with church ornaments, or some other form of sucker-punching. I'd endure being nothing for a while until, for God knows why, one of the daytime shows were on. Someone trying to figure out who the baby daddy was.\n\nThat channel got changed as soon as mama walked back in the room, but when I heard all the screeching on TV, i decide, yeah, that's brilliant! That'll put some attention on her. I get the stepstool, fetch the test, fill in the lines with pink, and call it a day.\n\nSo, when bully leaves the classroom, I slip the test in her bookbag pocket. She pulls it out in the middle of class, and the teacher starts *screaming.* Like, freaking out, holding her mouth. Like I didn't read emotions at all (I must have lost a hundred bucks to scammers at lunchtime) but even I could tell she was really uncomfortable.\n\nAll I saw was the girl getting picked up by her parent in a dinky Cadillac and zooming off from the lot. No one really knew what happened to Dixie, but I didn't have to deal with her again, which gave me all the peace and quiet as I wanted. Not that it mattered, because a week or two later I ended up transferring into public school for being a 'bad fit,' but what can I do.\n\nIt wasn't easy to reflect on something that happened so long ago, but...it's over. It's been dead and buried as the teacher probably intended.\n\nTake being an unknowing kid, take all sentiment, all of that nonsense out of the picture: did this make me an asshole? Is there something I'm missing here? I trust that you guys can pick this apart to the truth.",

      "description": "I am a very short person, so short that my feet do not normally touch the ground when properly sitting in any sort of chair. For further context, I also have back problems so sitting for extended periods of time make me uncomfortable. Ever since I have sat in chairs I have opted out of the traditional posture and have usually opted to sit crisscross. I typically start by sitting in the typical position with my feet dangling, but one by one pull them up. As time progresses I usually uncross one leg and put it directly up to hold it against my chest. I fidget a lot and as time progresses I go through the sitting positions dozens of times. I consistently do this in class, leisurely at home eating meals, during meetings, and of course at work. I have always regarded this as jus having an eccentric sitting style. However, recently as I have started university I have felt very insecure about my seating positions and that maybe I am being disrespectful to my teachers and boss. So I have to ask, am I an asshole (more, am I being disrespectful) by not sitting properly in class? Am I ruining the furniture by putting my feet on it? These are typically plastic seats connected to a desk. I would like to say that no one has mentioned anything to me personally, no one has even given me a dirty look. This is something I'm really on the fence about because on one hand I feel that putting my shoes on the chair might make someone uncomfortable or feel that I am destroying their property, but on the other hand I feel that truly no one cares or even looks or pays attention and I'm just over thinking it. However, I just wanted to post here to hear what others believe. Thank you for any judgement. ",

One employee particularly constantly states that he was a manager somewhere else ALL THE FUCKING TIME. After just a week it has grinded my gears so much I had to say something. \n\nFor me, it's not the fact that he was a manager somewhere else, it's the fact that after saying this, he will command other employees around and act as though God died and he has stepped in. Also, he is not a manager here. He is an employee, just like the other 6 employees who are all on the same pay rate (this was visually proven, which is why I know). He also makes it seem as though he has some fiery work ethic. However, he stands around lazily like all the other employees while I do inventory, product placement, web development, marketing, pricing, and other assorted responsibilities involved with my job. I was not asked to do any of it. Our bosses love seeing ownership of ones responsibilities which I cordially oblige every shift. The mentioned employee does not do any of this, despite \"being a manager somewhere else\". \n\nSo, AITA? Thanks in advance to anyone who can elaborate with their point of view!

      "description": "I \\[26M\\] went to the bar by myself after a bad day. I met this girl (Blue) \\[21F\\] and her friend (Red) \\[21F\\]. Eventually I made it clear after a bit I was trying to meet someone, short or long term. Blue said she's been talking to this guy but it's not anything and she doesn't really like him. She just left an abusive 2 year relationship and just met him. Red interjected with \"She's single\" multiple times and was insistent I should make a move. \n\nThey mention the guy has no phone, no car, 3 kids, 2 baby moms and is controlling. She is going to tell him to back off. We dance/drink and she's saying how fun I am, she wants me to go to this party and both of them insisted on getting my snap chat. Eventually I drove them home.\n\nWe start snapping she's telling me she's having that conversation with him. I say \"okay because I'd be interested in dating and not really friendship.\" She's like \"yeah btw I want you to come to this party with me\" Super insistent. I go and the other guy is there. She says \"I had that talk with him but I told him like 2 weeks ago he could come to this party\" I'm confused, whatever. I spend the entire night with Blue. Eventually the guy spends the rest of the night puking. At some point I asked why she would invite me out with the guy. \"I made it pretty clear I was into you, this is pretty uncomfortable\" \"I didn't think about it, I wanted you to come\" We all stay at a friends house.\n\nKeep talking everyday, we're multiple plans for the upcoming weekend. I'm really into her by now, like in a way I haven't felt about a girl in awhile. After some flaky replies I ask like \"hey what's up, anything going on?\" she said \"Nothing. But I'm just wanting friends, I already told you I was talking to someone\"\n\nThen she back tracked what she said she wanted from me and now wanted to bring this guy along on a night out together we had planned. She says how fun I am, want's to go out and wants to have fun because she's finally out of her old abusive relationship. I stopped replying, I felt rejected and confused.  I feel guilty that I'm pulling some r/niceguys stuff but I feel like I was upfront about my expectations. I felt like we were dating and was vocal about it. \n\nAITA for not wanting to be her friend? If she had said from the beginning she wanted to be just friends I would've been fine. She's made me feel like maybe I was forcing it. And since meeting Red at the bar we have become friends. I have plans with her and her SO. I ask Red if she knows anything and she's said \"I'm not sure what she's doing, I've told her how much I hate that guy.\" I feel weird being friends with her best friend and not wanting to be her friend because of my own issues. It's been a week but I can't get this situation out of my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: Met a girl, said I'd want a relationship, we hang out a bit. She goes with another guy, still wants to be friends. I don't.",

I've met her, she used to live near me until she moved away. We were pretty close.\nNow. Maybe a month or so ago our messages stated to become a but more flirtatious. \n\nNow I didn't mind this. I found this girl attractive and I would be open to a relationship if we got further into the future and got to know each other even more.\nWe carried on chatting and, to me, but obviously not to her, it felt like we were unofficially dating.\nAs I asked, \"What are We?\"\n\nTo which I got this response.\n\n\"I just don't know.. I'm really confused.. Because you're really nice but.. Idk. I've been chatting to someone else aswell named ____\"\n\nNow, I just found this incredibly immature. But okay. Whatever. I decided to ask about ____, maybe they were an amazing match.\n\nTurns out they'd been chatting for a week at most, and that _____ lived over 8 hours away if you were to take a plane. Now, obviously I don't care that it was long distance. I just felt slightly offended. I've had bad long distance relationships before, where I've been cheated on. But that's just me being bias and I didn't bring that up in conversation.\nAfter that, our flirting dropped drastically.\n\nLater on that day. She revealed to me that they'd started dating. I didn't object or say anything. Cool. She obviously preferred this girl over me and I couldn't change that.\n\nOur flirting stopped completely. I didn't want to get in the way of this relationship and I was feeling a little disappointed.\n\nOkay. So maybe a week ago, she broke up with this girl. And she told me, then proceeded to say,\n\n\"Now we can date!\"\n\nI said no. Because I didn't like feeling like something that this girl had as a second choice. And even if that wasn't her intent, I can't help feeling like that. But she has been awfully cold with me lately and I miss our friendship. I just don't feel like getting into a relationship with her. \n\nAITA?",

We decided that before the party we would all meet at Gerald’s house and take a ride in Gerald’s car because it would be packed and finding parking for a single car would be easier than finding parking for 5 cars. \n\nIt’s all fine and dandy through the party and then Gerald says, guys, we’ll be leaving at 2AM (it was 1:30 AM). We were fine with it. Victor decides to go over to where Karl was to tell him that we’re leaving in 30 minutes to which he replies: “Nah man I’m having fun”. Victor didn’t think anything of this because we still had 30 minutes. \n\nAt 1:55, Victor goes over to Karl and says: “dude our ride is leaving”. \nKarl: “Nah man, I aint leaving”\nVictor:”Idk man find another ride then”\nKarl: “nah you guys aren’t gonna leave me”\n\nWe walked up to the car and left.  When we’re just a few blocks away from the hotel a friend of ours call that was in the party calls someone in the car and it was Karl: “WHAT THE FUCK YOU ASSHOLES, MY FUCKING STUFF IS IN GERALD’S CAR, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ALL OF YOU I LITERALLY DONT WANT TO FUCKING SEE ANY OF YOU EVER AGAIN”. \n\nPersonally I laughed because it seemed childish and petty. Whatever. We stopped at a local 24 hour diner and when we were leaving Karl shows up at the parking lot asks to get his stuff from the car and leaves. \n\nIt’s been like 2 years and I haven’t talked to Karl but he has slowly rejoined the group and nobody else seems to care he didn’t say he was sorry for being a little bitch (I think he was being a little bitch). When he’s at the same place I am I just don’t talk to him, if he asks something or says a joke I’ll laugh maybe but I don’t directly get involved with him. I think he should apologize. More recently he’s started to speak to me directly but I just give the vaguest excuse to leave and go socialize with someone else. \n\nAITA for expecting someone to recognize he was just a whiney child or should I just forget anything happened?\n\n",

      "description": "My mom isn't in the best of health. She's always had surgeries and a list of other ailments. Yesterday she got on group text and asked all four of her children to a 8pm conference call. \n\n8 o'clock rolls around and the call commences. There aren't 4 kids on the line but 2. I'd like to mention it was the only 2 kids out of the 4 who had children of their own. This isn't important but it pisses me off. \n\nThe call in total lasted about 10-13 mins before shit fell apart. \n\nThe call consisted of what we can do to help my mom who lives in a different state. As were talking I'm patrolling the house making sure my kids are in bed. As I'm doing this low and behold my boys who share a room are going at it. I do my daddy duty and go on. About 10 minutes later I catch them doing something else. I honestly can't remember because as soon as I got the first 3 words out my sister asks me if I take this seriously because I'm reprimanding my kids while on this call. I softball it then she hits me with something along the lines of, \"Your wife is lazy because she cant keep the kids in the room for 10 minutes while you're on a important call.\" I said, \"You expect my wife to split herself into 3 separate people and watch all 3 kids simultaneously?\" \n\nI'd like to add that my wife has Lupus and Fibro. Not only that but my family is well aware the my wife has Lupus and Fibro. Not only that but you scheduled a fucking conference call the minute my kids go to bed. I digress.\n\nWe go at it, I tell her off and ask my mom to finish. She doesn't say anything for a good 10 seconds so I hang up. \n\nThis morning I woke up to a text from my mom explaining how my sister was right and I need to apologize to her. In a nice way I told her to get bent and my sister is an ass. \n\n\n",

      "description": "Just for clarification and simplicity, I am going to call the peer in question Jeremy (and that's not his real name) and say that he might have some special needs. A teacher accompanies him to most of my classes, and from what I've heard, I think that might be the case. I'm not a psychologist, so I'm not too sure.\n\nSo, here's the details. I am currently a senior in high school, and the seniors have their own separate wing in the cafeteria space to sit. I sit in this wing with my lifelong friends, and we always allow other people to chill with us and talk if they want. We usually just goof off and quote bad 80's movies, but occasionally we talk about some pretty political stuff.\n\nWhy do I mention this? Because Jeremy decided to sit with us one day during lunch (I didn't have a problem with that initially), but he quickly asserted himself as the \"stinker\" in the group. Every time we would talk about something that would invite some serious discussion, he would either say something so unrelated to the topic or he would say the most offensive thing relating to that topic thinking he's funny. That pisses everybody off and makes the whole table cringe. \n\nFor example, if we would be talking about politics, he would either start talking about Fortnite and throw a fit at the rest of the table for the rest of us about not wanting to talk about it, or he would say the most offensive thing relating to that topic thinking he's funny. I even remember one time when we were talking about Holocaust deniers, and he looked straight at me and says, \"Jews deserve to burn in hell, anyway\" with a smile on his face, and this kid knows I am Jewish.\n\nIn addition, he sits next to me in English and in Math, and he ALWAYS COPIES MY PAPER. He doesn't even attempt to hide it, either. When there's a group project, he asks to be in the group that me and my friends are in, but he never does any of the work, and throws a fit when we don't actually want him in any groups in the future.\n\nThis leads to me sitting down to write this post, am I the asshole for not wanting to associate with him? I really do feel like I am. He's never really had any friends, and I think being with our group has given him some sense of accompaniment, but he's toxic to the rest of us. \n",

We hinted that we might not be able to go and she sort of freaked out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, SIL calls and asks if she’d be able to come over. She is cleaning her closet out and has a bunch of old clothes to give me. I tell husband and he is completely shocked. He said that she has never given anyone her old clothes before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe comes over with two full sized garbage bags full of clothes, and we start going through them. They are all designer clothes in mint condition. I’m modelling them for her, and she is hyping me up, telling me how beautiful I am. I’ve never really been accepted by my husband’s family, so this whole thing really meant a lot to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then she gets to the bottom of the clothes, and pulls out this absolutely stunning dress. She tells me that she wants me to wear the dress to her wedding. And that it has such strong sentimental value to her, and that she’d never give it to anyone else except for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her that I loved the dress, but we still weren't sure if we'd be able to make it due to cost. She was very upset, and told us that after all she had done for us, she at least expected us to be there for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter, my husband told me he felt guilty for missing her wedding after she had been so nice to us. Along with the clothes she gave me, she has also given us her old car, and other misc. stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided to sit down and crunched the numbers again since I just got a raise at work. If we put a little bit aside each month, and pull some money from our saving, we should be able to afford it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m still nervous though. If we have any unexpected expenses, we’d be in trouble. And let’s be honest, if something goes wrong it’s going to be when we are broke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for still not wanting to go to the wedding after everything she's done for us? I feel like a total piece of garbage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My best friend has been broken up with her ex for about 8 months and they are on friendly terms, but I know my friend still has feelings for him.  She has always made that clear. I didn’t hang out with her ex at all for about the first 4-5 mon they were broken up because I was conveniently traveling at the time. \n\nI started hanging out with her ex about 3 mon ago, when I got back into town, and our friendship has grown a bit during that time.  I’ve had a really hard time navigating this situation because I have been friend’s with her ex independently of her (i.e. we didn’t meet through her, but we’re all students at the same school, different years though).  Unfortunately, he is one of my few other friends that lives in my area and the only other friend that shares an interest in packing (going on trips with pack animals), which is something I don’t feel comfortable doing on my own, so I would be giving up a bit on pursuing that hobby with my pet donkey for the time being without his friendship. \n\nIn an effort to try and remain friends with both parties, I have tried very hard to be completely transparent and keep my friend in the loop on everything that happens between her ex and I. I let her know when we hang out/see each other, details about our conversations, etc.  Basically trying to make sure she isn’t left to speculate whether we are acting in any way besides friends, which we aren’t.  I honestly have zero interest in him as anything other than friends.\n\nAt points, she has said that she thinks it’s a good idea for both of us that we are friends. She knows that we both don’t have a ton of other friends in the area and share a lot of the same interests, so I think she was trying to be noble and unselfish in that statement.  I question in light of the recent reaction she had to the news that I am\ngoing on a trip together with her ex (a trip she was also invited on) that she may not have sincerely meant it.\n\nObviously, one solution is that I could stop being friends with her ex, but I’m wondering if it should have to come to that. Am I being an asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "This is my first time posting in this sub so sorry if thing's aren't properly formatted. As someone who suffers from depression and anxiety, I've been trying to get control of my life for the past few months and I find myself being pushed back because of my mother. I love her, I really do, but sometimes she's too much. I can tell she deeply misses her youth and as a result, sometimes takes that out on me and my siblings. She barely does anything because of back pains, which is understandable, but it's just bare necessities like washing clothes, cooking etc etc. Keep in mind I also help her when I'm not at work  so it's not like I'm treating her shitty either.  I haven't been able to help her these past few days because of a foot pain I have and because I'm sick (which is difficult to get treated because not only do I have no insurance but I work mon-fri so clinics around my area are closed.) and she keeps getting on my case. I'm only one person and I'm not forcing her to do anything and she keeps attacking me and making me self conscious. One of her fave tactics to do is compare herself to abusive mothers, that she can be like them but chooses not to. She also sometimes hints that she'll throw me under the bus when we get into disagreements (she has threatened to out me to my father, despite knowing how homophobic he is and only apologized when I broke down in hysteria before she dropped me off at work.) But looking back now she really hasn't done much for me and I've gotten to where I am with help of friends or other parties. Hell, when I got baker acted in high school, she didn't even visit me at the ward. I can't vent to her about anything because whenever I vent to her, she flips it on how much worse she had it or that my generation is too soft.  \n\n\nToday in particular she was being extra insensitive and I snapped at her because I'm just so tired. I told her that if she didn't want us, she should have aborted us (because she loves saying she regrets giving birth to us and wish she can get back her youth which obv hurts) and that we shouldn't have to grovel at her feet for caring for us. She *chose to have me and my siblings*. I appreciate it but that's what a parent is suppose to do. We got into a huge screaming fest and she charged at me with a knife. My dad got in between us and I quickly locked myself in my room. I know it's a whiplash there but I really don't know what else to add here. Am I really being selfish? ",

      "title": "AITA For using my boyfriends credit card",
      "description": "So this may be long but here goes.  My birthday was last month, I had lost my iPhone a couple weeks before. My boyfriend asked what I wanted for my birthday and I sent him my amazon list with items ranging from 15-30$. He said none of those items were big enough and asked for other ideas. I told him I needed a phone, I found one that cost 300$ and sent him the link. He said that was too much so I told him he was on his own to figure out a gift because between my amazon list and the phone I didn't really need much else. My birthday passes and he hasn't yet come up with a gift idea (He did send flowers to my house as we live three hours apart) He ends up deciding to give me the phone he is using, a pink iPhone 6 that his sister had given him.\n\n I was excited as I had been using an old phone with an absolutely destroyed screen. My boyfriend kept saying he would get around to getting another phone for himself but he is extremely busy with work during the holidays. I reminded him several times that I really need a phone that works, I have been trying to get a new job and my current phone doesn't receive calls or tell me when someone leaves a voicemail half the time. He began to get annoyed with me for reminding him (as he is busy with work a lot) essentially saying \"You're getting a $300 phone, relax\"  \n\nA month passes by and he suggests we look into replacing the battery of another iPhone 6 that he has been keeping in one of his junk drawers so he can use it. I made an appointment at the apple store, took the phone with me back home ( 3 hours away) and got it fixed. I had his credit card with me because he gives it to me to go grocery shopping for him. I had assumed that he was paying for the phone battery and after I left the apple store (but before paying for the phone) I called him and told him it was $50 and was that okay? He was out with his friends and I don't think he was completely listening to me, he said that batteries used to be a lot more than that so $50 isn't too bad so I thought he understood and was okay with that amount. \n\nWhen the phone was fixed I paid with his credit card. He sent me a message with a screenshot of the invoice saying \"what is this?\" I was confused and told him I used his card. He was furious saying that I used his card without permission and after getting a $300 gift from him I just added $50 on top of that. While I am thankful for the phone and it does cost money, he had thrown the phone in a drawer and forgot about it for about a year. He had no plans to sell it or do anything with it. The phone he was using (that he was going to give me) was given to him for free from his sister. I feel like he would basically be paying $50 for my birthday gift. It's not like I took his credit card and went on a shopping spree, I used it for a charge that I thought he knew he would be paying for. While I do think I should have made it absolutely clear that he was okay with me using his card I don't understand why he would have expected me to pay for the phone battery? I feel that it's a bit ridiculous that he was basically gifting me a broken phone and expecting me to pay to fix it. Not that this matters much but he isn't exactly struggling financially so It's not that he can't afford the $50.\n\n **TL;DR** Am I the asshole for thinking my boyfriend would pay to fix a non-working phone he gifted me for my birthday?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I'm 15, and live at home with both my parents. We aren't that wealthy but we make ends meet. My mother has a gluten allergy, and has a special diet the go along with it so that she stays healthy. Last weekend as a surprise my father and I spent 3 hours baking a special gluten free lasanga for her, as well as going out and buying the special gluten free ingriedients that we'd need for it. It was expensive compared to what we normally buy and we had to go to the organic supermarket a town over to get the ingredients. Me and my father aren't great cooks but we made do with a recipe we found.\n\nShe loved it when we gave it to her Sunday night she joyfully ate as much as she could. There was extra that we left for her so she could bring it to work and eat it later.\n\nThursday comes along and I notice that 2/3 of the lasanga is still left. There were only about 6 servings so she had barely touched it. I asked why she didn't finish it, and she got very defensive right away. She claimed it was good but she just wasn't feeling lasanga today and said shell finish it tomorrow. Okay, I'm pretty annoyed here because it was a special gesture we made for her but as long as she eats it I guess it doesn't matter.\n\nSaturday, it's still there. I ask her again what's up with the lasanga, I've noticed you haven't been eating it. She told me that it's been too long now, i'll have to throw it out because she couldn't eat it. I get really flustered over this because of what it took to make the lasanga. She had told us that she loved lasanga and wished she could eat it even though she couldn't have gluten now. She clearly didn't appreciate the gift even though we put so much time into it, and I was really offended by that.  I told her that it hurt that she didn't eat it, and she yells at me for being a \"sensitive pussy\" and then next thing I'm grounded for 3 weeks. That sucked because I had a date already lined up for next weekend and my plans were ruined.\n\nAm I the asshole for being hurt that my mother threw away the gift we gave her and punished me for talking to her about it.",

His wife was there and she was looking like her water could break any second. Me, thinking of a funny joke, I went over to the teacher and said, “Wow Mr. Teacher, your wife sure is getting fat.” And then he just stared at me with the most serious look I’d ever seen and said, “Don’t you ever call my wife fat.” and walked away.\n\nI was so confused, I thought he’d get a chuckle out of it considering that she’s obviously not fat and that she’s just extremely pregnant.

This has basically been a bunch of hook ups, and we've been sort of inching into actually dating territory. \n\nHowever, now that we're getting more serious and im getting to know her as sort of a pseudo girlfriend, I am starting to look at her a different way. Things I didnt care about before are becoming apparent, namely how she performs sexually.\n\nShe is a freak in bed, to put it mildly. Like she goes all out. For instance, when she was giving me head, she actually started licking my balls. No girl has ever done that, but she took it a step further and actually placed them in her mouth.\n\nShe also gets off on being called derogatory names, like \"whore\" and \"slut\". Not to mention the fact that she straight up asks for anal sex. She licks nipples, she asks for spankings, she wants to call me daddy, ect. \n\nShe even told me she cuckolded (with his consent) a previous boyfriend, in addition to having threesomes.\n\nSo, my thought process is, \"huh, this is awesome\", but also \"man, where did she learn this stuff, how many guys has she been with, do i want to date someone who is so \"experienced\"? Like, is it possible for her to be a girlfriend, instead of a fuck buddy.\n\nAm I wrong for thinking this way?",

      "description": "Okay, so I rent a townhouse, which is among other townhouses, in a not so safe neighbourhood. My neighbours are not very good parents (in my opinion) because from dawn to about 10 pm (in the summer) they kick their little kids (mostly elementary kids though also including toddlers) outside to play WITHOUT any adult supervision. On school days the kids are outside from 4pm to 9-10 ish pm.\n\nA lot of awful stuff has happened to these kids because they aren't being watched, from severe injuries to a kidnapping of one girl, but these parents continue doing this without keeping an eye out for their kids. They also drew on the walls of the townhouses, dug out flowers from the gardens, and threw a rock at someone's window.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most is this. There are stairs (at least 10-15 steps) that lead to the parking downstairs in multiple places. Last summer, a kid fell down those steps, was very badly injured and got a concussion, so the landlord built these fences (that open one-way) to prevent kids from going there. Here's the problem, I have caught kids climbing these fences (these fences are taller than me, at 5 feet 7 inches). \n\nYesterday I caught a bunch of elementary school kids taking turns climbing this fence. There's nothing but a flight of stairs going down behind these fences, if they fall, they fall down the stairs. They could break something, snap their necks, or much worse. I had had enough when I saw this kid climbing it and trying to get down the other side HEAD first. I yelled at them to get off and not to climb the fences anymore. They listened but proceeded to do it again right after I left. \n\nNot to mention that in the area the kids are left to play all on their own, I have found beer bottles and syringes, and human waste (once again, it's not a safe neighbourhood for them to be left alone for so long).\n\nI've had enough, and I am writing a letter to each parent (that I know of around here) that they need to watch their kids or I'm calling CPS for neglect. Am I the asshole? Am I overreacting? What should I do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Some backstory. I've been DMing for a group of friends for about two years. Generally the thing that matters to them is narrative and character-story building. Everyone has typically played some sort of good guy. But now we're doing a mini-arc with a company of mercenaries and more/less all but two characters are in it to find some meaning in their chosen profession/life. One character (a total scoundrel) unlocked a coffer, four large gems and some gold (about 2k worth), picked up a small bag of gold and said, \"Huh. Only 50 gold in here\". One player lost their shit. Their PC rolls for perception, nat 20, proceeded to tell the other PCs that he was stealing from the group. The other three PCs didn't care, players said it was in character, their characters wouldn't notice or be concerned since they're getting paid for a job, etc. The player was furious and left. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOutside of the game, I thought about it, and decided that it was a bit like stealing. I presented him with a couple solutions, told him that the group was cool with them, such as a retcon to the contract where the merc leader takes all liquid assets and disperses them at the end of the job evenly. The player wouldn't find that acceptable. They were of the opinion this person's actions was == to killing another PC. Basically said no solution was equitable other than killing the offending PC or this person quitting the group. I do not see how this incident was really that bad. I don't agree that it is equal to stealing or PC murder.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAm I the asshole here? ",

I knew what he was hinting at but there was only one jello pack left and I told him it wasn't mine to give away. he said that my wife never shares her jello with him and she shouldn't keep it in the fridge if she's not willing to share it like all the other food. I told him that you have to make concessions when people are pregnant and deal with it. I offered to get him some jello next time we were at the store, but he wanted the jello right then, so he went into the fridge and took it out. I took it out of his hand and put it back and stood between him and the fridge and told him to stop and eat something else. he threw a fit because my wife wasn't there to eat the jello and he said she could just buy more, but I wouldn't let him eat it. he's still mad at me and its been a few hours.

      "description": "AITA for getting upset with my teacher after she throws a comment about a problem im currently struggling with? (English is not my first language and i got dyslexia so im sorry for any spelling mistakes)\nSo a bit over a year ago i got a virus infection that have caused me to get cronic fetigue syndrom (ME) \nThis basically causes me to sleep everyday after school for a couple hours or even sleeping till the next day and on bad days i cant even make it. \nSo i get that the teacher really dont like us having youtube or netflix up while we work on our art prodject but most people in the class do anyways. I usually like to work with some background noise so i use youtube. I wouldnt see this as a problem since im minding my own buisness and doing my job like im told to. As im working for myself the teacher comes up to me and tells me to turn it off. I do as she says since i dont wanna start a drama about it, but then she goes \"arent you always tired wont this just make it worse?\" Then walks away without me being able to reply. I get this could just be her trying to look out for me but when she just walked away i found it really offencive since its a personal problem i am struggling with. \nAt first i got really annoyed and went to a friend to rant about it to blow off some steam because it made me really pissed off. My friend just told me i was over reacting and that she was probably just wanting to look after me which could be the case, and i just took it the wrong way. To me it came over as rude because she just walked and to me its like asking a depressed person why they are listening to sad songs because \"it will make it worse\" \nA couple of people have told me aswell i am blowing things out of proportion and simply over reacting over nothing but to me this was really rude especially since its a teacher and she knows i have struggled alot with keeping my grades up and getting to school everday. I am also a very worried person i worry about almost everything which causes me alot of stress and this tiredness has caused it all to go through the roof the past year.\nAITA for getting upset with my teacher because of what she said? \n\nAlso i am really tired so i might not respond until tomorrow, but i will be readong through and respong to stuff when i wake up :)",

      "description": "So it goes like this. \nSo for my sisters 2nd child my mum bought them a baby chair swing, RRP $300 paid 150. They used it and then stored it as they weren't sure if they were going to have a 3rd child. I got pregnant with my 1st and they loaned me the chair for use until she grew out of it. My daughter used it and grew out of it and I offered it back to them. I was told that they didn't want to store it as i was probably going to use it for my second (if i had one) so i should just keep it till then. \nIn truth my house is bigger and it did make sense. \n\nSo I have just popped it in the corner of my lounge room and after about 6 months it is getting in the way. While my house is bigger than my sisters it is still not big and we certainly don't have a spare room. So at this point I lent it to a friend for her bub telling her that I would need it back for my second. She loves it and it gets some use. \n\nSo this was not an OK thing to do, I think I asked my sister and she said I didn't. Anyway it was made very clear to me that it was not mine to loan as the chair was loaned to me and not gifted. I straight up admitted that I had done the wrong thing, got it back from my friend and apologised many fucking times for my error in judgement. \n\nSo I get pregnant again and the chair is in my possession all so it is all good. Side note my sister is not having a 3rd. So then my sisters SIL (following this?) Gets pregnant 3 months behind me. Fantastic, yay as she is actually lovely but my sister starts asking me for most of the baby items back that she gifted/loaned me. Bearing in mind dear reader none of this stuff I am done with. \nSo I was gifted (definitely gifted) a bassinet from my sister that she now wants back. I have actually accidentally broken it and have told her, now she expects a replacement for SIL. It keeps coming up every month or so until my husband buys a 2nd hand bassinet to stop the fighting. Turns out SIL bought her own anyway so we use it for a bit and then sell it on. \n\nNow the swing which is the current fight, so after my first baby I was told to keep it for my 2nd. So I did. My bub is born and we are using it, then SIL has hers and my sister keeps asking for it back. I keep telling her 'but we are still using it'. Maybe an asshole move but I am a bit pissed off. \nSo SIL buys her own and my sister now refuses to take the swing back as no one on her side has any use for it anymore. \nSo now sister doesn't want it, but wants me to give her some money for it. Not sell it for her (which is reasonable) but she wants to retroactively sell it to me for what she did have got for it had she just sold it. The suggested amount is $120. The main arguement is that I have had 3 rounds with it including my friend and she, one. \n\nSo my baby has significant, multiple health issues that  have ment that he couldn't sit or roll till well over 9 months so we reeeeaaallly used the swing a lot, and really needed it.. which she was well aware of. \n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "So, for some context, my current landlords are a couple who are good friends of my boyfriend, who I live with. They are Jewish (which will become relevant in a moment), and observe the Sabbath.\n\nRecently they bought a two-bedroom condo that's a few blocks away from the synagogue, so they can walk there every Saturday. They intend to come over on Friday evening and leave on Saturday evening every week- as well as stay for a few days at a time on the High Holidays. This was the arrangement my boyfriend and I agreed to when we signed a lease with them. We share the space one day a week, and the rest of the time, we get it to ourselves.\n\nThe only problem is, we were forced to take the guest bedroom, which is about half the size of the master bedroom.\n\nInitially, we agreed to pay $1200 a month plus utilities for the space. However, as we moved furniture in, it became increasingly clear that the space was going to be very cramped, and having only the guest bedroom is extremely impractical for my boyfriend and I. It's a much smaller space, and we're the ones living there full-time. We talked it over, and agreed that we were going to ask our landlords if we might be able to switch rooms.\n\nWell, we talked to the couple, and they agreed to let us have the master bedroom... for $1400 a month plus utilities. Personally, I think it's ridiculous. I don't believe they'd be able to find any other tenants who would agree to sharing the space so often, or who would observe other important things, such as keeping the kitchen kosher.\n\nAITA for not wanting to pay that much rent?",

I’m on  friendly terms with everyone in the program, but am only really close with a few people. I’m currently in a student directed one act. So my director’s birthday is Tuesday so she set up a brunch and her best friend, who is also in the program, set up a surprise party not knowing the director was planning brunch. I was originally planning on going to both however my boyfriend got grounded and my other good friends can’t go. I decided it wasn’t worth it to go to the parties only to make awkward small talk and be on my phone. So last night I made the choice of just sleeping in and work on school projects that I’ve procrastinated doing. I texted my director telling her I was unable to attend, but hoped she’d have a good day. And texted her friend basically the same thing. I got a kind message back from my director and a mean one from her friend. Saying since I was in the cast I was obligated to go. I tried to be as nice as possible in response, but she wasn’t having it. She proceeded to insult me, my acting abilities, and my boyfriend. I still plan on giving my director her present on her actual birthday ,but the message from her friend made me feel bad about not going. So tell me, oh wise people of Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So, quick info. My grandfather has Alzheimer's. Hes getting worse and worse. All that fun stuff.\nWell, heres where the story starts. I remember it all vividly because of what happened. This originally happened in december. I dont remember the exact date. I was told to clean uo a few stuff and my parents kept saying thing after thing. I get really easily annoyed. So i tell them im really annoyed. They continue. When i complain, my grandfather mocks me. I tell him to stop so i dont get angry. It continues ti happen and i complain again. Grandfather mocks me AGAIN. I say \"Im done\" And storm off into the other room. We have 2 living rooms seperated by a wall, and then a kitchen. I go through the kitchen to thep nb other room, the dining room portion. Its all connected. I sit down in a chair. I hear my grandfather ask my sister where i went, and he ended up coming into where i was. He was angry. I grabbed the pet cage that was for my cats to protect myself. He was trying to attack me. This is where i first felt actual terror. My grandfather is strong. Hes an ex veteran from the vietnam war. Hes still strong. I try and block him with the cage  and he ends up pushing it out of my hands. This is where i have to protect myself, i use my foot to push his torso away from me, he looked like he was about to punch me. At this point i was loudly screaming for him to get away from me. My heart was probably the fastest its beaten in its life. I hand to push his fist away, it took about 2 minutes for my mom to finally intervene and stop him. When he got away i bolted to my basement and was legitimately yelling and crying.\nToday, my grandfather was accusing me of stealing money from him. Ive never stolen before in my life. Nothing. My mom is on my side with this one. Hell i had to be next to her as i am still afraid of my grandfather. Then a few hours later (around an hour before posting this) the topic came up. I forget was exactly said. But then it came to this\n\nMy mom: If you ran from him hed probably fall, but youd probably helo him up.\n\nMy sister: i really doubt that \n\nMe: yeah i wouldnt help him up, id run the hell away.\n\nMy sister: hed probably come in and tell us but..\n\nMe: yeah, i still really hate him.\n\nThis is where they got mad\n\nMy mom: why?\n\nMe: because of what happened, duh\n\nMy mom: but OP, he has Alzheimer's, he wouldnt normally act that way.\n\nMe: Disorders dont excuse behavior!\n\nMy mom: If its a hevahorial-\n\nMe:It still doesnt excuse it!\n\nMy sister: its not bad if they dont forget it an hour later!\n\nMe: oh? So its okay for someone to ASSAULT somebody if they forget it an hour later?\n\nMy sister: well no-\n\nMe: But thats what youre saying!\n\nMy mom: You just gotta learn to forgive and forget!\n\nMe:IM NOT GOING TO FORGIVE ASSAULT!\n\nMy mom: OP, he has Alzheimer's\n\nMe: I KNOW THAT!\n\nAt this point, i stormed into my bedroom upstairs.\nAm i the asshole for not forgiving my Alzheimer's infected grandfather for assaulting me? Or is my family in the wrong?",

I was wrong. \n\nI have an irritable bowel and am also pregnant. I don’t always know ahead of time if I’m going to be on the toilet for a long time. \n\nI heard people come and go and the stalls were mostly empty when I finished, about 15 minutes later. When I came out, there was an elderly woman standing there waiting, who went into the stall after me. She wasn’t in a wheelchair or seem like she obviously needed to use that stall specifically, but I’m sure it was just more comfortable and easier for her.

      "description": "Ok so a little back story: I moved to NYC and signed a lease to a relatively ok apartment with two other people I met online. Fast forward 5 months, coupled with a jaw infection from a bad wisdom tooth surgery, I got a severe case of pneumonia, and decided that, financially and emotionally, it made the most sense to move back in with my parents in MD. I sublet my room to a girl, and to make life easier on everyone in regards to the security deposit, we thought it would be in everyone’s interest for the subletter to pay me $1600, and then when they ended their lease, the management company would give the subletter what would’ve been my portion of the security deposit ($1600). \n\nIt’s been about year since then, and I got a message from my ex-roommate saying that management wrote out a single check with all the original roommates on it (one of the other girls also moved back home to CO), and she says the only way to cash it is if we open a joint bank account. I feel like I’m not getting the full story, because that sounds strange and every time I offer to call the leasing office she gets upset and says not to talk to management. I’m a college student with loans and (I’d like to think) a good credit score. I’ve also had issues with money with this girl in the past (ex. her not sending money for utilities). I’ve offered to do almost anything else to help: call in while she’s at the bank to authorize the money going to her account, calling management, sending a notarized letter, but I refuse to risk my financial security by opening a joint account and I live in Chicago now and cannot afford to fly all the way out there for money that’s not even mine (plus the other girl that moved flat out refused to so it wouldn’t matter anyways). I feel like it’s reasonable, but she’s been calling me and yelling, she’s had her parents call me and yell at me, and now her other roommates are too. AITA for just wanting to block all of them and be free of NYC and it’s problems?",

      "title": "AITA For Losing Patience With My Girlfriend Suffering With Anxiety",
      "description": "My girlfriend(21F) and me(22M) have been dating for almost 2 years now. We’ve known each other for upwards of 6 years or so, and have always had feelings for eachother, so when it eventually became romantic is was beautiful. We felt comfortable and still do to this day, we can be ourselves as if we were just friends and we love eachother for that.\n\nHowever, early in the relationship she disclosed with me that she suffers from Anxiety and Depression. I suffer heavily from the latter myself, so I was sympathetic when I learned this and was willing to help anyway I could.\n\nI’ll try to put the situation in my perspective. My depression really hit me when my ex cheated on me, but I learned to cope with it in my own way. I don’t get overly attached to anything or depend on others for my own happiness, I try to keep it all separate and it really taught me the way a relationship should be, you should be overall comfortable and happy with yourself before taking on the responsibility of a relationship. It’s a partnership that should enhance both of your lives, not depend on them.\n\nSo at first, her anxiety attacks were quite frequent, maybe once every 2 weeks or so when we saw eachother once a week. This would involve her breaking down, shaking violently and crying very heavily while gasping for air. During these I held her in my arms and constantly reassured her that I’m there and it’ll be okay. These typically occur when she believes that she “upset” me, when in reality that’s usually not true. Sure I may get annoyed sometimes, but I typically get over it in minutes.\n\nOver time and after a lot of communication, she’s learned to try to not let her mind overthink things, and realize that I don’t get upset unless something really bad happens.\n\nBut to get to the point of this post, she still has these, not as violent and often, but they still occur. For basically the same reasons, but I feel it gets a bit ridiculous. For instance, at times I may get mad at something, however I’m not a yeller, I typically say “it’s alright” then focus on something else to calm down quickly. This will almost always end in her breaking down, saying she’s not good enough and she’s scared I’ll leave her. \n\nI suppose deep down, because I suffer through my own mental condition every day and deal with it on my own without involving her, I get frustrated that despite all this time she still has these issues at any opportunity when I’m not overly happy. I feel as though I’m not “allowed” to be annoyed or upset, hell not even allowed to be tired without her having an emotional hit, due to me being tired looking like I’m upset, etc.\n\nI love her and try to get her support, I helped her find a therapist, and constantly remind her that I love her and that she’s doing better, but when she has her breakdowns, I shut off, I stare into another direction and just get really mad. I genuinely hate myself for this, yet there’s always a voice in my head telling me I shouldn’t have to babysit her, that she’s an adult and shouldnt cry whenever she convinces herself something is wrong. She always calls me out and tells me she just needs more support, but the repetitive nature of it all eventually got to me. \n\nShe blames a lot of things on her anxiety, and I mean a lot, and I suppose I really got tired of hearing her blame so much on it, like letting it completely run her life, while I’m accepting my depression but not being ruled by it and letting it change me.\n\nI understand and even discussed with her that I know everyone handles their problems differently and I don’t expect her to deal with her’s like I do, aka using logic and not getting emotional about petty and unimportant things, but I feel she doesn’t cope, she just lets it run her life and unfairly expects me to be the solution.\n\nSo instead of being supportive, I now get irritated and typically stay quiet during it, because I feel like a babysitter, not a significant other. When she’s herself we really do enjoy each others company, and I couldn’t imagine being with someone else. I love her so much, I suppose that’s why I’m so conflicted whether or not I’m being an impatient asshole. I feel like with true love I should always support her, and I can’t help but feel like an asshole that I no longer do that for her.\n",

      "title": "AITA for confronting my wife about using her vibrators?",
      "description": "Quick aside: This is a new account bc my wife is on Reddit at times.\n\nThe backstory\n\nMy wife and I have been married over ten years, two children, two incomes, in our forties, and have a relatively healthy relationship. We communicate pretty well, enduring no significant challenges like cheating, abuse, money problems, except for one: our sex life. Mis-matched libidos is a common issue, especially after children, age, and life comes into play, and that’s totally fair, but If I'm a 9, she's a 2. It's something we've discussed with some difficulty, but openly. I'm still very attracted to her. Oh, there’s no religious influence.\n\nWe've been on about a 2/3x a month average for a few years, far less than my ideal, but tolerable. We’ve discussed it, with shallow promises to work together, but no real change. I backfill with porn, which she is fully aware of and has zero issue with. Our last child was born 6 years ago. More context: when we do have sex it is intimate and pleasurable for us both. Reading between the lines: I am a giving partner, ensure she comes, and we aren't pushing any uncomfortable boundaries afaik–I'm not forcing her to do anal or dress up like my mom is what I'm saying. She has two vibrators. Masturbation is part of our intimacy, it's not taboo at all either together or alone. Her private sex life is her business, assuming it's not harmful to our marriage.\n\nAround September the frequency has dropped to 1 or 2 times a month, no obvious external factors would indicate why. At this point my frustration has resulted in my not initiating at all.\n\nImportant side note: About a year ago, I went to her nightstand for a phone charger (routine and not inappropriate), and when I put it back a day later, noted one vibrator was in a completely different place. It's purple and hard to miss. This occurred during an extended dry spell and it irked me. I asked her about it, she flatly denied using it, I dropped it and haven't been checking since then. You'll have to trust me on this one.\n\nThe main story\n\nLast week while making our bed, close her nightstand drawer and realize the vibrator is missing. We hadn't had sex since early Feb, only twice this year, and hope maybe it's charging (my birthday soon). Nothing. Monday before a trip, I take a picture of the top drawer: no vibrator; and bottom drawer: vibrator.\n\nI came home and checked. Vibrator back in the top drawer, now the one in the bottom drawer is missing. I call her out, without mentioning the photos, and she straight up denies touching them, angrily stating,\"If they've moved, someone else moved them,\" goes upstairs, puts both in my top drawer, and leaves for work. Yeah, I'll be headed over to [r/relationship\\_advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice) next.\n\nI just sent her four before-and-after pictures without comment. AITA?\n\ntl;dr I took photos of my wife's vibrators and showed her to catch her lying about using them while ignoring our sex life.",

      "description": "I have bronchitis right now so after the doctors my wife and I went to Walmart. I hate Walmart, absolutely despise it,and avoid it as much as possible. Regardless they have a pharmacy there so I figured it would be easier to just pick up my medicine there, instead of going to my usual Riteaid. So it's been about a hour since they called it in, I go to the pharmacist, put down some other OTC medicines on the counter and ask if they have it ready. They look and tell me that there out of stock and I could get it tomorrow. This absolutely infuriated me because I knew I shouldn't have wasted my time trusting in Walmart. I immediately said, \" okay I'll just go to riteaid.\" I swiped my stuff off the counter and promptly walked away. My wife thinks I'm the asshole because apparently Walmart is \"beneath\" me and I was rude. While you do see some \"interesting\" people there, it also has shitty customer service. I don't think I was rude, I didn't say anything bad, all I said was I'll go to riteaid instead. I ended up going to riteaid and what do you know with in 5 minutes I was out of there,medicine in hand. So am AITA for giving Walmart a chance and then promptly walking away when they couldn't provide the service I needed?",

      "description": "My friend and I sit together every day on the bus. We became really close, and we talked about everything with each other. Now, months after sitting for an hour together everyday, Im getting kind of sick of it.\n\nThe conversations used to be nice and relieving, being able to confide in someone like that. Now, there is nothing to talk about. Nothing at all. She’s gotten to telling me about conversations that she had that day just to fill the silence. We both mention things like “there’s nothing to talk about” “I’m so tired” “The bus is so boring”. \n\nThe main problem is that she is sensitive. This next part sounds asshole-ish, but it’s the best way to describe. She tells me how sucidial she is, how she cuts, how &amp; when she is going to kill herself. Every day. I don’t like thinking about that, losing a close friend. I have told her not to do it, and tell her she needs to get help, i’ve done a lot to try and help her, but she isn’t convinced life is worth living. I can’t do anything more there.\n\nShe also talks about uncomfortable things. Not that i’m against talking about it, but i just don’t like talking about it all the time. She talks about masturbation, her period, discharge, etc. It’s nice to rant sometimes, but not anymore. She talks loudly about it a lot, too. \n\nFinally, she doesn’t brush her teeth. Self explanatory.\n\nI’m a shy girl who loves listening to music and podcasts, and at 6 in the morning, I just want to put in my headphones and look out the window.\n\nAITA for wanting to sit by myself once in a while? I’m not going to completely ignore, just sit by myself. I can’t tell if i’m being mean or not.",

      "description": "Hey! Throw away account, since the situation is kind of revealing. Also - I apologies for grammatical errors and spelling errors! I'm studying English, but not the best... yet!   \nlittle more than a year ago, I bought an apartment. I can live there alone, but i'm a student and i'm trying to focus on school and work part time as little as possible. My friend (for +6 years) was looking for an apartment as well, so we decided to move in together. We bought all furniture, repairs and lightning together too.  \n\n\nIn the beginning everything was fine and we were having a good time. Over the year however, I realized how bad he was a living without parents. I was always the one cleaning, buying groceries and so on. on top of that, our lifestyles weren't that great of a match. He's working full time at evening/nights and often drink with people from his work. This means that I often get woken up in the middle of the night. I then made some more strict rules, mostly about inviting people over, hosting parties without me knowing and cleaning.   \n\n\nBut then I got sick - Long story short, I was in-n-out of hospitals for months and my drugs were kind of dangerous, so I had to take them with people who knew what to do in emergencies. So I lived with my parents for that period.  \n After 4 months, I had my final surgical operation and could move back to my apartment. When I came back, the place was a mess. Living there alone, without me enforcing those previous rules, they were 100% ignored. He hadn't been cleaning once since I left, empty bottle from parties were pilled around in the kitchen, and on top of that, his girlfriend moved in, without me knowing.   \n\n\nI had enough - I don't want to be his parent, I just want a roommate. I talked with him, and told it how it was. something along the lines of \"*I have been the one doing everything and with my sickness, I can't do that in the future, not do I want to*\". And he accepted and agreed. Since we didn't have a lease contract, we just agreed he had 2 months to move out.  \n\n\nNow we fast forward to today, it's been 1 months, and me and my roommate was talking about those furniture, repairs and lightning. He had payed for half of the stuff, but he's leaving without any of it, so it's only fair I pay back what he had payed for.  \n\n\nHowever, when I was looking through my bank records, I noticed something. Those 4 months I had been sick, he hadn't payed rent. Financially i'm doing pretty good, and it's not going to break my back or anything, but just the thought of it makes me furious. Even after I pay him back from furniture and so on, he still owns me around 500$\n\nAt this point, I don't even care about the money he owes me. Just the fact that he cares so little about my rules, my apartment and my sickness makes me feel so betrayed. I just want him out, and i'm not sure I want to wait another month.  \nWould I be the asshole for saying he has 3 days to move out, and if he isn't out, I will change the locks?  \n\n\n**TL;DR:** Got an apartment with a friend (+6 years). I wasn't great, but acceptable. Then I got sick for 4 months and wasn't home. Apartment was shit when I came back, and he didn't pay me rent those months. I wanna kick him out, within 3 days ",

      "description": "So, I met this girl a couple of years back, and I fell head over heels for her. I am 20M and she´s 20F. \n\nWe dated for a brief period of time, and she was never really into me, while I was super into her and really trying to make a relationship out of it. Its so weird for me to truly like someone, that when I do like someone I try and open up about me feelings and everything. The thing with this girls is that she´s never been a very communicative person, it was always me striking up conversation and it was always me forcing little encounters to try and win her over. \n\nWhen we were finally dating, after about a month, she told all some of my friends (but not me D:) that she really was not that into me and that \"She was planning on talking about it with me because she couldn't keep me like that anymore\".  I did not know this at the time, and this \"planning on talking about it with me\", never came.\n\nThen a big party came and we were both invited, I hit her up on Wsp and asked her if she was coming, she did not answer my message (to this date, that was the last text between the both of us), and after that, every other girl form her friend group showed up to the party, except for her. That night I felt very very stupid, because I realized I had been chasing someone for so long, and she was so clearly not into me, that she couldn't even answer a WSP back.\n\nI talked about this with a few of my friends, told them that I was feeling kind of stupid, because I was putting so much effort into trying to win this girl over, and she couldn't even talk back. At this point, they told me that she had told them previously that she wasn't into me, and that  both my friends were expecting her to talk about it directly to me. At this point they suggested that I should move on and that if she wasn't trying to communicate at all with me, I shouldn't try either and should just move on, given that she apparently wasn't that keen on talking about it with me and letting me know through dialogue that thing were over.\n\nSo, I gathered courage and finally stopped talking to her. And so I stopped trying to force the little encounters I had always forced, and exactly what I thought would happen, happened: since I was always the one opening up dialogue, and now I wasn't looking for her, all interactions ceased. \n\nHere is where we get to the problem. I started ignoring her, not because I resented her, or because I was angry at her, but because I felt I needed to move on from her, and that was through creating distance. \n\nI need to be honest here, I did ignore her on purpose, absolutely and 100%. But this ignoring was not out of hate (which is what she believes to be the reason), it was simply because the healthy thing for me was to move on from her, and given that I was seeing her everyday at college (we study the same thing), the way I figured to move on was through creating distance.\n\nFast forward to a few months back, three of her group of friends came to me, on three different occasions, to ask me \"So why do you hate her all of a sudden?\" Implying that it was because I hated her for not wanting to be with me.\n\nI told all three that I did not hate her, that I was just trying to move on from her and that I was trying to create distance. Since then, I had never had an opportunity to talk thing with her, we´ve both been busy, and our encounters are always brief, with always translates into an awkward little Hello- how are you?- fine bye. And those encounter make me sad, because we used to be close to each other, maybe only as friends, but we used to interact, and no we don't, and it kind of pisses me of and frustrates me.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I force another conversation with her? to Try and explain how I feel? Was it her job to end things with me? Am I being an asshole? Should I be feeling guilty?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** A girl I was dating cut all communications with me, and did not talk with me finish our brief relationship. I responded by not talking to her, and started ignoring her on a few occasions. Some of her friends now throw comments ant me saying that I hate her because I don't talk to her. I don't know If I´m being and asshole or what I should do.",

      "description": "This happened some time ago but it's one of those things that pops into my head and keeps me up when I'm trying to sleep sometimes...\n\nIt was about midnight and I walked into a bar with a friend, the only seats open were all the way at the end of the bar so we sat and ordered some drinks. After half a drink, a strip club promoter walked in handing out coupons and stood between me and the girl next to me and got both of our attention. We kind of rolled eyes at each other as he put the coupon on the bar between us, and I jokingly asked her if she wanted it. She said no and turned back, I threw the coupon in a trash on the other side of the bar and thought nothing more of it.\n\nAnother 20 minutes went by and she turned around and tapped me on the shoulder.\n\nHer: Sorry if you thought I was being rude before\nMe: I didn't think that at all, no problem\nHer: We are talking about some ex-boyfriend problems so it's just that we were in the middle of a conversation\nMe: Sorry to hear that, really you're not rude at all\nHer: My name is \"S\" and this is my friend \"E\". What are you guys up to tonight?\n\nWe talked for a few minutes, who we are, what we do, what's been going on tonight, generally exchanged pleasantries, until I excused myself to the bathroom. When I came back my friend (who is gay and definitely wouldn't have been hitting on them or offensive in my absence) was in deeper conversation and had taken my seat closer to them. I stood behind him with my arms on his chair and waited for the topic to trail off. When it did, \"S\" said \"it was great to meet you guys, do you mind if we go back to figuring things out?\" Sure, no problem.\n\nWe ordered two more drinks and moved to a table that just opened up in a corner behind us. Maybe 30 more minutes went by and it was time to catch our ride home so I put my empty glass on the bar where we sat previously and as I walked past I said:\n\nMe: Hey, I'm sorry if we bothered you at all and I hope you two can have a good night\n\nTo my absolute surprise and horror, \"E\" started screaming at me so loud that half the bar started staring:\n\nE: You are such a fucking asshole!\nMe: I... I am?\nE: Yes! That is the most insulting, condescending thing you could have possibly said! \nMe: It... it is?\nE: I don't need your fucking permission! I don't need a man's permission to have a good night!\nMe: ...I meant no offense...\n\nAnd I walked out, with 20 or so people staring at me thinking I was some chauvinistic piece of shit. My friend laughed his ass off and insisted I shouldn't have said anything and it was my fault... am I the asshole for wishing them well?",

I am 3 years into running my own Gardening/ tree care business and try to save as much as possible to put a deposit down on a house - Therefore making the festival I do not want to go to a pointless expenditure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, last year I had said to my GF - it might be a good idea to leave the festival early in order to make the train back and avoid the stampede. This would have meant cutting the gig short and was not done at the time. It got to 11.30pm and it was clear that the train station had been shut due to it being unsafe &amp; my gf was now stuck alone in Brighton, over an hour from home. I ended up driving a 3 hour round trip to pick her up. We go home, she told me it wasn't even that good and she wishes she had stayed at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I want to add that i'm not a massive fun killer as the story seems to tell. We are at the pub 3/4 times a month, quiz nights, friends birthdays ect ect.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis brings me to this morning. I am at work and have been for a few hours and notice a text from my GF - Please call me when you can xx.\n\nI call her and we have the usual chit chat. She then tells me that shes booked tickets for Brighton pride this year and has a ticket for me. \n\nI told her I dont want to go and asked her if she remembered our previous conversation. I said I have no problem with her going but I wont be driving for 3 hours to pick her up and id rather spend my weekend at home and chill. \n\nShe tried persuading me that it will be fun, and everything is great there which is the complete opposite of what she had told me about the previous year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomehow she managed to speak with several of our friends to arrange buying tickets but somehow forgot to ask me, &amp; forget the conversation we had about the previous time in Brighton.\n\nNow she has the hump and is not speaking to me as of 2pm this afternoon.

      "description": "Long time lurker, first time poster, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a bit of background, my high school requires that all students complete a year long senior thesis research project as part of their advanced academic program. I ended up helping out with some astronomy research at a local college over the summer of 2018 (mostly data processing), and the professor was kind enough to let me use the preliminary data for my thesis. Most students present and defend their projects before the end of the calendar year, but due to some scheduling issues mine got pushed back to just last week. I was told I did extremely well and it felt amazing to finally finish a year long project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biological mother is an alcoholic, albeit a recovering one, and I've tried to keep her distant from school related events (talent shows, open houses, etc.) ever since she showed up very obviously drunk to a meeting with my guidance counselor my freshman year. I'll spare everyone the details but she's been sober on and off and in and out of A.A. since then, but officially hit one year of sobriety on December 17th for the first time in as long as I can reasonably remember.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hadn't planned to even tell her about my defense at all, but accidentally let it slip about two weeks before it was scheduled. We argued about it back and forth over lunch, one of my biggest worries being that my dad's other ex wife, who has a restraining order against my mother (long story) was planning on being there, and I didn't want them to get into a technically illegal pissing contest on a day that I felt should be about me and my accomplishments. And while I understand that she is a year sober and has finally been able to keep a steady job, I automatically get very worried at even the notion of her being involved in my academic life, which I take very seriously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the thing that really got under my skin was that during our fight, after I mentioned that dad's ex wife would probably be there, she said something along the lines of \"Well, I would hope your *biological* parents would take precedent,\" because my former stepmother would consistently go out of her way for me during and after her marriage to my father, while my mother was too hungover or on her way to being too hungover to do jack shit. for the past 8 or 9 years since she split from my dad. She also remarried a man whom I despised, who turned out to be a bipolar heroin addict, and then lied to me about being divorced from him, which I found out on Christmas Day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer issues aside, I'm more or less at the point where I do want to have a relationship with her going forward. And to my mother's credit, she did drive me a lot to and from the research lab, as well as give me money to buy lunch while I was there. She's been going to therapy, staying on her medications, and attending A.A. meetings. I can tell she's trying very hard to be there for me and my younger sister, but I still feel every time I try to discuss things with her she doesn't understand that her problems have affected people besides herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I could use some unbiased opinions here: should I have been the bigger person and put my best foot forward? Am I \"unfairly jerking her around\" and \"punishing her\", as she claims? Should I have invited her as a sign of good faith?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr is I didn't want my mother to come to my thesis defense due to an unpleasant history with her being an alcoholic and things still being tense between us, she thinks I am being unfair and ignoring her strides towards recovery despite claiming I want a relationship with her, am I the asshole?",

So why should I have to pay 80-90 dollars a month instead of the usual 50-60 a month because he decided to go to Austrailia.

      "description": "I’m not even sure how cringey this story is to outsiders, but I do know that after it happened my heart physically hurt for four days, and I still can’t think about that trip without remembering this incident and wanting to collapse in shame. I never told my parents or my siblings besides the two who were present. I also swore them to secrecy—which isn’t something they would agree to unless it really mattered.\n\nThis was two summers ago. I was traveling in Europe with my parents and three of my siblings. We went to four countries, traveling by train—I especially took the time to plan the whole thing out. One nice thing I planned on our first day in Geneva was a trip to UN building. We were all really excited. \n\nNote: I’m from New York. I’m also a female if that helps with context. I was 19 during this trip, but when I was 16 my class went on a trip to the NYC UN Building. My experience there was nice enough. The tour guide was extremely present, lively, trying to spur intrigue and make every small bit interesting. He was totally into his job.\n\nOk back to the story. So we walked for a long time to get there. It was up some hill and the directions were unclear. When we finally got there—the space was empty. We ended up waiting 40 minutes with other tourists until someone opened the door and let us in for the tour.\n\nI showed my passport, got a visitors pass, went through security, went to the gift shop and got shirts for too many people. Then this young man (I would guess 35) walks in and asks us to gather. He’s the tour guide.\n\nNow I’m going to try to describe this guy. He wore a plain suit. He told us that first and foremost he’s a translator (French and English) at the UN, and that giving tours is a secondary thing. He was eloquent and clear and knowledgeable. He also basically lacked any animation. He seemed very jaded or maybe that’s his personality. In his voice and in his facial expression. Not saying he was incapable of being animated—but just that he made it very clear he didn’t want to be giving this tour. He walked really quickly, didn’t chat or answer questions in between walking from room to room, he made only sarcastic jokes, and he briefly explained the history behind some rooms.\n\nNow I wasn’t complaining. He spoke. I listened. Honestly I thought if I were to give a tour it’d be pretty similar to his style. I have a tendency not to be animated when I probably should be.\n\nThe tour was over. As we were leaving, I approach him and say “Hey I have a question. Are you as miserable as you look?” Before I said this, I thought it was completely normal thing to say. Correct me if I’m wrong: someone from New York wouldn’t be offended by this. They would know I was acknowledging the fact that they hate their job, Maybe that’s what I wanna think to let me sleep at night. Anyways, his eyes bulged. And he looked so disgusted and shocked. My heart starts hurting and I say “wow sorry that was rude.” And he just stares at me and in his accent goes “yes that was extremely rude.” Cue me running away before he can say more, and me feeling physically horrible for four days while my sisters first are equally stunned, then laugh and then try to cheer me up. I honestly don’t remember much else about Geneva because the whole time I kept reliving this incident in my head. \n\nIdk if I was guilty of some culture faux pas—which is what I would like to think happen. Or I’m just an asshole who can’t ask appropriate questions.\n\n",

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons. It's also really long, sorry. But I'd really like to hear your thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople are me, ex-girlfriend (GF) and her friend (F).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met GF a couple of years ago in the major European tourist destination where I live. At the time I had a little bit of notoriety and a wild confidence and was having a lot of success with women. (Not intending to humblebrag, it's relevant to whether I am an asshole). My number one rule was to be totally upfront about everything and only sleep with girls who understood that it was never going to be anything serious. Girls who were looking for something serious didn't normally think much of me, so the system worked well. I was promiscuous, but I believe I was respectful too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night I'm in a bar, when two girls approach me and start flirting. I'm immediately into both of them, and my wild confidence begins to wonder if I can swing a threesome. I take them to another bar, and GF tells me that F wants me to take her home. I figure \"that's her in the bag then\", and immediately kiss GF to see if they'll both come. It doesn't quite work out like that -- F goes home with one of my friends, and GF and I hook up on the bathroom sink. Everyone's happy though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still think a threesome is possible, so I invite them both out again. I'm doing this \"which nationality kisses better?\" thing, and they're both into it - kissing each other and me. F is wearing a short dress and every time we kiss I discreetly slip my fingers up and touch her. It's turning into a wild night, but GF isn't into it and comes home with me alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple days later GF and I go for dinner and suddenly I realise I'm really falling for her. She's only in the city for a few months, so I suggest being exclusive for that time so we can enjoy life together properly before she leaves. She's against the idea initially (she wasn't looking for anything serious) but comes round to it. After a blissful few months we tell each other that we love each other, but she still eventually leaves for a different country. I've already been hurt by the long-distance thing once so we officially break up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy life goes back to being a wild cartwheel of women, and she dates other guys too. A few months after she leaves, F and I meet drunkenly on the street by chance. I've always wanted to sleep with her, and she feels the same, so I take her back to mine. We both understand it's a fun, no strings attached, one night thing. I really enjoy it, no regrets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the next couple of years, I call GF every week and we see each other every few months. Most of the time she comes to me, I sometimes come to her, we meet each other's parents etc. We aren't officially dating, but we come to rely on each other emotionally. Eventually she tells me that she wants to quit her job, move back to my city, and be together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far, by her choice, we've operated on a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy with regard to other partners. But I think that if she's going to make such a big life decision to be with me, she should have all the facts. I tell her the number of girls I've slept with during our relationship, and also that I slept with F a few months after she left. She tells me that she slept with an ex-boyfriend and dated some other guys for months at a time. I tell her that I really enjoy our relationship, and I've made mistakes in the past by trying to change things too quickly, but I'll be happy if she moves back. Everything seems good, and a week or so later (while she's arranging to move back) she calls me to explicitly say she's totally fine about the whole situation. I forget about it. In fact, I organise a big ten day roadtrip with her and some friends to welcome her back to the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as I meet her on the first day of the roadtrip, I can tell that something is wrong. She doesn't touch or kiss me. But she's otherwise the cool, awesome girl I've always known. For a while. Then she starts putting me down in front of my friends, humiliating me, really twisting the knife. I'm confused. I've never known her to be cruel before -- and she's always on her phone smiling about something. I figure she's seeing another guy, and about half way through the trip I confront her and she admits it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn theory, I'm 100% fine with this. But in practice: she's lied to me; she's ignoring me; she's being actively cruel. And all the while I'm spending huge amounts on the first holiday I've had in years. It's horrible for me, and her, and my friends, but we talk about it and end the trip on superficially good terms. I'm wracked emotionally. On the one hand, I'm totally comfortable with polyamory. On the other, the needless deception and cruelty were deeply hurtful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as the road trip is over, I decide to hike deep into the mountains with a friend in order to clear my head. But the trip is a disaster. I'm fit and experienced, but I didn't have much time for planning, and I end up with no real food, a three-day hike to the nearest town, and crippling altitude sickness. I drag myself out of the mountains on foot, losing 10% of my bodyweight in just a couple of days, and hitch-hike back to my city.  GF tells me to come to her place, and I arrive with a fever, barely aware of what's happening around me. We spend an hour talking through some of her problems, and then she puts me in her bed and then goes out partying. The next day, she tells me I have to go home (a 2 hour train journey) because she wants to hang out with some friends of mine instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI literally don't have the strength to carry my things, so I leave it all behind. Somehow I make it home and call my dad. Before I can say a word, he tells me that my grandfather has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. After the call, I text GF looking for support, and explain that I was upset that she left me when I needed help. She calls me and shouts down the phone for 7 minutes straight. At this point I'm just crying silently and watching the timer go up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next few days, she keeps telling me she loves me, but never manages to do even one thing that a normal person would do for someone they love. Some of my work acquaintances show me more warmth and kindness. I'm very confused. My behavior becomes toxic and unattractive - I'm pushing her away because I'm desperate for her to prove that she does care about me after all. But she doesn't. I find her other lover's email address on the internet and contact him to make sure he had all the facts too. She calls me in tears. It's clear who matters more to her. She tells me she's ashamed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGF arranges for her other lover to come visit the city. It's my birthday. The weight loss from the mountains and the emotional turmoil of what feels like a deep betrayal is too much for me, and I declare the relationship over. She's fine with it. You can't heal by hurting other people, so even though my heart is breaking we meet one last time and I say every nice thing I can think of, and we hug goodbye. Hours later, she meets her other lover and I binge watch netflix to escape life. Over the next few weeks, I discover to my horror that terms like \"heart break\" and \"heart ache\", which I'd always assumed were poetic, are actual, literal expressions for the physical manifestations of extreme emotional pain. It sucked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor so long I had felt like the king of the city. I had been convinced that by being open and honest no-one would get hurt. But I've spent the last 5 months wondering if that was all a mad delusion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've quit dating until I can clear my head. But I can't work it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's your judgement? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Am I the arsehole for attempting to cut contact with my cousin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was quite close with this cousin, visiting often - and on relative good terms. There were ups and downs, but there are many things that I cant forgive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time, my cousin had organised a party for thier birthday, and invited my aunt. My aunt was in a rough, financial situation and was unable to afford to go, so attempt to message the cousin about this. However, what my aunt did not know is that my cousin had changed their number the day before the party, and did not tell my aunt - so my aunt thought that she had sent the message when she had infact not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother time, my cousin had told me all the details about my uncles death (not the cousins father, from another one of my nan's sprouse), about where he was found, how he was found - and read out some disturbing facebook posts he posted. I feel that this should be my aunts job, not theirs -  so this upset me when they did this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA third, and possibly the most annoying one - cutting contact with my Grandad. He is a great man, and I would not change him for the world. As previously mentioned, my cousin had changed thier phone number, so whenever my Grandad attempted to message my cousin, asking how they were etc, he never got a reply. However, around christmas time that same year, my Grandad was able to get their new phone number, and phoned to ask what they wanted for christmas, \"despite you not speaking to me for the whole year\". This apparently annoyed my cousin, so they cut contact with my Grandad. However, after a good year and a half, my Grandad had attempted to contact my cousin again, however as they had blocked his number had to do it through a third party. When my Grandad finally reached my cousin, they refused to speak to him - and got another person to do it. My cousin then complained about my Grandad, and this was the final straw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the arsehole for doing this?",

      "description": "I have two German Shepard’s one is 3 years old (I’ll call him B) and the other is 12 (I’ll call her M). I’m 24m and these are actually my moms dogs, but they live with me. The older dog we’ve had since I was in high school. M was actually a birthday present to me from my mom.\n\nM doesn’t listen to me or anyone for that matter. She knows basic commands like come, sit, down, and stay but like I said M doesn’t listen not even for food. When I walk M she lunges at people and especially dogs that we pass. Both these dogs are 90-100 lbs so they’re big and it’s hard to control two of them let alone one. B knows the basics and will listen most of the time but he feeds off M’s energy so when M is unfriendly then so is B. I don’t know how to train M as she is old and I can tell her joints hurt sometimes by the way she walks. She barks at B whenever I play with him which is annoying, but not hostile in any way just loud and bothersome. Both are friendly towards people at the house. B will get a bit crazy around newcomers but he’s not mean, doesn’t bite, and calms down eventually. I don’t know why they’re so bad out in public. \n\nThe problem lies in that I want to move to a new home and I want to take B, but not M. My mom has this BF who doesn’t like dogs and won’t take either of them. Ultimately my mom knows that if I leave and I can’t take them that she will have to manage with them somehow. \n\nSo am I the asshole because I don’t want to take M with me?",

      "description": "This may be long but the details are important here. My step family has a family reunion every year where they all travel from around the world and spend about 10 days together in California. I have not been to one of these reunions in about 10 years and the last time I had seen everyone together was five years ago at my sister’s wedding. I want to attend these reunions but could never afford it. Now I can.\n\nMy 17-year-old step cousin was diagnosed with bone cancer about a year ago and it’s obviously been very tough on her family and everyone else. She was too sick to travel so last Christmas, so the reunion was in London where she lives with her family. Fiancé and I were invited to go but the dates overlapped with our own travel plans. We both wanted to be there but couldn’t. \n\nFast forward to now, Step Cousin is responding well to treatments and seems to be doing better. She hopes to attend our June wedding and has really been looking forward to it. She even said it was the one positive thing in her life that was making her excited which made me tear up.\n\nThis is where it gets tricky. The next family reunion is happening the first week in August in France. Fiancé and I are both invited again but he can’t go because he doesn’t have the time off. However I do. I want to go so badly to France and see my cousin and that side of my family. I barely see them because they live all over the world and they only get together once a year. \n\nI told my Fiancé about the trip and if it was somthing he wanted to do. He said he can’t go because of the time off and “would be really pissed if I went without him”. Hearing that made me really mad and I told him I wasn’t going to let him prevent me from going on this trip. My fiancé and I got into a huge fight because he says he feels like he’s being excluded which is not true at all. He’s 100% invited but has no vacation left because the time off he had he’s using on two bachelor parties and our honeymoon. \n\nI think it’s crap he can leave me alone for these two bachelor parties yet he’s going to be mad if I go to the family Europe trip without him. He’s gone off and done plenty of movies/day drinking/beer festivals/sports games without me and I have never stood in his way and said he couldn’t go. WIBTA if I went? \n\nTL;DR: family reunion to see my step cousin with bone cancer conflicts with my fiancé’s schedule yet I can go.  ",

      "description": "So my GF and I work at the same (very understaffed) retail store, mostly on different shifts, I have worked there a lot longer than she has, and I’m very close friends with a lot of our colleagues. Our store gets manic on some days, and as many retail workers know, running a store on a couple of people is hard work. Over weekends, I work Saturdays, and GF works Sundays. I have exams coming up, so I was making a thing of avoiding all overtime in order to study and have time to myself a little. I’d been asked to work overtime this weekend, but I’d refused for that reason, so the store was as tightly staffed as usual on Sunday (3 people overall incl. GF).\n\nAbout 5 or 6 weeks back, a friend invited us for a night out clubbing to celebrate her birthday (this past weekend - Saturday - I’m sure you can see where this is going). I mentioned to GF that she was working the day after, and because she isn’t used to going out/drinking, it might not be a good move to go out the night before. She insisted it’d be ok, and we wouldn’t stay out too late; “only 3 or 4am”. I also warned her that it wasn’t an option to “just call in sick” as I wasn’t happy for her to put my friends in the shituation of having almost no one in-store. \n\nOfc, the night out comes around, we go out, have a good time, come back around 1:30am. She’s drunk a little too much, ofc. And then, ofc, she was feeling awful the next morning. Shocker. \n\nI prewarn my friends that she’s gonna be feeling rough, but I drive her into work (even tho she has her own car) for 10am, and then go back home to nurse my own hangover a little. And then, I start getting texts. “I feel so awful”, “I can’t focus at all”, “I feel so light headed”. I was expecting it, but I told her that it’ll pass eventually and to just keep drinking water. Then she starts asking me to come in, that I can have her pay for that day, etc... and even though I’d made it clear I wasn’t happy about the requests, and I wouldn’t be working, eventually by about 1pm, (Stupidly) I relented, grabbed my work top and started to drive over. \n\nAnd this is what I’m really, really pissed about. I got there, and walked in the door, looked pretty annoyed. “Elliomitch, it’s ok, I’m feeling better now, you don’t need to work”.\n\nShe’s now upset that I’m really mad at her, and we have fallen out over it...

      "description": "About 8 months ago the company I was at laid off over half of the development team. I was not laid off, but it was made pretty clear that there was not going to be room to grow there so I started looking for a new job. Got a new offer within a month at a place about 45 minutes - 1 hour away for $25k more than I was making. During rush hour my commute was about 1h15m - 1h30m. I'd leave around 7am and get home around 6:30pm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur lease was ending in three months, and we had been planning on moving out already. I suggested moving somewhere in-between where we work and let her choose the place. So she found a place she thought she liked and we ended up moving there. It's about a 30 minute commute to work for me, and a 30-40 minute commute to work for her depending on traffic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, for the hobby. She's part of a non-profit organization from our college that creates cat sanctuaries. She takes care of two cats that live outside her house from junior year. It's about 10 minutes from her work, but it's in the opposite direction. Her commute home, including feeding the cats (as in parking, going to the sanctuary and feeding the cats), is about 1h15m.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hates it, understandably, because having a 1h15m commute sucks balls. But it's a hobby, there's other people in the organization that can help feed the cats, but she's adamant that she has to be the one to do it. She wants me to look for a new job so that we can move back to where we used to live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the first month, I said yeah we can do that once our lease is up, but I've actually grown to like my new job a lot. I'm a respected member of the team, the workload is pretty heavy but manageable, my boss is a great guy, and the money is good. I even got a 5k raise in my yearly review. I said we can try to move 15 minutes closer, but she says that's barely going to make a difference and we have to move all the way back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just think that's ridiculous. I get that she loves these cats, but I don't think she needs to be the one to feed them every day. I think it would be absolutely absurd to leave my job just so that she can be closer to the cats. She complains about it constantly and we keep getting in fights because I tell her she should just let someone else feed them during the week and that I wouldn't move anywhere that my commute would be longer than 45 minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy latest suggestion has been that we wait for our lease to end and try to see if we can switch to monthly payments with no lease, then if I can find a new job that seems good we can move. She's not happy with that and wants to move as soon as the lease is up. We ended up getting into a fight about it where I said that living somewhere that our commutes to work are similar is more important than living close to her cats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get that it's important to her. Hell, I even used to drive her there every weekend before she got a car, and helped pay for the food before she started taking food donations. I actually think it's amazing what she does and how committed she is to them, but I just think it's ridiculous to base decisions about my career around these cats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My younger brother's 13. I'm 19M. Recently, he's been asking some people, including me, about how to get a crush. We had a pretty lengthy conversation with it, because I'm on vacation from college for the week. \n\nSo, he mentioned that he asked a female friend of his, and she said something along the lines of just be nice. I told him while it's true, it'a not the greatest advice, because *just being nice* won't really do anything. You need to be nice + do some other stuff. Later on in the conversation, when he kept mentioning a lot of advice the same female friend gave (most of it *true* but not good advice). So I asked him, is this girl straight? He said, as far he knows, yes. I told him, it's generally not good for guys to take dating advice from straight girls (or vice versa, girls taking advice from straight guys), because straight girls don't have experience trying to get other girls to like them romantically. \n\nFor whatever reason, my brother let this drop to my mom. I don't think it's a big deal, but she thinks it's sexist. I don't see it that way because 1) it's common sense that straight girls have no experience flirting with other girls, and therefore aren't going to be giving the best advice and 2) it isn't sexist, because it goes both ways, and the vice versa also applies: I wouldn't expect girls to come to be fir dating advice on how to get a guy, because I have no experience with that.\n\nAita?",

Except if they're damaged. He tells me now that it's for a switch and the switch uses... USB C so he got really mad and told me i'm a retard. He didn't have his switch with him before nor did he say it was for a switch he just sayed nintendo... It did state that it works only with 2DS and 3DS Am in the wrong here ? ",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my friend's boyfriend to come to a music festival with us?",
      "description": "I'll try to make this as short as possible. I'm(18F) going to a music fest over the summer with my friends Erica (19F) and Liz (17F), for the second year in a row. Last year, the three of us went, along with Erica's cousin(20M), because our parents would only allow us to go if a guy came to \"chaperone\". I'm now dating him, but I wasn't at the time of the festival. A few months ago, I asked them how they'd feel about my close friend coming with us, as I knew she'd get along with them + liked the same bands. Liz said she'd prefer it to be just the three of us. I saw where she was coming from and dropped the idea.\n\nWell now Liz is in a relationship with her coworker Jared(25M), and they're constantly joined at the hip. I disapprove of their relationship for obvious reasons, but I don't inherently dislike Jared. Erica and I have tried to be understanding, but we've been irritated because Liz has been assimilating Jared into our lives by bringing him everywhere we go and engaging in excessive PDA. We told her that we won't hold it against her, but can't support the relationship due to the age gap. Anyway, Liz mentioned the idea of Jared coming to the fest with us several times. We've both told her no, as we thought it was gonna be just the 3 of us and we didn't wanna change that. Liz started trying to list reasons he should come: that he could buy alcohol in-festival, and that he could \"protect\" us. She also tried to say that it wasn't fair that I got to bring my boyfriend last year, but she can't bring Jared. I think the situations are completely different since I wasn't dating him last year, he's Erica's cousin + our friends, andd our parents wanted him to go. Liz told us she understood where we were coming from and we thought the matter was done with.\n\nApparently not. Liz texted us today asking if Jared can come to the festival with us, and that he bought a 10 person tent for the 4 of us and sent a photo of them putting together the tent. We didn't respond for awhile and she started calling us and texting us separately. Erica and I are trying to figure out what to do in this situation. At this point Liz isn't even giving us a choice. We feel like Liz is disregarding our feelings on the matter, and also being a bit of a hypocrite since she was the one so insistent on it being the three of us. It's not even that we dislike Jared, we just think we'll have a better time without him there. When they're together, they're all over each other and it irritates me and Erica.  Is it really that hard for Liz to go a weekend without Jared? We just want a carefree weekend with our gal pals and bringing Jared would change the entire dynamic.\n\nAm I being unreasonable here? I mean, maybe we're making a big deal out of nothing. But it really irritates me that Liz won't take no for an answer and keeps pressuring us to agree.",

      "description": "Me and my gf are in a long distance relationship so everyday(yes literally every single day) we call at around 10 o clock. It was her idea to do it because it made her feel safe and all that stuff but the thing is it can kinda be annoying, I try to do my best to make the best out of it but it can really by tiring and annoying at some times. From Monday through Friday I have school, I get up at 6 am and go to school at 7 am and get out at 2 pm and on Saturdays I have work where I get up at around 8-9 pm and work till 3-5 depending on how the day is and Sundays I usually get up early since my family goes out. I don’t Go Take naps because my dad gets mad at that and my gf always suspects me of doing something I shouldn’t because when I take naps I usually just knock out but the reason I’m always tired is because I don’t get enough sleep. My Parents Recommend I go to sleep at 9 pm but I always have to wait until 10 pm so I can call my gf , she usually wants us to do something like play roblox watch a movie or just call and talk but I’m not really good at starting conversations and sometimes that’s the reason behind us fighting. We played Roblox 3 days straight and we usually stay up all the way until 12 or 1 and usually when I don’t want to do something she’ll get mad and this will carry on all the way until a week or so, I never tell her no because she’s sorta like a cry baby where she’ll cry until she gets what she wants but lately it’s getting annoying and I don’t know if I’m in the wrong or not. She also enjoys Video calling and makes me video call her for a week straight or so but I barley show my face at all. I’m not allowed to fall asleep before her because she’ll have a nightmare and we have to leave the call on and wear earbuds the entire night until we wake up, I hate to admit it but I really am annoyed of this, Am I the asshole for not liking this ",

      "description": "We're both 17, I'm about to be 18, and we're supposed to be going to college next year. We've been dating for 7 months and I consider this a very serious relationship. Neither of us are dating just to fool around or have fun, but to be in a committed long term relationship. \n\nBefore we started dating, someone had mentioned she had some interest in being in the military, but once I started getting to know her it was clear she was much more serious about the healthcare route. However, recently that has apparently changed. \n\nShe has been talking more and more about a career in the military, and when I ask her why, she can't seem to give me a real answer. Because of scholarships, she will already have almost no student debt when she graduates from college. Both of the careers she's considering doing in the military, computer science and physical therapy, are more lucrative in the private sector from what I know and come with a lot less sacrifices. She even told me that her goal was to help people, but now she's thinking about doing computer science in the military and I'm confused. \n\nI know many would say that it's too early to be thinking about this, but I do not want to be married to someone in the military. I mean no disrespect to the veterans who sacrifice so much of our lives to keep our country safe, but that's not what I want for my life. I have never wanted to have anything to do with the armed forces and everything that comes along with it, and the freedom we'd be loosing by making that commitment is the same freedom that I'm seeking by not wanting kids. \n\nEventually she told me that her main reason for wanting to join (if she does, she's still just looking at her options) is for the pride and honor of serving her country. That's a noble thing to feel, and I've told her that if that's how she feels then she needs to pursue her dreams regardless of what I think, but if she decides to do that then I do not think I can stay with her. This is a girl that I love and that I care SO MUCH about, and if this is her dream and what will make her happy then that's what I want for her, but that's not what I want for myself. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I broke up with her if she decides to do this? I haven't told her that I would do that or anything because I don't want to give her an ultimatum or influence her decision by waving our relationship over her head, and I think that she thinks that if she joins nothing will change, but I think that if she follows through with that I will break up with her.

I divorced my ex about four years ago, and custody has always been a point of contention between us. Eventually, my ex decided that if I ever wanted to do something with the kids that was on her time, I had to ask her first.\n\nSo, once a year, our church invites all the men to go on a little road trip to see a basketball game. I took my son last year, and we had a fun time. He got a signed basketball and he got to shoot a free throw (which he made). I wanted to take him again this year, but it turns out that the date falls on one of my ex’s weekends. I figured “Okay, I’ll ask him if he wants to go and then ask her if he says he does.” So, I call him, and he says wants to go. Thing is, he goes to ask his mom before I can, so I get an angry e-mail asking me what the hell I think I’m doing. I explain, and she claims that I’m being a manipulative bully.

      "description": "Howdy Reddit,\n\nFor context I am 15yo Male and a freshman in HS. After breaking up with my ex I took a little time to get over her and then took a break from even thinking about dating. But about a month or so ago I ended up developing a crush on a different girl. I told a few friends some of which are mutual friends with her. One of my friends who isn't the best at keeping a secret keeps wanting to know who she is. I keep refusing to tell him but he keeps insisting. I am worried that it will get out I'd he finds out so I haven't told him. He brings up the fact that we are good friends and that he supposedly can keep a secret which the first is true but I'm not sure about the second.\n\nShould I tell him? Should I not? Who is un the wrong here? Some help would be appreciated.\n\nTl;dr- my somewhat untrustworthy friend wants to know who I like but I don't want to tell him.",

      "description": "My friend and I have been best friends for a few years now. We could be considered sisters. Before I became friends with her I had another best friend and we ended on bad terms. However, a few weeks ago my ex best friend and I started hanging out again because she apologized. When my current best friend found out, this angered her and she stopped talking to me. At first it was little things but then it grew into her purposely finding ways not to talk to me. (we go to school together so I see her everyday). It wasn’t until I texted her a few days later - because I knew if I didn’t text her she wouldn’t text me - that I found out she was mad at me for re-establishing a friendship with my ex best friend.  This conversation ended with us saying we had a “clean slate”. This made no sense because the next day and even now she continues to ignore me and puts no effort in establishing our friendship again. Now, it’s been more than a month and she continues to not talk to me and even hangs out with people she said she would never hang out with. So am I the asshole for not wanting to rekindle this friendship even though we’ve been friends for a long time? ",

      "description": "My partner and I traveled to Cancun for Valentine’s Day and on the flight back, our flight was delayed around two hours so we decided to take advantage of our priority pass lounge access. The wait is around 30 minutes since it is packed and we decide to wait it out. Once we are let it, we scored a comfy couch and a large chair where we can relax. At our thirty minutes of being there, my hub decides to go check our flight info since we don’t have a gate. While he’s gone, this family of four comes towards me and asks if they can sit on the couch. I told them my husband was sitting there so it is up to him, so I can give him a call. I call him and ask him if the family can take the couch he was sitting on, he said no since the call is cutting in and out and it was hard to explain to him that they probably only want to take a small area of the couch. When I hung up I let them know that they are more than welcome to take the chairs that are in front of us since there are 3 and someone can sit on his end for the couch. The woman then told me well since you’re sitting on that large chair can’t you just get up and sit with him?? To which I said no? Mind you, all of my stuff is on this area of the seat as well as my phone, which is charging. She said, “wow you’re very rude.” When my husband returns, the woman is trying her hardest to make it as unbearable as possible for us to be sitting near her. At one point she was about to push my husband off for her to be able to sit down. Mind you, there was a chair for her to sit, but it seems like she really wanted to prove her point that she wanted to sit on the couch. Her husband keeps telling her to keep it down and quietly telling her to stop as she keeps on being obnoxious. There was an elderly couple sitting in front of us that heard the whole thing go down so as they left, they offered the family their table and the staff of the lounge also quickly cleaned it up for them. This made me feel bad since she had two children with them and the staff was quick to help them out. AITA for not giving up our chairs for a family of four?",

      "description": "My cousin and I work in the same place. He's actually the one that referred me and got me this job, which I am still thankful for. I've been driving him to and from work for 8 months now. Small info to note is that he's 24 and doesn't know how to drive, nor does he have his permit. He also tells me that he's paycheck to paycheck even though his bills are only 1/3 of what we make per month. \n\nHe hasnt given me a single dime for gas. I've also taken him to a lot of places outside of work. I helped load his stuff in my car when he was moving out of his house. I helped sell his stuff on my ebay and gave him 100% of his profit after the taxes.\n\nMy brother, 19, also works with us. Today after work, he calls me and tells me about all of the disrespectful stuff that our cousin has done or said about my us to me. There was a time where he kept trying to play bloody knuckles with my brother and constantly saying no, he punched my brother in the arm. I was working but was not around the area at that time. There's another incident where my brother showed him a picture of his gf at the time and my cousin flat out said, \"She looks like she gives good head.\" Then proceeds to try and hit on her via fb the moment he finds out that my brother and her broke up after giving a sexual relationship. To this day he still tries to hit on her. My brother knows because his ex still tells him about how our cousin keeps liking all of her pictures and sending her pm. Then on days when I call in, my cousin gets upset because I \"told him last minute,\" when in reality I tell him the moment I find out I wont be able to make it, which is usually in the morning when our shift doesn't start until 3:30pm. He's also told my brother to take him to another city that was 4 hours away, which my brother actually did, and told my brother to not tell me. There's a lot more instances, but just listing a few: He's called me retarded and stupid (not in a joking matter) to my brother, doesnt ask if I take him somewhere but instead says that he needs to go to this place, doesnt throw his trash out from my car, has spilled stuff in my car many times, talks trash about my brothers new car every time him and another coworker talk about cars, wants to know everything that I do on the days that I call in or cant take him to work, and a whole lot more.\n\nI feel horrible because I know he won't be able to get lunch even though he does know a lot of the coworkers here. But I'm hurt. And I feel as if hes stepping over me and especially my brother which I cannot accept. I also feel bad because my supervisor is the one who picks him up and sends him home when I can't which I know he'll be the next one who my cousin goes to once I let him know.\n\nTLDR: My cousin got me this job with him. I've been taking my cousin to work for 8 months now, gas free, and after finding out that hes been disrespectful to my brother and I, I'm going to stop taking him to work. AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "Long story short. A coworker got a DUI leaving happy hour around a month ago. (Her third one) Everything after that has been a pity story. Or we should all feel bad for her. She can't get her kids gifts anymore because of the fees associated with the DUI, yet she comes in with a new hair weave. New nails. Weed cartridges. She always clarifies everything is on \"a tab.\"  \n\nNow all of my coworkers are looking at me as a \"heartless person\" for not wanting to contribute money/gifts to someone who I feel isn't even helping herself, better yet her children. \n\nOn top of all that I'm going through hard financial times myself too, but it's not something I go around work talking about. \n\nShe's a single mom too by the way.

      "description": "So when my GF and I first started dating (2 years ago) she instituted a rule where I have to notify her of all Facebook friend requests I get and that she has to approve them in order for me to accept them. I thought the rule was stupid and controlling but I agreed because I don’t really use FB all that much so I didn’t feel it was worth the fight.\n\nNow fast forward about 6 months ago. My work hired someone new, a woman. I am by far the youngest person in my office and she was closer to my age then everyone else so I think she felt comfortable talking to me. She got into a fight with another co-worker pretty early on and came to me for advice and how to handle it. I told me GF about this and she was not happy. She claimed that the new co-worker was too friendly and instructed I stay away from her. She then insisted that I show her my work email about once a week so she could properly monitor my interactions with her. Again, I thought this was a bit much, but I didn’t really care because I had nothing to hide and I truly love my GF. Eventually this stopped however when I made it clear she had nothing to worry about. \n\nNow fast forward to now, about a month ago this co-worker sent me a friend request on Facebook. I accepted it without thinking anything of it and forgot to tell my GF. \n\nLast night, my GF demanded I give her my phone so that she could inspect it. After I gave it to her she realized I had friended my co-worker without telling her and she completely lost it. She claimed I “cheated” on her, she broke up with me, and she even contacted the co-worker to tell her to stay away from me. \n\nI think this is all a huge overreaction. I never cheated on her, I never even came close to doing anything I would consider innapropriate. I don’t even interact with my coworker on Facebook, no messages or likes or anything. \n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole?\n",

Someone was asking for the number of a good medium and I felt I needed to point out that they are all scams meant to take advantage of the bereaved and it's practitioners are either mentally ill or liers. I'd say I'm pretty ok with people having Thier own beliefs and such. I care not a wit what your religion is as long as it's not hurting anyone. I'm even kind of ok with \"psychics\" because I think most people understand  it in the same way  as astrology. Something fun to burn time. But mediums.... Mediums piss me off. Stuffing their words into the mouths of the dead and claiming they came from your loved one. Its about as sacreligious as you can get without being religious. Someone may as well write me a letter and say its from my wife, but neither the penmanship nor the thought behind it was hers. And it never will be. Its like losing that sweater they last wore and getting a new one that looks sorta like it and thinking it's going to mean the same. Its not. It never will.",

We had lots in common and we hung out all the time. Everyone in our little friend group besides her knew a had a crush on her, including this one guy. Let's call him Mike. I asked her out because Mike encouraged me to ask her out that night. We ended up dating and since this was my first relationship I was unsure of what to do. \nMy friends and I all went to these youth groups in our small town and Mike would always be there. At first it started with playful banter and him constantly asking me to fight.(Which I didn't mind until it started to escalate.) It then turned into very casual flirting in front of me. Then he actually became physical with me. It got to the point that at least once a day I would have someone I knew stop me in the halls and tell me about them flirting with eachother. I even heard that they kissed but that was from a person who likes escalating things so I dont know if it was true or not. \nI have two really close friends a female and a Male. The female I have known since kindergarten and had a crush on in elementary. That stopped but we have been best friends since probably grade 1. \nMy second friend was a guy who really didn't approve of our relationship. She wasn't the greatest gf and did some things to me that upset him, including flirting with Mike. He explained that he didn't like that we were together and my gf found out. \n",

      "description": "So I had a girlfriend of 9 years. When we met, she was just about to start university. A degree takes exactly 3.5 years where we live. I started uni a year later than her, and finished waaay earlier than her, while she admittedly failed some classes along the way.\n\nAfter one more year, I asked her how long will it take for her to finish, as I had plans to move in together, engagement, etc. She said some classes are too hard for her, please be patient, 2 years tops.\nI asked a year later. Said 1 year.\nI asked again a year later. Said 1 year again.\nAnd this went on for quite long time. I am a patient guy, and I loved her, and supported her above all.\nI even tried to help her with those difficult subjects.\n\nThen one year, I accidently walked pass her, and caught a glimpse of her computer screen. It was her online records. I went to the same school, so I automatically seen and deciphered everything that was on screen. She was nowhere near even close to finishing her degree. She was not even at the halfway mark, based on her credits. If she completed every single course on the first try from now on, she would take 2 more years.\nThis was the point I realized, that she spent 9 years for a 3.5 years long degree, never worked, never kept the house clean, and will possibly never finish this school. \n\nI told her, that I want to see her records after the next exam period. If she fails the exams yet again, I'm out. If she fails to show me the results, I'm out. Mind you, during exam periods, she played league of legends for hours without me ever seeing her actually studying. \n\nNext exam period has passed, and she didn't show me the results on her own. I asked her to show me the records, but she refused. Next day, I broke up with her. She was surprised, and said now I am the asshole. \n",

Anyway this started an argument where he told me he was unhappy. Whenever I asked why he was like “I’m going out” and then wouldn’t respond for a while. \n\nThen he came back and said to me that he hates that I didn’t put kisses on my text and that I don’t love him because I never mention him on Facebook. Then he said he didn’t want to be here anymore and goodbye forever and he was going for a walk. \nAnyway, I was in hospital at this point so not much I could do in regards to getting to him to ensure he was safe. Plus he lives like an hours drive away. So I tried calling and calling him and no answer so obviously I was worried out of my mind. So I messaged his mum and told her what had happened and she replied “Oh he’s in bed asleep now, he’s fine. He does this often just ignore it” \n\nSo anyway, I got some sleep knowing he was ok. But I wanted to know wtf it was all about. \n\nSo the next day I asked him to come and talk to me face to face and he made some lame excuse. \nAnyway, it’s now like what 5 days or so since then and he just won’t talk to me. \n\nAm I the asshole here for wanting to know what’s up?

      "description": "Hello, I try to make this as short as possible.\nLittle bit of a background: when I was living with my brother, mother and his third husband, they mistrested me physically and mentally. My mom has bitten me, scrathed me, pulled my hair and pulled my hands with aggression. My step father has hit me in the head with varoius objects (bottles, household stuff etc). Also they are really manipulative and forced me to do all the house work since I was 12. My mom once kicked me and his husband out of the house when I was 13 or 14 because she accused us for fucking behind her back, which is absolutely not true. And this is just a little bit of things what has happened. I'm no longer in contact with my mother or her husband.\n\nMy brother (as far as I know) hasn't ever got physical punishemnt, but this is not for certain. He's always been the favourite child, however he just sits and plays in his room because he is scared of our mother and is very anxous. Also he has said that there's no food in the house, just beer and they have been drinking for years everyday, I've witnessed it. Now, they force him to do all the housework.\n\nMy brother's father (not my father) wishes that my brother would live with him and my brother too, but they are too scared to ask my mother that. I asked the CPS to help with the moving out. Also they haven't let me to see my brother at all and black mail me by not letting us see each other. My brother is 14 and cries because of this, but my mother wants just to punish me.\n\nSo, after I filed the report, my grandma, who's always been on my side, called me and accused me of breaking our family and said that if I just could spend time with my mother, none of us would be unhappy. My former stepfather/brother's father, who's very dear to me, also won't talk to me anymore and my brother has blocked me from all the social media (this might be my mother's doing, last time me and my brother chatted, he wanted to see me so bad). \nI don't know if deserve this or not. \n\ntl;dr AITA for filing a case for my brother's neglect even if it breaks the family apart?\n\n",

      "title": "WIBTA for not allowing my mother’s boyfriend at my wedding?",
      "description": "TLDR: I despise my mother’s boyfriend who has not treated me well and do not want him in attendance at my wedding. WIBTA for not allowing my mother to bring him? \n\nBasic backstory is that my mother and father separated when I was around 12 and have both since found new relationships. It wasn’t the messiest divorce, but by no means was it amicable and I was very angry for how it went down, especially in regards to my mother, for quite a few years. \n\nAt this point, I’m 21 and have a wonderful boyfriend that I’ve been with for over a year. We’re living together in his country while I do university here and it’s been going well. We‘re not engaged, but we’ve spoken about it and it’s just a matter of when (I’m not pressuring him).\n\nI despise my mothers boyfriend. My mother didnt handle a new relationship with this person and her children well. She moved him into our house without any regard for my or my sister’s feelings. We were just ambushed one day and told that he and his disabled mother were moving in. I admit that at first he attempted to form some sort of relationship with me, but when I didn’t bite, it became mutual ignorance. He then began to erase every semblance of my father from that house. He destroyed our pool, he turned my sandbox into a pit for his cigarettes, he painted over the mural that my father painted for me, etc. \n\nI never left my bedroom because I was so uncomfortable in the house and barely spoke to my\nmom. The only time I got with my mother was when we would watch this one show every week. Once when we were watching this show, he came in, grabbed the remote from me, and told me about how I was such a terrible child who didn’t respect my mother or him and I needed to get my act together and then threw the remote and stormed out. I never again watched that show with my mother. \n\nAfter I went to university, things got a bit better with my mom and I worked on forging a relationship with her that didn’t involve him. And things are better now. We hang out and talk and I’m happy to have her in my life. But I will not go to anything if he is involved. To be honest, I don’t really care if she feels bad for having to pick me or him because I was never picked when I needed her when I was younger. She says I don’t want her to be happy, but I believe that incredibly selfish to say and I don’t want to deal with it. \n\nAnyway, here’s the basic question. I told my boyfriend that my mother could not come with him to our wedding. He doesn’t think that’s fair to her as he’s in a very similar situation with his mother and her boyfriend and that I should want my mother there no matter what. He tolerates her boyfriend and speaks to him because he loves his mother so much, but he doesn’t like him. I don’t want that. I don’t want to feel this hate inside me when I’m supposed to be my happiest. So WIBTA for only allowing my mother to come without him? ",

      "description": "So I live in a college house with a lot of girls, one of the girls has her boyfriend stay over every single night (basically live) at our house for 4 months. HE DOES NOT PAY RENT OR UTILITIES. He has his own room at another house a mile away and he does all of his showering there. His main impact on my life is the fact that he uses the kitchen a lot, takes a ton of time in the bathroom, and parks in our 2 spot driveway. \n\nI have tried to talk with my roommate multiple times about how I feel calmly and respectfully about what we could do to make our living situation work for everyone, whether that would be financially contributing or being added into the cleaning schedule.  The last time I tried to talk to her about this she screamed at me that it’s just a personal problem I have with her and I’m a bitch. \n\nTo be fair she has some valid points, I don’t really like her, because she does stuff like this and is generally disrespectful. I haven’t always been the best roommate, I’m kind of obsessive about cleaning and could do a better job of expressing myself. But I’m pretty sure that it’s pretty common to feel like people living at a house should contribute.  Also if it matters it’s 2 against (me and pal)/3 don’t care/4 in favor.  \n\nAnyways, WIBTA for stirring up shit with this roommate and potentially others for trying to get him out of here or to at least financially contribute? \n",

      "description": "Okay. So this happened a couple of years ago. My uncle picked me up from the airport with a girl that he called his \"friend\". We went around doing a lot of things together. I was pretty suspicious, like, who in the world is this chick? I remember meeting her several years back when. I. was younger, but it was like one meeting and I. was younger. This time I was basically going. around the city. with her and my uncle and so I. was like...  is she a mistress?? That was all I could think about. We went to her apartment, she took me. to the salon, we went out to eat, she even was there in the morning when I was hospitalized at the ER to bring me breakfast O\\_O!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while, I finally. asked. my mom who was surprised that I didn't realize/ask sooner. She. confirmed my guess. Yes, that woman was my uncle's mistress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I had very conflicting feelings about this. She treated me quite nicely, and so I did like her. My grandma likes her. My mom likes her too. And both my grandma and my mom insisted that I don't say anything at all to my aunt and not mention her at all when we talk. Because my mom was like your aunt will be furious and it's not your business etc., and that you shouldn't interfere with these things, basically. Now, I felt really. guilty, because I like my aunt and I think cheating is wrong. But I also thought the mistress was a nice person. And I didn't want to be someone who... ruins the peace, if. you. know what I mean. So in the end, my mom. convinced me, I didn't say anything, and went back home when the summer. was over. Next summer I didn't say anything either. plus, my mom does have a good point that it isn't my business...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk, I occasionally still wonder if I'm. a terrible person for not saying anything, so I wanted to ask this. here. if you guys. think I am an asshole for not saying anything in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome more background info: In China, mistresses are fairly common (so says my mom). My aunt and uncle have divorced once. (idk the reason, I think she said it was several years ago), but got back together (my mom said because the divorce didn't work out, idky). They have a son (older than my by three years and already graduated college). My. mom says my aunt and cousin probably have their suspicions, but no one says anything. The mistress is not allowed to have a child (I think if she did all. hell would break loose if it is a boy). My uncle lives in an apartment with his mistress, while my aunt and cousin live in a different apartment (I've actually been to both and slept in both...)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's my uncle who is two timing, so why does it feel like I'm the one who's two timing...? I feel like I'm living a double life whenever I visit, it's like straight out of some soap opera.",

They broke up for a bit and my friend reached out. \n\nIt’s been a very fun few months catching up and hanging out. But now that is new relationship crashed and burned, he’s going back to his ex. I’m becoming really resentful. I listened to him talk about how awful and controlling she was and how cold and distant and all the terrible things she said to him. \n\n I can’t be happy for him. Everytime he Brings her up, I feel myself shutting down and getting angry. I’ve told him my opinion on it and he doesn’t really hve much to say except that he hopes it’ll be different this time. \n\nHowever, I feel like if she starts controlling him being friends with me, I’d be done. I’ve said all I can say about why I think this is a bad idea, and two years down the line when they break up again, I don’t think I’d be able to open the door. AITA?",

      "description": "Grab a snack, this might be long. I’m going to start off with some background information\nabout my uncle and then you guys are free to judge the situation.\n\nWhen I was younger, I was very close to this aunt. She was my FAVORITE! And my uncle was always very welcoming whenever my family paid them a visit. He made sure there was dinner and snacks when my sister and I came to hang out with our little cousin. He was just...nice!\n\nAs I got older (I’m 25 now), I started noticing things like he was ALWAYS drinking beer whenever I saw him. And he never made eye contact with people when he talked to them. I chalked the eye contact up to anxiety, and the drinking to relaxing on his days off.\n\nFour years ago, my aunt (mom’s sister) began having tremors and couldn’t function anymore. She had to quit her nursing job at the hospital. They didn’t qualify for government assistance because even without her working, my uncle made too much money I guess. So it was only him working for awhile.\n\nThen he was fired.\n\nWhen he was fired his drinking got progressively worse and he became violent. He would yell at and hit my aunt. He threatened suicide and pulled a gun on himself. Then he started taking my aunts medication that she needed.\n\nMy aunt was getting more sick by the day. Now she’s using a walker and has gotten her license taken away. She can only eat purées because she can’t chew her food with her tremors. She’s on CBD pills to calm her tremors. \n\nShe moved in with my grandmother to escape. She stayed there for a few months with my little cousin, while her brother stayed with my uncle. She got a PFA against him and was adamant about not going back. The cops took all of the guns out of the house. \n\nMy family stepped up when he wouldn’t. We had fundraisers, bought her family groceries, took my little cousin to and from work. Made sure the kids had clothes and supplies for school. \n\nThen she went back to him. And nothings changed. The PFA was taken off.\n\nCome to this summer. I got engaged in May and we decided to do a short engagement and get married in January! So in June I already had a guest list semi compiled. My family planned a bbq for August to celebrate the engagement. We were at a birthday party for my two cousins (mom’s brother’s kids). The bbq was brought up because invites were handed out to family. I told my aunt that her husband was not invited to the bbq or the wedding because I don’t support how he treated her. She agreed and so did my little cousin. They both said they didn’t want him there either. My aunt and cousin came to the bbq and had a good time! All was well.\n\nUntil yesterday. I was browsing Facebook and my aunt had posted a status saying how she’s “not in her right mind but she needs to vent” and how “if her loving husband isn’t accepted because of his mistakes then she’s not accepted either” and he’s “been clean for over a year” (which is a lie because this summer he nearly shot his foot off because he was so high on HER medication and alcohol but oookay).\n\nI showed it to my mom who then told me my aunt asked her if he could come to the wedding this past weekend, to which she said absolutely not.\n\nI just don’t want a man who beat my aunt, who takes her live saving pills to get his own high, who drinks until he’s literally unconscious and the ambulance needs to come save him...at my wedding. I haven’t talked to him in 4 years, I see no reason to invite him if I dislike him.\n\nSo, Reddit. Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: Abusive, alcoholic, pill stealing uncle is offended he’s not invited to my wedding. Aunt is offended as well so the family isn’t coming. I don’t want him there. ",

      "description": "Sorry for formatting, on mobile. TL:DR at bottom\n\nI (25m) and my friend (25f) went out to have a drink after work as we normally do. We both work at the same place and I just so happened to be getting out earlier than her tonight so the plan was I was going to drink while I waited for her, sober up when she's there, and go home when I'm feeling ok. I finish my drink by the time she arrives and around 20 mins into her getting there she orders me a drink.\n\nWhile at the bar waiting I had decided that I was just gonna have the one, wait for her to get there, and get out when I sober up which wouldn't have been more than an hour and a half. She didn't know this and me not wanting to fight with her about a drink she was paying for I reluctantly accepted. So I was forced to stay a little later than I would have liked.\n\nAround 11 this group of guys shows up, typical middle aged drinking at the bar because it's very cheap type of guys. They start doing shots with everyone in the bar, I refuse and my friend accepts the shot offer. She ended up doing roughly 5 shots of Petrone along with her 3 other drinks she had earlier.\n\nA 6th shot comes for her and she refused to do it so she goes around the bar to the group of guys and gets one of them to drink it for her. The guy that took the shot only did it if she would let him get to know her as he grabbed at her waist and pulled her into himself. Immediately after hearing that I went into dad mode where I was staring this guy down. He did the shot and she went back over to chat and this guy would not let his hands off her.\n\nShe knows the bartender very well and trusts her as well as a bar regular that we've both become acquainted with, so I know if I leave they'll watch out for her. But this dude had a very creepy vibe going on about him and he was sitting with the group of guys that came in together so I stayed just to be safe.\n\nShe was pretty tipsy and I was worried about her so I ended up taking her keys to make sure she couldn't drive off anywhere, probably not the best move but it's the one that came to me at the time.\n\nBar is closing down and tabs are being collected and she's still chatting with the dude. Finally comes over the pay her tab and I tell her that I was concerned about her getting home and either we were going to sit in the parking lot until she sobered up or I would drive her home. She told me I wasn't driving her home and assured me we'd wait in the parking lot. She goes back over to chat with the dude\n\nBartender is kicking people out at 1 and after about 10 mins I tell the bartender that when she comes over to get her stuff to tell her I have her keys and I'll be waiting in my car. Wait in my car for about 20 mins until she finally comes out with the dude and immediately gets angry at me for taking her keys. I tell her calmly that I need her to get in my car because I need to have a chat with her, which she finally accepts. I have her the keys, she reads me the riot act for doing what I did. I apologized to her, told her I understood where she was coming from and why she's angry with me, and told her that I was just looking out for her and I only did it because I care about her. So AITA for this?\n\nTL:DR. Friends and I went drinking. She had to many shots of Petrone. Offloads her last shot on a creepy guy that is very handsy with her. I pull a dad move and take her keys to make sure she can't leave",

      "description": "My wife and I got in a disagreement last night about the topic of her friend had both her bio dad and step dad walk her down the isle.  In this situation, the step dad was the better man, and more involved with her throughout her life.  I explained to my wife that it would offend me if my daughter asked this of me as the bio dad.  Especially if I was truly a good father figure in her life.  \n\nTo me it is an escape goat of not trying to hurt ones feelings, the end of the day one dad was probably better then the other.  And whomever is walking her down on the right side is the one truly giving her away at the alter/ceremony. You will be offending one of the dads regardless in this situation, and if the bio dad is truly a great dad, he deserves the honor. \n\nI could see how if both dads were truly great and awesome dads, that this would be a pickle (and I think majority of us truly would want that for our daughters, if a divorce sadly happened) but the end of the day the bio dad wins out, because blood is thicker then water.  Have you ever came across this situation at a wedding, and the real question is WIBA if my daughter asked me to walk her down the isle on the left side and I took great offense, and made an issue of it (again assuming that I'm a good dad).  \n\nFYI, this is a hypothetical situation for me, as I'm married to my wife obviously and my girls are both under four years old.  They better not be getting married anytime soon. But my wife thought I was an AH for thinking this situation was goofy/silly/odd.  I really think you should just keep it to one person walking the bride down the isle.    ",

      "description": "Today is her birthday, and she wants to do something for it. I made plans with a different friend to eat dinner today about 3 days ago. Birthday girl reminded me 2 days ago that April 3 is her special cool day, and asked what we were gonna do for it. I don't want to cancel on dinner friend, because I don't get to see her often. Birthday girl is my roommate (yes I know I don't know my roommates birthday by heart, I've always been bad at remembering them), so I see her all the time and I think maybe we can officially celebrate for her tomorrow or some other future night. So I guess the crux of the question is, WIBTA if I tell birthday girl that I made other plans, but I still want to do something special another night?",

At the same time I placed the three remaining copies on a table where there, among other books, were two books by other politicians from other parties. I also sold one of the books today, so now we only have two copies left. \n\nWhen my coworker came into work today she saw the book and asked me why I had put them there. I answered truthfully, which was that a customer had asked for it. She, as well as other coworkers apparently, didn’t even want the book in the store as they don’t like the politician. \n\nAITA? I don’t think it’s our place to engage in censorship, we’re just a normal bookshop, if people can read books by other politicians, why not her? However, she didn’t like it, and expressed that my other coworkers probably wouldn’t like it either.",

However now, there are a few members of the core group who would like to make it a physical display at our next MAJOR event.\n\nI think this is a fucking terrible idea.\nIMO, this is on the same level as trying to argue that its ok to display a swastika as it was not originally an image of Hate, Racism and Violence.\n\nI have explained to several group memebers on our council group my views on this and have even offered the alternitive of maybe attaching LED'S so that it glows to the cross instead of setting alight but I seem to have hit quite a bit of of a wall with them.\n\nI am unsure of whether or not they will go ahead with this at the event at this point. Getting ready for big events like these as a woman with a weaving and textile display is a big cost in both time and effort, let alone childcare.\n\nI really love attending these events with our group and look forward to this event in particular. \n\nAITA for telling them I would leave the group immediately if this idea is not canned so close to the event?

      "description": "I’ve been playing on a local darts team for about 6 months now. This guy, who might have been in his early 40s, had just joined and at his first practice with us he managed to start two fights and get kicked out of the venue, but he promised that he would behave himself if he was allowed to stay on the team, so he was allowed to come to our next game and I was asked to play with him for our doubles games. Immediately before we started playing he got completely plastered and he would repeatedly press up against me from behind or lean against my shoulder, he did this a couple dozen times in the first game even though I would always move away from him. I talked to the captain and to a couple other teammates and was told that he had done the same thing to some other women on the team. They told me they were going to pay close attention. During the second game I asked him politely to stop touching me, and he listened... for about 5 minutes. Then he started doing it again. I told him more firmly to stop touching me and I thought that maybe he was going to stop, until our third game started. When I went to take my turn and had my back turned to him he decided to blow as hard as he could on the back of my neck. I yelled “what the hell is wrong with you”, called him a fucking idiot and asked how he even functions in society while being that clueless. I told him he shouldn’t even go outside if he can’t keep his hands to himself and learn how to behave. At that point I forfeited the game and refused to play anymore so we had to give that match to the other team, and I told the team captain I wasn’t going to play with him again. The guy ran to the bathroom crying, I was told later that he didn’t seem to get it. The team captains decided to kick him off. I was told that there were some other complaints as well, but I still feel like an asshole, since I forfeited a game because I couldn’t stand the guy I was playing with, made a scene in front of everyone and I was pretty rude to a guy who I was told has some issues. I don’t know, did I overreact to something that was probably just an annoyance? ",

She brought her boyfriend with her, who the kids never knew until that month. He has repeatedly threatened to hit my niece and nephew with a belt, screaming at them, while my sister lets him, hell she even does the same thing.  I despise the fact people hit their kids, especially if you hit them hard enough to fall down and cant get up. My sister yells at the kids for getting mad at her, when SHE does them wrong. Her boyfriend is a druggie, he has repeatedly asked my mom to find pills for him, and even hid marijuana in my dad's dresser before my dad passed in January. C is also an uninvited guest, and always tells my sister he's gonna leave, he /does/ but comes back about 10 minutes later just to get her mad. He is also our only way to get around town, as we are too poor to get a car. Oh, my niece is 11 years old by the way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo today, at about 1:30 PM CST my niece wanted to sell an xbox one S for herself, so she was posting about it. She wanted to sell it for about $100 so she could use it for her grandma and herself to go out and eat and get their nails done. Well, in comes sister's boyfriend, lets call him C. He told us he was going to sell it for his boss for $100, he came back with $50 and kept a good bit of the money to himself. He told her he sold it to a pawn shop, which I don't believe. She was telling him to give her her money, which he already owed her $20, and he threatened to take all the money he gave her. My sister and C came upstairs, fuming, about to hit my niece before I yelled at her to stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSister got mad and started yelling at me, which I'm not going to take her shit. Now, I know my niece disrespects everyone, including me, but I believe it's my sister's way of punishing them as my sister did the same to my mother. Me and my brother do not act like that. My mother never laid a hand on us, and I love my mother dearly and would do anything for her. Her boyfriend started yelling at me, telling me not to get up on him, so i got up out of my chair and stood eye to eye with him, he may be taller than me but I'm not scared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if this is jumbled, I'm just angry and trying to get this out. He does not have a place in this house, he has not paid a dime, he is but a stranger to the kids, and to us all.",

      "description": "Lease is up in March and I asked my friend who's lease was up at the same time if she wanted to be roomies with me and my fiance.\n\nShe was back and forth about it for weeks so I just asked another friend and he is all for it.\n\nWell then she says she wants to room with us. So now we are trying to find a house with enough bathrooms for everyone and it's a nightmare.\n\nShe also has some specific needs/demands. Like we only look at houses on her days off (which are weekdays, we all have weekend off except her). She wants access to borrow the master tub and possibly shower of they are fancier than her bathroom. She also wants an in law suit style basement to herself like with a kitchen (all while spending the same amount as if it were just 1 bedroom). And electrics stove?! Ugh she could never cook with those.\n\nShe assumed we would pay 50% of the house and then 25% for her and 25% for extra friend. But we would be in one bedroom not 2. So I suggested a 30-30-40 split and it wasn't...well received. \n\nWe have 2 cats. Our friends don't have pets and will not be able to get them, but she still wants to dog sit as a side hustle. I do not want my cats (one nervous boi and one who literally has cancer and is a delicate senior) to get freaked out by the dog. I also don't want nervous boi to go nuts and scratch the dogs eye out.\n\nMy fiance has less patience with her than I do. She is like my sister so maybe I give in too easily. \n\nHe keeps telling me we should politely \"vote her off the island\". She has high demands and isn't showing a team effort in all this. We also can easily find a cheaper place with just the other roommate.\n\nSo would I be the asshole if I tell her that I don't think living together will work out? I know I need to do it soon so she can come up with a game plan.",

      "description": "So my partner and I ran a gallery until recently. We would typically have one featured artist ever month or two. They would have an opening reception where they could have a chance to talk with people about their art. We had a cut an dried commission policy (70/30). However, one artist decided she was going to tell a bunch of people at the opening that she would sell the pieces directly to them once the show was over, effectively cutting the gallery out, causing us to lose our commission. We called her out on it and she made a big deal about how she was the one that sold the art and it was too bad for us. So we took it out of her portion of some other work of hers that sold.  She freaked out and started telling everyone not to work with us and how we stole from her. Are we the assholes here??",

We play for around 10 minutes and my sister storms in and says it's clamblitz on splatoon 2 and she wants to play on the switch. I say I am playing with my friend but she says she wants to play so I give over the switch and say I have to go to my friend.\n\nThis happened many times over the past 2 months and my friend is getting horribly made at me. I say I am playing with her and maybe we can play later and say \"I'm sorry\" but he just keeps saying \"my ass\".\nHe knows it's clamblitz and he knows I am playing with her but he doesn't believe that I am sorry. I try to say no to my sister but she just doesn't care, so it's not like I'm not trying. Also our mom just forces my to play with her even though she knows I'm playing with my friend. I can't play anything else with them because the switch is in use and the other consoles can't be used. My computer is in the same room so we can hear yelling at the game while we are in a call and we can't hear eachother. I can't play with them while she's on the switch.\n\nThe worst part is was near their birthday and I feel horrible that I did that to them. They have a good reason to mad but not to not accept my apologies.\n\nSo here is my question: Who is the asshole.\nMe: for not trying hard enough to play with my friend and failing them near their birthday\nMy sister: for not letting me play with my friend \nMy friend: for being so hard on me and for not accepting my apologies even though I have explained to them my reasons",

I pulled up to the front, let her out. I couldn't wait in the front due to being a traffic hazard and I figured she'd be about 10-15 mins so I went to an open parking space, pulled in and parked. At this point, I guess the parking lot was getting full so lots of cars were driving around looking for spots. I was unaware as I was chilling in the car while it was turned on (so I could listen to music) when a car behind me honked as if they thought I was gonna pull out. I immediately recognized this and turned the car off and waived him by, letting him know I wasn't leaving. Ok so now I'm in the car, in a parking spot, turned off so nobody could know I was someone gonna leave, minding my own business when I hear a verrrry elongated honking. I turn around to see a car with an old lady in it acting really angry. I got out of my car and told her my car isn't even on and she should 'f' off. \n\nAITA for 1) sitting in a parking spot with the car off 2) getting angry at her for being rude with a nonstop honking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll admit, I prob shouldn't curse anyone out, I'll take blame for that.",

I called her horrible names, stole her things, put a picture of her head on the picture of a pig and put it on her locker, and i gave her a nickname that followed her all around school, and was just awful to her. She always ended up crying and she actually transferred to another school (either because of me or her parents just moved. I heard 2 stories.)\n\n\nNow look, i KNOW I WAS AN ASSHOLE for that. But i was 12 and my family has a very negative view of overweight people. I feel horrible about it. But what i want judgement on is this.\n\n\nBut, i discovered her on Facebook again and she's actually pretty damn hot now. She dropped all her baby fat and has grown up to be quite doable. The only fat on her now is her breasts (seriously, she's, like, an F cup.)\n\n\nAnd, i got to thinking. There's something i want to do. I want to add her as a friend and send her a message to \"apologize\". I do feel guilty, but i have somewhat of an ulterior motive. I want to apologize and ask her to meet up for coffee with her. While there, i want to make a move on her. I was thinking i apoligize and start complimenting her on how beautiful she's become and maybe make a move on her. Just rub her leg or something.\n\n\nI haven't talked to her yet, she probably doesn't even remember me.\n\n\nWould this be scummy of me? Would i be an asshole if i hit up this girl with the intent of trying to seduce her?",

Since I was new to the game and RL was his life......he completely destroyed me which I didn't mind.  However, he started really kicking my ass and would say shit like \"You know you're garbage at this game, right?\" or \"omg you know you're just trash noob\" IN THE SAME ROOM, RIGHT TO MY FACE.  I just put down the controller and stopped playing because I am not going to let an 8 year old trash talk me to my face.  He asked me why I stopped playing with him and I told him he hurt my feelings, which made him cry.  He ended up apologizing and promising he wouldn't do it, and I told him I appreciate it but I don't want to play that game anymore.\n\nSo we tried other co-op games like minecraft or human fall flat and his goal in gaming life happens to become the most annoying little shit on the planet.  I tried politely explaining to him why it's not fun when he does certain things, but he doesn't get it and his dad doesn't want to step in.  My brother just says shit like \"Dude you'll understand when your son is born this is just how they are\".\n\nIt has come to a point where I'll be playing a game by myself and immediately log off whenever he sees me playing which really hurts his feelings.\n\nI don't think I'm the asshole because he doesn't make gaming fun together.  My wife says I am the asshole for not putting up with it since he's just a kid.",

I guess to compare with the American economy is around 500 bucks. So shelling out 2 dollar here for food (which is normal for us) is like shelling out 10 bucks for food. \n\nAnywho, since she hasn't told my father where to build it, he hasn't done any of the work but has bought the parts needed to assemble it, weeks came by and there is no update. Even her cell is uncontactable. my father just shrugs it of because he had a similar incident (and to this day the person hasn't pick up the stand). \n\nAfter about a month the person came back and demanded her money back, my father is confused and just states \"I don't have the money, maybe we can just continue the stand and ship it in a week\". She doesn't want it, she said something in the lines of suddenly her newlywed son doesn't want it and wanted his money back. My father said \"I don't have 100 bucks in my pocket\" (remember 500 bucks) . \"look, I need the money right now and that is it\". I knew my father well that he doesn't want such a big order to waste, I knew he could've just transfer all of the money to her account, but my father still insisted on selling her our stuff, Since she had bought our stuff before this incident. \n\nOf course, she insisted on her demands and are semi screaming. My father fells in and just pays her the money (after going to the atm) . That day, I learnt that a business has monetary risk and that is one of them. Thoughts? ",

We live about two hours away and are freshmen in different high schools. We still talk to each other and play games very commonly.\n\nTHE STORY: H is in a relationship with person “b.” Person B is currently female, believes they are transgender and wishes to become male.  Person b also still likes males and is a relationship with H. Through various text conversations it has been revealed that B apparently has been in a toxic relationship previously, B’s partner only being in the previous relationship because “it would be cool.”\n\nApparently b has not fully recovered from any alleged trauma they received during this relationship. \n\nI was fine with h being. In a relationship with b, in fact I was happy my best friend could be in a relationship with someone he likes. But recently b’s “depressive episodes” have increased drastically. This is taking more and more time away from h’s social life just to talk to b and comfort them. So in my mind H has become more and more of a therapeutic tool for b to stave away their trauma and “depression.” \n\nIt has also been revealed that b has not tried to receive help from parents, guidance, or therapists and is relying solely on h to stave away their depression.  \n\nTHE ACTION IN QUESTION: This made me more and more angry, I tried to recognize that b may actually be depressed or something akin to it but I don’t think so. So I sent an *EXTREMELY* long text block to h detailing how I felt that b isn’t actually transgender and is just doing it to mess with h because it is funny, and you that h is being used for b’s enjoyment . I also addressed how they actually needed to get help from a therapist, not another 14 year old if they even were depressed.  So I have no respect for b and believing they are just manipulating my best friend for their own pleasure, and have said so to my best friend.\n\nWith that being said, Reddit, Am I the asshole?",

Over this course of time he hasn't ever straightforwardly acknowledged me as his girlfriend to his family and some of his friends, meaning he doesn't refer to my as his girlfriend or significant other. If anyone asks he'll deflect or call me a 'good friend'.\n\nI have, however, met his family multiple times, spent holidays with them, etc. So its not like I'm being hidden, he just won't ever call me his girlfriend in plain English. His defense is that \"everybody knows so why bother.\"\n\nI would probably be okay with this to be perfectly honest, except he became very upset with me when he learned that I hadn't told anyone we were dating early on in our relationship. I've brought this up with him multiple times but it doesn't seem to register with him that he's being a hypocrite. \n\nHe's also asked me to marry him multiple times, which I eventually agreed to but he hasn't bought a ring, even though he said he was going to get one around Christmas. I suspect its because he doesn't want people knowing but his excuse is he wouldn't know what to get me even though I sent him multiple rings that I liked on Etsy all less than $300. He makes good money and I've even offered to go half on something so its not a money issue either.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n  \n",

      "description": "So I'm a 14-year-old kid. Nothing really special. I take part in this program called the Air Cadets where we learn stuff and sometimes go out and do community service.\n\nA little while before Christmas, I had taken part in a Christmas tree sale because, ya know, I wanna rank up. I was a flight corporal, and still am since that's relevant. Near the end, I stood next to the commanding officer (who we'll refer to as Captain Yastrzhembsky) and some other guy (Who I'll call CV Liubimova), and we got a picture taken. \n\nA few days later, it was brought to my attention that I was mentioned in a newspaper. Awesome, right? That's what I thought. I took a closer look at the caption. It said the following.\n\n\"From left to right are Captain Akelah Yastrzhembsky, CV Boris Liubimova and Corporal \\[My misspelled first &amp; last name\\] getting ready to bail a tree.\"\n\nI was a little furious at this, not gonna lie. I don't like having either my name or my rank wrong, let alone both. The other names were properly spelled, but not mine. I ended up telling my other cadet friend, who seemed annoyed by my complaining. Am I really in the wrong for not wanting to be referred to by the wrong rank and name?\n\n\\*Keep in mind all names here were made up. And no, u/OrionIdalia isn't my name, either.",

      "description": "For some background, we're both in our late 20's and we've been dating for about 8 months now. Things were going fine, but trouble started in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving when he started flaking out on me with disturbing frequency, and when the week of Thanksgiving came around he flaked out last minute on meeting my parents for the first time. We rescheduled for a couple days later, and while he did make it that time, he was 25 minutes late and showed up with 3 days worth of stubble and grungy clothes. I tried to sit him down for a serious talk about what was going on, but he practically ran out of my house and subsequently stone walled me for the rest of the week, refusing to answer texts or calls. All my friends were telling to just break up with him, that this behavior was unacceptable, but I had a suspicion that he was depressed so I held off until we could talk about it. After Thanksgiving he finally resurfaced and was answering texts again. We arranged a meeting, talked things over, and it became clear that yes, he was depressed, and he had been in a depressive episode brought on by difficulties at work. I agreed to give the relationship a 2nd chance, but I told him he couldn't go dark on me without warning again and he had to start seeing a therapist to deal with the depression. He had a pretty rough childhood, and I think there's a lot of crap he hasn't dealt with either. We agreed that I would ask around for counselor recommendations, and he would go.\n\n\nThat was in November. Things were better for a couple weeks after that incident, but then we both went out of town for Christmas. During that time he was difficult to get a hold of and hard to draw into conversation, but his grandfather wasn't doing well I thought maybe he was just busy with his family. I assumed things would get better once we both returned from our trips. After we both got back, he was still difficult to draw into conversation, and he didn't seem to feel any urgency with regards to seeing me. I managed to set up one date in January, but that was the only time we've seen each other since early December. Last weekend he canceled a date to pick up an extra shift at work, and most of my texts have been going unanswered for a few weeks now. At this point I started thinking that what we're doing right now hardly qualifies as a relationship and strongly thinking about just ending it. But I wanted to talk about it in person. On Tuesday he again, without warning, became completely unreachable. On Friday I got aggressive with my demands to know what was going on, completely at my whit's end that he was doing this to me again, and he finally responded that his grandfather had died and he was about to fly out for the funeral. He hasn't responded to me since.\n\nRight now I'm frustrated and I don't think I can do this anymore. But I don't want to be the person who breaks up with someone who just suffered a death in the family. I feel terrible for him that his grandfather died, but this is the 2nd time he's responded to a difficult personal situation by completely cutting me off. To make matters worse, today is my birthday and I still haven't heard a word from him despite reaching out myself to ask how things are going. We had plans this weekend, and if I hadn't demanded to know what was going on, I don't think he would have told me he wasn't even going to be in the state. \n\n\nI know there are issues with depression underpinning these problems, but I found out he never called the therapist I found for him. I feel bad that there are difficult things going on in his life right now, and I know what a struggle mental health problems can be, but I'm seriously considering breaking up with him over text since I can't get him to talk to me. Does that make me the asshole?",

It was amazing.\n\nNow to the problem: when I went down on him I immediately noticed his dick looked really different to the multiple dick pics I had been receiving (color, girth and length) but continued and had a wonderful night.\n\nWhile cuddling I jokingly asked if he dickfished me because his dick looked nothing like the pics he was sending me weeks prior.  \n\nP.s I'm in no way a girl who is obsessed by the look of a penis. As long as it works and the owner knows how to use it, that's good enough for me. There's nothing wrong with his dick at all I was just caught off guard because it was so different from the multiple pics he sent me. \n\nAnyways, he was pissed off at my joke and ended up leaving after a discussion/argument saying things like \"I'm sorry I don't have a PORNSTAR cock\" (I mentioned the dick in the pics was pornstar-esq not that it mattered.)\n\nNow I'm stumped wondering if I should have just shut my mouth and said nothing because I really didn't have a problem with his (real) dick but I kinda want to know why he would send fake dick pics in the first place",

      "description": "Hello! I made an account for this, and it’s been eating me alive for months. \n\nI (used) to have a friend, who I trusted more than anyone or anything in the world. He was really important to me. I’m pansexual, and the first person I came out to was him. Recently, he’s been a total asshole.\n\nHe’s the leader of the GSA in my school, and he decided to have the GSA in a room with people I barley knew, and detention, for our coming out discussion. This was supposed to be incredibly confined and confidential, and he should’ve tried harder to make everyone feel safe in my opinion. \n\nI’m a girl, and have pretty long hair. He decided to crotchet my hair on the bus, (don’t ask me why I thought that was a good idea) and when it got knotted, he got scissors and cut off a chunk of my hair without my knowledge. Keep in mind it’s not noticeable, but it’s still a really big deal to me. I gave him shit a lot, as a joke, but when he got pissed at me for it, I became serious about it. \n\nHe’s also just a total dick. I have high functioning autism, and he decides to excuse me from any work because of it. I had a group project with my other friend, and him. My other friend and I didn’t do much because she was pissed at him, and he complained to me about how she didn’t do work, and when I mentioned I didn’t either, he said he’d never make me do work or anything because I’m autistic. This may be a good thing in theory, I find it unfair I won’t be held to the same level as everyone else because of something I can’t control. \n\nHe keeps trying to be friends with me, and act as if everything’s perfectly fine, when it’s clearly not. I tried to talk to him about it, but I never got a chance to. He does know that I fucking despise him though. \n\nI believe he’s extremely toxic to me and all my friends, but he won’t leave me the hell alone.\n\nTL;DR My friends a dick and won’t accept the termination of my friendship.",

I was venting about how much I hate needles in my groupchat when one of my friends brought up how she gets bloodwork several times a year and how would I know anything about needles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went on a rant. This friend is notorious for making up illnesses to win the sympathy olympics. She's claimed to be allergic to everything under the sun, have various \"diagnosed\" phobias, arthritis, schizophrenia,celiac, and even an immune disorder of her own.  I told her that she should stop making up illnesses because no one will believe her when she's actually sick, and it makes those of us with real illnesses look bad. She cried and said that I have no idea what's she's been through dealing with all her sicknesses and that I don't need to be a b\\*\\*\\*h.  Am I the asshole? I feel bad, but I was so fed up.",

Husband and I bought tickets to visit them during thanksgiving months ago and planned on staying a week. Since the split, she has used us as crutch even though we live 1000 miles away. We talk her through her episodes everyday and have been in touch with her doctors. She was really looking forward to us visiting for the holiday. We though that in order to establish healthy boundaries it would be best to get a hotel room for the stay instead of staying with her and we wanted some space from her.  We also have plans to visit my family and friends in the area. We told her about this today and she freaked out and is saying we are abandoning her and don’t love her. Now I’m really questioning whether we were inconsiderate in doing this. We still plan to spend a majority of the time with her but didn’t want her to lean to much on us and then be devastated when we leave. She has other family in the area and she has chosen for several reasons not to be in touch with them. ",

Being in a group with her, we spend most of every day together (same lectures, same classes, same lab times at.). She is amazing and we get along really well, we also study together, hang out from time to time and go out for parties from time to time. I can picture the two of us really well together, both medical students, same interests, we can support each other etc. She also told me a few times she thinks I'm really funny, so she definetly does like me too.\nThe only problem is her boyfriend: I have met him, he is an engineering student, and while he was really nice to me and we chatted for quite a bit, it became clear that he is no intellectual fit for her. Don't get me wrong, Engineering is great and everything, but compared to medicine, I really can't see a relationship working between the two of them. She does not think the same though, constantly talking about how much she loves him, they even moved in together and plan a future together. As stupid as it might sound, but I think I know better than her and know that she would be happier with me in the end, both of us working in the same field, on a similar intellectual level. \nI have really tried to casually slip it in the conversation, making suggestions, etc. Her boyfriend is currently studying abroad, so I really see my window now. \nYesterday though, I told a friend of mine about this, and he was shocked, telling me I'm trying to ruin their perfect relationship and no good will come from this, telling me I'm a huge awhile for trying this, but I know it's the best for both of us. \nSo, what do you think?",

It was really hard for me to see my dog so upset and K only lives two blocks away. I thought that was a reasonable request since my dog shouldn't have to be hurting in her own home. They both love my dog too so  they shouldn't want her to be sad either.\n\nK ended up just leaving right away and D has been huffy all day.

      "description": "(Warning this is a SMALL. judgement. Not an interesting story. I’m not necessarily overthinking it but I just wanna know lol.) I work at a brewpub from 10am -5ish. Then I work at my small little rerun theater from 6-10pm\n\nI get there at 5:10~ because I have access through the bar that we’re connected to. I’m the “boss” there aside from the owner. so I’m the one that walks through the bar, gets into the theater, and unlocks the doors for the other workers. I don’t clock in during these 45min because I consider it my lunch break since I don’t have one at either jobs. \n\nI’m 20 years old. We have a lot of snackbar workers that are in high school 14-15 and I’m really nice to them and I usually let them mess around as long as we’re being efficient, and have a good time. \n\nAnyway. This one girl specifically, call her X. Found out I come in at 5 because I was just talking about my schedule one day. She really likes me. Lately. Everytime she works she comes in at 5 through the bar (which is weird as it is and makes the bartenders really uncomfortable). She’ll come find me and start screaming my ear off about shit that happened to her at school. Blaring music or trying to show me videos. All around making me silently rage inside because this is usually when I have my break. \n\nI don’t have a car and my commute to home is really far so I don’t go there on the in between. \n\nNow whenever she comes in I go and sit in a different room and pretend them I’m assuming she just came in early.  Today she went and sought me out and saw I was sitting in the theater eating. \nShe seemed really upset and asked why I “switched” where I was having my “break” and I just said I needed to be by myself before I start working cause I haven’t had a break all day. She said “well you’re not working yet” and I had to awkwardly clarify that I meant I needed to be away from any people for it to be considered a break in my head. I’m tired. I think I was short. This is so stupid haha. \n\nShe is 14 and took this the wrong way. I am not going to waste my lunch hour by continuing to be around her, or anything but should I have just found another solution like going inside of a cafe or at my other work till she took the hint? She’s 14 so of course she’s a dramatic teen who probably just over analyzed this but it made me feel bad to make her feel bad! ",

      "description": "Roommate and I have lived together for 8 years or so, the last 2 he's become more financially independent. He used to rely on me for a lot of things, as I helped him escape a bad situation. He's since paid back rent and such. When I first bought my house 6 years ago, I furnished it entirely myself. He has since bought 3 things of his own (coffee table, tread mill, and dresser in his room) otherwise it was all furnished by me, and he didn't pay half of it. I'm okay with this, given the situation he escaped. Other things, like a fence and shed in the backyard, he agreed to pay half - shed because he didn't feel like he had anything with the house, and fence because he wanted a place for his 2 dogs to run around. I built most of the shed, all of the fence, without his help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI bought a Kitchenaid mixer last fall, admittedly on a whim, and he immediately said he wasn't paying half of it as he'd \"never get use out of it\". Last night he said he wanted to get an attachment for it for making zucchini noodles, and I said that's fine - as long as he pays half. He got upset, insisted (while at the store at 10 pm) I tell him if I expected him to pay half of all other things he hasn't paid half on, like the washer/dryer I bought 6 years ago. I said no, just this, because it's not a household item and he insisted he would never use it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHistory, we typically pay half for things we'll both use. I asked him about his moving out plans 6 months ago, and he said he doesn't foresee being able to move out for 2+ years as he finishes school, plus he can't afford to move out alone, doesn't want to/can't because of medical issues, doesn't trust moving in with a friend, and has 2 dogs + 1 cat and rentals don't like that many animals, especially apartments. He complained at the time that his rent was too high, so we agreed on a plan to lower it a little more to help him save to move out, but he's largely not done that, either. So he's not going anywhere, for a while, unless I formally evict him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I have also bought things that he's later used that he didn't pay half for. My TV and Xbox in the living room, he didn't pay anything towards and I don't expect him to. He's got his own stuff as well, but likes using mine as he doesn't necessarily like being in his room alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not letting him use non-necessary kitchen appliances without paying a share of it?

Obviously we are no longer in that sort of shape but we still talk about girls and things the same way.\n\nWhile most of the guys in the thread have kinda got on with their lives, there’s one buddy who’s always trying to attack me and a few other “group outsiders” with snarky put downs. He also always talks about girls in a really rough way. Like anytime someone brings up a girl they’re seeing or a social media girl/tinder girl he jumps in there asking for pics, nudes, w/e and then judges the shit out of her making crappy comments.\n\nSoooo a few weeks ago we were all talking and one friend brought up he was thinking about seeing this one tinder girl. Everyone asked for pics. Friend was unsure whether to go on the date cause of the timing and cause he can’t really tell if she’s attractive or not from her pics. I said he had nothing to loose by doing it. Then our more obnoxious friend hops in and asks me if I have eyes cause clearly this girl’s a horse. I respond by asking him if he’s looked in the mirror recently. That devolved into a huge debate where I was called an asshole by the whole friend group for defending a stranger over my buddy. Idk I feel like he needed a wake up slap to let him know he was being a dick but maybe calling him out like that was uncalled for. It was a friendly conversation until I went there. I just don’t like this stuff. Getting made fun of all the time is annoying and we should be at a point in our lives where we’re not just thinking about the physical. I think he needs to grow up.

      "description": "Before any of you start freaking out at me, I want to say that I fully support both women and men asking for consent before getting touchy or sexual with another person, and I would never in my life think about treating another person that way. Now that thats out of the way, the AITA moment.  \n\nI've been with my girlfriend for the last 8\\~ months.  In this time, we've slept together, been sexual together, and all that jazz.  We've hit a comfortable routine where on friday nights one of us would go to the others place and spend the weekend there.  Our usual routine on the first night is watching some shitty movie or tv show until we realize we don't actually care what we're watching and would much rather make out.  This goes on until one of us decides to start pawing at each others genitals like a cat pawing the bottom of the door while you're trying to use the bathroom.  Things lead into foreplay followed by the usual sex times.   This has been our almost weekly routine for a good 3 months now.  We've been comfortable with each other and very open about our sexual desires and what not.\n\nNow, on this last friday, I went over to her apartment.  We put on some stupid netflix documentary that I can't remember the name of, and about half way through we started tongue boxing.  I got into it, and decided to start touching her, resulting in me getting under her pants.  I do the business and make her feel good.  After this, we just sit there for a minute in the after glow, before she pulls away from me and goes kind of silent.  I try to talk to her because I can tell somethings suddenly upset her but have no idea what, she tries to tell me that nothings wrong.  I tell her that I know when shes upset and if she's not willing to talk with me about it then I should probably just go, so she breaks down and says this.\n\n\"I just feel like you kind of use me.  You never ask for my consent before touching me and it makes me feel like an object instead of a person.\"\n\nNow, of course I understand the sentiment.  I'm not always the most romantic of person, I try to make her feel good and give 110% to her, but I can see where shes coming from.  Still, I was \\[visibly confused\\] at this statement, and she must have noticed because she huffed and pulled away again and said that I never listen to her.\n\nI point out how we've been dating for months, and that neither of us has asked for consent to touch the other since we first started dating and were just starting to be sexual towards one another.  She gets mad at this and says how it isn't the same for a woman as it is a man.  I tell her how blatantly a double standard that is.  \n\nAt this point shes getting angry and borderline yelling at me about this, and says that I'm no longer allowed to touch her in any way unless I ask first and she gives me permission.\n\nI say that it makes no sense for us to be dating and in a romantic relationship if she expects me to walk on eggshells just to try and be intimate with her, and say that shes making me feel like I'm some kind of molester or sexual offender because I want to touch the woman I've been dating for 8 months.\n\n\"Well maybe you are!\" she says angrily.  At this point, I'm angry, annoyed, and absolutely fed up.  I just say that if thats the way things need to be with her then maybe we just should break up.  She throws a fit over this and starts insulting me, at which time I just leave and go home.\n\nNot five minutes after I walk in my door, shes texting me saying that shes sorry for insulting me and yelling at me, I think it over for a minute and decide that I'm done, text her back that we're through, and go to bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up in the morning to almost 50 texts, most from her either being apologetic or angry, the rest being from friends of hers or her sister calling me an asshole because I \"broke up with the perfect woman because I wasn't allowed to grope her whenever I want.\"\n\nSo, Am I the asshole here?  I feel like I'm justified in my reaction and opinions regarding this, but at the same time feel like maybe theres some new wave promoting the virtue of consent that I've missed?  Am I the asshole for thinking that you shouldn't need to ask for consent to touch or feel your partner if you're in a romantic relationship?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd before you start yelling at me (even though I'm sure half of you have already started typing) I respect a persons right to say no.  If I touch my girlfriend, or any girl I'm with sexually/romantically for that matter, and they say they aren't interested or aren't in the mood, I'll stop, no question.  I just think requiring consent every time is insane and more damaging to the relationship than anything.  ",

      "description": "So, I live in a apartment with a 3 roommates (for those wondering I’m in university out of state, because I graduated high school early, got a scholarship, and turned 17) and so far the roommates are fine, they even helped move my heavy ass desk to my room(as seen in r/battlestations) But the two tenants downstairs WILL. SHUT. UP. They’re a couple, bf and gf, and they must hear like dogs. Whenever I’m a little loud, like “Oh, you just got 100,000+ people in cities skylines? And you’re celebrating a little loud? How about I POUND THE ROOF!?” That’s what they do, one time I dropped a microphone on the ground, which was so hard it broke, and not 2 seconds later:\n\n“POUND POUND” Okay, whatever ignore it. Which made my day 5x worse, and 1 day, my roommate paid the pet deposit so his dog could come up, and during while he was at class, his dog barked, ONCE. How do I know his dog barked? Because when I came home there was a note on our door that said, “DONT LET YOUR DIG BARK!” In big red letters, and also, my upstairs neighbor said;\n“The dog only barked once, that’s all I heard”\nSo they’re clearly just blowing things out of proportion. \nThis incident is unrelated, by noise, anyway. So, I come home from getting my latte (Chai tea btw) and I see a parking spot, and I go to park there(our apartment doesn’t have assigned parking) and then I hear a car horn go off, I look around and see the couple neighbors sitting there in their Honda fucking civic(I’m not exaggerating) and they gave me the hardest death stare. \n                          2 HOURS LATER\nI go outside for quick errand, I get to my car, and there’s a piece of paper that says “NICE PARKING ASSWIPE” which I assumed was the neighbors, bc I was inside the lines. My final incident, I was in a discord call with a friend of mine playing BIGFOOT which is scary as shit, so I won’t lie I screamed, once. And then; \n“POUND POUND POUND POUND”\nI get instantly pissed off and pound back. Not two mins go by.\n*knock knock* \n(In discord) “ gimme a sec someone’s at my door”\n*i walk to the door, look through the peep hole, ITS THE FUCKIN NEIGHBOR! The bf! So I open it*\n“What the do you want?” I ask\n“If you don’t quiet down your horror movie session, and stop being so loud, I’ll get you evicted and arrested” the neighbor responds, at this moment I snap. \n“Well, maybe if your fucking ears weren’t so fucking sensitive, and you didn’t act like I parked like an asshole, you wouldn’t have too.” I respond \n“I could get you arrested for what you just did! That’s disorderly conduct! Penial code 9!” He yells, getting in my face.\n“How about you don’t pull stuff out of your fucking ass, and use earplugs! You fucking cunt!” I slammed the door shut. Went back to my discord call. \n\nSo the true question, am I the asshole?",

His brother goes to the same college as me and he's a few years older than us. My ex and his brother live together in a 2bdrm apartment.\n\nLast night I was out with some of my friends and saw my ex's brother and we began to talk and catch up because it had been a while since we'd last seen each other. Anyway one thing led to another and I left with him to his place. After we hooked up I was getting ready to leave then my ex walked into the apartment. I just squeaked out a 'hi' and ran out.\n\nNow I saw that my ex blocked me on social media (instagram, deleted me off facebook). AITA? It's not like I'm dating his brother it was just a one time thing, I currently don't regret it but I'm not sure if what I did was bad. ",

      "description": "Long story with a lot of background\n\nTL;DR Mom abandoned family and left me alone, didn't speak for 25 years and now her 'new family' are harassing me for not attending her bedside.\n\nThrowaway for privacy but I was born in America and now live in EU. I grew up with my abusive mother, alcoholic father, twin brother and younger sister. Mom would constantly be screaming, shouting and demeaning me and my brother, call him Dave, by calling us rejects, unwanted, disgusting. I remember when I was 4 she dug her nails into my wrist she drew blood because I spilled a glass of milk. She scared my brother so much he'd often wet the bed (that we shared) and we'd be slapped silly by her and shoved into a cold shower to clean us off. Teachers often noticed bruises and such but after meeting our Mom, they'd back down out of fear for that psycho. Dad was usually drunk and while he wasnt abusive, he neglected us by not doing anything, and I mean anything to intervene or even say something to comfort us. \nSister, Lydia, was a saint and was spared this abuse. As we got older the abuse just kept going until Lydia died in a car accident. Immediatley me and Dave feared for our lives as we knew Mom would snap but instead, she just left. No note, no warning, the day after Lydia was buried she was gone. We were around 8 when this happened. Our Dad was not a good caregiver but we were no longer afraid or being hurt. Sure we went hungry and our clothes stank but I adapted. I learned to cook, do laundry and looked after my brother but as we became teens, the trauma and continuing neglect was making Dave very depressed. He began self harming, thinking Mom was right to punish him for being worthless and when we were 15 he committed suicide. I  wanted to die when I found out. I blamed myself. I went out for two seconds to the store, my Dad was god knows where, and Dave didnt even hesistate. My Mom was at the funeral briefly but we avoided one another.\nI've made peace with the fact he was very depressed and I truly did all I could but I blame my parents. I was taken into foster care with a nice family till I left for college. I havent spoken to my father in 15 years and my mother in 25. I left the country and hope to never see him again.\nLast month, I got a contact request on FB with a message from a friend of my mothers from years ago. I thought this was weird as I barely remembered her. She said she had heard my mother was dying and that I should go say goodbye. I ignored the message.\nA week later I got random messages from 2 girls saying they were my half sisters and my Mom gave them my name to find me. I politely told them I was sorry their mother was dying but not to contact me again. They flipped their shit and called me scum, she was right to leave me, drop dead etc. \nBLOCKED.\nThen they started contacting friends from FB, tried to find out where I worked, made new accounts to send more nasty messages and even put me on blast to my old hometown FB page using fake accounts. I deleted FB but not before hearig my mother was dead. \nThis all has dragged up so many feelings but deep down, I feel guilt for not seeing her and maybe I should have tried reaching out? I'm so messed up and confused but was I the asshole to basically ghost her in her last days?\n\n",

She said she named her dog that as a kid because it was a name she always really liked. She also said that dog was her best friend growing up, while I've never even met the originator of our child's middle name. \n\nNow she is really mad and she says she doesn't want the kid to have some dead person's middle name.

And I’ve been in the apartment for almost the entirety of the day and so has he. But he went into his room then sent me the Venmo request which I thought was rude because it wasn’t accompanied by a text or just him saying that he was going to send it. So I declined it. 4 hours later he sent me another one that I declined too. While we were standing together in the kitchen. Then he got an attitude and I told him why I was width holding the money and I told him he’d see it when I was good and ready or when the bill is due. Whichever comes first. \n\nSo AITA for not giving him the money until the due date?\n\n\nPS.. I usually don’t even need a Venmo request because I usually Venmo him as soon as they tell us the amount of the monthly bill but I changed my number and they usually text me to tell me the balance and I haven’t updated my number because apparently I have to call and do that shit and I haven’t gotten around to it.

We are at second of bachillerato (I think that's how to say it in English, I guess it's like that) So before the teacher starts the class, a classmate shows a paper/file/document to Ashley about  permission to go to an University guide asking if she is going.\n\n\nAshley turns her face to me (it looked like the Pikachu one, lol) and says: \"Crisll, you didn't told me about this when I didn't come to classes the other day when I was ill and asked you about tasks and what you've done, I can't trust you anymore\".\n\n\nOk. What? I was shocked since I thought she wasn't interested in this activity, about months ago we had a similar activity out of high school, taking information of universities, but she didn't even come to see. \n\n\nAlso, once, we have an hour a week that we don't do any learning, it's called \"tutorship\" I think. Just manage upcoming events in high school, behaviour, etc. That tutorship day, we were announced that a person from outside would come to have a talk with us about universities too. She decided to leave high school that day since it would be in the last hour of the day schedule. Also I left that day, I wasn't interested anymore.\n\n\nWell, I replied to her: \"I told you everything. Task, what we've done. I thought you didn't even cared about this, and in our class from the, 28 we are, only 9 wanted to go, also it costs 3€\"\n\n\nShe said: \"Of course I want to go! Are you stupid? Next time tell me everything!\"\n\n\nSo the teacher approach us and tell us to end the story, since I didn't want to bother the teacher, I just said: \"That's your problem, next time show interests in your things. That's all\"\n\n\nShe said lowering his voice: \"Asshole...\" We started the class.\n\n\nI mean, yeah, I should've told her everything. But I'm thinking about this all the day, and it's bothering me. Sorry if I didn't explain myself that well, English is not my native languague, but... AITA? ",

Fast forward four years she moves out to my state (5 hour drive) after high school leaving behind her parents and free school (only in her state) to live with me.  I've loved her this whole time but I slowly started to realize once she moved out here that we probably arent right for each other.  We fight all the time and she wants to make this work but I can tell she isnt happy here.  She doesnt want to live with me or my family.  She wants me to move out with her which I cant afford to and dont think I'm ready to do even though I'm 18.  I dont think I'm happy either.  I feel like im not myself when shes around.  I cant do what I usually do (make music with my brothers)  cause I can't leave her alone, I'm her only friend here.  She doesnt want to sit in the room with us either.\n\nBasically AITA for wanting to break up with her?",

      "description": "We're both 18 years old. \n\nI wanted to return them in the store, but the policy requires him to do it in person. Because he's going into 30 day inpatient care, he won't be able to return them himself. So I think I'm going to sell them online. I'd give the money to his older sister and she can choose what to do with it. I know it's his money and it was a gift for me but I can't accept it. When I look at the earrings, I feel like I can't breathe. The whole thing scares me.\n\nWhen he gave them to me, he didn't want to pressure me and I don't have to accept them. He said he was getting help \"tomorrow\" and then he'll be fixed for me. He'd even do 90 day rehab for me, if it helps. He just needs me to wait for him. I tried telling him that he needs to do it for himself, NOT for me. I can't be the reason he wants to get better. I'd be there for him but I couldn't take the earrings. He got upset but said it was okay and that he respected that. Then he just went to sleep. I'm not exaggerating. He went on the couch and fell asleep. Just like that.\n\nBut I can't keep them. His older sister gave me the receipt and the earrings. He is not in a good place right now. He made an impulsive and reckless choice.\n\nI can't put it into words, but selling his fucking Mercedes to buy me a pair of earrings scares me so much. I'm scared for him. I'm scared for us. I don't know why, but I'm scared for me too. But with these earrings, and being the only reason he wants to get better, I feel so trapped. I literally CANNOT KEEP THEM.\n\nBut I feel like it's also not my place to sell them. They'll sell for a lot less than he paid for.\n\n**Also: Some of that money could help me, but that would def make me more than just the asshole if I spent it. I need to pay some school fees and I can't afford books, but I won't spend a single cent. I don't even need to ask if that's wrong. My older brother is trying to convince me to pay for what I need and give the rest. But he is only thinking about my best interest, not morals.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This is not about me discovering my sexuality. Did that in middle school.\n\nAnyway. I feel like shit even thinking about doing this, but I don’t know what else to do. It’s not that I don’t care about my wife. I just don’t love her anymore. I don’t know if I ever really did.\n\nSee, I’ve known her since we were kids. Our families were close friends. We went to school together. We went on vacations together. You get the idea. Our parents used to joke that we decided to get married when we were five.\n\nWe did date other people. I had my share of failed high school romances. College too. And she had an on-again-off-again thing with another guy for a while.\n\nThe summer before she started med school we started hanging out again, and one thing led to another, I guess. We broke up for a while, didn’t want to do the long distance thing, but then she ended up in my city and we got back together. We’ve been married 4 years.\n\nBut it doesn’t feel like it. We spend more time with our dog than each other. She works weird hours and I travel a lot, so even when we’re both home, we’re too tired to do anything. We’re both introverts, so we go into separate rooms and do our own thing. We don’t even bother to eat together. We barely even talk to each other. We haven’t had sex in close to a year. You get the picture. We’re roommates who happen to share a tax return.\n\nExcept I’m starting to realize is that we’ve never really been compatible. We don’t share hobbies. She has no interest in my work (I don’t blame her, it’s kinda boring) and I only have a passing interest in hers. The only thing we have in common are our families, and even that’s starting to disappear.\n\nIt sounds stupid to call it a marriage of convenience, but at this point, what else could it be? We got together and stayed together because we felt like we were supposed to. And now, unless something changes, we’re going to be stuck like this.\n\nWhich brings me back to the guy I met. I don’t know what love at first sight is supposed to feel like, but I felt *something* for the first time in years. The kind of something that makes me want to run off into the sunset or some dumb shit like that.\n\nAnd yeah, I slept with him. Was it one of the dumbest things I’ve ever done? Yep. Do I regret it? Yes and no. I’m still married, after all... but he’s easily a 10. Like, I thought this guy was some movie star I’d never heard of. Nope, just a normal guy who’s Ryan-Reynolds-level hot.\n\nAnyway, aside from that, I’m not an idiot. I know that the chances of me staying with this guy are basically zero. I’d love to, because he’s exactly my type and he’s been very kind about all this, but I’m a realist. It’s not going to happen.\n\nBut now that I’ve realized how complacent I’ve been, I don’t think I can go back. Even if my wife disagrees with what our marriage has come to, I think we’re fundamentally incompatible. There’s no coming back from that.\n\nTo be clear: I am not **happy** about this. I don’t **want** to do this. I’ve never let myself think about it until I met someone who reminded me of all the things I don’t have in my marriage. Then it all came crashing down like a ton of bricks. It’s much easier to not have to face it. Ignorance is bliss.\n\nBut now that I know what I’m missing, I can’t ignore it anymore. Maybe my wife will hate me for it, but... this is better in the long run, right? She deserves someone who actually suits her. Right?\n\nI don’t know, maybe I’m justifying it at this point. IDK if this should be in another sub, but I feel like an asshole so here I am.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I (both 21) have been together for almost 4 years. We’re both in college, long distance but we see each other when we’re home for breaks. I also suffer from depression and anxiety.\n\nShe has spring break the week before I do, so only one weekend overlaps. This year she decided to go on a volunteer work trip through her school to build some houses. I was pretty excited for her as she seemed really excited to go on it. I expected that we wouldn’t talk much over the week, but the first day we talked quite a bit, which helped given I was having a rough couple of days.\n\nI had a breakdown one of the nights and we ended up in a bit of a fight when I had asked if she saw me in her future, and she responded with that she didn’t really know how long she saw. This dug really deep since we had planned to be together long term, eventually getting married. She said she didn’t want to feel tied down and would rather take life day by day. I knew she didn’t like to have plans for some things (I on the other hand like having a plan), but this was new info. I felt emotionally devastated, almost betrayed. The girl I thought I was gonna be with forever told me she didn’t want to plan the future anymore. We didn’t really reach a conclusion because it was nearly 1 AM and she had to be up at 6. The next day we talked a little bit but I was still on edge and hurt from the night before, so conversation was sparse and tense. I ended up getting a really big internship and she wasn’t there to celebrate with me. It was her last day of work though, so I figured today we’d talk more.\n\nThis morning I decided to let her text first since I usually do; to see if she wanted to talk to me, and it wasn’t just because I texted first. She was up at 8 AM. At 12 I was really tempted to text her but held off. At 3, I texted her saying I had waited for her to text first but couldn’t take it anymore. I saw on Snapchat she was active, but go no response. At 4 I texted asking if I had done something for her to ignore me. Once again she was active on her phone but ignored me. At 5, I caved in again and told her I was distraught over how she was ignoring me. She finally responded saying “I’ve been busy, what have you not gotten from this week?”. When I said all I wanted was for her to check in on me,she said she didn’t have time to text today as the group was busy (sightseeing the area). She told me I was ridiculous for being sad and anxious and I should’ve know better for texting her while she was busy, which to me she wasn’t, she was just driving around with her friends. After I explain again all I wanted was for her to care about how I was, she said she was “so over trying to prove she was busy” and said “I have to go but I hope by the next time I get to text you you’re better.”\n\nI don’t know when or if she’ll text me again today. I just feel like shit and I want this mess to be over.",

      "description": " \n\nI had a good friend that I had been friends with since we were small children. He asked me to be one of his best men at his wedding (he had multiple so he didn't have to choose). I live in Texas, and so does he, but the wedding was in Ohio, which is where his wife is from. I was responsible for buying a tux, my travel, and my hotel. I don't make a lot of money, and this was a big commitment for me, but I was determined to make it since he was my best friend.\n\nIt was about two weeks from the wedding, and we got very disturbing news from my ex-girlfriends family that her mom was arrested and going to prison for pulling a lady out of her car at a red light and beating the ever-loving dogshit out of her. Her sister was staying in the mom's apartment without any food or electricity, so naturally we had to travel to Illinois to get her since she was only 14 at the time. This would mean I would have to miss my best friend's wedding.\n\nI called my friend and explained the situation. I'm a big, burly man, but I cried over the phone at the fact that I wasn't going to be able to make his wedding. It literally crushed me, but I couldn't leave that child in that situation. He told me that he understood, and I told him that when he came back that we would celebrate his wedding.\n\nWe picked up the sister and came back, and he was having a party at his apartment so I went. He nor his wife would even speak to me. I sat by myself at that party with nobody to talk to. I ended up leaving and he hasn't spoken to me since. It was at that point that I realised that he had done this to my other friend as well in another situation. I don't really feel bad about it now since it was 2 years ago, but my coworker thinks ITA. What do you guys think? AITA?",

      "description": "Okay so from the title alone, I definitely sound like the asshole. But hear me out. \n\nI'm a nanny for two lovely kids. I love them, but the family pays me a laughably small amount of money for the work I put in. I work about 8 hours, four days a week for 150 a week. \nThis is my second job, I also work a more \"career\" part time job in the evenings. I took the nanny job not for the money but because it's something I enjoy doing while I'm not working at my \"real\" job. \nHowever, the parents can be... demanding. Often, they will ask me to come early or on days off without paying me extra. I can be a bit of a pushover, so I usually make their requests work if I can. Well, the mom is pregnant with her third child it's made things more difficult for me, but I wont get too into that. \nThe case in question: She has an ultrasound appointment in a few weeks to find out the gender. Last time she had an appointment, she called me (on my day off) at 8 am as they were on their way to the doctor to ask if I could watch their kids. Due to the way my two work schedules lined up, this was my only day off that week. I tried to tell her that, but she said stuff along the lines of \"I know, and I will be so appreciative for your help. You dont understand how hard it is to have kids at a dr. Appt,\" etc, etc, basically cornering me and giving me no choice. Finally, I caved and agreed to meet her to take the kids. \n\nFast forward, last week she posted online that she has an ultrasound appointment in couple weeks to see the gender. I immediately know exactly what is going to happen, shes going to call me (at best) the day before to ask me (tell me) to watch her kids so she and her husband can go without them. My first instinct was to just plan for this and keep my schedule clear that day. Then the asshole(?) in me remembered that my boyfriend and I had been planning a mini vacation next month. I asked him if he would be okay with doing it early, and we ended up working it out so we will be going on our long weekend trip at the same time as this doctors appointment. I thought this way, when she calls at the last minute, I will have a firm excuse for why I cant help, and she will have to figure something else out  \n\nThen I started to feel like an asshole. I feel petty for going out of my way just to get out of helping someone, especially cause I know they dont have anyone else around to help them. I feel spineless for not being able to just stand up for myself and say no. Then again, this is a vacation we were going to take anyway, they dont pay me extra to help on these extra days (cause they pay me by the week), and she has a really skillful way of manipulating people so it's just impossible to say no to her sometimes. \n\nThe vacation is planned and the hotel is booked so I cant take it back, but I'm wondering how guilty I should feel about this.

It’s been 2 years now trying to make my own business work and make meets end. All of this has been building up lately (since October) and I can admit that I’m pretty much a mess right now. I opened up with my GF about this (pretty hard thing for me to do to begin with), and that I’ve been thinking about therapy. But I don’t have the money or time (and I’m a bit scared too) to do it right now.\n\nAnyway:\nToday she texted me trying to know if i was free by the morning cause she already looked for a psychologist and a friend of hers told her that he was pretty good. \nMy initial reaction was to really freak out and ask her why did she do it? How did she hear from him, etc etc ... She left me the number of the guy and told me “I’ll not touch the subject again” you go when you want to go and ended the conversation. I can tell she got upset about me getting defensive. I genuinely felt like it’s not her choice to decide when I should do it. Don’t get me wrong I DO appreciate she caring enough for her to go out of her way and look for someone to help me get through this. But, isn’t it like pushing a kid into a deep pool he is afraid of? \n\n",

We've made plans to go out and do fun stuff for my birthday that's coming up very soon, and i dont know how, but my other sister found out about this.   \n\n\n\"The bad sister\" decides she wants in on the action, and somehow gets my number and texts me about it. she has been pretty awful to me and my family most of my life. she apparently has 'turned over a new leaf' but i haven't seen this, and when she texted me, asking me what type of present she should get me, and where she should meet us (all the while inviting herself as i didn't say yes to her coming).   \n\n\nthe good sister says that i should give her a chance, and so just talk to her maybe and see how i feel. so i did. we had a decent enough conversation, but i honestly dont trust her.   \n\n\nshe is the type who thinks birthdays and holidays aren't anything special and i have fears about being made to feel guilty as i am usually a pretty big celebrator. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlong story short, it's closer to my birthday, and finally, bad sis demands an answer, and i just say \"no, im sorry i just dont want you there.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncue her ranting about how she has to return a present, and all this stuff about how im not being nice. so i just straight said, \"fuck off\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwas this too far?

This kid was pretty innocent and he couldn't really stick up for himself. I sit next to him in class and one day I find the bully blocking my way to my seat and terrorising the kid. I told him to buzz off and go back to his seat then he made fun of me. I retaliated with asking him if he wanted to cry to my mother again (context, he once complained to my mother that I swear at him, ironically he makes fun of my accent and swears at me too). He got pissed and pushed me, I hit him in the face and he hits me back. Teacher throws bully out if classroom. Next day in the morning he clearly purposely pushed me causing me to topple over and hit the floor. Other teacher sends us both into the classroom. She says that it's BOTH OUR FAULT and believes him when he said it was accidental. Am I the asshole here guys?",

I have never really had a good relationship with my parents (mom + stepdad), but after a very difficult internship abroad + breakup, I'm struggling with some mental health issues. My parents said they're okay with me taking my time to find my footing, which I'm very thankful for, and that I can stay with them as long as I need. I have projects ongoing fairly consistently and make decent money that I either re-invest into upgrading my computer for new projects, or saving for the future. I do help a bit around the house and more when asked, though truthfully I could be doing more if I managed my depression and time better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't like children, never have and never will. I find them slightly disgusting, and very annoying. I never wanted children of my own, and I grew up as an only child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom is currently 4 months pregnant with my stepdads child. She brought up today that she's upset that she can't rely on me for help in the future with the baby and that she wishes I cared about her and her needs since she's doing me a huge favour by letting me stay at the house (slightly rephrased, because I couldn't remember how she originally said it.) Basically, she called me selfish for not wanting to help with the baby.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no problem picking up more weight in other areas of the housework, like cleaning (although we have a cleaning lady) and feeding the cats, but I specifically do not want anything to do with the baby. I don't want to see/touch/interact with the baby. Again, I do not have a good relationship with my parents after years of emotional abuse and see this new person as an extension of *their* family, which I have never felt a part of. My bio-dad is not in the picture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting anything to do with my mothers new child, despite the fact that they're letting me stay rent-free in their house while I figure my life out a bit?",

      "description": "So, my sister (T) is currently living with a boyfriend that, until a few days ago, housed 6 other cats. This was because the guy didn't fix his original cats and it resulted in an inbred litter - two of these cats wound up with some health issues.\n\nThe focus of this post is just on one of those cats, though. His name is Scooter, because his back legs are deformed and he needed to have a wheelchair to get around. He's eight years old, and still hasn't gotten a wheelchair. Keep in mind, a few months ago one of the cats somehow ate a lily and the guy had to pay I think a thousand or two to pump the stomach. \n\nAnyway, my family is trying to help get Scooter adopted to ease things up. We brought him to another sister's house (we'll call her A), gave him a bath, TLC, and showed him how to get into the litter box (I made a makeshift ramp out of a pizza box). Once he started to get used to us, he actually started hobbling around and cuddling up to us. T and her boyfriend are no longer actively involved in this.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is whether ITA for calling this cat by a different name. I didn't want to say anything at first, but A and I had a discussion about how it didn't feel right that the cat was named based on its disability (which they didn't even provide for). I haven't said anything to T yet, but if it were ever brought up I think she would be outraged - would she be justified in that? She can be rather unreasonable about some things, but the only other person I've spoken to about this is A. ",

      "description": "I made a mistake and texted my ex-bf and hid it from my BF. I am not justifying my actions by any means &amp; I know was wrong in that action. For context, it was a 2 text conversation about school, superficial and not inappropriate. My BF has a bit of a jealousy problem and has expressed that he didn't want me texting my ex by any means. Since I started dating my BF, my ex has never tried to get back with me and has stated that he's happy I'm with someone that makes me happy. My BF is just a bit insecure and doesn't want me in communication with my ex at all as he feels I won't fully be over him if I don't cut him out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy BF went through my laptop and found the conversation. Before confronting me he said he was at a loss and needed to ask other people for their opinion on what to do. He went to 8 of our closest friends and sent them a long message stating that I texted my ex and lied and hid it from him. He provided no context on the actual conversation I had but did state it was not sexual. He didn't tell them the conversation was about school, and a lot assumed I was emotionally cheating, which I was not. He also claimed that I used to text my ex last semester every single day, which is not true, I would never reach out to him, I would only respond to his texts and again all conversations were small talk and superficial and I would always let my bf know and would tell him he can read through the conversations if he wanted to. But over winter break, I told him I would break off communication completely. Which I had until this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe didn't include any backstory into why we've been having problems. I have expressed doubts in our relationship to him due to him getting jealous of me having breakfast with our guy best friend after volunteering, and getting mad I bought a guy friend a drink  because I thought he had disliked me but I was wrong, so in good faith I got us shots, my bf was with me the entire time &amp; I never flirted or expressed interest, but he accused me of wanting to be with him anyways. He wanted to try anal sex, but I didn't, but he stated that since I've tried it before (4 yrs ago), he felt I owed him a chance as well. He also went through my Instagram and found a post I made in 2013 about a high school BF and stated how I loved him more since I was \"more expressive\" about it than I am currently with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITE for thinking that going to 8 people is excessive and being upset he brought our friends in the middle of our problems? It seems he wanted everyone to know the wrong I did.  He also told 1 of the 8, personal info about me and my ex that I had confided in him with, this same person has now gone and told outside people that we broke up because I was texting my ex. Slandering me and not including any context about the texts and not mentioning any of the jealousy and control issues that we were also facing that contributed to our breakup that she also knew of.",

      "description": "Hello all, I'm using a throwaway account for this post. For context, the bag in question is the Louis Vuitton Speedy B 25 in the Damier Ebene print.\n\nI've been working at my family's company for the past 6 years. My father co-owns the company with a business partner, who I'll call David, and both of them have family working here. His partner has more of his family working here than my dad does, simply because his partner has more kids/grandkids. \n\nI still live with my parents and make a decent sum of money, though not enough to live on my own comfortably. For cultural and practical reasons, there's no expectation that I will move out from my parents house until marriage, though if I really wanted to and funded it myself my parents would only raise minor objections. On David's side, he has openly talked about putting down payments on his kids's houses (who also work here) and he gives them his cars once he tires of them. My dad bought my first car when I was 18 which I still use, though I'm allowed to drive any of the cars we have. \n\nGiven all that, it seems natural that I would have a lot more \"spending money\", enough to buy a nice bag or two. However, I know a lot of people at this company have money issues because they have kids and families to support and would never even think of carrying a designer bag. I would say, if I brought this bag to work, I'd be the only one in the company to bring a designer bag at all. \n\nI'm not so worried about David's side of the family putting up a stink, but some of our other employees have been here longer than I have and concerns about how their financials. I don't want to be an asshole by \"flaunting my wealth\" in front of them, especially since there's that element of nepotism there. On the other hand, the bag is very practical and easy to use and ideally suited for use at work.\n\nSo would I be the asshole if I brought this bag to work? Am I overthinking the whole issue? I did notice a few designer bags at our company xmas party, but as far as I know those people were married to employees and not any of our actual employees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know a lot of people already think I'm a spoiled brat because of my circumstances, but that's not what I'm asking about so if that's the extent of your comment I will not bother replying.",

      "description": "So, last year, around May, my buddy was going through several health issues and lost his job. He said that he was going apply for disability. He broke up with his long time girlfriend and wanted a place to stay.\n\nI was just served divorce papers, so I was in a spot, too. We agreed, because we had been long time friends, that he could move with me into an apartment and I would cover his half of the bills while he applied for disability. I was pretty good friends with him and I watched his health decline over a year or so, so I thought everything was legit.\n\nHe sells his truck so that he can pay his half of the rent. I told him not to worry about the utilities or the internet until he started receiving disability.\n\nFor the next six months, though, this guy does nothing that could speed up his disability claim. He makes one claim, talks to one lawyer, and doesn't visit any doctors during this time. Literally all he did was play video games and get drunk. Around October I started telling him that I'm having problems making ends meet, and that I needed to know what was going on with his claim. He said he didn't know what was going on with it. I told him he needed to start making phone calls and appointments because I couldn't take care of him anymore.\n\nCome January 1st, I knocked on his door and I asked him for his half of the rent. He just stood there and looked at me like I was crazy. I stared back at him. He stared back at me. I asked for his half of the rent again. He says,\"Dude, I'm broke, I thought you knew that.\" Then he tries to gaslight me and tell me that we had this long conversation about how he was broke and that I said I would cover his half of the rent, too.\n\nI told him he had to pay up. Not only for the rent, but for his half of the rest of the bills, too, or I was going to find a lawyer. I couldn't kick him out because his name was on the lease, but the lease made us equally responsible for the rent.\n\nWe ended up having a huge blowout because, later on in January, I sent him a message that had the total of how much money he owed me for rent, for utilities, and for internet. He went ballistic. He claimed that he never tried to screw me over and that he had done *so many things* to help me out, like sell his truck to pay rent. I pointed out to him that he sold his truck to pay rent, not to help me out, and that I had been covering all the other bills while all he did was play video games and get drunk.\n\nSo he decides to move back in with his ex-girlfriend.\n\nThe day he moves out, I ask him for his apartment key. First, he gives me a key that IS NOT his apartment key. After I point that out, he searches through all his bags and tries several keys on the apartment door until he declares that he hasn't seen his apartment key in months, and that he'd send it to me when he found it. I told him, \"Don't worry about it. I'll just have the landlord change the locks.\" He gave me this weird look and said, \"I don't think that's necessary.\" Um... what? I said, \"No, I'm not letting someone who doesn't live here have a key.\"\n\nThe final kicker is that, now that he's moved out, he's applying for jobs. This is after almost a year of claiming that he couldn't work.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So yesterday afternoon I finished work around 5pm. Just as I was leaving work I received two text from my mates (who must have been speaking to each other at the same time) inviting me out for the evening.\n\nAt this point, my girlfriend and I had no plans, except for me to come home and we have dinner together. I text her to say I had been invited out and was thinking of going, to which she became unhappy stating, \"I thought we were staying in tonight.\" To clarify, we had not made this a set plan, it was just that no other plans had come up.\n\nWhile stopping to pick up dinner, I text her to explain how two weeks earlier, one of the same two friends had text asking if I was going out and at the time I responded no because I was staying in with my girlfriend for the evening. I included a screenshot of said conversation. I also explained that I didn't want to let my friend down again.\n\nIt came to a point where her last text was to say, \"do what you want\" with an emoji giving me the finger.\n\nThen I came home, cooked dinner and we sat in silence for the evening.\n\nAITA for wanting to see my friends?

      "description": "Throwaway in case he sees this. Sorry for the length and formatting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year my brother suggested we go on a trip, just us two, to the UK. I was hesitant to accept since we've been known to easily get into petty fights since his temper is quite bad, though he tells me I do things that tick him off to make him even more pissed off at me. At this point though, we had a solid month or two without fighting (and we kept being civil to each other until a couple of weeks ago), so I agreed that we'd go on this trip together if he kept himself from getting angry at the drop of a hat. Should also be said that my brother easily gets stressed, which turns into anger that subsides quickly. I've learned to deal with this and we've talked it through so I know what I shouldn't do to anger him even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago, when the planning started in earnest. First came lots of arguments about when we both could take time off school/work and travel. When the date was decided (end of May), he took it upon himself to find the flights and a nice hotel, which was found quickly at a good price. We had the hotel and flights done and ready to pay for since the start of January, but my brother insisted on finding something better through a travel agency. I tell him we should book the tickets quickly, but due to Brexit, he didn't want to rush anything. I understood, but at the same time the hotel reservations could be cancelled without fee and there wasn't many seats left on the one flight we wanted to take that day. Nonetheless, he doesn't book anything, time goes by, and suddenly there are no tickets left to book on the flight. Finally I'm done with the back and forth (he had to drop looking for flights and such because of school, I took it upon myself to sort it all out) and tell him that I'm done with his skittish attitude, and either he books the flight or we don't go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, he tells me the flights are at double the price and the hotel we wanted is no longer an option. I tell him I'm done, and that I don't want to travel anywhere with him anymore. During the last three weeks, he had gotten more and more stressed, which turned into anger towards me. He tells me that I'm a prick for backing out. Initially, I didn't want to, but I don't feel comfortable booking a hotel and flight tickets at double the price when I know I can get it for cheaper, and he still didn't show any signs of actually purchasing the tickets anytime soon. I did want to go, and I feel like a complete asshole, but I've gotten migraines over his short temper these last couple of days and finally, I just felt like I had enough. Though I could potentially travel with him next year or late this year, we both have lots of things to do so it's not a sure thing that we'll have the time (which I guess he also realised). Basically, AITA for backing out this late?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This past week, one of my old friends that I dropped contact with 4 months ago texted me out of the blue saying that they missed me. Due to how our relationship had ended earlier this year I was slow to respond and careful with how I handled it as I do not want the stress involved with having them in my life especially during finals week. I very clearly expressed that I did not want to foster this friendship back into reality, however they continued to try and guilt trip me into it.\n\nNow for a little more context this person has bipolar depression that they refuse to treat. Whenever they text me its either a very concerning conversation where I genuinely worry about them and what they might do, or they are incredibly happy and lovey with me even though they are already in a relationship and I have made it very clear that I do not want any kind of relationship, this is the same reason that our past friendship ended as they were trying to make unwanted sexual advances on me and I freaked out on them.\n\nThey past couple of days they texted me and I began to wonder if maybe I am the asshole in this case as this weeks conversations had been Michigan winter cold on my part. The conversations were along the lines of them asking for forgiveness for \"Being weird and insecure\" and my response asking if they were on their meds. When they responded no I shrugged this off as another mood swing they wanted to catch me in, and as I mentioned right now is a stressful time already with it being finals week among other things. Yesterday when they asked if they were to much to handle I was honest and straight up told them yes. Again they messaged me again today tried multiple times to try and guilt me into being friends promising me everything from just barely being in my life to being my life. After I refused again with the reasons given above. They responded that their going to try and get their \"druggie\" what I'm assuming friend or SO back. I told them to just make new friends and don't search for toxic ones. Am I the ass hole for not wanting to deal with them?",

Feel free to correct any. \n\nOk so in short, I was on a 10 hour flight from Tokyo to Vancouver in economy class, I’m a average sized 5’9” 14 year old  so I generally don’t take up a lot of space but it was a 10 hour flight and I just wanted to get some sleep.\n\nAs soon as the flight took off and the seat belt sign was switched off I reclined my seat back as everyone else was doing but as soon as I do, the guy behind kicked he seat! I immediately thought this guy tall ass man and needed some leg room so I recline forward. As dinner came, I reclined forward so I can enjoy my lasagna but when I’m done I recline back and he kicks again!\n\nAs the flight continues there is the occasional thump which was annoying and woke me up several times but I’m extremely shy and introverted so I let it go. \n\nWhenever I get up to use the restroom this dude gave me the filthiest looks, almost as if I’m causing him extreme pain but then I notice, he doesn’t have his seat reclined at all and has his legs are together and pushed up against the seat he so he was almost giving himself no legroom! He could have just spread his les wider so they wouldn’t be touching the seat! \n\nOne time when I went to the bathroom, he somehow managed to get my seat back to its original position and for about 2 hours his legs were crossed so I couldn’t recline it even a centimetre. I eventually got it back when he left. \n\nWhen the flight landed I realized I was almost the same height as this guy so I guess he didn’t need that legroom after all. \n\nAny Reddit, AITA?\n\nJust a note: I was not being obnoxious and had my seat back all the way, probably 30% of the way. \n",

      "description": "I live in a dorm on campus and I chill with a few neighbors and my roommate (4F total). To be honest, I don’t really consider them true friends, but that’s because of past issues that I need to resolve. Anyway, we all decided to live on campus together next year in this great building: two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, on site mailbox, the works. \n\nBut I HATE living with my current roommate. I believe that I wouldn’t like her even if I didn’t live with her. She’s disgusting — lets her dirty gym clothes marinate on the floor, leaves our shared sink a mess despite me cleaning it EVERY night, has trash strewn over half the room (for some reason she gets the bigger half of the room??) seconds after she enters. She coughs and sneezes without covering her mouth because “she can’t help it.” She’s loud — always slamming the door shut, her walk is like a stomp in her clunky boots, her voice echoes when we’re walking together, inside and out, and then she just claims that it’s because she’s a “sociable person.” She’s rude — she interrupts people when they are talking (also the signs of a sociable person), she is such a know-it-all, especially on topics she knows nothing about (for instance, MY job), she jumps into conversations that do not include her at all, she speaks on the behalf of others who CAN speak, she believes that if something happened in her life then it automatically sets an example for everything else in the world (such as the lack of bullying in schools? Okay.). And she is so LAZY. She doesn’t help clean up unless I directly ask her, she doesn’t have a job because she is super picky about where she wants to work but complains about not having money (she claims to have applied to every position on campus but never got one, and didn’t do a single follow up). Then she cries because she feels like she is disappointing her family. And then she cries about not having a boyfriend. That’s not really lazy but you can all see why she DOES NOT have one. Basically she’s always dumping her problems on everyone else and frankly I don’t really care because they all have simple solutions. \n\nAnd honestly, she’s just MEAN. She takes play fighting/teasing to a whole different level (throwing pencils and metal forks). And a bit racist. \n\nYet everyone expects me to share a room with her again next semester. \n\nI can’t do it. Nope. I decided to get an apartment. BY MYSELF. I’m not risking ending up with another shit roommate. I’m willing to start working full time to avoid that. But everyone else in the group thinks that it’s just so I could have my own room (they know that I have never had my own bedroom) and that I’m being an asshole for not trying to stick it out. That I’m being an asshole because they have to risk getting shit roommates because it’s too expensive living with just two people (the other girl is joining the army, but no one thinks she’s doing wrong by “abandoning” us). \n\nSo what? AITA for letting them sink with the increased rent, or the possibility of getting terrible roommates, for my own means? \n",

      "description": "This happened a few weeks ago.\n\nI'd just made a withdrawal at a shopping centre ATM and was about to walk away when a man standing nearby asked if I could spare any money as he had not eaten since the previous day. He did seem to be rather down on his luck, but seeing as how I only withdrew $20 and had no coins in my wallet I told him I didn't have any spare change. As I was walking away he calls out to me \"buy me something?\"\n\nI didn't think much of it at first, but then it struck me that a guy who asks a stranger to buy him a meal is likely genuinely hungry. Glancing back I could see he wasn't at the ATM any longer, but I figured he was probably going to be somewhere in the general vicinity.\n\nAs it was almost closing time for the food court, several of the eateries were beginning to box up the day's leftovers and offering them for a discount. I happened by a kebab shop and grabbed a couple of chicken skewers and a slice of pizza in a takeaway container - it came to just under $10 for the lot. It didn't take long before I found the guy walking around, so I approached him and offered him the food. The conversation went like this:\n\nMe: Here you go.\nHim: What's this?\nMe: Chicken skewers and some pizza.\nHim: Oh.\n\n*He glances at the container*\n\nHim: I don't eat chicken.\nMe: Well I do.\n\nWith that I abruptly about turned and started walking away. I heard him call out \"Nah, wait\" as I was walking away, but I didn't acknowledge him and kept walking.\n\nSome points to take into consideration:\n\n*The $20 I withdrew was supposed to cover my meals for the next two and a half days. Money that was supposed to get me enough baked beans, bread, eggs, and vegetables for at least four meals was instead used on greasy takeaway food that would only get me through that night. Hence my abrupt response when he told me he didn't eat chicken.\n\n*In retrospect I suppose I could have sought out the man first and asked if he had any food preferences/dietary restrictions. While I hate choosing beggars as much as the next person, I acknowledge the fact that just because you're hard up doesn't mean you should get absolutely no say in what you eat.\n\n*After some thought, it is also likely he wasn't in full control of his faculties when he said what he did. Maybe I should have given him the benefit of the doubt.",

      "description": "I was at a coffee shop after work the other day. When I entered I noticed a guy, white, probably late 20s, scrawny, looked like the kind of person who works in IT and saves his money to fly to Thailand twice a year for \"sightseeing\" with a young Asian girl, she looked like 12 to 14 or so to me, slim, small body, looked like my niece who is 12, and a young looking face as well.\n\nDidn't really think too much of it and I sat down a bit away from them, facing the same direction as the girl so I couldn't really see her perfectly. But I did notice that the guy seemed to do her like gently stroking her cheek and even leaning over to give her a kiss (not on the cheek). It made me sick and since I had recently read about underaged sex traffic victims from Asian countries I wondered whether this might be one of those scenarios.\n\nSo outside I decided to call the police and told them that I had seen an adult man making out with a young girl here. I waited across the street until they arrived. They got inside and since there were only few people inside they found them quickly. I could see them through the glass window. They talked to them shortly, then the girl talked, then she showed them what I presume was her ID, the policemen seemed somewhat apologetic and left. Afterwards it looked to me like the guy was consoling her.\n\nI concluded that she probably must have been older and I misjudged her age. I debated whether I should go inside to apologize but I didn't really want to face them so I left.\n\nI was acting out of genuine worry for the girl though. So am I wrong here? Does that make me an asshole? ",

      "description": "Long story short my best friend for the last 7 years has made some choices I don't agree with recently and I am distancing myself from her. Read on for details.\n\nLast year around October she began cheating on her husband and they decided to take a \"break\" while still living together and see other people. I suggested marriage counseling to her but she claimed it was too expensive, even though her and her husband were both going out all the time. She saw a few different guys and found out in December she was pregnant. She said it was either her husband's or one other guy's. Her and the other guy weren't dating anymore but if it was his he would be involved. The plan was that no matter who the baby belonged to she would stay with her husband and they would raise the baby together. \n\nShe was going to do a paternity test at one point but said it was too expensive, then she found a cheaper option, got samples and submitted it I guess and found out the baby was her husband's supposedly. I haven't seen the results. So her and her husband had the baby and all seemed good. From my knowledge they were together and happy during the pregnancy.\n\nI just found out about a month ago that for the last four months,since they have had the baby, they have been in an open relationship and seeing/sleeping with other people. I went to visit one weekend and it came out that this had been going on for awhile. Other people who are acquaintances with her knew this was going on, but I hadn't been told because she knew I wouldn't approve.\n\nSince I found out I haven't contacted her but she has texted me maybe once and I replied. I decided that if she texts me or makes an effort I will reply, but I am not going to make an effort to maintain the friendship. I don't agree with their decision and can not see how this is good for their relationship as husband and wife or with their child. She is not on birth control but is supposedly \"being careful\" with all these other guys she is sleeping with. It's a train wreck waiting to happen and anything I say goes in one ear and out the other. I just don't see her as someone I can relate to or be friends with in the future. It's something that I just so strongly disagree with.\n\nSo, AITA for distancing myself and not wanting to be her friend?",

      "description": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nContext:\n\nMy family grew up very racist, sexist and religious. My parents hold these traits and my siblings adopted it too. For context I'm 28 and my brother is 27. Growing up I had all these beliefs too but over the last few years I decided that I don't want this hatred to be who I am and decided to change.  Now my family casually throws around racist remarks like it's nothing. My brother has even gone so far as to drop the N bomb multiple times over voice chat in video games or whispers just to try to piss people off. For context he's say stuff like \"Fuck you N****, you fucking suck and I hope you kill yourself\" and so on.\n\nAt first I didn't really do anything about this because I always thought that's just the way they are. The more I changed however the more this bothered me. I'm no longer racist and to be honest the idea of being racist disgusts me these days, especially after reading about hate crimes like what's happened in new Zealand.\n\nWhat happened:\n\nRecently in discord my brother has been dropping the N bomb even more because I asked him to stop. He que'd his mic and just said the word over and over again for a full minute at least, since then I've asked him to stop at least another 5 times. \n\nYesterday I posted in our discord of family and friends (it's a pretty big discord 200+?) that I won't deal with this type of racism anymore and if he doesn't stop I'll simply be leaving. He responded with \"I do what I want\", so I left. In the process of doing so I ended up feeling pretty well and decided to message him saying that I'm actually not just leaving the discord, I'm done with him until he grows out of this. I think it's too toxic a mindset to be around, let alone my kids being around it in any way.\n\nNow my siblings are telling me I should stop being stupid because that's just the way he is and he's never going to change. I think I have a reasonable request though. Over the last years I have started believing that just because you're family it doesn't mean you are exempt from consequences or being removed from my life. We play a lot of games together and are pretty excited for WoW Classic. We have a fun little lan party planned at my place and my family is telling me that I'm going to ruin this for everyone because now they have to choose and split and it's my choice that's making them do this.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "My ex-husband’s family always wants to buy our son clothes and I have asked almost since birth not to do so because I am very selective about fabrics and styles. My son can’t wear a lot of synthetic fabrics otherwise his eczema flares up really bad, so I tend to buy organic or natural fabrics, I discovered this when he was a baby and have mostly stuck with it, he is now 4. \n\nIt seems like every upcoming holiday, I’ll get a text or phone call from my ex or his mother asking me what size my son is wearing because they want to buy him something. They don’t see him very often as we live on side of the country and they live on the other, so I know they want to know what he’s interested in and what he likes as a way of finding the perfect gift. I’ve always suggested a book or an educational age appropriate toy that may be better suited instead of clothing as an alternative gift. Most of the time this has worked in the past. \n\nThis morning, I got a text from my ex of a photo of a pair of pajamas that is a material that is 100% synthetic and huge no for our son because of his skin. My ex stated that his mom had bought them for our son and she was super excited about them. I texted back that while I thought they were great and I appreciated him thinking about our son, he wouldn’t wear them because of the material. I also gently reminded him that I have asked him numerous times to remind his family members to not buy clothes for him. \n\nHe blew up at me and said I was an “elitist snob who only wanted our kid in name brands” which isn’t true at all. We Old Navy, Target, &amp; even Costco it up! \n\nLong story short, AITA for doing this? And before anyone asks, I hold my side of the family accountable as well, they just have listened for the most part. We’ve had a few slip-ups and I just asked politely if they minded if I returned or exchanged. \n\nI just don’t want my ex or his family wasting their money on items I will not dress him in, I think it’s wasteful, but I also feel like they purposely buy him clothes so I can continually look like the bad guy. \n\nThoughts? \n\n",

      "description": "So today I was Disney Springs with my gf because she had a job interview at a retail shop (Uniqlo). I tagged along because we figured after her interview we can hit the parks( We have annual passes). While she was in the interview, I was sitting in an area with tables meant for people just to sit and relax. All the tables were taken with families but I managed to find an empty one and sat there.\n\nA few minutes passed and this elderly man and his wife came up asked me if they could have my table so that they could rest their legs. He said they asked me because I was alone at my table and all the others were taken. \n\nI said \"Sir, I have to wait for here a little bit for someone and I told them I'd be waiting here so I don't really want to move but you and your wife are more than welcome to join me and sit in the other seats at the table.\"\n\nHe looked at me and said \"My wife and I would really like some privacy and I think since you're young and can walk easier you should let us sit here\"\n\nI said \"Sir I'm sorry I don't think it's fair that you feel you have the right to this table just because of your age but like I said I really don't mind you guys sitting here with me since the seats are empty.\"\n\nWe went back and forth for a few more remarks until eventually he said \"Nevermind, clearly your parents didn't teach you to respect your elders.\" Then him and his wife left and walked away.\n\nI feel kind of bad because I don't want them to not rest, but also they both seemed to be in fine condition and I don't think it's right for them to expect me to give up the table. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

He and I both have different management styles and do things differently.\n\nHe and I haven't been seeing eye to eye when it comes to paper work and training our team. I, for instance, will teach my team based on the guidelines and procedures outlined by the company. He uses his past experience. The problem is, many of the team members have come to me in confidence and told me that they feel confused because I'm asking them to do things one way and he is asking them to do it another.\n\nI've tried sitting down and talking with my assistant and asked that we get on the same page when it comes to training the team. I've explained that the company is growing and evolving and that things he has learned in the past may not always be applicable due to changing procedures and policy. I've explained that as a manager I have a responsibility to uphold company policy and therefore I have a certain level of expectation from him and our team. I've explained the WHY behind my decision making.\n\nI thought we were on the same page but then found out he was bad mouthing me and my decisions in front of the team. I asked to meet with him in the office and I confronted him about the situation. I explained that his actions showed the team that we are divided as a management team and that he does not respect my decisions as a manager. I also explained that I had lost some trust in him.\n\nI feel that he gives push back every time I approach him with an idea or suggestion - my ideas, as well as those from the team, are always met with negativity and opposition. I get comments like \"I didn't have to do this before\" or \"the way I have been doing things has never been a problem until now!\". He feels that I am too demanding when it comes to paper work and training guidelines and told me that I need to create \"buy in\" if I want him to change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "I’m a nudist and my roommate knows this but out of respect I usually put shorts when he’s here. There was once a long while back where the conversation came up and he asked me not to sit on the couch naked. Considering I don’t pay for the couch, I obliged for a while until one day, not too long ago, I absentmindedly just sat on the couch while I was playing RDR2. When he came home I grabbed shorts, unlocked the door for him to come in and he immediately began yelling at me about sitting on the couch, “bare assed” as he put it, and how I’m not the one paying for it and how gross it is. He stuck emphasis on how gross it was which deeply hurt and offended me. I get not doing it because he asked and it’s his couch, I completely understand that. What I got upset about is how passionately he was speaking about it being gross. I wash myself, or at the very least my genitals and behind, thoroughly everyday and have never sat on his or anyone else’s furniture if I wasn’t clean. The fact that I prefer to stay naked makes the cleanliness of my body, especially my entire genital region, a very conscious thing for me but he made it seem like I was just leaving shit streaks on the couch. I don’t even fart on it because that leaves fecal particles on whatever is against your ass. I wanted to snap at him for it but my now ex gf left me the day before and I didn’t wanna deal with anything at the time. \n\nI also don’t get it because he has two cats who constantly rub themselves on and claw the couch and a dog who once pissed on it so much it leaked through the padding to the carpet yet he never replaced it. He through some carpet cleaner on it and vacuumed it and sleeps in that spot from time to time and that was over a year ago. The dog hasn’t even had more than 4 baths since we moved in last January and sleeps on the couch everyday. He’s even worn my clothes which is think is worse because I don’t wear underwear. So am I wrong for being upset about him yelling at me about how “gross” it is. ",

      "description": "For context, I tend to drive and camp out on the right lane unless I need to pass someone. Most people have a tendency to sit in the middle lane or the left so I find the right to be the most open. On top of that, I have a bit of a lead foot and maintain a speed usually well above the limit. This means I'm usually passing everyone to the left of me, even folks who think they're \"passing\" on the left. \n\nMy boyfriend tells me this makes people nervous and I shouldn't pass on the right. He also says that people getting on the highway will freak out cuz of how fast I'm going. If the left lane were clear and there were cars on the right, I'd use the left lane but now if I try to be on the left I find myself weaving through several lanes to maintain my speed. Otherwise, I'd constantly be tapping the breaks. \n\nIMO I'm using the freeway correctly and if people are not passing, they should be in the right lane which would force me over to the middle/left lanes. Secondly, I think if you're entering the highway its your responsibility to get up to speed and judge if the cars that are already in the lane are going faster than you can speed up to in time. If you can't, then enter behind those cars. \n\nSo I'm here to ask all the people I pass on the right, AITA?\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Hi, this is a long and awkward situation that I will do my best to explain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (21f) am a full-time student and live with by best friend (21m) who I'll call David. We met freshman year and clicked immediately (not romantically in any way, he's gay). Since the start of our junior year we've lived together in an off-campus apartment and everything has been great. We joke around that we're basically married and call each other soulmates. He's my ride or die. \n\nAbout a month ago, David's uncle, who I'll call John, started sleeping on our couch because he's going through a divorce and is in the middle of getting a new place. He was on of the only members of David's family to support him after he came out and as a result they're very close. John could easily afford a hotel (he's a lawyer) but David didn't want him living by himself since his divorce has been really hard on him, which I completely understood. \n\nJohn moved in and turned out to be a pretty great guest. He even paid a full months rent as a thank you to us which kind of blew me away. He works a lot but when all of us are home we'll have dinners together, watch movies or just talk. Until this week these nights have always included all three of us.\n\nDavid left at the end of last week to spend Spring Break out-of-state. Since then John and I have eaten dinner together and stayed up late talking like normal, just without David. I don't really have any close friends except for David so I really don't go out much when he's gone. John listened to me rant about my ex-boyfriend and told me a lot about his marriage. Nothing weird, we just kind of talked each other through our break-ups. He never once acted inappropriately.\n\nLast night, we were having sushi on the couch when the topic of my ex came up again. I showed him a text I got from him calling me a bunch of horrible names among other disgusting, degrading things. I made a joke about being unlovable (even though it did upset me) and John immediately changed his tone. He got serious and told me to never believe anything my ex said about me because it isn't true. He started telling me this story about how when he was my age, he had this ideal image of a \"dream girl\" that he imagined himself ending up with. He said meeting me was like meeting that girl twenty years too late. He said I was beautiful and funny and that it kills him to hear me talk negatively about myself. \n\nI guess I got caught up in all of the things John was saying about me because I kissed him. He reciprocated for like five seconds before pulling away. He apologized (even though I'm the one who kissed him) and told me that as much as he wanted to, it was a bad idea to do anything. I can't say I don't agree, but I *really* wanted him in that moment. It was awkward after that and I just went to bed. \n\nSo I guess I have two questions.

Everyone was buzzing because I was someone new and we were all excited of moving in. \n\nSo its been 4 months and this is bullshit, they give me shit for things i havent done, and when someone steps up and says “oh sorry that was me” i dont even get an apology, they just crack up jokes between them. I dont really spend time at home mainly because I dont like being at home, its a shit feeling and I still have until july because on my rent contract. \n\nWell, 2 of my housemates are jewish, one of them isnt really that deep into it, just belives because her family is ( I suppose) but the other one takes it really seriously, and not only religion, lets say you cannot say any opinion that doesnt match hers because she get offended easily. \n\nLast night on the groupchat they were making jokes and she was correcting te grammar of some of the housemates and I replied with oh damn you are one of them grammarnazis, she replied with oh dont you EVER call me a nazi again and got kicked out of the groupchat (not really bothered, if they want anything from me they can text me), after that when i got back home i was talking about this with the other jewish girl and she said she didnt find offensive, however the one that takes it seriously thought i was making a nazi joke, she didnt even know what a grammarnazi is and didnt even bother of searching it. \nIm not going to apologize for what i said, i dont think i have the need to apologize for calling someone a grammarnazi, specially in a joke context.\n\nAm i the asshole?\n\nGrammarnazi: grammar Nazi (plural grammar Nazis) (slang, idiomatic) A person who habitually corrects or criticizes the language usage of others.",

      "description": "So first of, myself and this guy were on and off friends throughout secondary school but then barely spoke to each other when I went to University... He still maintained friends with some of the people we used to hang out with, including my ex-girlfriend and a few others who I don't particularly want to see again for various different reasons.\n\nSince leaving University (2015), I moved back near my hometown as I got my first job when he somehow found out that I was living close by. He struck up conversation and asked to meet. He seemed friendly enough so I invited him over for a couple of drinks. He was extremely pleasent, brought myself and my new girlfriend some wine and was very enjoyable to be around. Had a nice evening, and when he left we both agreed that we would start making this a regular occurence and he would next invite us over to his and his girlfriends house.\n\nWell, it's been 3 years and the only other time I've seen him recently was when I needed to get my tyres replaced and he just so happened to be working at the same garage (didn't know he worked there). A couple of days a go, he sent my girlfriend and I an invitation to his wedding for next year. \n\nI like to pretend that I don't want to go because I find it weird that he's asking me to come despite barely communicating now for nearly a decade, but it's really because I know that he's going to invite all of the other people that I don't want to interact with, including my ex-girlfriend... Would I be an ass hole if I say no? Should I just suck it up, and just ignore my GF and the others?\n",

      "description": "This evening, I (20F) was speaking to my Dad (54M) about needing a new laptop quite desperately. My old one is on the blinker. I mention how I’m thinking about using some of the money grandma left me (5,000 – I used 1,000 to pay for a car a few years ago with his permission) to invest in a good one.\n\nHe gets pretty pissed at me and says why do that when I have a perfectly good one already? I get his point, it’s still working, but I’m literally in my final semester of university and it’s on its last legs. It overheats, makes weird noises, the fan goes from time to time and it has to be thumped in the right place to make work, it can’t be tilted when it’s having a funny moment or it dies, etc. He doesn’t want me to replace it as it is still under warrantee (we extended it when I went to uni) until October, but I’m not disagreeing with that, I’m saying it can be used as a spare for the whole household while I take advantage of my student discount before it runs out.  \nHe then says that he won't give the money to me as its his choice when he releases it to me. I argue that it’s my money, I’m good with money, and I think it’s a good investment. I write novels, do Photoshop work, etc. So, while I may not make a profit with it, I still would use it to earn some money somewhat. I mention this and he says I can’t have the money right now because it’s currently going into the house renovations (Grandma’s old house which he bought which I said was a bad idea). I say it’s my money which she gave to me, he shouldn’t be doing that with it and he gets real pissed at me.\n\nI walk away and not get into an argument. He then comes into my bedroom and mentions how I have £1,000 from a few years ago in an old account from a relative who died. It rings a bell but I don’t remember any of this, really. I was 10 when I was informed about it. It’s been 10 years.\n\nHe goes into the safe and gives me a book that proves I have £1,000. He says, “You can use that as it’s your money, but you have a perfectly good laptop already.”\n\nI’m really shocked and pissed off because I haven’t been told about this at all. He argues that it’s my responsibility to remember where I have money but this was literally given to me when I was 10, its been in the safe (which he won’t tell anyone the code too), I have never seen it before now. He’s claiming I gave it to him when I moved in but I honestly don’t remember any of this.\n\nNow I feel really angry at my dad because he’s practically keeping my (and has kept previous) inheritance away from me and being a weird about me getting a new laptop. I told my aunt and she thinks he’s being really unfair but I dunno. \n\nAm I being a giant selfish asshole here? ",

      "description": "Am I the asshole for telling my family to move out of my house?\n\nI’m on mobile so I’m sorry if this is badly formatted. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSo I’m (F) younger than &gt;25. I bought a house when I turned 18. I’m not in a relationship and I have no financial responsibility other than my mortgage, phone and WiFi bill. I have a full time job that earns me a tight but comfortable wage, enough to make ends meet. \n\nI bought the house for my parents and I to live in, this was a gift and I worked so hard for this because we lived in a small trailer almost all my life. I wanted them to finally be comfortable. I wanted us to be happy! But ever since buying the house, it’s like they’ve been becoming complete assholes. I had to put a second car under my name so I could give my dad a reliable transportation. My parents work full time jobs in restaurants because, well... let’s just say they can’t work anywhere else. \n\nSince buying the house, my mother hasn’t said thank you. I don't expect her to kiss my feet, but at least acknowledge that I worked hard to give her a big home. I’ve always been the daughter and sister with no remarkable talents or school grades. I’m trying to go back to school because my parents tell me I’ll never amount to anything if I don’t have a degree or have some form of second education. \n\nAnyways I’m getting a bit sidetracked. The thing is, I like keeping the house clean. If I’m paying almost one entire paycheck for mortgage, why not keep the house in good condition????? My dad never cleans the house because he feels that women should be the only ones cleaning and cooking. He will sit in the morning watching tv or sleep 15 hours until he works again. When I come home from work, I better not DARE to take a nap unless I want to be called an ungrateful lazy ass. Ironic right? I can spend 2 hours cleaning while he sits on the sofa and stares at me. This is also encouraged by my mother who calls me a pig if I have some clothes laying on the ground of my room. I’m their kid, so I can’t talk back. Even if I’m legally an adult, I still fear their abuse. This is worst because I suffer from depression and anxiety. My parents are well aware of my mental state but chose to ignore once they are angry.\n\nMy mom makes me feel like I owe her everything. And I have given her everything. Newest iPhones. New beds. New furniture. New TVs. I make sure to tell my mom I love her at least once a day, even if I never get told the same. \n\nShe’s told me to get a second job to support the house even more. This kind of contradicts the fact that I’m trying to go back to school, but I guess mothers know best. \n\nMy mom tells me I’m worthless. That I’m good for nothing. Then she threatens to leave me with all my bills and mortgage. Which actually, is ok. Because I’ve been supporting her for too much. No one else in my family gives her extra money to spend on whatever she fancies. My mom is too greedy and materialistic. She says she is not but I feel like I have to keep up with all her material wants and comforts. \n\nI try to make sure my mom knows how much I care about her even if both my parents seem to hate me. I try my best to become a daughter they’re proud of. In my high school years I made sure to always have a job, never do drugs or go out with anybody so I could support them. This is why I’m afraid of committing to relationships and why I’ve never had a lasting one.\n\nI’m alone and I’m afraid. I told my mom that I’m going to strip everything I’ve ever given to her. I told her that being greedy is a sin and God will not permit it. I told her I hope she’s happy. She said she’s moving out in a month. I don’t know how I’ll do it. \n\nI have two dogs to take care of. And I’m very scared. I’m picking up popcorn from my floor because I have nothing else to eat.\n\nTLDR materialistic mother and lazy father that have done years of abuse finally pushed me into asking them to leave the house I got for us when I turned 18. I’m alone and scared.\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole for telling my own family to move out of the house that I’ve given to them? I’d like to think not, but I need a different perspective in this and maybe I should ask them to stay.",

      "description": "I've been 'BFFs' with this girl for 5 years (M), and she's been what I can best describe as using me, and our other friend (T) for her own gain. In high school, she would never have lunch and complain she was hungry, or when T and I wanted to go out during lunch she would say \"Oh I don't want to go I don't have any money\" and because we either wanted M to actually eat, or hang out with her, we bought her food. I have probably spent $1000 on food alone. T’s family has also taken her on road trips, all expense paid. M only got away with this she didn’t have a job, but we did.\n\nIt's now the second year into university, and normally money isn't really something I care about. However, I was starting to notice her taking more advantage of me. Her Xmas gifts are notoriously cheap. Now our limit was $50, and I went over it, but she went so under it. 2 years later, she bought me Elf Makeup and said it was $50. I calculated how much it could be, and at the cheapest it was $20, and the most expensive was $35. Nonetheless, I bought her a $50 gift. Last year was the last straw, and I kind of decided I was done with Xmas Gifts. She bought me a purse and claimed she spent $50, but accidentally left the $25 receipt in it. This wasn't my friendship tipping point though.\n\nIn Nov I bought tickets for a concert for both T and M. M was in class and promised to pay me back 92.50, and T promised to pay me back asap. She paid me the next day. M never did.\n\nAt Xmas she bought a fitbit for me (but not as a gift, so I still had to pay her back 156.44), and I paid back $100 at the beginning of Jan. Mid-Jan, I got kicked out of my house, and M had the bright idea of texting me the day after I got kicked out, asking me for money. I told her I was a little tight on funds, and at the time forgot about her owing me money (Keep in mind she was one of my BFFs, and I told her and T, the day I got kicked out.) She pretty much said 'No worries' and then hopped on the group chat and made plans to cheer me up a week later.\n\nA week later she no-showed on T and I, so of course I brought up how frustrating it was, as she constantly flaked on us, and it was getting annoying. Once I brought this up, all hell broke loose. She hopped into my DM and said something about me owing her 56.44, but now because I took too long she was charging me interest. She wanted me to give her the concert tickets for free, and then pay for HER concert shirt to compensate. So then I just snapped. I paid her 56.44, and broke off the friendship. Since then, she's been talking about how I ruined *her* birthday, and I took away *her* concert ticket. I was being cruel to *her* on purpose. I wasn't being *fair* to *her.* She's been trying to get between T and I, and villainizing me. I've been told I should just apologize because apparently I'm in the wrong - but it just seems so obvious to me that she's just trying to antagonize me, and turn our mutual friend against me.",

      "description": "I am a 22M who graduated from university last spring with a degree in biology.  Currently for work I tutor and just recently got hired to substitute teach. It’s enough that I could theoretically get a cheap apartment somewhere and live on my own, but not comfortably. I’m in California, so everything is very expensive out here. \n\nMy degree is in biology but my passion for my entire life has been to be a writer. I was pushed out of it by my family because I did well academically and writing was viewed as something that would turn me into a homeless drug addict with no money. All the successful people are the exception, not the rule, I always heard. \n\nThe original plan was for me to take a gap year and then apply to medical school. However, college was significantly harder than high school, obviously, so I didn’t get a strong GPA. Medical school is out of the picture unless I move out of the country to attend. My family is pushing for me to apply to said out of country schools or to get a different full time job as a nurse or clinical lab technician or other such job my degree can help with. \n\nI’ve been working on a manuscript since before graduation and have also been working on short stories. I know it’s not for sure, but I think I should be given my fair chance to try. I’m not a burden on my family, and in fact most of my income goes to groceries for the house. \n\nRecently my family has become much more aggressive in pushing me towards what they think is best. Just last night, my dad walked in on me writing on my laptop and slammed it shut in my face.  Now that it’s the new year, they say they hoped I’d already be moved out and moved on. They told me it’s taking too long and that’s an indication I’m not cut out for it. \n\nOf note is that I have two brothers. The most important one is my older. He is about to turn 25 and has not yet graduated. He messed around a lot and was never as good at academics as me.  I brought up that my family has and continues to fully financially support him, but say that since I’ve done better, I don’t deserve the same treatment. To whom much is given, much is expected, they quoted. \n\nI explained that what I want is not to waste time until I’m 25. I simply want to have the opportunity to try getting my dream career. If it doesn’t work, I’ll rethink everything and consider a job with biology or perhaps a different career all together. I don’t have my entire life planned out. \n\nWhat my family wants is for me to quit writing, get a full time career with high pay, and move out. They see me as having wasted the money they put towards my education (I had a full ride but they paid room and board) and fear I’ll just keep trying and failing to be an author without ever moving out. They said that when they were my age they both already had the jobs they have today, and that my generation is just bad at life planning. \n\nFor continuing to live at home with my family when I could get a full time job, AITA? \n\n",

I see her more as a lifelong friend than anything I guess. \n\nAs an adult I started living with her. We split the rent, which she does come up with every month. But other than that she helps out very little with the bills. I have tried to talk to her about this and she either puts it off or points out the fact that she helps me with my kids. She does not watch them while I go out or anything, or have to change diapers, but she does sometimes make them easy meals and helps out with my severely autistic son. \nI should also mention she's a compulsive gambler and hoards. She will buy frivolous things for my kids then throw that in my face as to why she has no money.\n\nAnyway, I have been using her card to pay part of the bills without her knowledge. If I didn't, it would be all on me. A part of me feels bad, but I simply don't have the income to cover everything and I'm tired of fighting with her to contribute. So am I the asshole?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So this actually happened today. Lately I’ve been spending more time at the office since it’s a busy period and I’ve made a habit for when I needed a break later on (usually around 7 PM) to go visit the evening receptionist for a quick chat. \n\nToday she actually asked me whether I would agree to sign something for her. Initially she said that it is so that she may work at the voting booth for the upcoming elections to the European Parliament. However, before I signed the paper I took a look at it and noticed a name of a very anti EU party (which actually wants to push for our country to leave the EU). Apparently, the signatures were for them to gather minimum amount of support so that they may put their candidates into the election. I wholeheartedly oppose leaving the EU so I said I cannot sign it good conscience. She tried to tell me that she is not agreeing with their views but just wants this gig to make extra money on the side and needs 10 signatures for them to take her as support and to give her the job. I refused again saying that I do not want to support this party in any way, in particular by signing my name on what was clearly anti-EU party list for all people to see. We had a bit of back and forth then, but in the end she conceded saying that she understands, but she was clearly visibly upset. I left shortly thereafter as this little argument kinda made any further conversation dry and awkward. \n\nEver since this encounter I’ve been thinking whether I should’ve just signed the paper as it was only for her to get the job. Did I made this situation unnecessarily political? Did I allow for my political beliefs to get in a way of common courtesy? Reddit, AITA?\n\nTl;dr: colleague asked me to sign a list for what was clearly in support of anti-EU party. I refused as this goes against my beliefs. Colleague got upset.",

      "description": "Tldr at bottom. I fully take responsibility for certain parts in this whole thing where I know it’s gonna be a hard YTA. But aside from judgment, I guess I also want to make the whole story (or at least my side of it) known. \n\nFreshman year of college, in another country, I (24F) met another expat from the U.S. We’ll call him ex-bff (24M). I attempted to befriend him, having the expat thing in common and all. But he behaved dickishly towards me, and ended up getting a gf who bullied me. To cut to the chase, they broke up and me and him became friends when he apologized for his behavior (I had moved back to the states at this point). \n\nNow, I found out that ex bff’s behavior stemmed from the fact that he was upset at ending up moving back to India for university, due to being caught selling pot senior year of high school. Hence revocation of college acceptances here. This comes in later.\n\nCue me and ex bff being friends for the next 3 years. Summer 2015, he was going through a “meh” phase, and I had a major car accident which was my fault. Around this time, he gets a new gf (23F), and suddenly his “meh” phase is gone. But only when it comes to her. I’m wary only because of ex-gf, but ex bff promises me that it won’t happen this time.\n\nKeep in mind, they are in another country. So he introduces us via group chat. I try to be cordial and friendly. I even Skyped her a few times. So I decide she’s alright. \n\nOnce, ex bff gave me his Skype password to pass on a message to her which I did. Fast forward to winter 2015. Ex bff ended up having to repeat the semester at his university due to not showing up because he was too depressed to deal with people except his gf. So he was holed up in his apartment smoking weed and playing dota. Keep in mind, this is the SECOND time that this happened to him.\n\nMe and him also had a heart to heart about both our struggles with depression, and he threw in, “gf comes to me and says ‘is OP really one of your  best friends? She doesn’t get you like I do.” It was this statement, which just bugged me initially.\n\nSo yeah, her little sentiment came from the fact that I, suffering from severe, untreated anxiety leading to massive overthinking, would kind of tell her that I was worried ex bff would react a certain way to something. And also was ruminating over guy problems I was having. I found out that she sent screenshots to him about me overthinking said guy problems followed with “that’s probably why OP called you. She wants to talk about that. Is she actually depressed? Idk what to say to someone like that.” \n\nYes, I went through his Skype. That wasn’t my proudest moment, and I fully accept IATA for doing that. But I also did it to know where I stood. Winter break 2015, ex bff’s sister was getting married in their state, and I knew I was going to be invited because he asked for my address to mail me my invitation. But turns out bride to be was having second thoughts, leading to a lot of drama. Also found out from snooping.\n\nSo yes, I was jealous that he was telling his gf those things, and not me. And he was redirecting his anger from family’s frustration at the wedding situation being taken out on him on me. But showing his nice face to his girlfriend who was behaving condescendingly towards me. Blatantly saying things to him and that he wasn’t sticking up for me. It doesn’t justify why I did it and I admit I was wrong for snooping, but at least I knew she was behaving disrespectfully. And I wanted to know where I stood.\n\nAll eventually settles down on that front. I tell him I’m upset he didn’t tell me anything about the wedding situation and that I was angry about the things his gf said. He justifies both with “it made me so angry I only really told her,” and “stop holding grudges.” No, I didn’t expect him to leave her just for a few disrespectful jabs. Just to acknowledge that it was uncalled for. But NOPE, it’s “my future wife this, that, blablabla.”\n\nFall 2017, ex bff tells me his friend, F, is attending grad school in my state. F is his former gf’s ex bff herself. So F and I link up and I hear from her about how the gf was a shitty friend who fucked F off the second she was in a relationship. WE NOW HAVE ANOTHER TESTIMONY THAT THIS GIRL SUCKS. \n\nSo it turns out the gf’s family didn’t approve of ex bff. And they expected her to move to another country for work. Which she did, to pacify them. So ex bff was bummed. I initially tried to be supportive and said “maybe you can visit!” Followed by a glum “she won’t have time.” I can guarantee you if the roles were reversed that he would launch into how my bf sucked for not making time, and how I have horrible taste in guys etc. \n\nAnyway, F and I were hanging out later that night and we Skype ex bff who was still glum. F immediately goes like “fuck her.” Impulsive, adrenaline charged me, who was pumped to have an ally who hates this girl blurted out “yeah, we hate the Bitch!” Followed by him getting all mad. F then tries to explain her stance, Followed by ex bff saying that she was playing the victim. I tried to pacify him and apologize, and he seemingly was ok until he was like “I’m still mad at you OP.” DESPITE ME TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT I WAS NOT TRYING TO RUB SALT IN HIS WOUNDS OR ISSUE AN ULTIMATUM.\n\nSo a week later, he messages me “I’ve given you enough time to apologize but you didn’t so I don’t want to be your friend. Enjoy the rest of your life.” And deleted me from social media. And I ugly cried at work and got sent home early.\n\nTo summarize: this is someone who got busted selling drugs and got his college acceptances revoked, leading to him attending college in another country. His parents were chill af about it. Mine would have let me rot in prison and I’d be dead to them.\n\nThen, spends time skipping class to play dota and smoke weed in his dorm room. To the point he loses attendance and repeats the semester. Not once, BUT TWICE. My parents, assuming they let the drug dealing slide, would fly out to beat my ass. HIS DID NOT. \n\nSo, taking all this and the fact that his gf pretty much ENABLED all of that just Bc she was made the center of his universe. I already know IATA for reading his Skype chats, but AITA overall in this situation?\n\nTLDR: AITA for holding years of resentment in from my former best friends gf treating me disrespectfully and saying I hate her just as the relationship is about to be an LDR\n\n",

      "description": "So, a few days ago, my grandmother went to the hospital because she had been feeling sick for a while. They told her she had some sort of infection, i think, i don't remember the specifics. I just remember she got a prescription for antibiotics. And, if you know about antibiotics, you have to take them until the pills run out. Even if  you do feel better. Otherwise the virus will come back. That's what i learned in school at least. I'm not a doctor.\n\n\nLong story short, the schedule to take the pills is a little complicated. She has to take 1 in the morning and one in the evening, but after 4 days, up it to 2. She was worried she would forget how and when, so she asked me for help, so icome up with a calendar so she could read it and know for certain. Plus, i started calling her to remind her\n\n\nBut, yesterday, she told me not to worry about it and that she doesn't need the pills anymore. They didn't run it, she's just feeling better and doesn't want them anymore.\n\n\nI told her about how she needs to take them, and it escalated into a bit of an argument. I started shouting that she needed to take her pills but she told me \"I'm an adult and i can do what i want.\". I told her she was going to get sick again and she told me to leave and not to come back,\n\n\nI know this may be a little weak for this sub, I feel bad for yelling at her, but am i the asshole here for wanting her to do her pills right? I mean, i get she's an independent adult, but i don't want to get her sick?",

      "title": "AITA for completely ignoring my former friend at another friends birthday party",
      "description": "So some backstory for this - I used to have a friend who at my bachelorette party got into a fight with another friend of mine when actually my former friend was in the wrong. It's a long story but my former friend was behaving quite badly and joked around and tried to make my other friend feel bad about her chronic disease which stopped her from joining in on all the activities. This resulted in a fight between the two of them. Fast forward to my wedding 6 months later and this former friend once again started a fight with my other friend, she actually got physical and knocked my other friend over. I asked my former friend to leave the wedding at that point and she yelled and screamed cuss words toward my other friend as she was leaving. When I talked to my former friend about it the day after she blamed everybody else for her behaviour. Example: It was my fault because I was the bride and friends with both of them and I had asked them to get along which prompted them to talk which naturally resulted in the fight, of course, and it was the other friend's fault since she didn't know when to back down and say sorry. So I got upset with my former friend again because it felt like she tried to gaslight me.   \n\n\nI broke off our friendship and I've had no contact with my former friend for a bit over one and a half years, that is until today when we both attended a third friend's birthday party (the third friend is a mutual friend to both of us and was actually the person who introduced us to each other). At the birthday party I didn't greet my former friend and her date when they arrived, I hardly talked to or looked at her during the party and when my former friend asked me to \"talk it out\" with her I said no. My reasoning for doing this is because I didn't want to give her a chance to say anything passive aggressive and I certainly didn't want to be alone with her since I know she can get physical when she doesn't get her way. Granted nothing bad happened during the evening and she was quite well behaved. I could tell that my behaviour bothered my former friend and since it was a couple of years ago I'm not sure if I should have given her another chance. Am I the asshole for not looking at/talking to her and her date?",

      "description": "I've kept an aquarium since I was about 10 years old (26 now), and I've always cleaned the filter in the kitchen sink. It provides enough space and water flow control to get things clean quickly and effectively. Since I've been doing this for so long, it's safe to say I've done the act hundreds of times, and neither myself nor anyone else has ever gotten sick from it.\n\nI've lived in my current place about four years, and it's never been a problem, but this most recent time my roommates took issue with it when I mentioned I would be using the sink for a couple hours. I've got a turtle, so the risk of salmonella is there, but I always take the proper precautions. Thoroughly clean every surface, make sure no food or dishes are nearby, wash my hands before touching anything, that sort of very basic stuff. They told me I had to do it in the bathtub from now on, which would turn a one or two hour job into four or five. I'd have to be hunched over the entire time, possibly get my feet dirty if I have to get in the tub... Plus, it's a lot less convenient for everyone to be without a bathroom than a kitchen sink for several hours. All in all, it seems really unreasonable, but they were insistent despite these points and it never being an issue before now.\n\nSo, I decided this was a case of \"ignorance is bliss\". I told them I would take care of it and not use the sink, but really I just do it in the sink when I know they aren't going to be home. I feel a bit bad for lying, but I know I can do it safely from extensive experience. I also have a very powerful aquarium filter, so it's a job that only has to be done a couple times a year. I'm not going to make the work harder than it has to be due to their fabricated idea of the risk.",

During the process, I told (? or advised, can't remember exactly how) him to not ask for more money since I didn't know if that's hurt his chances for getting the job (also can't remember if I told him that our not, he says I didn't). \n\nNow the current situation is that he's been put on a different team that's trying to accelerate his learning and progress more than I was pushed at that point in my job. He's understandably frustrated since he's basically being asked to do what I do (higher position, more money, more qualifications) for less pay. And he feels like I agreed him over since I told him to not push for more money, though I had no knowledge or control of what team he'd be put on or how much he makes. He's been handling it pretty poorly lately, going as far as just leaving to go see friends and verbally lashing out at me.\n\nIs this kind of my fault?

      "description": "My downstairs neighbours moved in to the flat below me around a year and a half ago. They're an Italian couple and they had a baby a couple of months after moving in. I've never actually seen the woman, but have had several bad encounters with the guy. He's came to the door and screamed in my face about noise when I've had friends over and once walked into my flat armed with a hammer (!) when I was drinking with a few mates. Honestly, he scares the hell out of me, so I feel too afraid to knock and see if everything is okay.  \n\n\nSince they've moved in, the couple has had repeatedly had extremely loud rows. Whilst, they used to happen a lot at night, they now mostly happen during the day. These rows usually last an hour or two and the baby screams throughout; whilst I can clearly hear what is being said, I can't understand it as it's in Italian. I've never rang the police initially as it sounded like a fairly equal shouting match.  \n\n\nOver time, things seem to have escalated. It's went from doors being slammed to the sound of things being thrown and scuffling; I'm pretty sure one of them is being abused. I've been contemplating ringing the police, but my own experiences with domestic violence are stopping me. Whenever someone rang the police when I was in that situation, it would escalate the abuse as a result. Whilst I want to knock and see if they'd like me to ring the police when such incidents occur, I'm not certain which one is the abuser and I'm also still scared of being targeted by them due to my past experiences with them.   \n\n\nDue to them having an infant in their home , I feel like it would be morally wrong for me to ignore the situation, so I'm leaning towards calling the police the next time things kick off. WIBTA if I rang them even though it could worsen the situation? I'm UK based, if that matters. ",

      "description": "Hi, longtime lurker, first time poster. Mobile formatting and all that. \n\nA few years ago I met a girl (let’s call her A) and we became friends. She’s been calling me her best friend for over a year now, but I have always been pretty insecure in our friendship. I have known a guy (let’s call him E) for only a little longer than I have known A. \n\nE has always been there for me had my sister (we are twins), but he’s also always been a little off. Specifically, he’s always been overly interested in us and sometimes he acts out in strange ways. Sometimes he just starts screaming at us or threatens to hurt us or himself. Last year we all had a big falling out because we realized E had been manipulating us and lying to everyone because he didn’t like how close we were getting to A. We all made up because we were worried about him hurting himself if we didn’t remain friends with him. \n\nRecently, A and I have been going through a rough patch in our friendship and I think he’s been taking advantage of it. He has been approaching me and my other friends and telling me what I believe to be lies about A. Things about how she’s been talking badly about me behind my back, etc. \n\nI reached to A in order to find out the truth and she told me that E was in fact the one who had said those hurtful things and was lying about it. There is no one to corroborate either story, but I’m inclined to believe A. E has a history of lying to us, however I wonder if A is just trying to get our friendship back to normal because we are going to college together next year and it will be awkward if we aren’t friends. \n\nI feel very hurt that either of them would talk badly about me, and I’m also hurt because I know at least one of them is lying to me. I want to confront E and ask him, but I know he’ll probably lie or he might get upset and that scares me. Another friend told me that it would be selfish and wrong to make a fuss this late in the year with graduation coming up, but I don’t think I can remain friends with people I don’t trust. \n\nBasically, I’m worried about E’s reaction and how it will affect the rest of our group.\n\nWIBTA if I confronted E when school starts back up on Monday?",

      "description": "I live with three other guys. One Turkish, One Spanish and one Czech.\n\nI was talking to Turkey this morning. And I told him we should go out for a couple beers and chill tonight. Not heavy drinking or partying but just some beers and conversations. He gives me a bunch of excuses. And he ALWAYS does this. And it's usually unrelated stuff.\n\nNow it is perfectly fine to not do things you don't wanna do. But you need to be honest and just say \"no I do not want to do that\". And I will accept it and make other plans with other people. But he doesn't do that. He just gives me a bunch of excuses and maybe's and makes me wait all day and i can't make any other plans and in the last second he says it's too late now and cancels it.\n\nBut today was the last straw for me. I asked him and he gives me the usual bullshit excuses. I debunk all the excuses while trying to not be too pushy. And he just gives me another excuse. So I tell him like I always do \"dude if you don't wanna do it just tell me no. It's totally ok if you say no and I won't get offended or anything.\" He gives me another excuse... So after civilly arguing about this for like 2 hours he says \"ok we'll go and I'll invite some people\"\n\nAfter that I went to my bedroom. And I fell asleep. I woke up at around 6 pm. We have plenty of time. I go to the living room and he was chilling on the couch with Spain. I asked him \"are we going?\" No answer. I don't wanna be pushy but I need to start getting ready if we're going out so a couple minutes later I ask again \"did you invite the people\" he says nothing. Didn't make a sound like I was some ghost. So I turned to Spain and said \"you wanna go out for a couple beers with us?\" He said he's gonna go to the gym so he can't go and I dropped it right there. Turkey still not saying anything. Then I went for a cigarette on the balcony and Turkey followed me. We were smoking and I said \"dude you have to make a decision because I know that in about an hour you're gonna be like 'Oh I would like to go but it's too late now'\"\n\nMeanwhile we were done smoking so we went back inside and kept talking and after a while sure enough he says \"it's too late now\" i said \"ok so we won't go but next time tell me earlier so I can make other plans\" but then suddenly Spain says \"alright dude i'll skip gym tonight let's go\" Turkey is already in his room getting ready to go out. \n\nI don't say anything. I pretend to get ready with them. And once everyone's all ready with their coats on about to leave, I go back to my room without saying anything. When they notice I'm not with them first Spain knocks on my door and says \"aren't you coming?\" I say no politely and then Turkey knocks on my door and says \"come on dude we're leaving\" I tell him to Fuck off aggressively. He thinks it's a joke and asks again laughing and i get more and more aggressive everytime he asks and then he leaves silently probably heart broken because I've never talked to him like that before.",

      "description": "  \n\nFirst some background information:\n\nA couple of my best friends and I have been going on a ski holiday (is that what you call it?), organized by our favourite teacher, for the past three years. We've gotten to know the other regulars and it’s always a great time, however expensive it may be (and it is expensive). We’re going again this year but there is one rule which is not as tightly enforced as it should be, the “apreski” part. We’re all minors where we come from, however, in Austria, it is legal for us to consume alcohol. Our teacher tries to crack down on this aspect, however, he can’t do this as well as need be. My group enjoys a beer once in a while, but we follow this rule out of respect for our teacher and because skiing under influence/ with a hangover, just isn’t as fun. We find that we are paying a large amount of money to have a nice skiing holiday.\n\nLast year someone else came along, a sort of “friend-of-a-friend”, I don’t like her, but that’s not the most important part. She didn’t have any skiing experience, so she took a class, which I find sensible. Then she strays off course, which I find stupid, but it can happen with less experienced skiers. She gets a bit “traumatized” (in her own words), but she carries on the rest of the week. However, she does push us towards drinking, because “why not, the vodka is cheap here”. Well, three hours later, she yarfs everything up that came in and nobody truly enjoys it. \n\nWhen we got back home, we held a bit of an afterparty and during said party, she definitively stated that she didn’t enjoy skiing. Then comes next year, my friends and I are talking about going again and she comes in, saying that she is coming with us. I’m trying to \\*hint\\* that she shouldn’t go, because she doesn’t enjoy skiing and is not good at it (at all). She says boldly: “But hey, drinks are cheap!”. Then I try to be more forward, saying that she’s a liability out there, and in her efforts of skiing along, which she doesn’t like, would only make it less enjoyable for the rest of us. Her retort again is something along the lines of “The drinks are cheap and we’ll have a good time being drunk!”.\n\nI’ve found myself on the verge of snitching to the teacher because I truly worry that she is going to worsen everyone’s time there. However, knowing her and her parents, she’ll have to pay every penny back and she’ll probably be limited in her freedom for a long time.\n\nAITA for not wanting her to come along, ruining my trip? \n\n(btw any and all advice on spelling, grammar or anything else to do with writing a text is welcome.)",

      "description": "It’s obviously more complicated than that, but I suck at titles. A while back, called a guy acquaintance up and invited him to Chipotle’s. Order our food, go to pay, and I ask him for his share. He gets a bit taken back and goes “no you invited me, you pay, that’s how it works”. I’m socially awkward and autistic, so I assume I missed a social construct and paid anyway. That and I hate confrontation.\n\nIdk what made me dwell on this now, but it got me thinking. I’ve been invited many times to go out and eat and always paid my own way, unless it was stated “Don’t worry, I’m paying” or “my treat”. I know I didn’t say I’d treat him to lunch, but maybe my wording threw it off? Maybe I said “Wanna join me for Chipotles?” instead of “meet me for chipotles” and “join” indicated I’d pay? \n\n(PS: I’m still learning this whole interacting with humans thing so I’m just making sure I don’t fuck up later lol)\n\nEDIT: just dawned on me, maybe he felt embarrassed because he assumed I’d pay and didn’t have any money, hence the reaction he gave. Also, was absolutely not a date in any way shape or form. I’m married and he’s got a GF. Just old friends wanting to catch up after a long time. He’s also not a complete asshole, just this one situation (he’s rough around the edges I guess lol)\nBut either way, thanks guys. 😊",

      "description": "This is a long one. TLDR: my mom has a tendency to accuse me of being disloyal to my family when I don't do everything they want.\n\nFor a little backstory, I am the only college graduate in my family. I have a decent enough entry level job in a science field. $20K in credit, and the best credit score in the family. I'm 23 and moved out of my parents house a little over a year ago and got an apartment with my boyfriend. I would also definitely say that I am more financially responsible than my family. I made a few mistakes in college and immediately after so right now I have about 30K in debt. This is between my 2017 car (the bulk of my debt), 5K in student loans, and around 3K in credit card debt. I have a plan to be rid of all or most of that debt by time I pay off my car in 4 years. So for my age and situation, I doing pretty okay since my bills always get paid.\n\nI'll add that a chunk of my credit card debt is from my family. I lent my brother (24) a lot of money that I put on my credit card. He hasn't paid me back even though this started two years ago while I was in college so I've been paying the interest and principle myself. He constantly asks me for money for gas or food or asks me to travel 40 miles after work to pick up his daughter when he doesn't have gas or messed up/lost his car. As a side note, he's on maybe his 7th car, I've had 3. Because of his irresponsibility, he's had two repos and just destroyed the rest even though some of the money that I gave him went to repairing his cars. The most recent one was a car that was about to be repo'd. I helped him get it back and a week later he crashed it. He didn't have GAP insurance so my guess is that its still on his credit. Aside from the cars, its been money that I gave him for other reasons on the promise he pay me back. I haven't gotten any money back since November. I also frequently buy clothes for his daughter since his ex never returns any of the clothes that I buy. Kid clothes get expensive.\n\nMy sister (18) also owes me from money I spent on credit and my mom tricked me into cosigning her student loans (9K) that she claimed would be covered by grants or refunded when my sister dropped out at the beginning of the semester. My mom has been paying but made it clear that she doesn't want to but won't make my sister take responsibility for her own stuff. I can't be taken off as cosigner until my sister finishes a program (she started at the community college) and has a year's worth of payments after finishing.\n\nMy parents also ask me for money either for basic stuff like groceries or gas or to keep a car from being repo'd or a bill being unpaid. The thing is my dad is a city cop and with overtime makes almost 6 figures. That's three times more than what I make. They spent money to raise me so I don't always mind helping but I don't understand how they can be so irresponsible that his salary isn't enough. They usually pay me back but always make it difficult like they don't need to keep their word. Even though I'm doing okay, I can't afford to not be paid back the amounts they borrow. Its usually in the hundreds.\n\nTo get to the point, my family is irresponsible and constantly ask me for help. It gets VERY annoying. But when I refuse, my mom calls me disloyal to the family and my brother gets mad. She always says I might need them but at the rate they're going, they would never be able to help me if I needed something. As far as I know, loyalty doesn't include giving up my hard earned money and putting myself into more debt to fix they're mistakes. And of course I feel terrible when I say no, especially when it involves my brother and niece. This is just one of the many problems I have with my family but that's 23 years of baggage that can't fit into a reddit post.\n\nAm I an asshole of a sister/daughter or just surrounded by chronic users?",

      "description": "Sorry for poor grammar\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo some for warning about this is that this doesn't effect me as much as it effects my \"friends\" gf. Which she is a very close friend of mine.\n\nTo start it off my \"friend\" will be called Rick. Rick hangs around my friend group and he has been known to be an annoying type of person (butt in on conversations that don't include him, making dark humor jokes at a serious point in time, guilt tripping etc.). We as the group politely asked him if he would stop hanging around us once because his annoyance got out of control. He responded nicely and respected our wishes and left us alone. Eventually one or two of the friend group members started hanging out with him again and he was eventually hanging out with the group again. Seeming like he changed I also greeted him as a close friend again. He has been through a depressive state so I asked him to hang out with me and my gf and her friend at her friends house. They hit it off immediately, but he didn't think so, he kept saying things like Nooo she is too good for me, She doesn't like me, etc. I asked him if I could see if the friend liked him at all and said yes (obviously). So they started a happy relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 4 months in that relationship he starting going back to his annoying state as I may say. He became a lot more needy also. Anytime his gf would get up from his lap from cuddling he would mutter under his breath something about my gf that made her get up even if they had nothing to do with each other. It got to the point where he would say, This is why \"Gf name here\" should leave me and find someone way better, I shouldn't even be here, etc. And he would sit making the same mopey face every time he pulled this \"game\" per say. It made everyone that was with us at the time really in a depressing mood and ruined the whole day. Especially his gf. She would go into a pit of sadness and cuddle him for hours while saying \"I'm sorry I don't make you happy, I'm sorry it's my fault\". And she has walked up to me and the group saying \"guys i'm tired of this mood he does when he doesn't get his way.\" I feel really bad because she said multiple times she wants out of the relationship but every time she tries talking about her problems with Rick he pulls the same sad mopey mood. I have talked to him and he blows me off saying \"he does it as a joke\" and I reply with its not a joke to make your own girlfriend think she is the reason that you are faking a depression to get what you want. And as you would expect he tries pulling the \"you're right i'm a terrible person, (his gf) should just leave me and be happy\". So I can't help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo WIBTA if I cut him out of my life and hope he goes away?",

The downside is that I get a ton of mail from people that use it as a throwaway or by mistake. I've had people use it to sign up for Ashley Madison, which could pose an issue for q married guy like me, I received 50 bucks via PayPal by accident (immediately returned it without being asked) and countless email addresses, facebook accounts and the like have been created with my email as the primary address. I find this irritating so recently I've been recovering passwords from these accounts and locking them out by changing passwords. Recently someone started a Bethesda account and bought some software with my email, so I changed the password to their account and the next morning had a bunch of password reset requests in my inbox so obviously the person wants to log back in. It pisses me off that people don't think of the fact that the email address they're using as a throwaway is in fact my email address that they're spamming. AITA? ",

      "description": "English isn't my native language so this text will have some mistakes, so bear with me\n\nTo cut long story short, I'm in my 25-30 years old and I was living with my family, I worked and paid the bills like a good member of the house. I don't know how to explain how this problem started because it seems something from a movie, but, little by little my family started to stop interacting with me and starting to find any motive to start a fight with me\n\nMy brother started to literally ignoring me, If I asked something to him (Like \"did you saw the keys?\") he would make me ask him 5 times or more until he exploded telling me to shut up\n\nMy mother little by little stopped to prepare food for me and make only for her and the rest of the family (and I started to make my own)\n\nThings like that started and got worts by the time. I think I'm a good and quiet guy, I just work, stays on my pc playing games and pay like, half of all the bills, I never start a fight with anyone, so, I really don't know why they started doing that to me.\n\nRecently my mother's dog attacked me and got me to the hospital, when I confronted my family to call a trainer or something like that (It's a really angry dog) they said what I was predicting for a long time: \"Why don't you get out of the house, then?\"\n\nAnd... I agreed, I really feel like my family don't liked me anymore, not only that but I saved a little money and have a good job. So I can keep myself.\n\nNow the problem: When we were kids, my mother made some bank accounts for me and my brothers (some for each) and saved some money for emergencies (She would normally says \"That's your money to use when needed\", the account don't have much money, but it is something)\n\nI had 2 accounts in my name, one she used for alot of things from her work (this had the most money), so I decided to transfer all to her. The second and last account wasn't was touched in 15 years and had less money, when I said to my mother I would give back the amout she deposited years ago + some years of extra income from the bank (I don't know how its called in english) and that I would get for me one part of this extra income (The total would be something like 60% for her and 40% for me) she started to scream at me, saying that I was stealing HER money, that I was evil, a monster and other things\n\nI really don't know if I'm being the bad guy, but I want to put a extra point here: I have nothing, I have only my desk, PC and bed. I'm starting a new life (gonna need to buy EVERYTHING like a refigerator and microwave), and yes, I have some saved money from my job, but this money would help me out a little\n\nI really don't know if I'm seeing something wrong, but, Am I really the asshole for \"stealing\" my mother's money?",

      "description": "So I recently posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ab26hp/aita_for_not_helping_my_so_with_her_panic_attacks/?st=JRGWARUN&amp;sh=c4e24c14) asking everybody if I was the asshole for not helping with my ex girlfriends panic attacks when we were together. Idk if the link works because mobile, but yeah it’s the second most recent post after this. Anyway, since then we’ve broken up for other reasons. Basically we want different things now in life. I’m an atheist and she told me she couldn’t handle the thought of having kids with someone who would tell her kids that god might not be real, which I can respect. I wanted to finally have sex because I thought the relationship felt more like a really good friendship and I had mentioned this a few times over the last year. She didn’t want to because of her religion, which again, I always respected. The fact that we were already going down this road a year ago is probably what has made moving on from her easier than expected. \n\nOf course breaking up sucked, but we kept it super respectful and chill, or so I thought. About a week later I started chatting another person up after drunkenly texting her. We hung out the next day and have hung onto everyday since, I have been really surprised how well we hit it off especially considering I hadn’t flirted with someone in over 4 years.\n\nAnyway, my ex called me last night saying how she misses me and what not, and I decided it was finally time to let her know what I had been doing, because I don’t have any intention of getting back together. The hell that I have gotten since then has been insane. I know it’s a short time to move on from someone, but I thought the point of breaking up was because you need to see other people. I’ve tried telling her that I truly enjoyed our relationship and that I hope she finds someone too, but it’s not enough. I’ve already had to go to counseling at my university because it’s really fucking me up how pissed she is when I never meant to make her mad. \n\nShe’s started telling her friends and they’re starting to be mean to the girl I’m only talking to and I feel like it could ruin what we have. Even worse, I’m worried that I’m going to start losing friends soon over this. I feel like I’m the only one trying to be calm about this and explain my reasoning, which again nobody wants to hear ",

      "description": "My brother (50sM) is a \"failure to launch\" person. He's almost a decade older than me, and he's been to prison a couple of times, and to jail many more times. Always for drugs or theft (to get money for drugs). Right now, he and his current fiancé (40sF) are living with my mom (60sF) trying to save money to get their own place. The fiancé works retail and my brother is currently unemployed (basically he can't pass a drug test, but I suspect that even if he could he still wouldn't have a job). He does odd jobs around my mom's place. Mom is retired and lives on a small farm. I have an autistic daughter that requires total care, so I have my own \"failure to launch\" kid and can empathize with my mom. I understand why she keeps propping him up even though she can't really afford to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it sounds like I'm not a fan, but I love my brother. When he's not high, I get along with him really well. I just have my own expenses and responsibilities and can't take resources away from my family to give to him, and I know him well enough to know that lending him something is a gamble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, today he came by my house to borrow my truck. I live just down the road from my mom and have no problem with him using it to help do stuff around her place. I'm home pretty much 24/7 taking care of my daughter so I hardly use it. He brought it back after a couple of hours and started telling me about how he had gone ahead and cleaned up the interior, vacuuming and wiping it down because it was pretty dusty with disuse (it's a fairly nice truck, it just sits most of the time). He then asked if he could use it to go into town so he and his fiancé could do some shopping. I could tell he was pretty high, and \"into town\" means into the suburbs. Much more traffic and many more police.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ME**: Do you have a license?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(He had lost his license, last year, and I didn't know if he'd been able to get it back.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BRO**: (instantly mad and defensive) Hell, yes! Why wouldn't I have a fucking license?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nME: I'm not trying to be offensive, I just remember you had lost it and that's the last I'd heard about it. When are you going?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I thought that if he wasn't leaving for a few hours he might sober up enough to drive.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BRO**: In about half an hour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ME**: Aren't you kind of high to be driving? You seem pretty high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I could see it made him even angrier, but he acted like he understood.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BRO**: I've had some edibles. That's fine, we'll take our car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ME**: Yeah, that truck is my only vehicle. I'm sorry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BRO**: No, I understand. (walks off in a huff.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? I know he's going to be mad at me for awhile, and, crazily enough, I feel like a selfish dick, but I think it's asking a lot to borrow somebody's only transportation if you're going to drive while intoxicated.",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my bipolar girlfriend to cry herself to sleep?",
      "description": "Obligatory this is a new account because i don't want people who know me correlating it to me snippet. TLDR ar bottom.\n\nMy girl is bipolar and has her manic/depressive episodes every now and then. Most are manageable, but this one was one of those major ones.\n\nI work graveyard shifts and work usually 10-12 hours each shift. So I'm doing my thing and I get a text from the gf, she's depressed and has been crying, so naturally I'm worried for her. I rush through my work as fast as possible and race home (we live together) so I can comfort her.\n\nI get back around 1p, and there I see my girlfriend in all her depressed glory, sleeping in the bathtub. I wake her up, she starts crying and saying how she wanted to draw a bath and maybe the warm water would feel good, I dry her off, she stops crying, all is well. I get some food in her and we watch a couple of episodes of this show we've been following for a while and eventually we both nod off to sleep.\n\nOr so I thought. She woke up about 2 hours into our nap (or my sleep), and what does she do? She cries. But I'm so tired that I don't wake up to her sobbing.\n\nAbout 5 hours later, I wake up to it as it's progressed into her crying so much she has the occasional dry heave and the sound is loud and disgusting. I keep trying to comfort her, but she's being so difficult-- she wants to eat, but doesn't want to make or buy food, but before that she wants her dog to be fed and walked so he can go to the restroom and she wants to do it but can't will herself out of bed, and she also doesn't want to be left alone but she knows I work, which makes her cry and dry heave harder. I held her and stroked her hair and tried to calm her, though she was having none of it. Through all the hours of crying, I was surprised she could still produce tears.\n\nBut hours and hours of crying on top of me working 10-12 hr shifts and only sleeping 5 hours just really stressed me out. I peeled her weeping body off of me, told her I'd take the dog to go restroom, got said dog and left for 2 hours.\n\nI couldn't deal with it. I walked the dog for a little, but eventually came back home, grabbed my car and put the dog in with me, and drove to Carls Jr to eat a burger. I got a burger for the pup, too, since he hadn't eaten. We sat for a while, then I got another burger for my girlfriend and went home.\n\nWhen I finally came back, she had cried herself into a stupor and had passed out on the floor. She's currently still there, I just put a blanket on her. I don't want to deal with her if I wake her up and she just goes on with her waterworks again, but her burger will be waiting for when she's awake.\n\nAm I the asshole for needing some space away from all that? It just gets overwhelming and I'm tired and running on very little sleep.\n\nTLDR; Bipolar GF is having a really bad episode but I'm stressed from working long hours and having very little sleep. Tried comforting, didn't work, couldn't take it anymore, left gf to walk dog and eat burger instead.",

      "description": "Full disclosure, my grades have been falling for the past year or so, I believe it’s mostly because of stress and self esteem issues, my parents think that I am putting up an act and using this as an excuse. My grades have finally picked up during the past month or so after addressing and trying to solve these issues,  and even though I am not in the top 3% like I used to be, I am happy with myself. My parents on the other hand, keep making fun of my ‘excuses’ multiple times a day, saying I was manipulative and just lazy. \n\nFor the past week or so, my mom has been tutoring a student. She is an economics teacher, and while I don’t study economics, my mom keeps talking about how better of a student the girl she tutors is. How organised and better she is, how she doesn’t put up any fake excuses. My mother says really inappropriate things she feels bad about later on when she is angry, stuff like how I was born to make her put her head down in society, and my brother made her proud, how I would be a garbage man in the future etc. I never mention these things to her and she mostly forgets that she said them in her rage. \n\nI finally snapped yesterday and told her all these things and how it would be better if I just got to be myself and do things at my own pace, we haven’t been talking since. My parents are quite angry with me. I love them to bits, I am very fortunate to have them, and I feel like they are amazing, just not perfect like anyone else on the planet, and I keep apologising and I feel sorry but they still aren’t listening. I just wanted to know if I was the asshole.",

      "description": "My boyfriend works from midnight to 6am. So it’s a night shift. I’m up usually at like 11 am on my off days, but when I’m in classes I’ll wake up at 5am and leave straight away. I normally try to wake him at 5-6pm. But lately he’s been getting to bed later and later till like 1pm. So hes been trying to sleep in later and later as well until lately where he’s been waking up at 8:30pm. This bugs me because he’s not actively trying to sleep when he’s been staying up, he’s been watching a tv show or playing a video game in bed (which he says is the best way for him to fall asleep). \n\nWe’ve had multiple conversations where we both agree that him going to bed at 9am and sleeping till 5pm would work, but it feels like he doesn’t try to work to maintain that sleep schedule. He’s been working really hard at his job and so he barely gets any time off (overtime on Fridays and 12hr shift on Sunday nights) so he tries to spend his morning playing games and stuff and he’s been out playing until like 11 am lately not even trying to sleep but he says he’s not tired at all so he can’t. Like I understand that he wants to spend his off time having fun, I’m an avid gamer myself, but he does it in the morning when he could be sleeping. I’d rather he played after he woke up when we could play together. I’m just so conflicted because I understand he needs his sleep but he needs to wake up earlier otherwise he’ll keep sleeping later and later. If he kept waking up at 6pm then he WOULD be tired by the next day. But he insists on sleeping in. \n\nI get frustrated because with him staying up because it feels like I get no time with him when we’re both up then. He’s just alone while I’m sleeping and then I’m alone when he’s sleeping. I am fine with that until 5-6 but it gets frustrating when I’m waiting till 8pm or even 9pm for him to wake up. \n\nAm I the asshole for being mad that he’s sleeping in all the time? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We became an actual group this year in high school, but have also known each other for a few years before through orchestra and such (its a group of 8 people). So basically, I have been having a lot of fun with them, and just yesterday I told them i’m leaving the group. There’s a solid reason so hang in there with me.\nAt the beginning of the year, and a little bit over the summer, was when our group started. We hang out almost every weekend and do everything together. The reason I left is because I don’t feel like I fit in at all. They all tried to convince me otherwise by saying I do fit in, and some of them got pretty mad at me when I said I was leaving them. Although they told me I fit in, I still didn’t feel it. Whenever we were at group things, I always felt ignored by everyone and I always felt like I was second best to everyone, and I felt like an outcast. I would beat myself up about it all the time, and I gradually got more and more angry at them and myself the more I was with them.\nBut then I joined band. So that made me one of those awkward orchestra-band children, but I met new people through it and realized I could be so much happier if I left and joined a new group.\nSo AITA for leaving my friends, making a lot of them angry in the process, and joining a new group of people?",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years. Since 2016 he's travelled overseas without me on 5 occasions. He now wants to go again in July. I can't get the time off work in July but might be able to in August. I haven't asked work yet because my boyfriend and I are arguing about this and there's no point in asking unless we can come to an agreement. \n\nMy boyfriend is refusing to change his leave plans despite wanting me to go with him. His attitude is too bad, I'm going anyway. In his mind he's had his heart set on this particular trip on these dates and refuses to change anything. Granted there is an event he wants to go to during this time, but, this event will also happen in a much closer neighbouring country the following week. I've suggested we both go to that and just make a long weekend of it instead and then go to the overseas destination at a time that suits us both. \n\nAt the moment he doesn't have anything booked so there's no financial detriment if he was to change his dates. He's also in a managerial position so he has more flexibility to take time off than I do. \n\nFor further reference, my boyfriend and I usually travel together overseas annually which is why I haven't really raised much of an issue about it in the past (despite the fact it sucks getting left behind while he's on holidays). However this year it'll be the only leave he takes. He doesn't seem to care that I can't go or won't be able to take an overseas trip now.  I'm not keen to travel on my own, I've done it before and I definitely prefer travelling with him for the company. \n\nI have no issue with him wanting to go and ideally I would go but it's not feasible this year at that time. I understand why he wants to go when he does, but I also think it's inconsiderate to me. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for being upset and asking that he doesn't go? \n\n",

      "description": "So I have been texting and FaceTiming this woman I met on Match for the past 10 days - we live about 90 minutes from one another.  Earlier this week we made plans to go out tonight (Friday).  Knowing I lived 90 minutes away, she suggested I rent a hotel room so that I could have some drinks and have a place to crash without worrying about having to drive home after our date.  I thought it was a splendid idea so I booked the room.  I also made dinner reservations for us at what she had previously told me was her favorite restaurant. Then, last night, she calls and is crying -  she had a horrific day at work and I listened and sympathized with her for 2 hours on the phone, at the end of which she thanked me and said that after her brutal day at work, she was not up to going out and wanted to just \"cry the weekend away\" and avoid the human race as much as possible.  I replied that getting out might be just the thing we needed and I was looking forward to seeing her -- she stated that she just could not envision herself having a good time with anyone this weekend - I left it at that as I did not want to be \"that guy\" pushing or begging her to go out with me.  I called the hotel and canceled my reservation, losing about $300 in the process (the cost of the room) as the cancelation was less than 24 hours before check-in and then canceled the restaurant reservation.  Today, she texted me to say good morning and told me she had a change of heart and really wants to see me tonight.  I then informed her I had already canceled the hotel room and restaurant reservations.  She said I should try to rebook a hotel (right, because booking a hotel the night of in New York City will never be cost prohibitive) and \"make it happen\".  I told her that as much as I was looking forward to our date, that I think it would be best if we tried next weekend instead.  I understood how she felt about her bad day at work and canceling our date but, having taken the hit on the room already, I became somewhat annoyed and my headspace changed from \"I am so excited for this date\" to \"meh\".  So, the date remains canceled. AITA?",

The plan was to go there introduce them and then all go out to Olive Garden.  \n\nWhen we got there everything went well until I asked my mom if she was ready to go eat.  She said she had a surprise for me.  She had made my favorite meal for me with plenty of sides and dessert.   There was so much food.  It was really sweet. \n\nMy gf is a little picky about what she eats.  We went to sit down and she just outright says, “I don’t like any of this kind of stuff.  I’m going to Grubhub Olive Garden.  What’s the address here?”\n\nThere were so many options and she didn’t even bother to try anything.  My mom didn’t say anything, but knowing her it definitely hurt her feelings.  I was livid on the inside about how rude it was, but didn’t say anything about it.  Gave her the address so she could order and was mostly quiet the rest of the night.  Gf seemed oblivious to how rude it was.  \n\nSince then the most I’ve said to her about it is that she could have at least tried some things and if she really couldn’t stomach it then order delivery.  She just doesn’t get it though.  She says she knows what she likes and shouldn’t have to eat what she doesn’t.

My gfs brother use to have his own apartment with his gf until they started having problems in which they broke up and bailed on their apartment.

He stayed there for a few months doing nothing but working and doing drugs. Eventually he got kicked out. So now he lives in his car with his cat he refuses to get rid of.

      "description": "This will probably be long, I'll try to be as concise as possible. My friend, who I will call S, is getting married in December, and I don't think I want to go. I'm 21, he's 23, and we've been friends for about 6 years. \n\nI have been thinking, and I don't think he's a good person. We have a mutual friend, who I will call K, who has been an addict on and off drugs since he was 16. He was sober for a few months, and began drinking a few months ago when he turned 21. \n\nK gets the worst of what S has to offer. Unsolicited \"advice\" out of the blue, degrading and berating him via text, months after not even speaking to him. Things like calling him a \"piece of shit drug addict\" and the like. Most recently it was, again, out of the blue, \"don't bother showing up to my wedding if you're high or drunk, you need to get your life together and quit being a loser. You being fucked up all the time is annoying. Grow up.\" He knows he has a problem, being an asshole isn't helping, and I think S knows that. And if you want to move on from being friends, that's your prerogative, but being derogatory is just unnecessary in my opinion. \n\nThat really upsets me, because despite him being an addict, he is one of the kindest and smartest people I've ever met. He has always had a lot of money from when he sold weed as a teenager, which may be why, but he's never imposed his addiction on anyone by stealing or manipulating in any way. Rarely can you even discern if he's high/drunk or not, he doesn't get to that point. He honestly has great input and I love talking to him. So I'm not sure how it could be annoying as opposed to simply concerning. \n\nS has also stolen from K. A few years ago, K had a little over $10,000 in cash he needed to store somewhere while he moved, along with some sports equipment and other miscellaneous things. 6 grand came up missing, and the story was that S's niece had stolen it. She was 7 at the time. Then, a month or so after that, equipment, worth $700, was \"stolen\". S later admitted to selling them, then proceeded to send a nasty text containing \"I'm glad I sold your stuff\" among other things in reply to a joke K sent him. \n\nK also told me a few weeks ago, when they were both drunk a couple years ago, S admitted to something he did that really changes the way I look at him. Apparently, a girl he was dating thought she may be pregnant. She asked S to punch her in the stomach. Which he did, multiple times I guess. Absolutely vile, even if it was a request and he was a teenager at the time. \n\n\n\nOne of the more recent things that made me decide this involves my ex-girlfriend. We broke up about 8 months ago, she is kind of unhinged as I've found, and she decided to try to make my life Hell. She decided to hack my business email and sabotage relationships with people I do deals with. Hack my PayPal account, eBay account, and any other random game or service that may have my cards tied to them. She made purchases on Amazon with my account, locked me out of my Gmail, etc. I'm also pretty sure she is responsible for egging my car, siphoning gas from multiple vehicles that have been parked at my house, and I've also heard people walking around outside my backyard at night several times. Can't be certain, But none of those things have ever happened, and they suddenly started when she moved out, and all happened in a 2 week period. (Only kind of ranting I promise, will relate soon.) \n\nWell, after she moved out, maybe 4 months after, she texted S and his fiancee. He didn't tell me this himself, I found out through a mutual friend. I asked him about it, and he wouldn't tell me what she told them, just that it was about me. He flat out refused, got mad for me asking, simply saying \"I'm in the middle of this. I'm out.\" and then didn't respond to me for 2 weeks.\n\nI was with that girl for nearly 6 years, and I feel like someone should have their friend's back over something as SIMPLE as a text message. I've heard him myself say things like \"not wanting to be in the middle of drama\", yet he gossiped about it to someone else.\n\nI've also seen S and my ex making replies to one another on Instagram on almost every post, clearly still friendly. I've told him what nonsense she's done after leaving. Am I alone in thinking that is at least a little inappropriate? I know bringing up social media and texting is a little ridiculous, but it's more about his lack of awareness/disregard for simple things. But also, if I know either of them, they're probably communicating more than just that, which makes me worry she's been invited to the wedding. Obviously that's an assumption, but it wouldn't surprise me at this point.\n\n\nIn general, S is also just unpleasant to be around, getting angry at the smallest things and being rude. Raging when we play video games, being very self-centered in conversations. Though I haven't heard anything from him in a couple of months apart from his wedding invitation I got in the mail.  He moved to another state without even trying to hang out one last time, even though I offered. \n\n\nI know this seems pretty obvious. But I discussed all of this with K recently, and he told me he wished he was in a place in his life where he could be there for a friend at his wedding, despite everything. My cousin who's also friends with S is also pretty upset at me for bringing up even considering not going, whom I've also told most everything I said above. \n\nI don't want to be friends with him anymore considering all, but should I at least go to the wedding? I would be upset if someone ghosted my wedding, but I have a feeling he doesn't even care if I show up anyway. I also feel I'm being disingenuous if I show up to the wedding and then never speak to him again. But he's moving 4 states away and doubt I'd ever see him again in the first place, he never reaches out to me either.\n\nAre these things I should put aside for a day and show up? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I’ve been looking for a job recently and and I’ve been talking to a few friends about the positions I want and such and one friend just sort of bothers me, he just talks to me in a way that sets me off a bit, like I’ll be talking about the job position I want and then I get to the pay and his first response is constantly\n“Oh you’ll make more/less” then me, and it’s constantly the lesser salaries that he points out. \n\nIt makes me feel weird that everytime I talk to him about finances he feels the need to point out that he’s making more then me and it honestly feels like a humble brag, I’ll tell him I think I’ll make x amount by the end of the month (The context is me bring up my savings plans) and he says he’ll make 2x the amount in half the hours even though the job I have recently landed pays more then his. (??) so I honestly don’t know how he gets those numbers and it feels.. bad. As if I’m in a constant competition with someone and can’t just enjoy my small victories without having him trying to overshadow me, this is not the only instances of him doing it either, he’s bragged about having 2000 in savings to me before while he knew I was broke, going on about he doesn’t “know how to spend it.”\n\nI finally got a bit blunt this afternoon after I once again brought up my finance plans when regarding a new job and then he had to try to one up me and bring up his lower hours and supposedly larger pay,and I told him it makes me uncomfortable and as if I’m in constant competition with him. He now sounds offended in his messages and I don’t know what else to say at the moment, AITA? ",

      "description": "My best friend Jess is a salesperson for a very big, well-known company. She began 2 years ago &amp; has been promoted twice. She SLAYS her job. She’s a go-getter &amp; makes great money. She said she could get me an entry-level position at her job - the same job she started at 2 years ago. She told me the position had a high turnover but assured me if I stuck it out, then soon I could be making great money like she did. I thanked her and went for it. In a month I had the job &amp; training started.\n\nJess was my cheerleader during training. It was as hard as my nursing school exams. Halfway through the training I realized that the \"educators\" from headquarters were very vague about the details of the job. Questions asked got answered with generic pep rally responses. One thing they told us is that there would be NO cold calling. They said this 4 xs a day. Every time I asked Jess questions, she repeated the same \"Go Team!\" rhetoric and assured me the product sells itself &amp; NO cold calls.\n\nTraining ends &amp; job begins: SURPRISE! It's 100% cold calling. The co. gets around calling it \"cold calling\" by stealing people's info online and tricking us into thinking they are \"leads\" who’d \"expressed interest.\" None of these people wanted what we were selling - we had to tell them why they can't live without it. I was AWFUL at it.\n\nAfter 2 months I had only made 1 sale. And only bc Jess did it. I gave her my next # to call &amp; after 30 min. of not-so-white lies &amp; sweet talk, she made a huge sale! She was frustrated. \"See? Stick to the script.\" So I did. I read the script, but it was so awkward I still couldn't make a sale. I HATE telling lies and I HATE being yelled at – but apparently it’s the gig I signed up for.\n\nI never made a sale &amp; after &lt; 6 months I quit. I spent months crying and dreading work &amp; after a breakdown I never went back. It's the only time I've ever walked out of a job, but it was the call center or my health. I chose the latter, and in doing so I've REALLY pissed off Jess.\n\nI got a new job I love. Jess has shit all over it from day 1. Saying if I’d \"read the script\" &amp; \"toughed it out\" I could be flying around and having fun in 2 yrs. I apologized &amp; told her that I don’t have the personality for sales. I am an introverted pushover. I thanked her again but she still acts passive aggressive.\n\nShe’s acting like my quitting ruined her career. It didn't! I bet nobody even knew I was gone - or that I was ever there! I wasn't making money for them. I'm not cut out for sales. I sent an email saying this &amp; she took it personally. She twisted my words, saying things like \"Oh I'm good at sales, according to you I’m an evil, soulless bitch!\" I never said anything like that. I know that quitting without notice was immature, but I think she’s blowing it out of proportion. She’s acting like she stuck her neck out, but in reality anyone that walked in the door would’ve been hired.\n\nReddit, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA For wanting an apology from my Dad after taking my coke glass?",
      "description": "Backstory: Dishes were stacking up taking more than 50% of the kitchen, usually my Dad or Mum would clean it up but this time the dirty dishes had invaded the kitchen.\n\nThe beginning of this major issue was when I left a filled up glass of coke on the table and decided to go outside where my two other siblings were playing on the trampoline - I played for 10-15 minutes with them which was nice as I am a filthy weebo that spends time in his room during the holidays.\n\nI go back inside to find my topped out coke glass that I had been using that whole day gone. I checked around to find who stole it and actually checked my Dad last, he pathetically covered it up with his fingers playfully and I went:\n\n\"Dad, dude that would be my coke glass\"\n\nDad-\"Well, its mine now, you didn't do any of the dishes!\"\n\nI knew that it wouldn't take too much effort to clean a new glass but I pushed for an apology which he neglected the entire time to give to me.\n\n\"Well, you took my glass- I stared in disbelief for a moment at him as I was a very slow speaker. Trying to find a way to fish a sorry out of him but he spoke up before I could say much more.\n\n\"Just go back inside man..\"- With a little bit of hindsight I can remember he said this with annoyance but I didn't notice it at the time as him about to snap, I thought he was about to offer a sorry.\n\n\"Okay just that's my coke glass that I've been using all day and I just left it for a moment-\n\nHe cut me off and started with little bursts of anger as he started to make threatening gestures of throwing my own coke glass at me, \"Go back inside NOW\"\n\nSurprised with his extreme anger that came out of nowhere I was suddenly very close to going back inside, as the gestures he made were very much legitimately flinching me; I ducked out of the way of his three alike gestures that he continued to make.\n\nAt that point my body took over and did go back inside very begrudgingly.\n\nSkip over two days as I had stayed up all night to work my sleep schedule to actually be normal as school is soon to come in a couple weeks. \n\nI'm woken up by my mum at 8:00AM to go shopping with her, I first have some cereal when she asks me to finish up to go shopping which was fair enough. I did ask her why we had to go so early and I heard my Dad yell from the other room adjacent 'BECAUSE WE ASKED YOU TO!\". We left then and she told me on the way that my Dad had broken his two toes kicking a chair, and her back was sore.\n\nWe then shopped and when we came back I had accidentally dropped one of the five fairly heavy bags on one of our cats water bowl, it spilled everywhere as it was topped of by my brother earlier that morning.\n\nI can't remember what my Dad said but he said something from the other room akin to mocking me. \n\nThat made me incredibly frustrated and angry, after unpacking everything I walked into the other room and asked him why he should be criticizing me when he had kicked a chair presumably out of anger-temporarily crippling himself.\n\nWith that he got incredibly angry, yelling to the point of spitting in my face that I was an idiot and that I was going on and on with a very small issue while he was supporting me completely for my entire life. Which I hadn't taken for granted by the way he was just bringing up other issues to avoid talking about things he was wrong in.\n\nI had just taken it, building up my resentment as he quite literally screamed in my face, he repeatedly told me to go away and leave it now.\n\nThen my brother started yelling from his room, my Dad begun to walk towards his room silently before I stopped him and told him to leave him alone. I then went down the hallway to tell him to shut up as he is only going to make it worse.\n\nHowever, my Dad changed his mind about me leaving the argument and shut the internet off. Trying to force me out of my room to turn it back on. Which I had only done because my brother complained to me to turn it back on.\n\nI fixed it back on, when Dad entered the kitchen again. This time my brother was also here to witness the next argument.\n\n\"No, you don't get to turn it back on.\" I still had my hands on the modem which was a rectangle with sharp edges.\n\nHe forced my hand into the modem and I had to let go as he is much bigger and taller than me.\n\nWe then had an actual argument where I had argued back that he was acting incredibly unreasonably and very similarly when compared to a close relative who I won't disclosed that had a mental illness.\n\nAfter all that I grabbed my phone and decided to phone 911 of which the entire family loved to come outside to see me call them.\n\nIt was then I noticed a deep cut in my index finger that had taken off an inch wide centimeter deep wound.\n\nI went back inside to a suddenly very calm father as the whole family was there, I'm almost certain he wanted to start acting collected just to make me out to be the bad guy. I had entered the situation again and tried to withhold my anger like he was, I repeated the situation and said sorry. At which he shrugged and went, \"Yeah, sure cool\". I then asked for an apology which he said snarkily \"What for?\"\n\nI stomped to my room to attempt to calm myself down but I couldn't control it and went back to him to yell at him for not being capable of offering a single apology to his son. But he yelled back we'll just have to wait for the police and see what you say to them.\n\nThen he started up the line of, \"That coke glass was more important than your relationship to me!\" Which he did repeat over and over, I have a rebuttal to that; \"Then why can't you say sorry to your much younger son for something as small as that, a single word?\" I eventually was forced out by my siblings to offer an apology to him because they wanted their internet back.\n\nThis was the final argument where in he recounted everything that just happened in his own way, attempting to nudge an excuse to get mad at me again to the point of screaming. I swallowed it and endured it for my siblings.\n\nWell, am I the asshole? I really need others input as I don't want to look back now and see myself as a \"entitled millennial brat\" as my Dad said as the closing feature in his argument.\n\nCheers\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Long story short, today in class this woman brought her child, who kept crying and making noises during the lecture. She had to get up repeatedly to take him out the class, and it kept breaking my ability to focus on the teacher. She would look at me, laugh it off and say sorry, as I told her that she should consider putting the little guy in daycare. She scoffed and said that she can take her child where she can; and acted like I was the one being obtrusive. When the kid started screaming I told her to \"shut her baby up\", where three other girls found my comment offensive. The teacher didn't mind me saying it. The kid then kept pulling my pants and so I pulled my leg away and caused it fall (on accident), which I don't think is my fault. She placed her phone on the desk to record the video and then stood behind me as she tried to such her baby. Her friends kept scoffing at me when I ignored her crying kid. I just wanted to attend class. ",

      "description": "I (male) was at school last week when a girl in my class (a black girl) gave me a bag of sweets with a note on it that said “I think you’re fine do you wanna come get some pizza soon?”. My teacher unfortunately saw it and as I saw leaving took me to one side “I know she has been sexually harassing you, a lot of girls at this age don’t know boundaries especially girls of that background”. I said I appreciated their concern but it was ok. I thought it was ok but I found out (through social media) that the girl in question has been given an official letter saying that a sexual harassment warning will be put on their permanent record. I have some learning problems and I am put as a vulnerable student but I didn’t want my teacher to start a crusade for me :(",

      "title": "AITA For calling the RA on a girl in the bathroom?",
      "description": "So here's what happened, at least from my point of view. I go to my hall's bathroom to take a shower a week or so ago, and one of my hallmates comes out right as I am about to go in saying that there is a drunk girl passed out in one of the stalls. My immediate thought is that she's probably drunk. I go back to my room and put my shower supplies away and then join my hallmate in the bathroom trying to rouse the girl (who was on the floor with her head on the toilet seat). We decide to call the RA on duty, as the girl hadn't responded to us talking to her under the stall door. It was actually my hallmate who called the RA, since she had her phone with her. We can see that she is breathing, but she hadn't said anything in the few minutes we'd been in there. The RA shows up, shoos us out, and I take my shower in a different bathroom. When I get back to my room, my roommate reports hearing a struggle going past our door and multiple people saying things like, \"Let me go!\" and \"I don't want to hurt you.\" I was pretty sure that the RA had called the police or something and had bathroom girl taken away. \n\nI felt like I had done the right thing. Sure she hadn't been disturbing anything by being passed out with her face on the toilet, but I was still concerned that she could be in trouble as she wasn't responding. \n\nNow comes what happened today. I'm washing my hands in the bathroom and the bathroom girl comes in about to take a shower. I don't recognize her at first (I'm bad with faces/names) and try to make small talk, asking her if she's going to bed soon. She answers that she is just taking a shower, but asks me why I thought she was really passed out drunk on the toilet. I told her that she wasn't responding to us trying to talk to her, so we wanted to play it safe and call the RA. If she wasn't passed out, the she should have been able to respond to us somehow. She then tells me that it had really messed up her life and that she can take care of herself. I didn't really have a response to that except that I didn't want someone in our hall to die of alcohol poisoning. She asked if I had known anyone who had that happen and I answered truthfully that I hadn't, but knew plenty of stories where that did happen. Then she says that if I really want to be an RA next year then I should think twice about it. I tell her quickly that I don't want to be one next year. (It was incidents like this that scared me away from the job, I hate confrontation.) After that I leave and go to a different restroom to calm down and wash the tears off my face  (like I said, I hate confrontation). \n\nI assume that she got in trouble with the campus police and probably got a mark against her from the college about being drunk in the dorms. I admit, it probably did mess up her life a bit. I felt at the time it was the right thing to do since she wasn't responding and seemed to be passed out, but now I'm conflicted. \n\nAITA for calling the RA on this girl? Should I have minded my own business?",

      "description": "Mobile user here, apologies for format issues, blah blah blah\n\nHere’s some background: I’m a minor, my parents are divorced, and we have a 8-6 day split (I’m with my mom for 8 days, then my dad for 6). For awhile now, my dad and I have butted heads over me not calling or texting him for long periods of time (read: five days at most). Like, I’ll go over to his house and he’ll get mad at me and call me ungrateful and shit, and then he’ll start talking about how I don’t get out enough or talk enough. But that only happened like once every couple weeks, and since we’ve been talking a lot more now, it stopped happening.\n\nBut this week, I slipped up, and I didn’t contact him for 7 days. So, not wanting to get yelled at again, I pretended like nothing was wrong for a few hours. I kinda thought that it was water under the bridge - I was wrong.\n\nLast night, he came into my room to talk, and I knew exactly what it was about. I just thought it would be the usual. But it turns out this was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\n\nSo, first he asked me why I didn’t call him, and I didn’t answer because everything explanation sounds like an excuse to him. So then he went on to tell me that I was never happy, and that my poker face was disrespecting him, and then he asked me how I would feel if he got rid of my room and made me sleep on a bunk bed with my brother, and I told him that I didn’t know how I would feel because it was hypothetical, and then he said he could make it happen tomorrow.\n\nThen he said that I could talk for hours about stuff that no one gave a “rat’s ass” about, then called me shitty again, and left my room.\n\nAnd then this morning on the way to school, he said a I was a selfish person who didn’t appreciate my family because I didn’t text or call them enough, and that I didn’t appreciate my friends because I hung up on them one night because they kept shouting at each other, and then told them to stop calling me back for the night. Then he got mad at me because I wasn’t talking, and I told him it was because I was trying to find something to say to explain myself other than “I was really busy with homework and testing and presentations”, and he told me to stop thinking.  Then he called me smug for not talking, and called me selfish because I didn’t take a picture of our Christmas tree and send it to my grandma because she bought me tinsel. The end.\n\nTL;DR: I didn’t contact my dad for 8 days and he called me selfish and unappreciative.",

      "description": "Let me explain. I am in college and recently decided that I am tired of the freshmen 15, sophomore 30 and so on. I have a gym membership that my mom got me for my birthday and decided to make good use of it. When I told my boyfriend, he wanted to go with me to also get rid of his weight gain. At first it didn’t sit right with me, but I let him come with me anyways. \n\nWe jogged together, much to my embarrassment, because I was sweating like a pig and couldn’t keep a pace after 3 minutes of half of the speed I did in high school. He seemed better off then I was but when I stopped to take a breath he stopped too and said that would be enough for now. I was so embarrassed that I had to stop so soon when I used to be able to jog a half mile in 5 minutes. I didn’t look at him while I wiped the sweat off of me. \n\nWe then went to do stretches and I still couldn’t look him in the eye. It happened again when we went to lift weights. I just couldn’t look at him after he saw me so out of sorts and gross and sweaty. I don’t know if this makes sense to anyone but I didn’t feel sexy anymore. I let this go on for a few days, but I couldn’t stand it anymore so I brought the issue up to him. \n\nI explained my feelings and asked him not to come with me anymore. He seemed genuinely confused about why I was asking this and got really sad. I told him I was sorry, and he said “It’s ok. I just thought this could be something we could do together.” He was so upset for the rest of the day that I almost took it back, but I knew I couldn’t. I would just feel even more ashamed afterwards, and I know he wouldn’t feel comfortable going to the gym with me anymore. So why do you think reddit? Am I the asshole?",

We are enjoying our food and then my 2 other brothers say ': happy birthday !\" My brothers then gave my youngest brother a pretty cool present(I believe some dungeon and dragons stuff), but I didn't. give him anything. I was talking my oldest brother later that evening and we were talking about presents and his birthday. Keep in mind that my youngest brother is pretty eccentric and his hobbies are kinda expensive. Also, keep in mind that I don't have a debit card/youth card and I'm kinda broke :((. This is how the convo went although I can't remember it in full detail. me=me and ob= older brother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nme: You guys gave him a nice present but I didn't give him a present, do you think he will mind? \n\nob: We did give him a nice present, I don't know if he minds. But he is your brother and we(the three of my brothers) got you a present this year. \n\nme:  I feel really bad but I don't know what I could've gotten him. \n\nob: it's kinda mean and unthoughtful of you tho \n\nHe then walked away and I felt like an asshole. I really love my brother but I didn't know what I could have given to him,  and my brothers play dungeon and dragons and paid for the present together. I mean throughout the year we give each other some small presents, and if I go to the supermarket I sometimes will bring free food for him.

I was pretty annoyed that she just got up and left because imo she didn't have to meet up with her friend at all she just chose her friend over me. She says she's not superwoman but I don't think I'm unreasonable for expecting my gf to spend more time with me. AITA?",

      "description": "So I've had a best friend since middle school, so for about the past decade, we've been basically brothers. \n\nFast forward to a few months ago I was talking to this girl. Someone we went to highschool with, and was kind of part of our group of friends. Me and her got kinda close and were hanging out here and there, not fully a couple, but we made out a few times, talked dirty over the phone and stuff. You know, kind of a light fling. \n\nWe never had sex because she was a virgin (still is as far as I know) and wasn't ready for it yet. (She was raised by a very strict, Christian mom, and pretty sheltered, which manifested in a girl that liked to roleplay kinky sex stuff [she had a major kink for being kidnapped], but not do too much irl, stay with me, that's relevant, I promise.)\n\nAnyway, we do that for a month or two, and my \"best friend\" (we'll call him \"D\") dms her on Facebook basically confessing his love for her from hs. So i'm like, \"Ok whatever, kind of a dick move, but I dont actually care all that much.\" And she tells me all of this and said it kind of blew her mind. Again i'm pretty whatever about it.\n\nThen she tells me that he wants her to come to a party with him at his brother's house. This raises a red flag with me for multiple reasons.\n\n For one, this girl is really sheltered, and would not by any means be able to get herself out of a bad situation, especially in a city she is completely unfamiliar with, about an hour drive from anywhere she knew. (We live in a small town, like, less than 2k people small)\n\nOther red flags are that I've been to a party over there once, and I know that there are lots of drugs and alcohol that go on there, along with underage girls ending up being taken advantage of while hardly concious. (Yeah I wasn't at that party for more than a few minutes) Add to that \"D\" has personally told me that \"as long as you've had at least a sip of alcohol, it's completely ok even if the girl is black-out drunk\" referring to getting laid at parties. \n\nNeedless to say, I told her that, in my opinion, it would be a really bad idea for her to go. But that I can't stop her, so if she does decide to go, be really careful, and go in your own vehicle, so she wouldnt be stuck there. \n\nA few hours later, I get a message from her saying \"i'm sorry, I can't talk to you anymore. If you come to my house I will call the police, and be armed with (insert firearm I forgot here)\n\nSo obviously i'm completely confused. \n\n\"D\" messages \"hey\" right after.... very suspicious.\n\nSo I ask him. He then calls me out for raping her (???) Proceeds to belittle me a whole bunch and talk shit. \n\nI'm at work so I ignore it till I get off, and message her on something she didn't block me on and ask what happened. She said I raped her and blocked me.\n\nI knew I was innocent (seeing how shes a virgin still) so I call the police and tell them this girl is saying I raped her, so they might wanna go talk to her, cause rape is pretty serious.\n\nThis is set still during when #metoo was pretty big, btw\n\nI find out through a mutual friend that she told him that, and he believed her without questioning it. (Btw to anyone that remotely knows me, i'm the last person that you would think would do that. There are people that I am very close to that have experienced rape, it's no joke to me)\n\n\"D\" Posts on FB and dms everyone on FB he can think of that knows me saying \"hey did you know (I) raped someone?\" (I found that out cause another friend that was in my passenger seat got that dm from him)\n\nI make a post on FB saying \"D is going around saying I raped someone, anyone that knows me knows I wouldn't do something like that. Please ignore him\" IK I shouldn't have, but I was mad, and wasn't gonna sit there and accept what he was saying with denying it. (AITA for name dropping him there, after he did it to me everywhere?)\n\nAnd I even provided evidence (dates and times showing how I never would've had the opportunity to rape her [we were pretty much never alone]) and logic that didn't make sense with her story, and he refused to listen. I understand wanting to believe a girl with this type of thing, especially one you are interested in, but to offer no resistance, even when its directed at someone supposed to be your \"brother\" even when it doesnt all add up properly, really broke my trust with him.\n\n\"D\" and the girl do their little fling for a while, then split up, and guess who comes groveling back with \"i'm so sorry, I realize now I was wrong\" and \"give me another chance to be brothers again\" But i was having none of it, and cut him off completely. \n\nI responded with something along the lines of \"well i'm glad you realize it now, but no.\"\n\nWhat kills me is one of his messages after I told him i'm not going to associate with him anymore: \"I dont i'm now what i did to deserve being treated like this\"\n\nIs there any basis that I should forgive and forget after that?\n\nWow that was long, lots of context, sorry about that, it's a very nuanced situation.\n\nTL:DR \nAm I wrong for cutting off a best friend for trying to ruin my life?",

      "description": "My good friend’s family has been in town for the holidays, and they’ve been asking me to come over for several days now. I’ve been fighting off a mild cold (watery eyes, slight congestion, headache), so I declined until last night. They had several friends over to meet their family over dinner.\n\nNaturally during small talk, my friend asked how I was feeling. I have no outward signs of being sick, and I explained that I still felt a bit “meh,” but have been feeling better and walking around enjoying our unseasonably warm weather all day. Like I said, there was no coughing, sneezing, runny rose, etc. \n\nCut to about 10 minutes later, and the room goes silent. Good friend’s brother/roommate sits down next to me with a stern look and says “I’m going to have to ask you to leave.” Everyone in the room is watching and seems to already know what is happening. He explains that his wife (who also lives with my good friend) has OCD and her father is having surgery in two weeks. She is worried about transferring my germs to him.\n\nAt this point I’m pretty embarrassed but trying to be gracious and understanding of the situation. I say that I’m just going to use the restroom before I leave, and they suggest I go to the bar next door instead. I gather my things and leave. Everyone continues to watch me as I exit the apartment. At this point, I’ve got about 15 horrified and apologetic text messages from my friend and another attendee.\n\nObviously I don’t want to get anyone sick, but something about this is not sitting well with me. I’ve been saying that I’m sick for the past 3 days, so it would have been nice to be spared the $30 cab fare if it was going to be an issue. Even so, if it was brought up more casually and [good friend’s brother] didn’t make such a spectacle of the situation, it would’ve felt less embarrassing. \n\ntldr- friend’s brother silenced a room and asked me to leave their dinner party because I have a cold, even though I’ve been telling them that I have a cold for the past three days.",

It was just comments like that and it would piss me OFF. I always thought friends were supposed to be happy for you and support what your doing but all of them literally did the opposite.

      "description": "I've known B since high school and back then she was a healthy, active cheerleader. Fast forward 15 years and she's fought a lot of shitty, hard emotional battles and in the process gained 160+ lbs and is edging on 300 for her short stature. I love B to death and won't begrudge people their inner turmoil, but she has gotten very, very unhealthy to the point where she can't really walk for long distances and gets winded and tired extremely easily.\n\nShe's expressed a major desire to start a family with her husband and I am supportive; she'd make a great, loving mom, but I'm honestly pretty concerned for her. She's had complications with her menstrual cycle and often complains that doctors tell her to lose weight to help conceive. Her rationalization is that since her much smaller (by ~100+ lbs) sister gets pregnant at the drop of a hat, she should be able to as well. They're half sisters. She's been trying to conceive for almost a year and it's not been fruitful.\n\nI'm getting more and more anxious for her as time goes by and made the mistake of saying that maybe she should take her doctors, multiple, advice but she just doubled down on her position. I don't know how to be supportive in a way that isn't superficial without bringing to light that part of her complications may be from being morbidly obese. It's even worse because I have a disorder that makes it so I can't really ever get fat and I struggle to maintain my weight while eating a ton. I'm like the worst possible person to say anything to her but she's my best friend and we confide in one another a lot.\n\nI feel like such a rotten ass for being this level of worried for her. I worry that her dream won't come true. I worry that she won't conceive the baby she wants because she won't work towards having her body be healthy enough to carry it. I worry that even if she does have a child that she won't be able to keep up with him or her; she can barely keep up just walking around shopping together. It's stupid to worry this much about a life that's not my own and maybe I'm the asshole for it because it's really not my business. I want her to have everything and it really tears at my heart that she might not get it and it could be of her own doing.",

This loaf only had three or four slices in the bag so it was easy to miss, since our microwave is on a lower countertop. When she got home, she saw that her bread was microwaved and was pissed. Before I could replace it she got our other roommate to run out and get a new loaf. \n\nThere was about 30 between the time I microwaved it and when she got home. When she saw it she immediately asked our other roommate to replace it, I was out of earshot but figured that’s what happened since he left and came back with bread. I’m going to buy my other roommate lunch the next time we’re both home together to repay him. ",

      "title": "AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend of 2 years for lying about a sexual partner and some other sketchy stuff?",
      "description": "Hey everyone - \n\nusing a throwaway because people know my other account and I talk shit in a lot of the sports subs. I deal with my sadness with stupid humor so hence my username. I honestly never thought I’d post here and that anyone here asking if they were the asshole or not we’re idiots because they have no self awareness. Well looks like I am an idiot, too!\n\n\nAnyways let’s get into this- buckle up buttercups. It’s a long one. \n\nI’m a senior at a large university in the United States. I met my now girlfriend the beginning of my sophomore year in one of our business classes. Let’s name her Jenna. The first year was amazing and I honestly fell in love with her. We talked about marriage after college, where we were going to live, the whole nine yards. The ONLY thing that was really a red flag for me was her lack of girl friends. Not only at school, but also in her hometown (we’re both out of state students). I know now this is usually a huge red flag, but I thought, Hey! It’s not like I have a shitload of friends and I was lucky enough to go to school with my best friend from back home. Anyways, we had sex pretty regularly. I am EXTREMELY paranoid about using protection when we have sex (condoms) and she is really against it, even after having a pregnancy scare with her last boyfriend (“but it feels soooo much better and I’m on the pill”) She reluctantly agrees to use a condom every time because I told her it was the only way we’d have sex. When we first got together she claimed to have been tested for STDs and has a low sex partner count, and I had no reason to suspect otherwise, but still thought it would be a good idea to protect the both of us - man I’m glad I did. \n\nLast night we went out with a bunch of my friends to some bars. Had a great time and I definitely had too much to drink. She was sober and drove us because she had work in the mid morning. We ended up going back to my place where I really don’t remember much, except I know we had sex and she admitted to me in the morning that she didn’t want to use a condom and I was too drunk to object or notice. (She did all the work). She kinda made a joke about it “See you don’t have an STD! Ha!” First, she has no idea how STDs work, and secondly I was furious. I’m a pretty calm guy, but this pissed me off as I explained that I only wanted to have unprotected sex when I got married to my wife and she had really broken my trust with her. She took this as an insult (“OH so I’m not going to be your wife?!) and a fight ensued. Listen, I really kind of blame myself for this at this point. I come from a family of alcoholics and I need to be better about controlling my drinking so that I can be coherent enough to know what’s going on around me. Still, I thought someone who loves me and knows my stance on things like this should have my back and respect my wishes. \n\nAnyways, during this fight, it was never physical (I’ve never touched a woman like that) and voices weren’t raised too loud as my roommates were sleeping, but it definitely had a hostile feel. It’s also the most bizarre fight I’ve ever been a part of. She finally came clean about so much of her past that she had either lied to me or chose not to disclose - almost a cathartic releases of things she had bottled up. She admitted to me that her actual sexual partner count was in the 30s and she couldn’t really remember the exact number (I’m not sure why she admitted this, except maybe to hurt me? I had asked once or twice in the past and she would always say 7) I started asking about why she didn’t have any girlfriends and that I thought it was weird and she admitted in high school she had “gotten” with two of her “best friends” boyfriends and was pretty much ostracized from her friend group. She had also gone “crazy” her freshman year and I guess got around her dorm room which is why none of the girls wanted to be her friend (we have coed dorms for anyone wondering). I lived in another dorm on the other side of campus my freshman year, and with the size of our university it doesn’t surprise me that I never heard anything about this.  (Perfect example gentlemen that if she says she only hangs out with dudes because they are “less drama” she’s probably bangin em’)\n\nThis all bothered me, but I’m all about second chances. I told her I was mad at her, but that I would probably forgive her and that she just needed to give me some space to cool off. She was grateful and I really don’t doubt her love for me. I even think at this point that I’m overreacting even though I’ve been somewhat cool about it all. \n\nThis is where it gets fucked up and after so many replays in my head I have no idea why I did this next part...\n\nI don’t know how or why I remember this, but about six months into our relationship I had a super weird encounter with her and another guy as we were both leaving my apartment. He was walking by and she waved him down to say hi. Let’s name him Jake. She introduced me to him and I thought it was super weird that my girlfriend knew him (I had seen him around before and knew he lived somewhere in my apartment complex, but didn’t know who he was and she lived about 10 minutes from me). I asked her after meeting him how she knew him and she said they had a class together. He was a good looking cat(looked like Ryan Gosling to be honest) and I made a joke about how if she wasn’t in my life I would totally bang that guy while watching the movie Drive (I’m 100% straight, just jokes). She normally likes my dumb humor, but for some reason gave a really weird fake laugh/smile. I thought this was super weird so I asked her what was wrong. Immediately, I have a sick feeling in my stomach (I kinda know she’s banged this dude, but think maybe I’m being paranoid?). I ask her, do you really have a class with Jake or are you lying to me? She does a GREAT acting job saying that I’m insecure, how she’s not a slut, she would never lie to me, she’s not in a good mood because she’s on her period, yadda yadda. I immediately apologize and again, up until this point, I have no reason to suspect anything.\n\n\nFast forward back to this morning-\n\nI don’t know why, but as she’s about to leave my apartment on OK terms, I remember this past moment. I ask “Remember that Jake guy? Did you have sex with him?”  She says “yeah, why?” She doesn’t even remember lying to me or the conversation we had over a year earlier. She goes “It’s not a big deal, it was before we dated” This freaks me the fuck out. Why did she lie to me about it? I shook the hand of a dude who totally banged my girlfriend and had no idea and then she lied about it. I lost it. Told her to pack all of her shit from my place (she stayed over about 4 days a week at this point) and to get the fuck out of my place and never come back (god damn you Ryan Gosling looking motherfuckers must have it easy). She starts crying. At this point of my best friend  is up (the true MVP of today) and tells me to leave and that he will help her pack her shit and will take her home. I leave and go to a bar and start drinking (I know, I know, stop being a fucking alcoholic)\n\nAnyways, this all happened this mid morning. She’s called and left voicemails and sent me texts nonstop and I’m too big of a pussy to block her yet. I’ve been pretty upset all day and haven’t responded to anything. I blocked her on social media, but haven’t shut the phone down yet. She’s also been calling my roommates and they are being good homies and not responding as well. \n\nAm I the asshole here? I feel like she definitely either lied or never came clean about her sketchy past. In one of her texts to me she said that she was so afraid of losing me and she didn’t know how to tell me (honestly I might not have dated her if I knew what I know now).  I’m going to make an appointment to get tested for STDs and get that taken care of because I’m fucking paranoid. \n\nAlso, I don’t reddit a TON ton and am sketchy on etiquette, does this post need a TL:DR? \n",

      "description": "Basically me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost a year when this happened (early October). His best friend had a house party so we were both invited but I didn’t go for unrelated reasons. 3 weeks pass and all I knew of what happened at the party was what my boyfriend told me: he had gotten blackout drunk and he didn’t remember anything. \nOkay, no big deal. By that time i hadn’t thought of the party since he had last brought it up, 2 days after the party. \nAnyways, one day he tells me that we had to talk about something. He told me that at the party when he got drunk he kept touching this girls leg and feeling up her ass. He didn’t remember any of it but from the accounts of everyone at the party and the girl herself, he did indeed do it. None of his friends stopped him. In my boyfriends words, “they all thought it was a joke. Like look at that drunk guy haha hes so stupid.” He found out the next morning of the party but he thought it wasn’t a big deal and never told me about it.\nHe told me that he was going to hide it from me if it wasn’t for a mutual close friend that found out about it, he had urged my boyfriend to tell me about what he did because the mutual friend thought what my boyfriend did was a dick move and my boyfriend agreed. \nI was pissed at him when he told me everything. Not so much of him feeling up a girl when he was drunk, but at him not telling me anything if it wasn’t for that mutual friend. 3 freaking weeks and he had so many opportunities to tell me about it yet he didn’t. Our relationship is majorly based on trust because we dont see each other very often (maybe 2/3 times a week.) After we had talked everything out, I told him that i couldn’t trust him because of this. I also added that i hated his friends for not stopping him nor encouraging him to tell me. Im now feeling like i overreacted and i have no idea whether my feelings are justified at all. \n\nTL;DR \nmy boyfriend felt up a girl while blackout drunk and hid it from me for 3 weeks.",

      "description": "My wife is a stay-at-home mother. I have a corporate job and work anywhere from 45-70 hours a week on average. (My schedule isn’t super predictable, and I often work late nights). My kids are 10 months and 3 years old. I spend as much quality time with them as I can but, as you can imagine, it’s not always as much as I’d like. \n\nAnyway, I will admit that I don’t really do household chores. I’m not a slob and it’s not like I leave messes everywhere for my wife to pick up. But she does the cooking, dishes, laundry, etc. And, obviously, she’s the primary caregiver for the kids. \n\nAnyway, this topic came up over the weekend when we were having some friends over. My mother-in-law took the kids over night so everyone was relaxed, drinking, whatever. I honestly don’t remember who raised the subject but one of my wife’s friends (let’s call her Jane) brought up how clean our house always is for having little kids. She said something like “you two keep it so clean” and my wife laughed and basically said that *I* have nothing to do with how clean the house is and it’s all her. Which is true, I guess. My wife wasn’t mad, mind you, just tipsy. But Jane sort of gets a look on her face and then the conversation shifted to chore division, generally. We all ended up having this stupid debate about it until finally one of the guys forced us to change the subject.\n\nI talked to my wife the next day and she basically brushed it off like she didn’t see why I was even thinking about it. She’s not timid so I know if something was bothering her, she’d tell me. But the whole night left me feeling sort of uncomfortable. \n\nAnyway, I guess I want feedback from objective parties. AITA here? ",

It was truly heart wrenching, and I couldn't believe my parents allowed that to happen after first watching. So the next day, I questioned by parents about the video, and and they explained what happened.\n\nHer family was not homeless, they were staying in a friends garage while their house were undergoing renovations. \n\n\nShe stayed with our father and my mother, and I on the weekend.

We had a good time at the bar got along well, flirted alot and she tells me where she works and I should come by for coffee (she works as a barista)\n\nFast forward a couple days later I'm running errands with my buddy and we decide to get coffee after on the way back to my place because it's a block away and convenient for us. We stop in and shes working, I'm hungover and not in a talkative mood I give her a smile and just chill we grab our coffee and leave, we dont talk for a couple days then I ask her if something's up and she says that I cold shouldered her and that I acted like an asshole and that she realized that she would rather work on her own \"things\".\n\nSo in conclusion after that I kinda guess shes just a child still and doesnt realize that some people have social anxiety and insecurities. I struggle with basic communication and when I told her she shot it all down as excuses, that hurt my feelings because i dont usually open up enough to let people know so i just told her that I'd rather invest my time elsewhere since she cant seem to understand me.\n\nSorry if my formatting is horrible I'm on my phone and rarely post",

      "description": " \n\nI am considering resigning a lease with one of my current roommates. We were previously a 3 person apartment but one of my roommates is leaving because the other remaining roommate is difficult to live with. The remaining roommate decided (with no communication with me at all) that she didn't want to find a replacement for the 3rd room. After asking her what was going to happen with the rent, she agreed to cover 2/3rds of the rent and relevant bills instead of the two of us splitting the bills and rent evenly since I was in favor of finding a replacement from the beginning (as is normal, we live in Portland and tons of people are interested moving in to the 3rd room). This is all happening within 2 weeks of renewing the lease with the landlords, who don't know that we haven't found a 3rd person for the apartment\n\nI want to change the lease or at least add an amendment to it stating that she is responsible for covering 2/3rds of the rent and bills. When I brought this up to her (over text because she can't handle talking about things in person like adults), she got really upset and refused, stating that she now feels that I don't trust her because I want a new contract and that I am causing a \"bad vibe\". While its true that we have never had money issues before, I feel its really important to have a legal contract because you never know what can happen, even though I don't think she will try to rip me off.\n\nThis roommate tends to be very emotionally manipulative and childish and always likes to pretend she is the ultimate victim. She is always really passive aggressive and will never admit she has made a mistake but I like to keep the peace so I try to appease her most of the time while she walks all over me. We don't really interact much and it's been awkward in the past but now that I am communicating my needs, she is really pushing back and not considering my side at all. She has had a really bad record with roommates, at least 3 previous ones leaving on bad terms, but I am obviously masochistic and now feel bad that she feels bad that I don't trust her on this. Everyone is telling me just to leave the apartment and not resign with her because she is gaslighting me but we are supposed to resign April 1st and I feel like leaving now is rude and irresponsible.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nTL/DR: I am a bad roommate and bad friend for asking for a new contract with the new details regarding rent and bills responsibilities? The remaining roommate is very manipulative and is making me feel bad for asking for one, am I the asshole?",

He orders a single drink and we sit down.\n\nOf course, I want to see my sister - I saw her car in the parking lot. I ask one of the waitresses if she can wave her over, and soon enough, my sister comes over. She greets us and is acting as sweet and as respectful as she could.  We talk a little bit and she asks me if I could see her before we leave. I don't see anything wrong, and neither do my dad or his gf, and I agree. My dad is still slurring his words, and once we finish eating, I walk to the to-go area to say goodbye to my sister.\n\nShe suddenly hugs me, warning me that my dad is drunk beyond belief and that she wants me to text her when I get home to my mother's to make sure I'm safe. She's seen my dad drunk (and I hadn't at this time) and was extremely concerned. She had talked to the other employees about it, but they couldn't cut him off because he had only ordered one drink at the establishment, and while he was showing red flags, they couldn't do anything about it due to their policy. I agree to do so, worried, and I head back over to my dad's table.\n\nI said something along the lines of, \"Dad, I think you're a little drunk. I think it would be safer for us if \\[his GF\\] drove instead.\" Now, keep in mind, this was entirely my idea.\n\nTHEY BOTH GET PISSED. His girlfriend starts angrily blaming my sister for *something she didn't even suggest.* She walks to the middle of the restaurant where the entrance is and starts demanding to see my sister, and I try to calm her down and say that we should leave. My dad is silent this entire time. His GF starts to yell about it, and after pretty much dragging her out of the restaurant before my sister caught wind of it from the other side, GF starts going off about stuff that she doesn't fucking know anything about. We also almost threw hands. A thirteen year-old. AND A GROWN FUCKING ADULT.\n\n(From here on out, I'm pretty biased and still pretty pissed.)\n\nSo, I keep pushing the idea that she should drive instead of my dad. She gets mad and claims that my dad \"has barely drank anything\" and that \"he wasn't drunk\", which *he obviously was*. She then starts saying my sister \"doesn't even know how to raise a child\" and that \"she needs to get her fucking life together before she comes in here spouting lies\". Lemme ask, what the *fuck* does that have to do with this??? This was her first time meeting L, too.\n\nShe goes on and on about how horrible of a person my sister is as my dad gets into the driver's seat and I into the back. Now, I cry when I'm angry, and that's what I was doing - I was pissed beyond belief and couldn't just tell her to stop because then my dad would get mad at ME for being \"disrespectful\" (as he did later on anyways.). I refused to speak after one particularly rude thing his GF said to me, and I stayed silent until I get back to my mom's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** My dad got drunk and we went to my sister's workplace. She stated he was drunk and was worried about me. I told my dad that his GF should drive home instead and she was pissed off for absolutely no reason. We get in a fight (almost a fist fight) and we leave. They got mad at *me* and my sister for trying to be safe.\n\n**AITA for getting defensive of my sister?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Tonight I was out for dinner with 4 of my friends. (We’re all in our mid 20’s). We order our food and were having drinks and talking when friend A’s boyfriend Josh showed up, unexpectedly. \n\nWe already ordered so he calls a random male server over who wasn’t our waitress and orders. He knew who our waitress was because she literally just took his drink order when he sat down.\n\nHis gf asks him why he didn’t just wait for our waitress to come over with his drink and he says in a really annoyed, non joking tone “why should I have to wait around for a woman?” \n\nFriend B says “wait what?” and he gets defensive and replies “Problem?” and she says “yeah what the fuck dude, that’s not cool” and we all agree except for his gf. He then says something along the lines of how women take too long to do anything and are too scatterbrained but this time he’s trying to pass it off as a joke. Everyone is pretty quiet now because Josh is the loudest one at the table. He kept talking about how much commission he was making at work lately as if any of us care or are impressed.\n\nFood comes out, there are onions on his burger and he didn’t want onions so he says to the waitress “I said NO onions, why is that so hard for you?” She says sorry and she’ll get him a new one right away.  \n\nThe male server he ordered from in the first place ends up bringing Josh his onion free burger and Josh says “This guy knows what he’s doing. She (female waitress) doesn’t get her tip rent money tonight.” Friend B again tells him he’s being rude and he says he’s just being honest. \n\nIt wasn’t even the waitresses fault!\n\nAs we’re leaving we’re planning our next get together and I mention this new axe throwing place that might be fun and Josh cuts me off and says “you girls even know what an axe is? That’s ok, I’ll teach you AND how to throw it” so I cut him off and say “uhhhh actually you’re not invited, it’s a girls night and clearly being around women makes you uncomfortable.” He mumbles something under his breath about bitches then he stomps off without saying bye. \n\nFriend A is mad at me now and I tell her Josh has been a douche all night and he’s sexist and he wasn’t even invited to dinner anyways. Later as I’m driving home she texts me calling me a bitch, saying I just don’t understand his humor or get how important his job is and that she won’t be coming to the axe throwing place unless I apologize to Josh and invite him. I said that’s not going to happen and she said maybe we should reconsider our friendship then. I haven’t talked to our other friends that were at dinner about this yet. I think Josh is a douchey, entitled prick but he’s really good looking so I feel like people let him get away with a lot. I love my friend and don’t want to lose her but I don’t feel like I did anything wrong. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n\n",

The lab was fine but the pitbull was a monster---constantly jumping on people and tearing up furniture left and right. \n\nYesterday my sister is out of the house as is her husband and my parents. My sister refused to put the pitbull in the cage and told us that he would listen to us---he didn't. We tried to keep him in the cage but he just kept acting up and even tried biting me. I was concerned for the safety of my daughter so I locked him outside in the backyard with a bowl of water. \n\nSo apparently he ran away and got out through an open gate which I didn't even know existed. My sister came home and starting yelling to me about how he needs a leash on when he goes outside which she said she told me, but I don't recall.

Besides, it doesn't even look for everything.\"\n\nI told her that didn't make sense to me....if you had the chance of knowing your child would possibly have a life altering condition why *wouldn't* you want to know?

      "description": "So for some context, me and two other friends went to a music festival recently. Let’s say their names are Frank and John. I’ve known them for years but am much more closer to John despite knowing him for far shorter of a time than Frank.\n\nBefore the festival, we went out to eat and I made told my friends around the table that I did not want pictures of me taken. I was gonna roll pretty hard and did not want to have pictures of me taken. I have seen what bad images can do to a person’s career and as I am a freshman in college, I REALLY don’t want that to happen to me because a friend posted something bad on Instagram. They all say sure and we go along our day.\n\nWe get to the festival and everything’s going amazing until about 3/4 through the final act. I notice that Frank is taking pictures of me with the camera directly aimed at me. At this point, I sort of blow up. I grab his phone and immediately start to delete the pictures but there’s way to much of them and he shoves me and grabs his phone. John notices at this point and intervenes. I explain that Frank was taking pictures of me pretty whacked out and Frank denies it. When John asks to look through Frank’s phone, he refuses till John eventually just pins him down and forces him to show (John is a pretty big guy). After going through and deleting the photos and wiping the recently deleted folder, he holds on to Frank’s phone for the rest of the festival and I go back to dancing.\n\nWhile we were heading back to the parking lot, Frank stops and says that I should be nicer to him since he is driving us home. I should insert here that me and John each gave him more than enough money for gas and paid for parking. I am pretty high at this point and I just sort of stare in disbelief and tell Frank to stop being an asshole to which he proceeds to run ahead and lock himself in his car. John pulls out Frank’s phone and holds it hostage till he lets us both in and me and Frank argue all night with Frank saying I ruined his night by not letting him take photos of me in “optimal lighting” and me telling him how that should not be an issue because I did not want to be photographed. Haven’t talked to a Frank or John since then but apparently Frank is telling mutual friends that I ruin festivals and that I almost broke his phone. AITA?",

They live approximately the same distance away from me 5-7 hour drive depending on traffic,  rush hours,  etc.  They live in opposite directions.\nOne is financially successful and owns her own home.  She can text me an invite and for pretty much two tanks of gas roundtrip,  i can go visit.  I stay in her guest room.  She cooks meals or we decide to go out. She always has little day trips planned and its a  really refreshing trip at little cost to me.\nThe other daughter lives in someone elses home,  just has her own room.\nI have to get a hotel (large large American city),  so at minimum $150 or more a night for anything not scary.  She often expects me to buy her meals if we go out.  She waits for me to suggest any sort of activity.\nShe works but due to the cost of living its hard to get a place of her own.  \nI don't feel comfortable going to her house due to one of her roommates and i do not get along.  (Roomy is my age-ish and a piece of work).\nPlus there are dogs in the home and I'm allergic - start to sneeze and cough after 30-45 minutes even if the dog is confined,  just normal dog hair/dander on rugs, sofa sets me off.\nBear in mind,  i have only been to the first daughters' home once or twice a year for the past 3 years.\n\nMy husband and i used to see the second daughter at least twice a year - she lives near his hometown.\nHe has been too sick to travel the past two years so i feel bad going there without him.  \nHe has not ever gone to the first daughter's home since she moved 3 years ago.\nDaughter #2 has really ben complaining about my lack of visiting.  She comes here once a year,  stays with us,  etc.  \nSo AITA?\n",

      "description": "I’m getting a lot of mixed responses from people I know like the people agreeing with me are saying good she deserves it for assuming I was some sort of terrorist and some people said I went too far by swearing that vulgarly in front of her young son who was next to her.\n\nThe whole thing started when I’m sitting on an empty train with my bag on the floor between my legs and a little boy runs through the door in to the train and sits next to me. He ran in to the train because his mother didn’t follow him in the train immediately after for about 10 seconds. This is important because that means that she didn’t choose to sit next to me on this empty carriage but she just sat where her son sat.\n\nThe train is about to depart in 10 minutes and the woman is sitting next to her son who’s sitting next to me until she says “Sweetie,get away from there, it’s dangerous,sit over here”, I instantly shift my eyes across in the ‘what the fuck?’ kind of way and she notices and says again “I’m trying to protect my son, we don’t know what you are carrying or what you’re planning”.\n\nI still hadn’t said anything at that point but at this time I was squinting my eyes and and staring in confusion like what the fuck is wrong with you. About 15 seconds later, there is a normal train message that plays that says “If you see anything suspicious, report to the London Transport police”. She rolls her head to me as I can see in the corner of my eye since I’m just daydreaming straight ahead. I lost it.\n\nI shouted at her “Fuck off you stupid bitch” and I remember the kid being scared and having his mouth hanging open but I picked up my bag and went to the next carriage but before that and while passing her and her son, I then muttered “Cunt” which they both heard but I used awful language because I had been racially profiled and antagonised so AITA for the obscene language or not because I do think the language was too much especially in front of a child but the situation was very serious to me.",

      "description": "TL;DR: I can't bring myself to talk to my best friend after he waited until I was in a relationship and under the influence to finally tell me he had feelings for me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I should start this by saying that S and I have years of history; sometime in the last two we had a very serious falling out that was 100% my fault. This is the backstory of why I didn't share my feelings first: I didn't want to overstep my boundaries when still being in his life was already so generous\n\nSo fast forward to the last year. I've had feelings for him for awhile, and he's vaguely hinted at the idea of requiting them, though mostly in over-the-top idealization types of affection. I waited for him to be serious and tell me how he felt, but it never happened\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo enters P, S's new roommate, a guy I practically immediately hit it off with. S seems sullen about it, his usual energy diminished when I talk about P. I tried not to talk about P too much with him because of this, figuring it's annoying when *anyone* does nothing but talk about someone else, and maybe I was being inconsiderate\n\nThe last couple weeks, I realized I was falling in love with P, and it might be time to go steady. It was a conflicting choice, knowing it was time to give up on S for good, even though I wasn't completely over him yet. So I asked S straight if he thought there was any reason I shouldn't go steady with P. He said no, I should do it, he was happy for me. He was very sullen about it, saying he \"didn't feel well\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, we're going steady now, as of Friday. Saturday night I was home with my roommate, playing video games and drinking, and S messages me. I tell him it's great to hear from him, I want to spend time with him soon, and let him know I took his advice and P and I were dating now. He seems excited for me and I feel really good, happy with my decision and that my best friend supports me. It was a mstly off-track conversation that eventually landed on him saying something along the lines of \"Yeah, I'm just as shy as you, and you had a good reason to be hesitant with your crush on me\" (See the first paragraph) Which lead to me asking \"Why are we only talking about this now?\" and \"Why didn't you say anything when I asked?\"\n\nHe essentially told me he didn't say anything because I was too good for him, I deserved better than him, and P is \"a real man's man\" (S is on the genderfluid spectrum, which has never once inhibited my feelings for him) I essentially blew up, crying and drunk, told him that \"what I deserve\" isn't up to him, it's up to me, that if he had said this any other day before today (the day after I finally started a relationship) I could have talked him out of feeling that way. I accused him of prioritizing punishing himself over my feelings. He agreed\n\nAnd then we agreed that none of it matters anymore, and he said he was sorry. And I haven't spoken to him since\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not reaching out and resolving this?",

      "description": "I've been waiting for him to come for dinner all night and holding my pee to get a good reading - he stopped at the store to get foodstuffs and asked if I needed anything.  I told him I need a pregnancy test, I have felt nauseas and exhausted today and am now 5 days late.  I'm not feeling up to driving, if he didn't come tonight I would have asked a friend to help me get it\n\nWell he says sure and that he knows it'll all be okay no matter what and he loves me.  I send him a picture of the pregnancy test I want.  I've seen it well stocked at this store.\n\nBy the time he walks in to my house I've been holding my pee for a long time to get a good reading on the test.  I'm bursting at the seams and rush toward him to get the test from the bag.  WHERE IS IT!!  I look at him.  He's eating at my table. \"Oh yeah I didn't get it.\"  What?  He has no answer.  Now I tell him we have got to go right now.  We get in his car.\n\nI am squirming and uncomfortable in addition to the nausea.  We get in the store and I grab it.  We get to the register.  It's our turn and he turns to me and I just look at him and he goes \"oh do you need me to get it?  You really need me to?\"  Yes I do.  I want to be taken care of in this moment and he's already let me down.  I don't want to fumble for money while doing the pee dance\n\nHe scoffs and shrugs his shoulders at the cashier and makes a mocking laugh.  Then he turns to stare at me as though to stare me down\n\nNow we get home and I take it and he acts like nothing unusual has happened.  I am pissed.  Background I have paid for tons of things like groceries when we stop by the store together to decide what to cook, picked up his dog and paid the groomer, never brought up the charge just dropped it to not cause conflict, etc etc and out of the two of us he's done far less than me.  We have dated now 7 months exclusively and have started to get to know one another's families.\n\nI wouldn't have asked him to pay me back for this had I got it on my own but I really don't like how he acted.  He's 39 years old and employed and owns his house.   He made me feel exactly like if I am pregnant I am taking care of this baby all on my own.  I'm raging.\n\nAnd the test was hard to read.  Doctor Monday.  I hope I am not pregnant I would love to be finished with him.",

      "description": "TLDR; my boyfriend accidentally (?) found out my family (and I, by extension) was richer than he thought, I made a comment that didn't help. He got mad/ dejected/ gloomy (?) and I got defensive. AITA?\n\nMy family is comfortable funding my 4 years of overseas university education. The university I'm applying to requires proof of finances for foreign students, usually a letter from the bank stating that my parent has x amount with the bank and can afford my education. \n\nI usually keep these documents at home as I'm scared of losing it but I accidentally brought it to school. I took out that file, opened it, realised it was the wrong file, promptly closed it and put it back in my bag. My boyfriend who was beside me noticed the distinct header of the bank's letter head and asked me what that was. I absent mindedly said \"ah just some letter from the bank for uni apps\". \n\nHe asked to see it, and I realised what he would be seeing, so I hesitated a bit. He picked up on it and jokingly asked if it's a love letter from some other guy (no malicious intent, it's a running joke). I roll my eyes and hand him the folder and tell him to be careful with it, I need it for applications etc. He looked over it, saw the amount listed in the account and commented something like \"wow that's alot\". Now, I knew my family was comfortable, but I didn't realise we had this much. I was also shocked by that amount when I first saw the letter. \n\nSo in an effort to be comforting/relatable(?) I said \"i know right?\" like I was also surprised by that amount. He didn't take well to that, and his mood changed noticeably. I asked him if he's okay, and he said I didn't have to rub it in his face. I got a bit embarrased and annoyed, because I didn't mean for anyone to see those documents, and I tried to back track. He didn't try to communicate anything to me but sit there and gloom with a cloud over his head. I got a bit defensive and told him he asked to see the document in the first place, and what was he expecting anyways? We ignored each other for a while then swept everything under the carpet and pretended it didn't happen (benefits of a HS rs lel). But it's still bugging me. \n\n Context re bf: his family situation isn't as stable as mine, but for the rs to work out we agreed really early on to go on dates both of us can afford, and I try not to be an obnoxious bitch about where we can/ cannot go. I have no qualms compromising, and I'm happy with things as they are. I avoid bringing up money as I can sense he feels uncomfortable about it \n\n",

Me and him added each other on Discord and occasionally sent memes. \n\nHe then invited me over and the night ended with his arm around me. \n\nWe've hung out more. Since then, we've done everything a couple does (like kiss, hold hands, sex, etc etc). But he kept insisting that I wasn't his girlfriend. I brushed that off, but it did hurt a bit. My friends insisted I need to have a talk with him. \n\nHe hung out with my friends too a lot with me around (important for later). \n\nHe also took care of me while I was sick, bringing me food and such. \n\nHe also got jealous easily, even though he wasn't my boyfriend. \n\nYesterday, he went out to the hall and didn't close the door properly. He saw the girl he first had a thing for. \n\nExcerpt: \n\nHer- \"You're with your girlfriend??\" \n\nHim- \"Nah, she ain't my girl.\" \n\nWhen he back back, I was quiet and so was he for a half hour while I asked two friends through messaging what do I do.

He said not to call myself a convenient option, bc it's insulting to me and him (I don't get how it was insulting to him). \n\nI said I felt convenient because of how easy it was to come over and hang out and have sex with me. He said that I was the one who most of the time wanted sex, though. Halfway he also asked he won't be on my friends bad side right, which caught me off guard and confused. \n\nHe also said something along the lines of, \"I'm sorry you feel this way...\"\n\nI said I want a couple days off. He said I know where to reach him, collected his things, and went to the door. It was quiet. \n\nI called out, \"Next time you say someone isn't your girl, make sure the door is closed.\" And then he seemed like he wanted to cry after? \n\nHe said, \"I wanted it casual so nobody got hurt.\" And I responded look at us now. \n\nMy friend came over after he left to comfort me. He forgot his keys and wallet and had to come back. My friend kept giving him a death glare when he came for his things and left again. \n\nSince then, he's unadded me on everything basically, which confuses me because he said I know how to reach him. \n\nAITA for how I handled this?

I'm throwing this up before I head out for the day but if anyone responds, I'll try to check in when we take breaks. \n\nSome background, I come from a large family on my mom's side and have over 20 cousins with a huge age span. My oldest cousin \"Billy\" was my absolute favorite growing up. He's 8 years older than me and he was so playful and sweet that when I was about 10 and he was 18, I literally had the biggest crush on him a girl could have. I not only thought he was the most gorgeous boy ever, he would wrestle me, chase me around, take me to movies and let me drive his car. Of course as I got older the crush faded but I still think he's one of the coolest people I've ever met (for reference we are 25 and 33 now). \n\n\n5 years ago Billy married \"Jan.\" For the life of my I will never understand why. I don't know what her deal but if I had to guess I'm thinking something like BPD with a severe dose of narcissism coupled with extreme insecurity. She is loud, she is boisterous, she offers unsolicited opinions on everything from politics to how it's impossible and unhealthy to lose weight. She claims to be a ballet champion but can barely walk up stairs and the last time I saw her, we got in a huge fight because she wouldn't shut up about how bad marathon training was for me. She doesn't get along with anyone from my family, so more often than not Billy no longer attends our family functions. \n\n\nSo I was so excited when I found out Billy was coming to our annual ski trip in Durango. Last night was the first night where everyone was together so my dad hosted a huge spaghetti dinner in his condo. Jan was awful to Billy, she made fun of him, she told him to shut up more times than count and for lack of a better term she was very emasculating. I was sitting across from them and Jan and made some \"joke\" about Billy being incompetent and impotent. I wasn't even really thinking so I said something like \"I thought Billy was the hottest thing I'd ever seen until I was like 15 years old.\" I honestly was just trying to make him feel a little better but Jan just stared daggers at me for the rest of the dinner (only about 10 minutes max). \n\nJan left and apparently she complained to everyone on the walk back to their area of condos that I had intentionally tried to start a fight with her, that I was some sort of pervert and that I need to learn how to keep my mouth shut or it's going to be the marathon fight all over again. \n\nBut what stumps me...is now everyone is mad at me. My aunt and cousin (Billy's mom and sister) said that I shouldn't have started a fight with her while telling me what she said on the walk. When I explained my side they said basically \"look we know how Jan is, we just have to go along to get along in order to see Billy, please just apologize to her.\" I told them I would think about it. Last night 4 more of my cousins texted me and all said along the lines of \"please just play nice, Jan is threatening to leave\" \n\n\nThis there was a big family breakfast and I could just tell that all 30+ adults present were expecting me to apologize to her. Jan was huffing around, slamming dishes, acting smug and silent and in my head I was like...fuck I'm just happy to not hear her voice. So I said nothing to her. \n\nThey left first and almost every adult there came up to me and asked me to please make the peace for the good of the family. I'm literally putting on my boots as I type this and since Jan can't/won't ski I wont see her all day so I have time to ponder what I should I do. \n\nTo help me with my decision...am I the asshole for what I said?\n\nedit: throwaway account. \n",

      "description": "I'm in my early 30s and my friend of over 10 yrs is 10 yrs my senior. The entire time I've know him he's had problems keeping a job. Mostly quiting due to child support catching up to him and garnishing his wages or just because he doesn't feel like working anymore. \n\nOne day he explains how he salty his landlord told them 3 days after paying rent that he wasn't renewing their lease and they basically had 30 days to leave. Hes like \"well he gonna have to take us to court etc etc cause he didn't give us time\" and  all this other BS.\n\nLong story short he asked if they could live with me till they find something. My first mind said fuck no, because if you were working you and your GF, who has 2 jobs, could afford to move in 30 days....but the good in me said ok. \n\nIn the meantime, I purchased a townhouse and didn't tell them. I've since rented it to strangers. AITA for not giving them an option to rent? \n\nAlso a little background on the GF..she's had the same job for yrs but is financially irresponsible. Has one daughter old enough to work and still relies on her parents to take her grocery shopping and put gas in her car at the age of 45. \n\nShes the type that has WiFi and cable but no car insurance even though she's been in multiple, car totaling accidents. The type that has a broken tooth and dental insurance but says she can't afford the copay to get the tooth pulled or remedied. \n\nAlso, they were supposed to be out of their place the end of October. Stayed through November and the landlord told them be out by 25th or I'm filling eviction papers. They stayed even though they already had the ok to live with me . Who gets an eviction on their records to be spiteful to someone else?\n\nLastly, when it was a possibility I would buy this home he'd said him and his GF would rent and I told him why I was uncomfortable with that option.

      "description": "**TL;DR – My friends are whispering and giggling while looking directly at me but refuse to tell me anything when I ask what's so funny.**\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n\nI'm 14F and as are the involved parties - Sally, Daisy, and Emily. This should probably explain why the situation is so petty and weird.\n\n\n\nEssentially, my group of friends and I are navigating an awkward time right now. Sally was caught up in some sort of weird drama concerning one of our mutual friends, Sean (14M), developing a crush on her. Somehow, she found out (not sure how/why) and everything imploded. She and Daisy, who is involved for goodness knows what reason, because she won't tell me how exactly she got wrapped up in it. Emily is privy to this as she witnessed Sean admit this – otherwise, she says, she wouldn't be part of any of it.\n\n\nSince last week, Sally and Daisy have been having whispered conversations and sharing knowing looks while in group settings. Later, I noticed that Sally seemed perturbed so I asked her if everything was okay since I was concerned, and she brushed me off with, \"Nothing, nothing, it's fine.\"\n\n\nI got extremely stressed; I have anxiety issues following an elementary school bully targeting me for something like 4 years and taking my friends by pulling them to the side and badmouthing me. The bully would often do this literally as I stood in front of her, so needless to say, whispered conversations make me panic. I mentioned this to them and they said, \"Yeah, okay, we won't,\" but continued to do it. Now, Emily was one of my few friends in elementary, and she was a victim of this same bully, so she can corroborate this. However, Sally and Daisy are new to the school but have both dealt with similar exclusion-based bullying.\n\n\nSally pulled me aside one day after I had a minor panic attack in the middle of class and told me the thing about Sean. She said that she didn't feel comfortable and was embarrassed of telling me, which kinda stung because I've told her embarrassing secrets of many kinds – she knows my secret crush even after I was in denial about liking him, she knows which guys in the class like me, she knows all my triggers and weird anxiety tics, etc. And she's told me many a secret herself, so I was confused as to why Sally didn't divulge this one until she informed me that Sean asked her and Daisy to keep it to themselves. I was okay after and guilty because I knew something I shouldn't have and forced her to tell me. I believe I'm the asshole in this situation.\n\n\nThe next day, however, she and Daisy were having whispered conversations again, but they were giggling and looking at me as they spoke. If they'd been serious I wouldn't have minded since I knew it was personal and didn't want to get caught in the mess. I asked what the joke was, and Sally immediately arranged her features into an expressionless board, but when she thought I looked away she and Daisy grinned at each other. I quelled my own fears by reminding myself that they were my *friends*, not my enemies. But they did this over and over and over throughout the day to the point where I had another panic attack and asked them what was so funny. Again: \"Nothing, it's not about you, it's nothing!\" She was cold and distant the rest of the day, but normal with Emily and Daisy.\n\n\nLater on that same day, Sally was shifting her laptop screen away from me and casting furtive glances my way while showing Emily and Daisy something that they both found humorous. When she turned it back my way, I saw something written on her screen: \"the girls are not getting along, spread the word.\" Keep in mind that she'd avoided me all day long, as had Daisy.\n\n\nI nearly jumped out of my skin. She saw my face and quickly said, \"It's not about us! It's the kids below us.\" But Sally's a bad liar, and she looked incredibly shifty and guilty as she told me this. So again, I had a panic attack but shifted my attention to another friend beside me.\n\n\nLater that evening, I was bombarded with all manner of texts and phone calls from Sally and Daisy, but I was hurt so I didn't answer. I needed time and space before I could deal with this. Another close friend, Anna (14F) intervened and said there'd been a miscommunication and made me talk to them because we were best friends. We all video called, and Daisy refused to show her face, instead choosing to send messages through Sally, who read the texts aloud. Daisy claimed that she had avoided me when I had ignored her earlier that day when she informed me it was her friend's death anniversary. I was shocked as I did not remember her saying a word to me besides \"Hey,\" \"What's up,\" and \"Cool,\" because she was busy walking ahead of me and shooting sneers at me the moment I walked into class. She was also slightly better towards the end of the day, and she's confirmed to be a huge liar - she's previously lied about having met one of the girls that bullied Emily and I, but when the same girl reached out to me randomly, she didn't recall meeting or even knowing of Daisy despite the fact that their ostensible meeting had taken place less than two days ago.\n\n\nAfter the call, I assumed it would all be okay. However, when I went to school the next day, Sally literally refused to look at or speak to me, despite us having hashed it out and agreeing to talk about it later at school. I guessed she needed space so I left her alone until the time came for us to discuss it further. When we did, she got super defensive and claimed to have told me she didn't want to talk about it when all she did was brief me on the basics and tell me she'd been too embarrassed to talk about it. I addressed the \"girls are not getting along\" thing and she said in this extremely snappy voice, \"That was never about you, I told you it was about the girls below us!\" And when Emily spoke up and asked her to talk to me properly as she felt I was being excluded, Sally just looked daggers at her but agreed. So I asked about the giggling whispers, the shifted screens, the avoidance, etc. Neither she nor Daisy had any explanations but they did exchange several, overt annoyed glances. They then didn't deign to *look* at me, but Emily was being nice as per usual. They're not talking to me and whenever I would message on the group chat, they'd never reply despite being online. It's been two days and they're still not speaking to me. They continue to whisper and sneer and Emily is still pleasant.\n\n\n",

      "description": "Alright, my co-worker and I really disagree on this. I was traveling for work recently and decided to go to Starbucks before a meeting. Unfortunately, the city must have a lenient policy for homeless folks camping out at coffee shops.\n\nWhen I went in, I was overwhelmed by the odor coming from a few homeless guys who’ve camped out at a booth. Two of them must have panhandled to get enough money for a couple cups of drip coffee. They were sitting in the booth with no intention of leaving, and one guy was even fast asleep. They reeked really badly, like they were showering in their own urine for the past decade or something. All the other customers hurried past these guys and no one wanted to sit in the store because the stench was so awful. And the baristas didn’t say a word to these guys.\n\nAfter I left, I called the store to speak to the store manager. I complained about the mistreatment of other customers by subjecting us to the reek from these homeless guys. I also told her it’s abusive to the baristas because they can’t leave and are subjected to poor working conditions due to the toxic plume emanating these homeless coffee shop campers. The manager promised she’ll look into it, even though I’m sure she won’t. To hold her accountable, I told her I’ll be back soon for another work trip and hope she will have taken the appropriate steps to address this problem. I also told her I’ll leave a Yelp review with everything I’ve discussed with her, and post a follow-up review when I return. \n\nI told my co-worker this who disagreed with me. She said I should have left those guys alone because they probably needed temporary shelter from the elements or it wasn’t safe for them to sleep on the streets. I told her what they needed was probably homeless shelter services, mental health and substance abuse providers, legal aid, and a whole bunch of social services - but Starbucks isn’t one of them. I’ve been to spin classes where the instructor would remind people to wear deodorants and speak with people with bad BO. We shouldn’t excuse or tolerate bad BO at a Starbucks simply because these guys happen to be homeless. I mean, really.",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I were together for about 5 months when out of nowhere he started constantly giving me dirty looks and calling me all the horrible names under the sun, cunt, bitch, dick, you get the gist. Because I have a history of abuse I am extremely non confrontational and so said nothing, just waiting for him to break up with me. Eventually, he does, and I'm far far happier and carry on with my life not really missing him. About a month later I get a text at 3am saying \"so we back together now?\". I was confused and slightly frustrated. I said no. Big mistake, apparently. He said that everything he'd done in the last week of us being together was because of his depression and his extremely mild autism. I still said no. I said that if he is going to treat me the way he did that he needs to understand that I will not just accept his apology and get back with him. (Note: just realised he never actually apologized for anything). Because of this, he gets mad, and I mean MAD. He, once again, calls me every name under the sun, tries to turn my friends against me through blackmail, and tries to physically injure one of the friends that tries to defend me. Now, the thing is, we pretty much have all the same friends, so it is a little awkward. He hurts no one but himself, and, realising that he has lost, plays the victim card. I am apparently a manipulative whore who drove him to almost commit suicide and I can kill myself because I don't deserve any of what I have. Because I said no.",

      "title": "AITA for not asking my GF if she’s ok?",
      "description": "Throwaway account. Apologies for format since I’m also on mobile.\n\nMe and my GF have had a dog for the past year and a half. Last year I took him for all his medical visits but it was always a pain to get things done since my free time is so limited due to work (I’m gone from 7am to 6:30pm). I took him to our vet here in our area which always went fine imo. Last year she was concerned he had kettle cough (couldn’t since he had his vaccinations, but she didn’t know at the time) and called a veterinarian that was 17 miles away.  Since they gave her sound advice on how to deal with it instead of asking her to come in and spend money, she prefers we send our dog there since “they’re not doing it for the money.” It’s out of the way tbh but who can argue with that logic? \n\nFast forward this past week and our dog has been overdue to be vaccinated. She agrees to take him herself to the vet that is far from us. I originally set the appointment for today at 6pm. Just yesterday she tells me that’s too late for her. I called the vet this morning and managed to get it moved.\n\nThis morning I tell her that I nabbed a spot at 3:30pm instead of the 3pm as she wanted. The conversation goes as is with her replying:\n\n“I can’t I’m going to see a doctor myself first”\n“You just made the appointment?”\n“No. It’s a walk in. Did you read what I fucking said? Christ. I tell you I’m in need of a doctor and you’re talking about an appointment. Forget I said anything.”\n“The reason I’m asking is because my next question would’ve been, why didn’t you tell me? I could’ve scheduled the baby’s appointment to another day. Imagine if had said nothing, obviously I would’ve.”\n“Just disregard that my ear is dripping fluid and I got a bulge in my throat.”\n\nIn her defense, she has been sick for the past two weeks. Just last week I told her to see the doctor, even as going as far as trying to make her an account for her health insurance so she can see providers in our area. Unfortunately I couldn’t, but I did tell her to call the number on the back of the card. Her insurance has also been acting funny according to her. \n\n“I’m not mad that you’re going. If anything, yeah, please go take care of that.”\n“You know what I don’t need your shitty support .”\n“Just a notice would’ve been nice.”\n\nIt all boiled down to the fact that instead of asking her is she’s ok as soon as she told me she was going to the doctor, I instead asked about the appointment. As soon as I asked her she had gotten off the phone with the  doctor telling her to come in immediately after she was freaking out about fluid coming out of her ear. I did tell her I thought you made an appointment for a check up since all she didn’t give much detail initially.\n\nShe says “I can’t fucking give you a notice if I’m panicking that there’s shit coming out of my ear. Didn’t fucking think of a stupid notice.”\n\nAITA for not asking her immediately if she’s ok when she told me she’s going to the doctor’s?",

      "description": "Throwaway because said sister follows my main.\n\nMy sister has a poor body image due to strict upbringing, her BMI is in the healthy range but she skips regular meals a lot, especially after eating snacks in order to “compensate” for the consumed calories.\n\nI try to get her to stop eating junk food whenever she does so she wouldn’t feel guilty and skip meals afterwards, but she would get upset and claim I’m fat shaming her. She thinks people stopping her from occasionally indulging (like my parents and I) is why she has body image issues. Because of how often her feelings on her body image fluctuates, she thinks I should just support her and let her eat whatever she wants whenever she feels like it.\n\nThis has been ongoing for the majority of her high school and college years. Again, she doesn't think she has a disorder since she's just watching her calorie intake. AITA for policing her and making a girl with self esteem problems already feel like crap? She has no health problems right now but I'm worried about this lifestyle turning a bigger problem in the future.",

      "description": "Background: my great grandfather was a Colonel in the marines during WWII and Korea and beyond. When he was enlisted in WWII he recieved the Congressional Medal of Honor during the battle of Iwo Jima. Care of the actual medal and most of his stuff has fallen to me. \n\nMy younger 2nd cousin (now 12) loves military stuff. When he was younger I allowed him to play with my grandpas flight helmet (grandpa became a fighter pilot between WWII and Korea) and he destroyed it. Part of it was my fault but also certainly my cousin's (his mom) as well because she didn't abide by my terms when I agreed to let him borrow it.\n\nEarly last year my 2nd cousin started asking for all of grandpas uniforms and medals. I initially sort of deflected but he got more and more demanding and I was so annoyed I decided I just didn't want to deal with it anymore and I donated everything to my grandpa's hometowns hall of honor. They were thrilled with the donation and are in the process of creating a permanent display featuring the Medal of Honor, his uniforms and flight suits. I figure it's a much better use then all the stuff being in my closet.\n\nFamily to a person is pissed at me. They think it all should have stayed in the family and that I was a jerk to assume my 2nd cousin woukd have treated the stuff the same at 12 as he did the flight helmet when he was 6. \n\nI honestly don't know, am I the asshole here?
