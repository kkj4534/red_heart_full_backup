      "description": "I don’t know why it’s taken me so long to post on this sub-reddit.  \nMy best former friend of 22 years had gotten pretty heavily into drugs. One of her friends (and dealer) had just OD’d and died about a month before me coming clean to her family. Up until this point in university she had done drugs since high school and had used LSD, ACID, Mushrooms, MDMA, weed, cocaine and some other hallucinogens. I never shared her secret because she meant and still means the whole world to me. I loved her, she was my sister. I would do anything for her. I was always there for her when she would have a bad episode after using MDMA and would be crying about her emotionally abusive boyfriend. I was there all the time despite being so overwhelmed by my own life.  \nI was never afraid for her safety, I believed she had good judgement and she was smart. She was active and university and active in student groups.  \nThis trust I had all started to crumble after her friend died. She encouraged him to use that night, and they used the same drugs. The next day he didn’t wake up and was found on the floor of his room with foam in his mouth. AFTER this event she visited home and was so visibly shaken and messed up even my dad noticed something was wrong.   \nI made her PROMISE not to use drugs for a week so she could recalibrate. She didn’t listen at all. The straw that broke my back was when she told me she wanted to smoke heroin because she heard it is less addicting and her *now deceased friend* used heroin and said it was safe. I fell physically ill and was just crying all night literally afraid she was going to die.  \nI started the “truth telling” by telling my own parents first. My dad then went to speak to her mom because it was too hard for me. Then her parents came to the house and I explained everything.  \nOnce she found out I had told them she called me the next day screaming and telling me to tell them it was not a big deal and she was fine. She proceeded to tell her mom she only bought drugs from *deceased friend* because he knew how to use drugs safely and trusted him (friend that OD’d). This was her entire argument: I use drugs safely. After that day she hadn’t spoken to me. It’s been 3 years. I think about her every single day. So many times I wanted to share moments in my life with her but couldn’t because I have been blocked on all social media.  \nYou have to understand that I kept it all a secret for 8 years. I never shared with anyone anything at all.  \nThe only reason I said ANYTHING was because I truly believed she was going to die, just like her friend.  \nIt hurts to think she doesn’t care about me at all, or know me at all to think I did this out of spite. I wish I just meant a bit more.  \nI guess after 3 years I’m still dealing closure, I regret trying to save her or help her. I feel I made a mistake.  \nI just want to know did I do the right thing? Or AITA? ",

      "description": "There is a kid in my law class that is incredibly disruptive and goes on irrelevant tangents all the time. The teacher is awesome and she has way to much experience to be working at a CC but she enjoys helping kids out. Anyway this douchlord that sits in front of me never shuts the fuck up. He is always derailing the conversation, talks even when it's not our turn to talk as students, doesn't get the hint no one else is interested, rambles and derails the class for minutes on end. The teacher has hinted at him to stop gently several times but he just doesn't get the hint, which leads me to think he is either oblivious, doesn't care and just likes hearing himself talk or is autistic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday he was going off on another rant and the teacher corrected him, he got snobby and said he would google it. So he got out his phone and googled a situational situation and gloated about how he was right. He didn't understand that the teacher was correct (not only because of her law degree and decades in the field but because it is situational and he searched for bias results).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally snapped and told him to \"shut up you're just a kid at a community college, she has a law degree and worked for the state for over 30 years. She knows more about this then anyone else in the room, if you weren't so busy trying to hear yourself speak you might actually learn something\". The teacher told us to calm down and she moved the class on, admittedly a little awkwardly. After class she told me she appreciated the gesture but that I should try to be more understanding of opposing opinions. I asked her if he was autistic and she said she wasn't 100% sure but she suspected he was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I feel a little bad about it because if he couldn't take social cues it wasn't really his fault and I basically embarrassed him front of the class and belittled him. My friend that was in the class also told me I was to harsh on him even though she agrees that he is obnoxious and disruptive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I apologize or would that just encourage him in the future? This happened a few days ago and he has been a lot more reserved. Honestly I'm really enjoying the silence. ",

      "description": "I (f23) just reported my ex(m21) for using and selling mushrooms. We broke up a year ago and have a child. He does not pay support and owes me thousands in backpay. He recently moved hours away without telling me, leaving me solely responsible for our son. I found out hes been selling mushrooms and using them almost every day for the past few months. We recently got into a fight and he got physically violent with me, again. That was the first time I called the police and I actually ended up being arrested for disorderly conduct(his and his girlfriend's word vs. Mine) \n\nHonestly, I probably wouldnt have reported him if we were on good terms. But they have basically taken over his life and he does absolutely nothing for our son and doesnt even ask about him. I'm honestly just worried that hes not going to be able to pay his child support (300/month) which I need as I am a single mother and I'm really struggling to keep the bills paid and get my vehicle fixed. He has a clean record so I feel kind of bad that a charge like this could essentially ruin his life, but I let him get away with alot of shit and hes really screwed me over. Am I a vengeful bitch or did I do the right thing?",

      "description": "First of all, i was told there was a wedding and if id like to be a best man. Days later I got a call saying itll only be for family so nvm on the invite. Then a few more days come by and was asked if I can be the wedding photographer. Yeah it was okay that i wasnt gonna be a best man because he had other friends he knew from childhood.  No big deal, but still kinda felt a way. So i think yeah sure. I was iffy since i went from being invited to being asked to be the photographer. He offered $100 (i dont do weddings nor do any gigs, just hobby. But I'm pretty decent) and I agreed. I know i should have offered to do it for free as a gift but it was a job. I was there for a reason and not to be guest just casually taking pics.  Fast forward to now. I got a thank you from him and no mention of the money. I already promised someone close to me the money i was gonna make and not sure what to tell them. I had a good 350 pics edited out of 1000 that took me a while since my computer has 8gb ram. Plenty of hours lost in troubleshooting and forgetting how to edit properly. So am I the asshole for expecting at least a little bit of it? Idk if I wanna ask him about the payment, i might seem like an asshole. Looks like he's expecting it to be free. \n\nTLDR; Did a wedding shoot for money but payment is unsure after the fact. Want to know if i should ask for the money or am i an asshole for wanting to know if ill be paid for it ",

      "description": "My sister cannot do her own grocery shopping because she’s bariatric and, though she can walk and has been going into small stores for herself, she cannot handle walking through a big store (e.g. Walmart, WinCo, etc...). And she won’t use the scootie carts because she thinks she’ll end up on people of Walmart. \n\nSo every month, when she gets her food stamps, I go and do her grocery shopping for her. I do smaller “Walmart runs” for her throughout the month, too, as well as getting her meds from the pharmacy since you have to go inside. \n\nLast month, she had no money for groceries because their February disbursement came early due to the gov shutdown, and she asked if I could lend her $20 for groceries. I said how about $40 and she can just pay me back half? She said great! Well, when we got to the store, she handed me the shopping list and I knew it was going well above $40. I told her that, but she said she didn’t think so and she needed everything on the list (it was all staples like tortillas, beans (bro in law is Mexican), sugar, bread, coffee, etc...). I said okay, I’d try to squeeze everything in if I go generic on everything. She said that’s fine.\n\nWell, I only made it halfway through the list when I hit the $40 limit. She still had a lot left, so I thought fuck it, I know they need it, so I’ll go ahead and get the rest. I ended up spending almost $20 extra (total came to $57.86). When I got to the car, I handed her the receipt and told her it went over the budget by about $20. I said if she can pay me back $25 when she can then I’ll call it good. \n\nThat was over a month ago and I haven’t seen the $25 dollars. Normally I’d be like oh well, I’m never going to see it again. The only reason I’m not willing to let this go is she spends at least $30/week on cigarettes and I’ve went with her to the dispensary a few times since where she’s spent $20-$30 each trip. I know they don’t have any “extra” money to be able to pay me back, but the way I see it, if she can afford that much in smokes and weed, she can pay me back that $25.\n\nSo I’ve been thinking about saying, “I won’t do your grocery shopping next month if you don’t repay that $25.” I feel really bad and know it will cause drama, but I’m flat broke (ft college student living on financial aid) and that’s a week of groceries and a box of litter for my cat and I could really use it. \n\nWIBTA??",

      "description": "\nBackstory- First, I come from a place where engagements are fairly short, so about 5 months or less normally. Second, my brother, my sister, and I are all engaged. My brother is getting married at the end of April, and my sister is getting married the week following. I’m getting married in May.\nAfter my sister gets married she is going to X country with her husband who’s doing summer sales.\n \nWhen FH and I got engaged, we told our parents which day we were planning on. FILs said that was fine for them and are excited. My mom was willing to work around her schedule and travel across the world, and my dad and step-mom (SM) said, “if you’re sure, then we’ll plan for that day”.  \nSM said that she and dad wanted to pay for the reception venue, part of the photos, decorations, flowers, and the reception food. I told them that I would be happy having the reception in our church, which would be free, and that FH and I could pay for other things and be thrifty to cut down on costs (I don’t want anything over the top; a wedding doesnt have to be expensive for it to be nice). SM said that they were doing it for the other kids, so they were going to do it for me too. She booked the venue. \n \nFast forward 2 weeks to when I book the church for the ceremony. I texted everyone to tell them what time and day I had booked it for, which was the agreed upon day in May. I didn’t get much response from SM and Dad except for an “ok”. 9 hours after I had sent the first text, I get a text asking me if I could change our wedding day. \nSM told me she wasn’t sure Dad could get the days off (he had already said he would), so I texted him to confirm that he would be able to get our wedding day off. He said of course, I told SM who then said “you didn’t consult with us on the date, and we have two other weddings in April plus a grad in June. You should move the wedding back to June because it would be better for us. Since you didn’t consult with us, your sister can’t be at the wedding. If you move your wedding she’d be there.” I told SM that we had consulted with them, and that if they were going to struggle with the costs of the wedding, we would move to the FREE church, and we would pay for the decorations ourselves, and FILs were ok with paying for flowers and reception food. She refused. \nSM said that it was unfair to our extended family who HAVE /s to buy gifts for us because all our weddings are close together. Most of the things on our registry are around $20 or less with a few bigger things around $50. \n \nIn the end we decided not to change our date, and that has caused tension between my parents and us. I’m curious as to whether IATA in this situation or not, because I think about it a lot. Thanks. \n \nTl;dr\nMy dad and Stepmom approved our wedding date, but when I booked the ceremony venue I was told I needed to change it because of sister and other family issues. We decided not to change our date and I am now wondering AITA",

      "description": "Ok so i have been with my SO for years. We were chillen at a house party when BIL and his girl are being obnoxiously affectionate (ass grabbind,kissing ect). I tend to ignor that because i just find it weird to do infornt of people. \n So we sat down to watch the game, everyone's buzzed and full when SIL taps my shoulder.  \"Hey are you guys together\"\n\nMe-Of course I am why?\n\n SIL \"Well it seems like you guys are just friends like you guys are together for like other reasons so she's like you guys don't seem like lovers you guys seem more like gay friends who live together to tell people to not hit on you guys.\"\n\nI'm already buzzed and I just started laughing \"like what do you mean why would you think that?\"\n\nSIL- well you guys are so unaffectionate. I've never even seen you guys hold hands,no kisses or anything? like how can you say you love each other?\nI was gone laughing \"okay yeah I guess we're in gay and lesbian lovers. \" I can't make it fun of the statement and laughing elaborating saying we must never touch each other and must have never hold hands it's so inappropriate for roommates.\n SO look back at me and BIL looks very awkward/ slightly embarrassed. \nBIL chimed in saying SO never been the kind of person who shows a lot of affection in public it's just not something that he does. I can see that my Asos visibly upset but I couldn't take it seriously at the moment because in my mind she had to be joking. Couldn't be a serious statement just because you don't see someone's sexual behaviors doesn't mean they don't love somebody. \nWhen we git home SO confronting me. saying he couldn't believe what happened and it was very offensive. But I told him that there was no reason for him to worry about that that other people's opinions don't really matter and we know what we mean to each other. \n\nI told my best friend about it and she got mad at me for saying that I should have stood up for him and our relationship but I really can't see it as a serious moment. Am i in the wrong?",

(or what do you think?)\n\nwell now as dumb as it's sounds I feel bad for it. I think I should've just hide my feelings until they fade or something because maybe it won't get to the point of comfortableness(?) it was before and I'm blaming myself for that.\n\nalthough I have a reason why I said it to her. this isn't the first \"only girl besides me\" and most of the time I started to have feelings for one of them and every time I wasn't able to hide it good and they found out in the end.\n\nmaybe it is a shitpost but I'm really in a crisis right now and can't find a way out.

      "description": "I don't know if I'm overreacting and being a bitch or if he's the one in the wrong. Last February I was studying abroad and met this guy on Tinder. We started dating (I know, bad idea), but it was never truly defined as dating. We went on dates, hooked up, and I crashed at his place often. We kind of mutually agreed that we weren't gonna see anyone else while I was still there.\n\nSummer comes and I move back to America. Him and I are still talking almost daily and then he says he's going to visit America just for me! I am so excited and I could tell he was too. I see him in October and things are near perfect - we tour two big cities together. He insists on putting his arm around me, holding my hand, and kissing me in public. We went to a club together and he couldn't take his eyes off of me the entire time. We have such a romantic time together that he says he'll come back and visit me again soon.\n\nHe's doing a 7 month worldwide travel tour, so he's currently in South America. He was planning on coming to see me for Christmas - New Years since it's too far to fly back to his home country in Europe and I was going to be alone (I do not have any family and am in my last year of undergrad). Holidays are a pretty big deal in my mind, so I figured that plus coming to America for me meant he liked me a lot. He called me soon after his visit in October and told me that he was considering moving to America for ME. I was unsure how I felt about it since we only knew each other not even a year, but I also understood it as him really being into me. We are also planning a trip together in Asia for my spring break. His entire family follows me on social media and even chat with me occasionally and he's ok with it.\n\nWell I just learned today because he casually told me that he was dating a girl in South America, where he is living for a month doing a brief job. I had deleted Tinder and was not open to looking for other guys just because I thought that's the direction our relationship was heading. He says this girl is just for fun and that after he leaves South America, he'll never see her again. He says she is not like me, whom he wants to keep seeing.\n\nWe never agreed to be bf/gf, but I thought we had an unspoken agreement that we wouldn't see other people. He says he is sorry for hurting me and I told him \"Whatever, you're free to fuck whomever you want.\"\n\nI know it was rushed, but I was honestly really falling for this guy and I know he was falling for me. Now I just feel like one of the silly girls he sees in different countries even though he still continues to insist I'm more.\n\nDo I have this right to be upset that he's seeing other girls? Am I being overly clingy? Am I being a petty asshole for wanting to tell him not to come see me during the holidays?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Background information: I'm 21 and he's 28. We’ve been dating for a little over three months and things have been going well. Since we’ve started dating, we’ve split everything 50/50; food, entertainment, travel expenses and so on.   \nSo I started a college internship in January where my manager is based in another country, so I have to fly over once a week. I’ve been over about eight times so far. One of my family members usually picks me up from the airport, but my boyfriend picked me up once when I was stuck. He also offers to pick me up nearly every time, which I always turn down because it’s far out of his way and I usually land quite late, although I do appreciate him offering.    \nThat brings us to today, I’m currently working in the other office and am supposed to be flying back tomorrow. My boyfriend texting me saying he wanted to come get me from the airport. I have to admit, I melted a little. He’s going away this weekend and we weren’t going to see each other, so I thought this was his way of seeing me before he left, which was sweet. However, this message was followed up quickly with a ‘you have to give me money through’, meaning for tolls or gas. I honestly thought he was joking at first, so I responded with a laughing emoji. He then came back saying that I’d be asking him for money if I doing the same (I don’t drive but always meet him halfway places using public transport so he’s not always picking me up by any means). I turned down his offer because my dad had already offered to collect me, and now we’re not really talking.    \nAm I wrong for being annoyed by this? I just feel like it’s unfair because he was the one who offered in the first place. It's not about the money, it would have only been a couple of euro.  ",

We planned for me to pick her up at 2pm and she would give me $20. \n\nThe day comes around and I'm not feeling well and almost pass out just standing there so I don't feel comfortable driving. I didn't know it was so bad until I almost fainted and had to lay down. As soon as that happened (~1pm?) I messaged her and said hey I'm sick I can't take you but I'll get my friend to drop off $20 for you for the rest of the cab fair and arranged a cab to pick her up. \n\nShe ended up getting a different cab so I cancelled the one I arranged and I sent my friend on foot to deliver the $20. My friend gets to Laura's house and I ask Laura to meet her outside. Laura says she's not there, tell her to go to [restaurant a couple blocks away] so my friend walks there. As she's just around the corner Laura says her cab is there and she's leaving. I said my friend will be just 2 minutes. Laura says \"I'm gone. I'll get the money from you later\". I feel like I did everything I could and Laura just drove away from free money, I don't feel as though I owe her that money to \"give to her later\". \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nBonus screenshots of convo: https://imgur.com/a/PyLSOds\n\n",

      "description": "So my best friend since the first grade who I will call Michael died in a car accident at the age of twenty one. Before that and especially after me and his on again off again gf throughout his entire life got really really close. Now when I say that I know what you are thinking but we are just really great platonic friends, I’ve spent the night at her house and vice versa and nothing sexual ever occurs but we are very good friends (Important context for later). Now the reason I mention that is that she tells me quite a bit and everything even remotely related to having to do with Michael. We spend much of our time together reminiscing about him or simply playing video games, something Michael loved to do also.  \n\nNow enter Michael’s other “best friend” Evan. For context Evan moved to our school (small school) in about the sixth grade. Him and Michael became friends quickly and were pretty close leading up and through highschool. Me and Michael always remained very close up until his death in an automobile accident. That’s when me and his girlfriend became very close friends, we both loved him and missed him and bonded over our mutual missing of Michael. Well our friendship apparently prompts Evan to thing we are hooking up, which would have been odd considering we mostly hung out together at the late Michael’s family’s houses. What he thinks doesn’t bother us until one day. She tells me that he asked her to hang out and talk about Michael but when she showed up it was actually a date which made her very uncomfortable. He then tried for months starting just a week after Michael’s passing to get with Michael’s girlfriend and she tells me this and it bothers me to the point I say something to him. It also bothered her as she was completely uninterested and found it inappropriate.  It doesn’t stop and we both end up blocking him out of our lives. \n\nFast forward to about two days ago and he is suddenly messaging her again and me (he made a new Facebook) asking her to look at a beat he made and apologizing to me for trying to get with Michael’s gf after his passing. And perhaps I should clarify it wasn’t so much that he wanted to get with her that bothered me but that he tried literal weeks after Michael’s passing and it seemed to me like he didn’t even miss Michael or care about his passing.  Anyway I go to his Facebook and apparently a popular old school rapper used his beat or something which is cool and good for him. But then I’m scrolling through the comments and he is responding to our mutual friends he wrote the best for Michael. People are praising him and I’m fucking pissed because no he didn’t he is playing that to get extra likes.\n\nWIBTA if I start responding to comments on his post where he says he wrote it for Michael with things about him trying to get and hook up get with Michaels girl weeks after his passing? I’m very angry and I just wanna know if I’m being an asshole for holding onto this years later.",

      "description": "I'm 33, my BFF is 27. A year ago we had a group of friends with 2 other girls, 26 and 35. One introduced us to her friend, Sarah. After a few months of knowing Sarah I knew this woman would be trouble. She lied a lot, was really selfish and always forced everyone to do what she wanted to do. She was all around a shitty person. No doubt there, she's definitely an A. After only 6 months of knowing her, she did some stupid things to me and I had enough. I didn't make a scene or anything, I'm fucking 33, I decided I didn't want this person in my life. But of course the rest would rather put up with a shitty person just to not make anybody uncomfortable or something. So I accepted that if I didnt want this person in my life, I wouldn't be able to meet them in general. And I was also questioning why I hang out with them anyway, they are the kind of people that talk shit about someone behind their back. So I knew they weren't something positive in my life. In general I feel like I'm too old for this, feels like something teenagers do, so it felt like wasting the little time I had for myself with people that didn't deserve it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow everytime my BFF and I meet she talks about how shitty Sarah is as a person, how nobody can't stand her, and when I ask her why do you put up with her she just says that she does it for her other two friends (even tho the other two don't seem to like her that much either). I told her that talking shit about Sarah doesn't make me feel better, it frustrates me because nobody seems to like her but she comes on top everytime. I think they are afraid of her, she has a really bad temper, so they rather have her on their side than as an enemy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, the thing is my BFF's birthday party is really close. She expects me to be there. I dont want to be there. Sarah will be there, and since she has a temper and I refuse to play nice to her, I'm sure it won't be pretty. And it's my bffs birthday, it shouldn't be about us but about her. But in order to not make a scene I would have to be super nice to her. I'm sorry but I refuse. This girl has done so many awful things and it feels so unfair that everybody seems to end up bending to her will everytime. And nobody expects anything decent from her because she's an A and everybody knows she's an A, so people expect me to do the decent thing because I guess I'm the decent one out of the two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didnt go to my BFF's birthday party last year. She made me feel super guilty for not going. Like I was a bad friend. But I never made her feel guilty for not siding with me in any of this. We're adults ffs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't fucking know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an A for not going? Should I just go and hope for the best? Just tell me cos I want to do the right thing but I also want to stand up for myself. It feels so unfair to me that Sarah doesn't get any negative consecuences for her shitty behaviour ever. And I know it's not my bfriend fault, but it's not mine either!",

      "description": "So a while ago my ex and I were sorta living together and she bought a PS4 on Black Friday, and my dad bought me VR equipment (compatible with the PS4) for Christmas. About a year later, we broke up, and she took the PS4. I remember she wasn’t gonna take the VR equipment and I said it’s no use without the PS4 so then I guess she took it, even though I could have sworn she didn’t. (Side note: she has been in my house unsupervised since then, so it’s possible she took it later although i don’t *really* think she would) \n\nAnyway, my current gf is letting me borrow her PS4 over the holidays and I was excited to try the VR out again, then of course I can’t find it, so I text my ex asking if she knows where it is and she says I gave it to her. She says her girlfriend’s kids use it all the time. I ask if I can borrow it for bit and she says she “doesn’t feel comfortable taking it away from the boys because it’s their favorite” I ask if I can just have it for a week (which is what I meant by “a bit”) and she doesn’t respond. \n\nI’m not trying to take this toy (I guess) away from kids or anything but i just want to borrow it for a bit. \n\nBut idk, maybe that’s still being an asshole? \n\nSide note but possibly relevant: she does work around my moms house that we can’t find anyone else to do. That’s why she’s been in the house. \n\nTLDR: I apparently gave my ex a VR system in the breakup and now she won’t let me borrow it for a week. ",

      "description": "So I'm a pretty young guy, for added context as maybe my age will play a part in this, I'm in highschool. My best friend told me he had a crush on this girl, who I at the time did not crush on. Over time, the three of us got chummy, him, me, and the girl. After he gave me a suicide scare and I talked him out of it, I reached out to her as we were getting close. During that chat, we started to get close and I started crushing on her. Then a month and a half later, she told me she liked me. I instantly was super hyped, and we decided to start to date.\n\nAnd then I told my friend. By the way, for added context to be absolutely fair, I had told him I didn't like her before, which was the day he had planned to ask her out. After he had confessed to her as she turned him down, but wanted to stay friends. When I started crushing on her was about 4 months later. \n\nSo I told him that we started dating, and since that day he's ghosted me. At the time I was angry, and thought that he was so petty. But a day has passed and I see it's totally possible that I may have made him feel betrayed, especially considering that he was suicidal before this and even though I knew that I still asked her out. I still keep tabs on him to make sure he's okay, and if I think he does anything I have some mutuals that will talk to him through it that I know he's close with.\n\nBut that's irrelevant. I'd like to reaffirm if I'm the asshole.",

      "description": "I dont have the best relationship with my mother. I love her, but in the sense that I would be there for her if she ever TRULY needed it. She wasnt there for me as a mom and never did her job. She wants to be a mom nowadays, but it's too little too late imo.\n\nA bit of background:\n\nMy folks got divorced when I was 11. I had to live with my mother for a year and a half and that was hell: allowed us to do whatever we wanted, parented us with the police, constantly threatened suicide if we misbehaved, never maintained groceries (and we had to deal with Indian moths), and just overall being a very terrible parent. Later on down the line, we would eventually be put in the custody of my dad, but the situation with my mother was still pretty horrid. It isnt AS bad as it once was, only due to the fact that I dont live with her and I'm a more mature person than I was as a kid. I talk to her (sometimes begrudgingly, but never tersely) from time to time, but that doesnt really do much for our relationship as it mostly involves me sitting on the phone while she prattles on about how good of a mother she is, what is bothering her that day, something about reading the bible (which she doesnt even practice, so it's rather annoying to me), and something about my dad (who she isnt entirely over), never giving me a chance to talk or never asking how I'm doing and seeing what is going on with my life.\n\nSo, I want to change her from my birth certificate to my step mom, who I consider my mom: she has been more of a parent than my mother and dad combined, is a constant source of love and guidance, and earned the title of mom in my eyes. I want that reflected legally so she can benefit from whatever benefits I receive down the line (ex: if I get this job as a flight attendant, she can travel for free whenever she wants) and so that I can legally call her my mom. \n\nThe primary issue with this is nobody really knows I'm doing this other than my step mom. I'm still good with my grandparents on my mother's side, but since they're insistent on me contacting my mother from time to time, I feel they may be upset that I'm doing this, even though they're fully aware of how inept my mother is. I dont want to make them mad and I dont want to hurt my mother unnecessarily doing this (as much as I dislike her, which is a lot, she is still my mother and I dont want to overtly harm her in doing this.)\n\nMy plan is to keep it on the down low, not tell anyone, and enjoy the benefits of it being legal whenever it is allowed. Only issue I have with that is I LOVE addressing her as my mom to other people and i dont want it necessarily hidden from public knowledge, but this runs the risk of upsetting my mother and her side of the family, and all of them are either old or mentally unwell (grandparents are old, mother is mentally unwell).\n\nSo, WIBTA if I kept my mother and her side of the family out of the loop on my taking her off of my birth certificate as my mom?",

      "description": "This is seriously something I'm worried about... Here's the context. I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for around a year now and it's gotten to the point where I upset her about everything I do. I'm in highschool and this is the first \"real\" relationship both of us have been so I'm pretty new to knowing how people should treat one another in a relationship. I'd like to consider myself a good boyfriend and more and more I kinda feel taken advantage of. She's very sweet and eventually she apologizes for most of the stuff she gets mad at me for, but it feels constant that she'll get upset, sometimes cry, and I don't feel like I do much wrong. For example, I walked back to the school from my friends house to wait for her outside of her class (I didn't have a class the last period). When we met, I walked her to her after school activity and I asked if we could sit down for a second so we could talk a bit before I left for the mountains for my spring break. She said \"no I wanna be early\" (to her after school activity). I contested this a bit, because I felt like if I could walk back to the school to say goodbye to her she could sit down with me for a minute (the after school thing is pretty informal and nobody gets very upset if people show up late). I hope this gets across clearly and I know this makes me look like the bad guy but me contesting it literally looked like \"why not, you don't have to be early\". Anyways, she started getting upset and said \"I feel like you're always mad at me for wanting to get to things on time\" (the only time I get to see her is after her classes and weekends and it isn't the first time I've asked her to stay with me a little longer). She started tearing up and I didn't know what to do so I apologized. That was just today. Yesterday, the first time we got to hang out in about a week, she, her sister, and I we're all ",

      "description": "There’s a lot of background here. I’ll try to keep it brief but you really have to understand the entire situation. So sorry for the wall of text you’re about to read. \nSo before this recent incident me and the SO already had some relationship trouble to say the least. \nWhen we met he was in the process of a divorce. Through a series of events and conversations he basically told me he was still in love with her. \nSo the first year of our relationship I stayed with him despite for various reasons, mostly because he told me he was trying and wanted to get over her because he valued our relationship.\n\nEventually sleeping in bed next to someone I knew was in love with another woman every night got pretty mentally draining. I couldn’t handle it anymore and so I broke up with him after about a year. \nA few months after that he comes to me saying that he tried to get back together with his ex but she said no but that made him realize that it was never going to work with her and that they weren’t even good together etc....\neventually a few months later I decide to give him another chance. \nI tell him we aren’t going to date officially yet bc I was still very hurt over everything and I needed to see things really did change. He says ok and he’ll give me as much time as I need. We agree not to talk to/sleep with other people. \nThings started to get better and we were hanging out all the time/sleeping over every night by about mid November. \n\nFast forward to last week when I borrow his laptop and look at his email (mostly out of sheer curiosity and nosiness) to find emails with some girl that spanned from the time he came to me and told me how sorry he was and how he was wrong and wanted to try again to late January.\n\nI was pissed. I confronted him and he said he didn’t think it was a big deal at the time. Because we “weren’t dating.” But from my point of view if he said that he loved me and wanted to get back together than why would he feel the need to do that? \nWe’ve been fighting about it ever since because although he acknowledges it’s wrong to some extent, we technically weren’t together so he doesn’t feel the same way about it that I do. But there’s also all the shit in our past....\nONE MORE piece of additional info:\nWhen we broke up I was very hurt and said a lot of awful things I didn’t mean and when we first got back together I was really cold and distant for the first month or two) ",

I know he doesnt treat my sister right because she lost her virginity to him, had a pregnancy scare while he just moved on and stopped talking to her. \nOn the other hand I dont drive but my boyfriend does. Neither my sister or her boyfriend dont ever talk to my boyfriend or myself for that matter. We live Canada, it's past midnight, temperature is at -30 C and he has no way home, he also lives far so i dont want my boyfriend to go out of his way for this kid.\nPS. He cant stay the night because my dad doesnt even know about this boy at all and the drive is around 50min",

      "description": "I'm 18 currently at University, SO is 19 at a different University, it's about 3 hours away but I visit them every weekend and normally end up staying longer and missing uni. We've been together since the last year of school and things have naturally been up and down (mixing teenage emotions with a lot of change in a short period) \n\nSO has strict parents so I'm kept a secret (this isn't a problem it's just for context) and over summer I went with family to a rural part of ireland, I wasn't on a phone contract at this time so was unable to communicate with them for a 2 weeks aside from sporadic DMs whenever I got WiFi, when I came back all was good until about 2 weeks after, when they broke up with me. I found out during the time I was away they'd started talking to someone else, we stayed friends and the other person turned out to be a dickhead so we got back together. The next time I saw them in person was during uni. \n\nI routinely visit them every weekend (3hr public transport (again not my issue just context)) and during fresher's we fell out, they were sleeping early one night and I was out with friends, so I went home and called them for a bit. After this they began to get more and more jealous of the time i was spending with friends. They also have a large circle of friends many of which are opposite sex.\n\nFast forward a few months and Ive drifted from  all my friends, I'm a loner at the minute. I stay in bed all day waiting for them to be available to ring, because being too busy to answer would not go down well. \n\nI've been called boring and difficult to talk to, and I explained that I hadnt left my room for the last week so maybe it was why I had no gripping stories or funny anecdotes, again, didn't go down well\n\nI still visit them every weekend and more often than not it results in me sitting in their room waiting while they have society socials and go out without me. \n\nOver Christmas I was back home and decided to meet up with some school friends for a night, SO fell out with me over my slow replies to their texts and I ended up calling them in the bathroom all night, my old friends have since drifted from me since then probably because I ignored them all night.\n\nThey continue to live a happy typical student Life with a large circle of friends and always have lots of plans whereas I feel like I need to stay in my room on standby in case I see them calling me\n\n\nNow obviously I know how it sounds reading it back, but this is just a one sided rant, they're a genuinely lovely person and I wouldn't consider ending it, just wondering if I'm the asshole (arsehole as we say) for feeling like it's sort of their fault Im not enjoying University\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I am 35, my wife is 32. We have been married for 11 years and have 2 daughters, 10 and 6. She is currently 4 months pregnant with twins.\n\nI am an engineer for a hydro company and work 8-4 each day, 40 hours a week and sometimes overtime. My wife works full time as a nurse consultant for a pharmaceutical company.\n\nBut otherwise she takes care of the house, the kids, and also does the cooking. I tell her she’s doing a LOT of work for someone who is pregnant with twins, and suggested that she take maternity leave early (she originally planned to leave around 7 months). I also suggested that she should think about staying home with the kids and maybe working from home after the birth of our twins. \n\nShe felt insulted by my suggestion and said she wouldn’t feel right, not working and just staying at home. I told her I earned enough for both of us and she should just take it easy. She was originally planning on having her mother come and take care of the kids and babies while she went back to work after a month or so. She told me that her mom is planning on staying “indefinitely” and “thats how its done in my family”. I know that after her mother gave birth to her sister, her grandparents literally moved in with them for 10 years, helping to raise the both of them while her parents worked.\n\nI’m not okay with this idea because although I like my MIL (57), I wouldnt feel comfortable having her live with us, especially for an indefinite length of time. I also don’t like the idea of my wife continuing to work while pregnant. I don’t want her to go back to work as soon as she gives birth. I just want her to be there for the kids.\n\nI don’t want an outsider interrupting our daily lives. She helped us out for a few months after the birth of our youngest, and there was some tension after a while. But my MIL wants my wife to go back to work ASAP after having kids. I really don’t understand the rush and just want my wife to be taking care of our children. \n\nI told my wife this and she said I’m being rude and unreasonable for not wanting her mom to live with us. And that with 4 kids, she needs extra help. I volunteered to take paternity leave for a month or so and she said thats a “dumb idea”.\n\nAm I the asshole/unreasonable?",

      "description": "Trying to keep this as short as possible. **TL;DR**: My in-laws were not able to be present or supportive when my husband, their son, was dying in the hospital and now I'm not speaking to them. I don't know if I ever will again.\n\nOver the holidays my husband was in the hospital for near-fatal flu complications. (Get your flu shots!) He was in a medically-induced coma for about 2 weeks, and spent 10 of those days on specialized life support. After he woke up he spent a week awake on the ventilator and withdrawing from opioid drips, then another week awake and able to breathe on his own but delusional and kind of psychotic from kidney failure.\n\nFor those first two weeks his parents were overbearing and insufferable--as you might expect from the parents of an only child. They had secret meetings with doctors, tried to sign papers without me, interrupted doctors during rounds, and talked to people about clinical trials without telling me. And they were there 24/7. Never left.\n\nWhen Husband woke up from the coma, his sleep/wake cycle was  reversed, he was verbally and physically abusive to staff and visitors, and had to be restrained so he wouldn't pull out his breathing tube or the dialysis port in his jugular vein. Sounds like a perfect job for overbearing, ever-present parents, right?\n\nNope. They went back home and visited for a couple of hours every 2-3 days. They didn't believe me when I described how awful my husband was at night, because when they saw him during the day he was sleepy and docile. I *begged* them to stay for longer and to stay overnight. They'd promise they would and then just not show up, and never acknowledge it or apologize. \n\nI stood at my husband's bedside alone every night and got yelled at, smacked in the face, barfed on, and watched nearly every bodily fluid he has get sucked out or recirculated through one tube or another. While my in-laws were having drinks with friends and going downtown to see the Blue Man Group. (Not a joke, I saw the ticket stubs.)\n\nI get that everyone deals with tragedy in their own way, and maybe they just shut down and couldn't hack it. But why disappear right when your son is coming back to life? Why promise to be supportive and then stand me up? Why accuse me of lying? I was beyond furious.\n\nI was barely civil with the in-laws for the rest of the hospital stay and I haven't spoken to them since we came home from the hospital, January 8. Husband knows what happened, he's okay with how I feel towards his parents but he is still super close with them. He has communicated to them that I need space and I will reach out to them when I am ready, but they are always telling him \"give newjerseygoldrush a big hug and a kiss for me\" and they've texted me a couple times \"to check in\" and for my birthday, which pisses me off.\n\nI know I'm not going to forgive them, but do I have to forget it and move on for the sake of my husband's family?\n\nAgain, sorry this is so long.",

A few months in, the three roommates decided that they wanted to get cable TV. I usually don’t watch tv because Netflix and YouTube are are readily available but it sounded good. \n\nMy household loves sports, whereas I don’t watch or care about sports. So when decided that we would get cable, I already knew the majority of it would be sports. I told them two channels that I wanted so that I could enjoy the tv as well. Well, this tv channels were never delivered. It has now been three months, and I’m paying $30/month for cable that I haven’t watched at all (we split it 4 ways). \n\nI’m a full time student, only working four times a month (every Saturday) so every penny is valuable. However, my roommates have full time jobs 40+ hours a week. I want to ask them to cut me out of the cable bill because it isn’t practical for me to pay it when I don’t use it. \n\nNow, when I brought this up to my boyfriend, \n\nhe said “everyone is contributing to the cable. I don’t like the house being warm but I still pay for heating because it’s a part of the house”. \n\nMe: “but heating a house is mandatory for Canadian winters. Sports channels aren’t”\n\nAnyway, it’s the end of the month and my roommate just texted me for $30 for the cable bill. I brought it up again to my boyfriend and he wasn’t happy with me. \n\nAm I the asshole for this? ",

His ex-wife cheated on him constantly with any and everybody so he obviously has emotional baggage from his past relationship with her. He is super jealous over any and everything whether it's a comment from a stranger or an innocent compliment from a friend it's always an argument.\n So one of my friends message me on Facebook and called me sexy. Yes I instantly knew that this would be an argument if he'd seen it.\nMind you he has access to my phone anytime he pleases he has my Facebook account on his phone so he can see any time I get a message. I have nothing to hide I love him and can't imagine my life without him.\nSo anyways I delete this message because I know that it's going to cause problems no I was not flirting I responded with have a great day but that was not the end of that.\nSo here we are in this huge argument because he thinks that I'm always talking to guys flirting or trying to find somebody else.. \nI feel like I have some kind of postpartum depression from having the baby constantly home taking care of the house making sure everything's clean dinners cooked his clothes are clean laid out for the night his lunch is packed he's got coffee made I don't understand how he thinks I have the time to be looking for somebody else when I'm not even interested in anybody else it totally blows my mind... \nIt also breaks my heart to know that he obviously does not have trust or faith in me that I would not go behind his back and do any sort of foolishness to ruin the relationship that we have or break up our beautiful family..\nSo please please please I need your input!!!!\n\nTldr: Fiance is jealous of a Facebook message thinks I'm unfaithful because I deleted the message that somebody called me sexy to avoid an argument...",

      "description": "In the last couple weeks my now ex girlfriend broke up with me,first telling me that it was my fault,then later admitted that it was because she has a sugar daddy in Texas who wanted her to leave me and start coming to see him. I googled the guy and he only makes 50k and has been arrested multiple times. I was talking with my uncle about this (who is a friend of her fathers) who then told her father. She then calls me and tells me I have no right to be giving out her business out and \"Now she sees that she can't trust me\" even tho she was the one who was sending nudes to an old guy in face book for money. Now she has to come home and she is pissed\n\nI should preface this by saying we are both 21 and live at home aswell",

      "description": "Hello, hope you're all well today.\nA long while ago, an ex-girlfriend of mine, say 'Sarah', and I had a very tumultuous relationship. We were on and off, but eventually while together I found out she started cheating on me with a guy she lied about for years.\n\nI believe she's otherwise a good person. We just weren't right for each other and she handled it very poorly. I had handled other aspects of our relationship poorly; I'm no saint. We've worked hard to re-forge a friendship and it's gone pretty well all things considered. She's made immense strides as a person and has earnestly apologized to me for the past.\n\nHer birthday was this weekend and is incredibly important to her, so she came to visit me and we went out together to have some fun. Currently, her boyfriend, say 'Henry', is in jail right now for a victimless crime, so he's unavailable. Of course if Henry weren't in jail, they'd be spending the day together. That's fine and obvious.\n\nWhat's bothering me is that he calls her from jail to \"thank\" me for taking her out on her birthday. She and I got into a very brief argument about this. She thinks this is a kind and thoughtful thing for him to say, and I think it's very insulting to both her and myself. My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1) She's my friend, I don't need his permission or thanks to go have fun with her on her birthday, or any occasion for that matter.\n\n2) Her and her birthday celebration is not a responsibility to just be handed off when he goes to jail. She is not an object. I took her out because I enjoy her company and recognize she loves her birthday, not because I was \"covering\" for him. I'm not his subordinate for when he's not around.\n\n3) His \"thanks\" implies a statement that I'm a convenience for when he's not around. I don't like being treated as if I'm only worth hanging out with when he's not around. I think I'm worth more than that.\n\nShe disagrees with me and thinks I'm over-reading. It sounds like a trivial point, but I don't think it is.\nSo, AITH?\n\nThanks for your time for whoever responds.",

      "description": "I got onto quite a packed train, but not too packed in that seating space is tight but there's plenty of standing room. \n\nI sit next to a kid with his father who are about 8/9 years old and 40 respectively. Then the kid starts saying stuff like \"I don't want to sit next to you, and asks his dad to move.\" The dad refuses and the kid goes on \"I don't like black people, they're scary... they're bad people etc\". The kid starts arguing with his dad and muffles in a \"but you\" as his dad shuts him up.\n\nNot that this matters but, I'm actually quite good looking, slim and dressed in casual business wear. So there really wasn't anything I could have done to actually scare this kid. \n\nAnyways, I give this kid a death stare and he starts to shit himself. As I'm about to speak to him, I give up and turn to his father. Then I start to berate him and what he's teaching his child. In effect, I called him a bad parent and a racist along with some other choice words. Father explodes and starts yelling \"how dare I speak to him like that?\", calls me \"unemployed waste of space\" and other defensive remarks. Things start to heat up, kid starts to cry, and then I walk away. \n\nI asked my siblings about it and she said it might not be the dad's fault. Her kids, although younger, built their own perception and were pretty afraid of the darker members of our extended family they didn't see as much. It was only until they went to school and made friends that it all went away. \n\nSo now, I'm not sure if IATA for calling out the dad and berating him in front of his kid.\n\nIATA?",

Feeling annoyed that he just blew me off and left me to shovel our large driveway alone, I decided to exact some revenge. I cleaned off the whole driveway except for his drivers side car door, where I piled snow just below his door handle, about 3 feet. So the next day he comes outside and tries to rip his door open, and proceeds to rip the door handle off and break his door. Now he’s pissed at me and says it’s my fault, when I think all he’d have to do was spend about 3 minutes shoveling his drivers side doorway out.\nReddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I realize how cliche that sounds, but I want to try and give a little background before judgement is passed. (Minor details have been changed cause privacy) \n\nI (Male, 25) had been talking to a girl (Female, 22) for a while, and it seemed like we were really hitting it off. I thought she was really fun to talk to, and although I wasn't intensely attracted to her physically, I still really enjoyed her personality and wanted to see if it could go somewhere. \n\nIt's here that I want to address 'the spark' a little bit. In general, I think the idea is very over-romanticized. It's not like in the movies where you kiss someone once and you have this life-altering epiphany about how this girl is 'the one' for you. I don't think that the girl needs to necessarily be a 'good' kisser, but in past relationships I have felt some sort of 'fire' or 'electricity' when kissing someone that I really cared about and it's something that I think is important.\n\nWell one thing led to another, and we ended up kissing for the first time, and I felt _nothing_. From the second our lips touched it just felt wrong, and I knew that it was something I wouldn't be able to move past. (Again, I want to reiterate that I'm not saying she was a bad kisser, because she wasn't). I debated for the rest of the day on how to tell her because I knew that no matter how I brought it up, she wasn't likely to take it well. I finally just told her the truth (that I didn't feel that 'spark' and that it was a bit of an issue for me) and as I predicted, she did not take it well. She started raging at me about how I was being a jerk and unfair, and how 'the spark' isn't real. She said that those feelings are something that develop over the course of the relationship and aren't there from the beginning. And while her point definitely has some value (There absolutely are some feelings that aren't there at the beginning, and have to develop as a relationship grows and matures), I still disagree with her and wanted to get some outside opinions. AITA?",

      "description": " I was in Target the day after Christmas. I live in a large city so it was packed with people returning stuff and the usual shopping. I needed to use the restroom so I went to do that.   \n\n  \n  There was quite a line of people so I decided to act civilized and get in line. The man behind me had a kid (probably like 6 or 7) with him and was getting really upset really fast. While there was about 2 people a head of me a store associate came out and told us he needed a minute to clean the bathroom. Obviously none of use were happy but what are you going to do? The associate goes in the bathroom to clean it up. \n\n  \n  Almost immediately the guy behind me starts complaining very loudly how the worker was probably in there doing nothing and making us wait on purpose. To be fair the associate did take about 10 minutes but the guy was talking loud enough that I think the associate in the bathroom could have heard it fairly clearly. I worked retail so I know how stressed the holidays are on people so I texted my girlfriend telling her it would be a while. I also texted her, \"There is a guy behind me who is acting like a baby about having to wait. He is throwing a little tantrum that is kinda funny.\"     \n \n\n I get out of the text app and start browsing Reddit or something. The guy behind me starts really calling the associate names and generally being an asshole to the young guy who is just doing his job. I turn around and give him a look and he says to me, \"You shut up. I saw what you said about me, asshole.\"   \n \n\n So at this point I'm a little stunned because there must have been an effort to look over my shoulder and see what I was texting. That's kinda a huge violation of privacy in my opinion. I get a little pissed fast and turn to his kid and said, \"Santa Claus is not real. It's your parents. Also the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy are not real. It's all your parents work.\" I walked away at that point because I didn't want a physical altercation to happen or anything.   \n\n\n  Am I the asshole? Maybe what I didn't wasn't proportional but I think it was if you have ever worked retail on the holidays and if I was the associate I would be cheering for me.  \n\n\ntl;dr: Stranger acts like an asshole to retail associate, reads my private text over my shoulder, calls me an asshole for texting that he was being a baby, I tell his kid that Santa isn't real.

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to meet my moms boyfriend who was part of the reason my parents separated?",
      "description": " So this starts back in 2017 when my parents split (they were never married but had been together for around 25ish years) shortly after my 16th birthday. My parents hadn't had the best relationship for a couple years prior but me being a kid I never really noticed until I look back on it now. My mom tells me that she's moving out and that they're not together anymore. Obviously this messed me up but I think deep down I knew it was coming. Anyways she moves out and I live part time with each of them. It comes to my attention that part of the reason they separated was because my mom was seeing a guy who lived in hawaii (I live on the East Coast US but my parents are both flight attendants) named David (not his actual name) and I was furious with my mom for this and I still don't fully forgive her for it. Couple months pass and during the summer my mom asks me to come to hawaii with her and my grandmother and I didn't really think much of it because we go on vacations every summer since we get free flights since they work for an airline. We have a really good trip until my mom wants me to meet David and his daughters and I lost my shit. I told her flat out that I never wanted to meet him and that she knew that and that I fucking hated this guy for being part of the reason my parents split up. She was very upset by this and my grandmother was too, and my grandmother tells me that the whole trip was just a reason for me to go meet him and I was livid. We've had arguments over it a couple times after this and I basically say I never want to meet him and she wants me to meet him because she is an important person in her life and she thinks I should be involved with that. Not much happens until late fall 2018 where she asks me to go to a wedding with her in California (I dont know the people getting married or anyone else going except my mother) and her boyfriend and his entire family would be there. She asks me for a while and I sort of lied and told her I couldn't go because I had a huge paper due that week that we were doing in school (which isn't untrue) and she was really upset by this. She kept asking me to go and I kept saying no and that I'm not ready for that. My dad found out and he was upset about it and said that she shouldn't be making me go if I didn't want to (My parents dont talk at all anymore). My mom starts crying and saying stuff like she doesn't understand why I don't wanna go and that its important to her and I told her I would meet them eventually (which for the record I really hope I don't have to). After the wedding she kept trying to guilt trip me by bringing me stuff back from California like some staff exclusive apple shirts (Davids brother works for apple) and she said if I would've went I would've been able to tour the apple HQ and got a free apple watch and that kind of stuff. I understand where shes coming from that she wants me to meet him but I think she should respect my reasoning",

      "description": "Here's the situation: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy cousin, our mutual friend and me (3 dudes in their 20s) are often hanging out in PS4 party chat and gaming together. Problem is, my cousin's girlfriend is overly attached to him (in my opinion). She basically lays in his arms when we are trying to game.  They are VERY intimate most of the time and I can  hear them doing lewd things multiple times an hour. Giggling, kissing noises, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yesterday I said how he can stand this constant intimacy. I get, I get it. Different strokes for different folks, but please don't subject me to your private cuddle time. Then I clearly stated that it bothers me having to listen to them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday him, our friend (who says he's got no problem with this situation) are having a discussion about it. And they both are picturing me as someone who doesn't allow other opinions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSidenote kinda relevant to all this: I have an old dog (14 years) and she is getting difficult. Multiple times a night I have to get up and leave my cousin and friend as soon as the dog requires attention. These periods can take up to 30 mins on a bad night (putting on clothes, going outside, waiting until she does her business, you get the point). So now my cousin compares the dog situation with his girlfriend situation, saying we both care about something we love, and they have to accept that I'm gone too. And I'm grateful that they do accept it. But I feel like they shouldn't/can't compare me having to care for a living creature so that it doesn't suffer and him not showing his girlfriends boundaries (even if it doesn't bother him or our friend, just me) when it comes to decent behaviour when in company of other people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I missed some info you might require, please let me know. I'm a bit upset right now, can't quite sort my thoughts.  ",

      "description": "Ok guys, help me out here. I legit want to know if I'm in the wrong here.\n\nSo, for context I was raised by an amazing single mother. It was always just the two of us growing up. She never dated, and we don't see our extended family a whole lot.\n\nNow that I'm grown up (I'm 29) and living in my own house 5 minutes away from hers, we still have a close relationship. I call her every day and we chat for at least an hour per time. We hang out once a week, going for dinner and watching movies together usually. We have a great relationship, in my opinion. Sometimes she can be very (very) judgemental towards me and I find this draining, but what Mother isn't? (Conversely she would probably say that we have a great relationship too, but she wishes I would do more of what she tells me to do haha)\n\nI really have only one complaint currently. It is that she only wants to hang out with me on Sundays, and she doesn't want to hang out other days. Not Saturday, not Monday, not Friday. Because \"Sunday is for family\", so she expects me to set aside Sundays for her. She is ok with the odd exception, but generally acts like I'm doing something wrong if I want to hang out with her a different day and do something else on Sunday (this could be anything from wanting to spend the day by myself, to going to a game night with friends)\n\nShe is retired and is free to hang out with me multiple other nights per week. There is no logical reason why it has to be Sunday (for example, if both of our schedules interfered with one another and Sunday was the only one that worked well, then I'd have no complaints)\n\nMy issue with it is the rigidity. She says that Sunday is for family. Never mind that it is only the two of us that would be hanging out, so if we're both free then we can hang out literally whenever we want to. I have a boyfriend, and a very active social life. I want a life of flexibility where I can do whatever I want to on Sundays. I want to be able to go snowboarding with my boyfriend, go to a friend's birthday dinner, see that movie that everyone is going to AND have dinner with my Mom sometimes. For about a year I tried hanging out with my Mom every Sunday and honestly, it made me miserable. It took something that I otherwise really enjoy (spending time with my Mom) and turned it into a restrictive thing that felt like a task. I decided that I just couldn't do it anymore, I wasn't happy, and missed out on so many other invites that I didn't have to.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr My Mom thinks that I should reserve every single Sunday to hang out with her and acts like the other days I want to hang out are inferior. I would like to do whatever I want to on Sundays, and think the whole \"Sunday is for family\" thing is ridiculous and illogical.",

Every now and then she feels that I dont consider her feelings even though I do but because sometimes I disagree with her I suddenly dont care about her or her feelings. I have told her that she has been emotionally and verbally abusive and has denied it or try to reflect it back to me. \n\nRecently I have been buying more weed than ive had to because she has been smoking it all. This past paycheck she finally had money to pitch in and I picked up as she was busy at an event for school. I decided to have a hit and she got mad because I told her I did so. I told her shes being a bit immature considering how much she has been smoking and is saying I didn't consider her feelings after telling her that I dont think im wrong for taking a hit after shes smoked through an entire oz basically. \n\nWhat do, Reddit?",

We can either draw it on paper with ruler and pencil - that would take weeks - calculating everything, creating about 40-50 cross sections etc.. Or we can do it in a program that nobody really knows how to work with. I liked the challenge so I watched tons of youtube guides and I'm already finished with my project. We still have 3 months before submitting it.\n\nThere are 15 other students in that class. I'm friend with like 3 of them. But now everybody expects me to help them.

      "description": "Before we met, my fiancé Brad went to college; his parents did not contribute financially. So in addition to government loans, Brad took out an informal, low-interest loan from his grandfather to help pay for school. After graduation, Brad's uncle, who was in charge of Brad's grandfather's money, suggested that he address the government loans before repaying the private loan.\n\nAfter paying off the government loans, Brad started paying off the loan from his grandfather, at which point his grandfather died. Brad's uncle divided the estate between his siblings and shorted Brad's parents the outstanding loan. Now Brad's parents are calling in to collect.\n\nThe balance is somewhat less than my non-retirement savings since I left undergrad, a few years before Brad did. I anticipate repaying the loan in full after the wedding, but it'll set us back on getting a house at least five years.\n\nI've expressed my feelings to Brad, a few close friends and my family; everyone but Brad seems to be pretty unimpressed by his parents. There's some growing resentment on my part, for a handful of reasons:\n\n* they intend to use the money to supplement the retirement they ignored for the last 20+ years\n* the collected sum will have almost no effect on their retirement's overall trajectory, but *would* have a significant effect on ours\n* Brad's parents were unwilling to contribute to his education, but have no issues with collecting money they never really earned in the first place because of it\n\n...we should talk to a lawyer. But aside from the legal aspect, I'd like to know if I'm being commonsensically unreasonable -- AITA?",

If INFO is needed then I'll provide it to limits.\n\nMy friend (F16, let's call her Tiff) and I (M18) have known each other for a 9 months-1 year, the reason I am unsure of how long it was is because we barely hung out in the past. We've only been starting to talk to each other more often recently and we were surprised at how much in common we have, things lead to things and we started getting closer, this was also happening at a vulnerable moment in my life because I have lost two close friends of mine of three years..\n\nWe aren't official and Tiff's seemed happy with things so far, I should point out that we haven't gotten past first base, just in case someone points out if the sexual chemistry was lacking or anything, anyways, she told me a bit about an ex-boyfriend of hers who's been harassing her recently, from what I can tell he's pretty toxic and I feel sorry for what she went through, he's making new accounts in an attempt to win her back and he bothers her a lot, I point this out because he, along with a few bad experiences with boys in the past, is the reason she's uncomfortable with a relationship, I understand where she's coming from since I had a pretty awful experience with an ex in the past, I was a bit obsessive back then (I was 16) and I pushed her away.. but since then I've matured and even talked it out with my ex months later. I told her about that story, so this may be a factor.\n\nI've been getting to know her friends lately, in an attempt to get closer and help her be more comfortable with things in case that helps (and also to meet new friends ig)\n\nToday she told me that she wants to take some time off of each other.. she thinks that we're going too fast, I got a bit panicky because I was upset to hear this.. but I didn't want to upset her, so I didn't show it (I'm not a very expressive person so it wasn't hard), I told her how much she meant to me, and asked her to think about it for a while before deciding, maybe sleeping on it.. I should point out that I told her the reason taking time off would be unfavorable is because I feel like there is some strong chemistry going on, and breaking it apart for a while will just kill things, she tells me the reason she wants to break things is because she's unsure about things because of how fast they've been, she reassured me it wasn't because of the guy in the past, but just her being conflicted with feelings, she seemed like she was blaming herself for this cause of what I said.. and I reassured her that whatever decision she made, we could still be friends, we still enjoyed hanging out with each other, but she still seemed upset..\n\nI feel like I put pressure on her to make a decision, so...

She got more and more upset until she asked me \"doesn't this bother you spiritually?\" To which I responded no, it doesn't and even if it did it wouldn't change my feelings toward him or my support for him.\n\nSince he's moving to a street nearby my parents house where I will be living this summer and seeing him regularly I've been thinking about telling her not to say anything about transgender people or his situation if she sees him but I don't know if that would be too far and I don't want backlash from that to affect him.\n\nAm I the asshole here?

We told them we could discuss later that night and come to a decision then.\n\nI lay down to sleep after work day when my partner wakes me up saying that our roommates had come home with the puppy. So I get out of bed so we can all have a conversation with them about it. Now I'm not gonna lie I was pretty pissed seeing as I'm allergic to dogs and it's not hypoallergenic unlike their other dog. But I was calm when speaking to them, I told them it was incredibly disrespectful that they brought the dog into the apartment without asking and that they shouldn't have done it and that as I pay half rent I have the right to say I don't want another dog in the apartment. They said okay and they would return it.\n\nThe next afternoon we text them asking when the dog was going to be headed back. They said we needed to talk about it. So they come out and flat out say no the dog is not leaving and that they're gonna just leave it in their room the whole time. Now other than the fact that the poor dog would be stuck in a small room, they already said that about their previous dog which they let out of their room all the time. So we firmly say that's not gonna work. And they just leave. \n\nTwo days later we text them saying hey we gotta be compensated in some way or you need to return the dog. They say that they are going to return the dog and that we are awful people because the two dogs are getting along so well.\n\nSo they returned the dog to my knowledge and we've just been ignoring each other ever since. So AITA?\n",

      "description": "My girlfriend and i were getting ready to go to the grocery store and our 16 month old daughter is playing with her baby alive. We kept trying to get shoes on her feet but she'd wiggle away to go back to her toy. Eventually i get tired of the back and forth so i take the toy and tell her she can have it back when we get back home. My daughter doesnt know very many words but she loves to back talk and give attitude, so shes fussing at ne for taking her toy and i say \"i dont care, you can have it back when we get home\". I thought i was being perfectly normal until my girlfriend starts getting mad at ne telling me not to say \"i dont care\" to our daughter. This completely blew my mind as ive been saying it and ive never gotten this kind of reaction. I ask why I cant say \"i dont care\" and her response is \"look it up\". I personally am not a fan of \"going with the flow\" especially when it comes to parenting, it just feels to me like one of those things where you just gotta do it how you do it because thats the beauty of it. \nI honestly feel like i didnt do anything wrong and shes just overreacting, but im here to ask. \n\nAm i the asshole here?",

This seemed well received and understood until last week when a girl abruptly told me she needed time off. At first she just said it was to spend time with her family, but I told her up front its probably not happening, and seeing were closed for 3 days anyways she'd still have some time off. Fast forward to today and she asks again, I say no and then 2 hours later there's no a sob story about her dying grandma.

However, he has another best(?) friend that he's known for longer than he's known me, and basically he decided to take the class schedules that fit with the other guy, meaning that he was NOT in my class with me.\n\nNow, I got really annoyed with him after that and blew off at him over text, because he is a really non-confrontational guy and hates making decisions until it's very late. It's a class for two years and he's been in classes with the other guy for maybe 3 years in a row and never with me, so FIRSTLY, I was really angry that he basically picked the other guy over me and chose to go with him over me.\n\nHe'd led me on the entire time into thinking he would take the class with me (to spare my feelings and not be straight with me), which has led to us not being in the class together.\n\nFrom then on, I pestered him constantly and brought it up very often, telling him to change the schedule to fit everybody's, but he never made the initiative and its reached the stage of the year where it's almost completely impossible to change the schedules for the classes.\n\nNow, I know he's not completely evil. If he hadn't \"ditched\" me, then he would have had to \"ditch\" the other guy. But I constantly asked him to find a workaround with the guy, so everyone was happy, but that never happened, and now I'm supremely annoyed. \n\nI still bring it up repeatedly to make him feel bad. Is that bad? We've discussed it a lot, but I feel like he doesn't feel guilty enough and doesn't see my point of view clearly. I feel as if he hasn't made it up to me. Other situations similar to this where he takes ages to make a decision which eventually leaves everybody worser off have happened before. \n\nAlmost every single time I text him, I repeatedly get mad and bring it up to him.\n\nAITA here?",

She was very worried about her and thought she might've sustained serious injury (She was fine, just a few scruffs) she expected us to buy her the food that she now eats. Which explains why she didn't eat her current food, and of course it is the most expensive and smallest, she also went on to say if anything happens to her, she'll rush her straight back here so we can whizz him off the to vet. I'm still probably gonna end up giving her the food and all that, but AITA for not wanting to pay for my cat since she doesn't even come here now and wont even come to her own name.

Not only that but they are not inviting our dad (to the wedding) because he told his fiance off for threatening my mum. \n\nBecause of this many of our family members (aunties, uncles, nans) think its wrong to go without my dad. He's responded to this by telling them he will cut them out of his life if they don't attend because they are being negative. \n\nHe mentioned all this on a huge family group chat (containing our family and her family) this was all after his fiance and her family members were bitching about my 15 year old sister (on the group chat) because she doesn't want to go unless our dad goes.\n\nWhen one of our uncles called him up to tell him how the message upset him he yelled at him down the phone.

      "description": "Close mate of mine just got out of a relationship around the same time I did, so we've been supporting eachother through our pains and bullshit. He mentioned something to me about how he felt like he needed to hang out with friends more often and I agreed with him, because he really closed in on himself during his breakup. \n\n\nMy buddy is 19, we graduated last year. For some reason, the only people he hangs out with are highschoolers??  \n\n\nI mean, I can see it. not to rag on the guy but in all realness, he's pretty immature; no job, parents paying for college in full, lives at home with no fees and he even still recieves an allowance. (all things I've noticed as weird but wrote them off because they have no impact on me at all lmao) \n\n\nNone of these things have meant anything, until recently, he got kinda worried about his image and asked me if it was weird that he's hanging out with these people. He also asked me to be as brutally honest as possible, because, in his words I am \"more mature and I know more about this stuff\" than he does. \n\n\nI said I understood where he was coming from, him and his GF were pretty much eachothers best friend, and these people he's hanging out with are from the same club we were all in in highschool, and some of them are people we went to school with for a year or so, and it's always cool to talk to people with similar interests-\n\n\n-but I also told him my honest opinion, which is that by hanging out with people who are up to 4 years younger then you, you aren't going to learn from them and you aren't challenging yourself. I basically said they're probably cool to hang out with but you've gotta adult sometimes, and that's not possible if you're spending all of your time hanging out with 16 year olds and going to class. \n\nHe got mad at me and called me an asshole and said I was jealous that he had friends \n\n\nlolwut \n\n\nhe then told me that \"this is why /ex BF/ left me\" and \"don't talk to him ever again\"\n\nyikes man, I was just trying to be real. \nThanks if you read this far. opinions/feedback appreciated. \n\nTL:DR - Friend is going through breakup and associates with highschoolers as his sole friend group. He asks for my \"brutally honest\" opinion, I tell him it's alright that they're his friends but that he's not gonna progress if he continues to associate with them in this way, he gets mad, tells me never to talk to him again. \n\n\n",

      "description": "context story is a bit long sorry:\n\nI work as a shuttle driver, driving employees from a corporate building lot to the grocery store they work at. we don't have a defined schedule, they employees sign-in their hours when they take the shuttle and we come and pick them up at the time that they specify. A round trip from the lot to the store takes around 10 minutes. \n\none day I had two people (John and Tammy) getting off at 4:30 and one person getting off at 4:45 (Sam). I get there about a minute early and John comes out and gets in the shuttle pretty quickly, a bit after the clock turns 4:30. we wait several minutes and Tammy does not show up. when it turns 4:38 I think maybe Tammy just got caught up with something, it happens at a grocery store can't help it, John has already been waiting in my car for nearly 10 minutes even though he came out on time and I will likely be late picking up Sam if I don't leave now. So I figure if Tammy wants to take her time she can wait and be picked up with Sam.\n\n I take John back to the lot and I'm about halfway back (about 4:14 now) when I get a call from the store, which I answer since the car has bluetooth for handsfree. it's Tammy complaining that she's had to wait. I'm a little annoyed because since she obviously wasn't out when I left the store last she could not have been waiting more than 5 minutes from when she called me, almost half the time John had to wait for her, but I just tell her my current location/time estimate and we end the call.\n\nI get to the store about 4:46, Tammy gets in and I let her know we have to wait for Sam. Shes upset so I explain my thought process to her but she doesnt really have a choice but to wait. Sam gets in and we leave around 4:49, getting back to the lot around 4:54-55. \n\nLater I get a text from my my manager that I got a complaint, it was from Tammy. I explain that her being late would put out 2 people who were getting out in a reasonable amount of time, so I chose the path of the least inconvenience for everyone. My manager tells me \"It wouldn't have been a problem if you had come back to the store as soon as possible.\" I was confused, because I did do that. It turns out Tammy lied and said she had to wait a full half-hour before I showed up. If Tammy did not come out of the store until after 4:38, and I took her away from the store at around 4:49, there's no way this is possible.\n\nI was reprimanded, I now have to wait a full 10 minutes after the time the employee writes on the sheet (this I don't mind since it was an order from the manager, if somebody complains due to issues coming from this I wouldn't consider it my fault) but the thing I'm more angry about is that she wildly exaggerated the time she had to wait to get me in trouble. at the time that this happened I was only a couple of weeks into starting at this position (previously in the store) and I'm not very confident in my job security because not a lot of people take the shuttle so I was genuinely worried someone saying they had to wait a half an hour could cost me my job. \n\nthe other day I was just scrolling through random sites and I read some story about a lady who had a boss she hated or something like that so she used his number to sign up for a wake up call service set to call him at 5 a.m. every morning for a certain amount of time. at first I was like haha funny, but the more I think about it I think it's a good idea. I have Tammy's number since she has used her personal phone instead of the store phone to contact me about the shuttle a couple weeks after the incidents. Its relatively harmless, she can cancel the calls on her end, but has the potential to be very annoying especially if I sign her up multiple times. the very least she deserves is losing some sleep. \n\nWIBTA if I got back at her this way?",

      "description": "  Recently I went to the dentist and they referred me to the orthodontist for a twisted molar. So we made an appointment and I had some x-rays and examinations done. Afterwards we went into the orthos office and she first complimented my teeth and said that they were almost perfect. She then went on to say that I have an 8 (mm?) Overbite and that I'd need a bite plate and have braces for three years.\n\nI was crushed. Immediately started crying as soon as we left the office and had a major drop in confidence and motivation. It took me a while, but I came to terms and by the time I had to get them on it didn't seem too bad.\n\nIt was awful. The bite plate is huge and gives me a terrible lisp. And God it's just so painful. As soon as I got into the car I became a mess. And when I got home it was even worse, everytime i tried to talk or look at myself I would descend into a sobbing heap.\n\nBut it's not entirely that I look incredibly stupid, it's that I sound incredibly stupid. I have to talk much slower to even attempt to talk understandably, and even then I still sound like a 5 year old without front teeth. \n\nAnd as an actor in training this hits me even harder. I am forced to miss an event that I've been preparing for for about two months, because I sound much too ridiculous to be in character during my sad, serious song. To be honest though, I'm a bit grateful, because I was so nervous, but this is taking away a spectacular learning and networking opportunity.\n\nObviously all of this has very much upset me, but it's only been one day since I've gotten them. This paired with the fact that I completely dont understand WHY I need braces, because my teeth are better than most people I know.\n\nSo I've been absolutely begging my mother to let me get them taken off. I honestly just dont feel like the pain is worth it, (mainly because I don't want to live past 30.) But shes standing firm\n\nShe completely believes that I need braces and if I dont deal with them now I'm going to be completely screwed in the future. To be clear, I think she only thinks this because she never got braces \"and never had parents that loved her enough to get her braces. She thinks that I'm being incredibly ungrateful and when she finally gave in to asking the orthos to get rid if my braces, she yelled at me to never ask for help when I'm an adult with jacked teeth. \n\nOut of guilt I compromised and told her that if it wasn't better by a month that I'm getting them off. Unfortunately for me, my acting final is in a 2 weeks and so is the student talent show. Not to mention my 16th birthday present, Dear Evan Hansen tickets.\n\nI deeply regret getting braces and I'm scared I'm not going to get used to them in time to be able to maintain my grade in acting.\n\nMy mother doesn't understand my problems because hers were so much worse as a kid, so she just thinks I'm being an ungrateful prick. But I dont think I need and definitely dont want braces, which I made clear to her since I was told I needed them. She basically forced me to get them, and I didn't fight back because I didn't want to get in another blowout with her. And now everytime I hear myself talk I remain on the verge of tears because I hate it so much.\n\nAITA for not appreciating my braces?",

      "description": "TL;DR I told my nephew he wasn't allowed to play video games the next time he was at my place. The next time he was over he sulked and cried when he wasn't allowed to. My fiancée eventually let him play.\n\nMy fiancée has two nephews who are 9 (who I will call 'S') and 12. I've known them for years and think of them as my nephews now too. Like most kids their age they are obsessed with youtube and, S especially, video games. A couple of weeks ago while we were all hanging out together, we somehow started talking about things that annoy us. I mentioned I hate it when people tickle my ears, so naturally S immediately went to tickle my ears. I pulled away and said \"for every time you tickle my ears, that's one time you're not allowed to play video games when you come to our house.\" We were all laughing and joking around when this was being said, but I did say I was being serious. S still tickled my ears so I said no video games and that was that. \n\nLast weekend, my fiancée's family came over to our house. This included the two nephews and her two younger cousins. They all went downstairs to play games and I reminded S that he wasn't allowed to play. The two cousins were playing smash on the switch and the 12yo was watching YouTube on a phone. S wanted to play the VR, so it's not like he was being especially social. When he was told \"no\" he went upstairs and shut himself away in a bedroom and cried for a bit. This led to my fiancée telling me I was being an asshole and I should let him play, because \"everyone else is\". I eventually let him play because it wasn't worth the arguments at the time and my fiancée was getting a bit angry with me. Cut to yesterday and S is still being quiet cold and not really talking to me.\n\nSo am I an asshole? Was I being too harsh expecting a punishment, talked about half in jest, to actually be carried out? ",

I’ve been in bed all day, my family hasn’t left the house all day, and my aunt and cousin came over. \n\nI wanted to watch this movie over an hour ago with my brother so we can leave and go to ihop and have time to make the 10 o’clock screening. Ihop closes at 11, and I don’t feel like watching a movie in the hood theater at 11:30 because my family can’t leave the house or do anything right. \n\nMy sister just asked me if we have to go to ihop. I want to yell. Because yes I want to fucking  go with her already and have a sister date with her. But no. Can’t go to ihop even tho I’ve been craving it ode. I don’t mean to sound spoiled but, all day I’ve been trying to make plans and none of them happened. None, zip. Zero. \n\nAnd I ask my family a simple question like “do you want to watch Us with us?” And I either get no answer or a dumbass one that has nothing to do with my question. \n\nSo now apparently we might not even go watch the damn movie. This family is just a huge worthless headache. \n\nSo, do I have the right, and AITA for getting mad at all my families bullshit? ",

      "description": "Okay so this happened in August of 2018 but I think about it all the time still. I was running home from work one day and was on this portion of the path that is along the edge of a drop off down to the beach (not far, \\~2-3 meters). I was approaching a woman walking in the middle of the path going the same direction as I was running, and loudly said \"on your right\". As I ran passed her, she moved to her right, misunderstanding which direction I said I was coming. When she moved over, she pushed into me and knocked me down the drop off from the path onto the rocks on the beach where I fell. I climbed back up, my knee dripping in blood, and she just looked at me and started frantically yelling \"What were you thinking, you should only ever pass someone on the left hand side! Faster traffic is always on the left, why would you run to the right of me?\" In the moment I had no response to this but shock and just said \"Jesus, OKAY\" and turned and kept running. \n\nI would have been 100% fine if she had apologized for pushing me down the hill and would have understood that maybe I should have been slower or gone to the other side of the path or whatever but it just drives me insane that she yelled at me! My knee still has a fat scar on it from the fall and I couldn't put any weight on it for a week after that - had to cancel major camping/hiking plans because of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I was running and said \"on your right\" but the woman misheard me and assumed I would be passing on the left then pushed me down a hill and got mad at me.

      "description": "We just passed the six year mark. We've discussed marriage a few times, he knows it's what I want. I feel like I'm done waiting. He proposed once while drunk three years ago and I told him yes- IF he asked while sober. He never did and he gets visibly uncomfortable when I even mention the word anymore and changes the subject. \n\nI don't even want to bring it up anymore. I feel like I'm being dismissed for wanting marriage, like it's not a big deal. I feel like he just ignores that it IS a big deal to me. I'm falling out of love. I feel like what I want means nothing to him. I'm starting to resent him. I don't want to do an ultimatum. I told myself I'd leave at the five year mark if he was still avoiding the discussion but couldn't make myself do it. I don't want to make an ultimatum, it feels like I'd be forcing him into it and marriage should be 'fuck yes'. \n\nAdditional info: We have lived together five years. I worked more hours and a more stressful job than him for most of that time and supported him through a year and a half of unemployment, but have been responsible for all household chores the entire time, minus his laundry because apparently I never do it right. I prepare 90% of meals, if I don't feel like cooking we get fast food. I'm almost 30, he's just over 30. Last time I brought up the idea of getting married (during a discussion about being able to make medical decisions for each other after I was in a car accident) he told me he'd want a pre-nup out of nowhere. Neither of us wants kids so I'm not like, putting anything off by waiting.\n\nI've started resenting him so much that I'm not even sure I'd say yes if he asked anymore because I don't believe he wants it. \n\nWIBTH if I just broke up with him and moved out without having some sort of come to Jesus talk about it?",

      "description": "I have this best friend of over 8 years. This person has helped me at important times but has also hurt me. They are lazy to respond, stingy, and not respectful when I ask them to stop actions that hurt me. I generally am the one to reach out, apologoze, forgive, get gifts, maintain the friendship.\n\nSometimes we hang out and this person just sits on their phone the whole time. This is mostly in the past as well don't see each other a lot now - we dont live in the same city. \n\nStill, something about their actions doesn't sit right with me. We're going to be in the same city and they will reach out to hang out, but I want to just ghost or say I am busy. I thought I forgave this person for doing things but now I think I don't want to.\n\nOne time I cried in the bathroom after and they and their friend had lashed out at me for not wanting to be at a concert. It got intense and made me uncomfortable. They hated me for it.  That person admitted to me later I was being dramatic and attention seeking. I rarely cry in general.  \n\nAnother time after I flew across the country to see this person. They didnt do anything special or make much time to see me even though I asked and they told me to come. They only would go out if I paid for food and  told me they wanted gas money.\n\n\nThose are two events that stick out. This person sometimes reaches out to me and tells me about their life but they don't respond to me when I reach out most of the time. I just don't feel like I gain anything anymore. I don't want to hurt them and I know that this would. They also deal with seasonal depression so does it make me an asshole to do this kind of out of the blue? Also if this person asks why I ghosted them, do I tell them the truth? \n \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for sending my elementary school teacher a blistering letter 20 years after the fact?",
      "description": "When I was in elementary school, I idolized my teacher Ms. W. Due to the small nature of the school I was in her class for four years. As far as I was concerned, that was tremendous luck because each day was a joy. Her son was a classmate of mine. We became close friends, and I spent many afternoons over at their house.\n\n\nWhen I reached 7th grade, the school hired my mom to be the principal. She discovered some concerning things- none of the teachers had teaching licenses. Ms. W in fact did not even have a college degree, let alone a teaching degree. As you might imagine, it turns out the education students were receiving was not great. Standardized test scores had plummeted over the years. (My scores in particular, having been in Ms. W's class for four years were so bad that there was a serious risk that I would bomb the high school entrance exams. I was testing at a 5th grade level in 7th grade).\n\n\nMy mom pushed to get the teachers licensed and to receive professional development. But this rubbed the teachers the wrong way, and it especially bothered the school's founder who was the board president. Ms. W was apparently very embarrassed that she had never completed college and she felt inadequate in her job. The prospect of actually doing the hard work to get better caused her a great deal of anxiety. The board president/founder saw the push for basic licensing as implying she had failed to build a good school. Ms. W and the board had my mom fired in the middle of the school year. Ms. W was promoted to principal.\n\nIn one swoop, my family was plunged into chaos, as my mom was unemployed in the middle of the year when it's hard to find another teaching job, and my sisters and I could not return to school. I lost all my friends. I also lost someone I thought was my childhood hero- Ms. W.\n\n\nI was incapable of making friends for the next years. Any time I thought about what Ms. W did, I became so angry that I would literally see red. So I would stop thinking about it and bury those feelings down below. I've never actually seen her since the day I was pulled out of school. But I often thought about writing a letter.\n\n\nIt's now been twenty years since my mom was fired. Last month I finally worked up the courage to send a letter, but I did it anonymously. I basically unloaded twenty years of pent of rage and used every bit of personal dirt I knew. I started by saying I was a former student and that I looked up to her when I was little. Then I pivoted. Drama was Ms. W's favorite subject. So I laid into her and said that I knew she wasn't a real teacher, but a fraud. Playing the part like a washed up actor desperately hoping no one could see through the act. I said it wasn't a surprise she was a professional failure, given that her personal life was a failure too. To back that up, I mocked her for having an alcoholic husband who squandered the family's money (one of the things I learned from having spent so much time at her house growing up). I closed by divulging one thing my mom told me. Ms. W had told my mom in that in her late teens, she had an abortion and that she has deeply and profoundly regretted it since. She said it made her feel like a bad mother. So I closed the letter by saying not only was she a professional fraud, and a personal failure, but also a piss-poor mother who killed her own baby. I wrote \"is it any surprise that a woman who would abandon her own child would make such a terrible teacher?\" I'm personally pro-choice, but I didn't care for this letter. I was out to inflict the same amount of pain on her that I've been dealing with these last 20 years. But I wonder if I've gone too far. Am I the asshole?\n\n\n",

Sometimes I annoy him out of sheer boredom, because that’s what siblings do.

I can see where my dad is coming from but I’m still conflicted. I know I’m not an angel either and I know that if he would get scolded, I should get scolded too.

      "description": "This topic is somehow occurring in a group Snapchat that has been going on for a few years now, consisting of some of my closest friends. When it comes to kinks, I'm pretty vanilla but I make sure to not judge others so long as nobody is being taken advantage of or being hurt. \n\nEveryone is going around doing the very high school, gossip-y thing of sharing their kinks, and one of the women in the chat nonchalantly says that she's a furry. \n\nI chuckle to myself because I personally think it is a little bit odd, somewhat of an outlier as far as the group went. I didn't say anything of course, because as far as I know, it's pretty harmless and has a somewhat self-contained community. However, she follows this up by saying \"In a perfect world, I'd just love to have a dog fuck me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was immediately disgusted, and said so. She got defensive, so I asked if she meant like a human who turned into a dog, but she was adamant that it was just a regular dog. I told her this was bestiality, and that she was crazy for wishing for that. She left the group chat, and shortly after her closest friend private messaged me telling me that I needed to back off, and that I was an asshole for kink shaming her, especially when we were all sharing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm starting to walk back what I said in my own mind, and I'm thinking maybe all she meant was that she would never do it, but if all the consequences were removed (dog can't give consent, illegal, moral issues, etc.) she'd find it hot. Even then, I find myself somewhat repulsed at the thought of it. But, I can't shake the feeling that her wording implied that she would never do it in real life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? Should I apologize, or was I right to kink shame her?",

So fast forward till today, my mom calls me and ask if I could buy the gps for her because if she buys it on her account my dad would see. I declined her because I’ve been trying to tell her it’s harmful and hurting her even more. She should not involve her kids in this because my dad is starting to believe we hate him.

      "description": "I've been with my girlfriend for about a year now and we're both non-religious/atheist. The thing is, my girlfriend was raised in an uber-religious household with very Catholic parents that constantly shoved religious elements into her life throughout her childhood/teenage years. She constantly tells me how much she hated- and still hates- it.\n\nHowever, she hides the fact that she is atheist from her parents as to not upset them and \"fakes it\" by going to church and other religious events with them on a regular basis. I don't necessarily agree with it, but I \\*get\\* it. As a result, we avoid talking about religion around them as much as possible and for the most part, it hasn't even come up when I'm around.\n\nHer parents seem to like me a lot (or liked) and I do find them to be nice people. The other day during a dinner with them however, they began asking me if I would like to accompany them to church. I politely declined and was prepared to leave it at that- it's not the first time they've asked and I know to keep my own beliefs to myself to avoid stirring controversy. But they kept probing.\n\nThey asked how often I went to church, and I said never. They asked what religion I was, and I said I didn't practice any. They then asked if I believed in God and my girlfriend interrupted and told them to stop asking me personal questions. They went back and forth for a bit and ultimately said they were \"just curious\" and said they wanted to see \"what my morals were\".  Feeling very uncomfortable at this point, I just said I preferred not to talk about it.\n\nThe rest of dinner was very awkward and went by pretty silently. They didn't seem angry or upset really, but there was clearly some tension in the air.\n\nAfter we left her parents place, my girlfriend was stressed and mildly frustrated with me. We talked about it on the car ride home, and apparently they didn't know about my non-religion prior to this. She had apparently told them I was Catholic like them. I suppose I should have suspected they didn't know about my non-religion, but we actually never talked about it.\n\nThe next day happens, and I find out from my girlfriend that her parents are upset with her. They're upset she lied about my religion, upset she's dating not dating someone of faith, and upset because they suspect she's now lying about her own religious stance (which, she is). My girlfriend is now upset with me for causing all this, and now I feel guilty for souring the relationship between all of us.\n\nI knew they were super religious, I knew my girlfriend was keeping her lack of religion a secret, and I suspected that they did not know about my atheism. But, I did not want to lie to their faces or hide that aspect of myself.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "On Monday a parent of another girl in my daughter’s class got in touch with me over Facebook.   She was asking me for help dealing with a situation between our girls.   She had pictures of text conversations between them both and my daughter had been being quite nasty to her classmate.  There was also a few of photos the classmate had posted with what I was told was my daughter’s account making harsh comments under.  I told the other mother that I would speak to my daughter about it.  \n\nThis seemed really out of character for my daughter so I wanted to get to the bottom of it.  When I first spoke to her she denied it out right.   Then I showed her the picture evidence and she said that she was just joking and that that was just her relationship was with the other girl.  I didn’t buy it.  This girl wouldn’t have gone to her mother if she wasn’t upset about it.  I was just getting no where with my daughter.  \n\nI’ve read the horrible news articles about teens harming themselves over bullies so I am taking this very seriously.   My boyfriend(not the father) suggested blocking her devices from the WiFi until she straightens up.   I didn’t even know you could do that, but he had it finished within minutes.  I also told her I would be monitoring her texts from now on.  \n\nShe just keeps telling me what year it is and it’s impossible to survive without internet.   She also brought up classwork.  As far as classwork I told her that for the time being she can walk herself to the library and use the resources there.   I’m not very internet literate so I’m really not sure if I’m being overly harsh.  Sure she doesn’t have tv in her room now and her laptop and iPad are fairly useless for now, but I feel like the punishment fits the crime.  Or maybe my daughter is right and I’m going way overboard.  I’m not exactly the most modern type person.  ",

We finally had tests and he’s infertile due to an underlying genetic condition that none of us knew about (esp not before getting married). \n\nWe both still want kids (me probably more than him) and we’ve been discussing our options lately. He wants to adopt but I would like to actually get pregnant and give birth to my own child as this is an experience I truly do not want to miss out on. However in order to do that I’d need to conceive via sperm donation. This is something he’s completely against and I can’t seem to understand his reasoning. \n\nHe would much rather adopt a child that’s unrelated to either of us than allow us to have a child that’s at least one of ours. It would also let me experience what I’ve always wanted to experience as a mother. Is it unreasonable for me to want to conceive my own child instead of adopting? Friends and family are all hinting that I’m the one being unreasonable when I feel like he’s being extremely stubborn and illogical. \n\nAdoption is an extremely long and expensive process. Natural birth would be much easier in comparison and it’s something he knows I’ve wanted since he’s known me. AITA here really?",

      "description": "\nTo begin, I (21M) love my grandmother. She's always been very supportive and kind to me and I really don't believe she has any malicious intentions. However, she also has an uncanny ability to make situations about her, even by accident. For example: my friend was taken off life support after an accident and, when she visited the hospital, he started to die. While trying to leave the room, she tripped over a table and fell screaming to the floor and was unable to get up without assistance. \n\n\nAnyway, my mother (her daughter) was diagnosed with breast cancer two months ago. Grandma says she'll help us take care of her after the double mastectomy. But on the week of, she's projectile vometing and needs to go to the ER because she might need gallbladder surgery. Not her fault of course, but then she decides not to go. So now my mom is worried about her on top of having major surgery done. Grandma visits her that weekend and my mom offers to let her recover at our house so she has someone to take care of her. She says she'll go but then doesn't. We spend a week wondering if she's going to drop dead before she finally gets help.\n\n\nCut to now. I have no issues helping out my family, but my mom's starting chemo on wednesday and over the past week my grandmother has decided to call in favors. She recently fell off a step ladder (she has a dead foot and can barely walk without tripping. See the dying friend story above) and greatly injured her back. There were two favors, one last week and one this week that are no problem. But today my aunt warned me that Grandma wants me to take my GreatGrandma to an nonessential eye appointment on the day mom starts chemo. I told my aunt I'm a little too stressed to deal with G-G. (Love her but she's 95, almost completely deaf, and a bit confrontational at times.) Eventually my grandma calls me and asks me not about the appointment (aunt must have told her i said no) but to drive her home after her dogs eye surgery tomorrow. Her back is causing her a lot of pain and she cant pick up her dog.\n\n\nHere's where I'm worried I'm the asshole. I said no. I can take her, but honestly I'm pissed off. This cancer has been very rough for all of us. My mom is only 47 and our rock. Even though I know it's not grandma's fault she keeps getting sick and injured, I'm mad that in this difficult time she's not giving me space. Ironically I'm also mad because she's giving my mom TOO much space. She hasn't visited her once since she came after mom's surgery. She wasn't able to come to said surgery because she was puking uncontrollably and not getting help.\n\n\nMy sister and dad think I should drive her and take G-G to her appointment. I don't want to and unfortunately I feel like my decision is born out of frustration/irritation/anger at a woman who can't help her issues.\n\n\nTL;DR grandmother is habitually sick/injured at the worst times. Right now its coinciding with my moms cancer and I'm not feeling very helpful",

      "description": "As a kid it's hard to see anything wing with your parents except in extreme cases. My parents were never exceptionally abusive, but it's hard to say whether or not I really did feel love for my parents, or it was dependence and the habit of saying I love you.\n\nA few years ago I started to examine my relationship with my parents and realized my mom tends to lack boundaries and trust. Whenever I told her anything in confidence, her friends (and often their families and friends) knew very shortly. This included private health information and things I was already embarrassed for her to know about, let alone half the neighborhood. But whenever something important was happening, I was the last to know. My friend knew my mom was pregnant before I did. She also snooped in our rooms and through our phones and backpacks without any warning.\n\nBesides the lack of trust and boundary, there was also obvious favoritism in the family, plenty of fighting, and a lack of belief and support. I had health issues that went undiagnosed and unhelped for years, causing quite a bit of pain and necessity for surgery. I now notice my sister has some of the same issues, and my mom again is ignoring it and not correcting it while it can be corrected without surgery.\n\nWhen I started coming to these realizations, I hated my mom. I don't hate her anymore, but I don't really love her either. My dad, knowing my reasons, thinks I should just tell her I do even if it's not true.

      "description": "Alrighty folks so three years ago when I left for college my mom got a poodle. Since then she’s done nothing to train him making him a 60 pound ball of destruction.\n\nWe are doing Christmas in my apartment this year because my oldest sister is coming home because her FIL is very sick and I live 20 minutes from the inlaws and my moms house is 4 hours away. I feel like it’s important to mention that my sister and her family live in japan and this is the first Christmas they will be home since 2011. From the 23-26 I’m going to have 9 adults, 3 children, 1 corgi, and 1 cat in my tiny two bed one bath apartment. I don’t have enough room for that to begin with so I told my mom that there’s not enough room for her dog and she freaked out.\n\nAt first she tried convincing me that she’ll take care of him and that he won’t be a problem but when she was here for Thanksgiving that was not the case. I had to take him out to go potty each and every time because I live on the third floor and it’s hard on my moms arthritis (she’s 60) and I don’t want her to fall down or anything like that. Plus he kept peeing on my cats little house. I told her no that he is not welcome and now she said she will just stay home then. \n\nWhat the most mind boggling thing is that she has a roommate who is watching her other dog (70 pound golden retriever puppy) and he offered to watch her poodle for FREE. \n\nAITA for not wanting her to bring her dog, from her perspective I’m being a bitch and ruining Christmas but from mine she’s picking a fucking poodle over her family.

      "description": "A bit of backround to this inquiry, i've been working for a black car service for going on 2 years now. It's somewhat of a dying industry but there is still a need for it New York. \n\nIt's taken me a year to get fully acclimated to the work environment and now i'm seen as one of them, highly relied upon, all the drivers know me, all the customers know me, the only problem is the owner of the company is slowly outsourcing the entire operation to Las Vegas. \n\nSince before the summer started the owner of the company has begun moving the job to a call center in Vegas because of the looming threat of 15$ minimum wages here in New York. \n\nThe bosses are trying to tell me I have nothing to worry about, that it will be a joint effort between Vegas and NYC, but then a month ago they fired a long time NYC worker and didn't even touch anyone over at Vegas. Their crew is growing while ours is shrinking, these next two weeks I have a maximum of 16 hours because they want the people in Vegas to start trying to work on their own. \n\nI feel the writing is on the wall but at the same time a lot of people have come to rely on me. My manager for instance just worked out custody with his wife so that twice a month i'd take his shift at work so he can spend more time with his daughters. When I expressed an interest in going somewhere else for work the guy pretty much pleaded with me that things have just begun to work out for him that he needs me to do this otherwise he can't see his daughters. \n\nI plan on moving with my girlfriend next year, I feel as if I need to get a new more stable job before then so i'm not in a situation where all of a sudden I don't have a job due to outsourcing. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I just started looking for somewhere else to work given the situation?

      "description": "  About a month and some change ago, I met a girl here on reddit. For the first week or so we were friends, and she was really flirty with me. We played Overwatch and other games all night, and went to bed at the same time we basically spent every waking moment together over the internet. It was great, we clicked and we were having an amazing time. She asked me if I was interested in just being friends or something far more about three days in. I said I would definitely like a relationship with her because we clicked so well and it felt right to be with her but I'd like to be friends for a little while first of course.\n\n  Now here's where it gets tricky, about a week in she dropped that she was married on me, but she told me that he didn't mind and that she went out and slept with people. In fact she told me that her husband would tell her to do this. She told me that she was done with that, and that she wanted a monogamous style relationship. So I said if your husband doesn't really care then I don't see anything wrong with us being in a relationship. I make plans to fly out to see her, and her husband catches wind of this and it turns out he is not okay with this. At this point I've already emotionally invested and I went, we had a wonderful five days together. I realized that I really feel a lot for this girl.\n\n  Shortly after I went back home she had a surgery, and both me and her husband agreed to be loving towards her and give her the support she needs to recover from surgery. On the condition that I act as a friend and nothing more. I spend time playing Minecraft and watching movies with her, just relaxing really, and when she said she was well enough, we masturbated together over video chat. The thing is he's been yelling at her over the smallest things, like she has to eat less so she ordered toddler utensils because it helps with that. He yelled at her for wasting money. She was sitting down at the computer with some open protein shakes and jello, basically the only things she can eat and he yells that shes making a mess. His excuse is that I only hear him yelling because hes angry shes talking to me, but I don't think that's true. He wants us to stop talking entirely, but I'm not going to leave this girl I care about to try and get through surgery recovery with just someone that yells at her for support.",

I asked her what was wrong, and she apologizes to me. She seemed pretty upset.\n\nNow, a sidebar, I'm a very private and reserved guy. I take my privacy very seriously, and as such, I don't give passwords out to anyone, including my partners, and I hate it when people go through my photos or search history. Well, she got into my phone the night before and snooped around. She tells me she thought I was cheating (because apparently having a sense of privacy = cheating), and I got pretty upset. I'm not going to lie, I yelled at her and told her she has no respect for boundaries or my privacy. She kept crying and telling me it's okay, I didn't cheat, and she trusts me now, etc. This pissed me off, because she should have trusted me in the first place, and now I have no trust in her because I know she's the type of person who could even consider breaking into my personal belongings.\n\nI broke up with her, as I have no desire to be with someone who doesn't respect my sense of privacy, and mistakes privacy for 'possibly cheating'. (By the way, I've never cheated on anyone in my life). She's texted me so many times, and she and her friend keep calling me an asshole without any forgiveness in my heart. AITA?",

We never did anything that would offend the other.\nLater, we start debating about the technical definition of a stereotype. Our debates have never had a conclusive ending to them before, but for once, we finished. I won the argument, and she was speechless. I laughed it off and thought it was the end of it.\nA little while later, I’m on my way to the trash can to finish up my water bottle and to throw it away.

I try to push her off me and I keep trying to run away, but she drags me out of the cafeteria into the bathroom. I keep pushing away and trying to run, and she keeps pulling me against my will.\nAt this point, I have gotten out of her grip enough to where she is only holding onto my sweater. I rip the sweater off of me and sprint away while she tries to get the stall open. I left the sweater in her hand. When I get to my locker later in the day, my sweater is in there, soaking wet.

A few days ago I walked in slightly late and learned we had a substitute for the lesson, so I knew this lesson was just gonna be shit anyway but I went with it. Literally the second I sat down in my place I was thrown into this vicious argument between K and this blonde girl (B), one of the girls B sat next to had told K that her boyfriend wasn't a real guy, obviously looking for a reaction out of her. As I started to do some of my work and that's when the conversation shifted. B decided to express her belief that being gay was a choice, which was when it became extremely apparent to me that she was looking for a reaction but K was fucking fed up with Bs shit as she had been basically harassing her in those lessons for several weeks so she didn't back down. It was right about this time that one of her friends (L) sat down next to her and started rambling about how his opinion was fact and that i was pretending that I didn't choose to be gay. Now that was when I made the foolish choice of making the joke that L chose to be black as Michael Jackson proved you can change your skin colour, this was very obviously a joke and I don't see how anyone could derive racism from it but I still probably wouldn't have said anything in hindsight anyway. After I said this B fucking accused me of being racist and yelled out that K believed being gay was a mental illness, which was very fucking obviously a lie, and that was just the fucking final straw for me at that point, I fucking hate her and I don't really have the patience to have a conversation with her but to tell me that something I've struggled with for years is a FUCKING CHOICE is something I just won't stand for. So I cleared my voice to get her attention and said \"if it is a choice then choose to be a lesbian you fucking bint\", I don't regret saying it because it seems to have made her think twice before talking to us again and her mates don't approach any of us, but I think I over reacted and need outside opinion on whether I'm the asshole here\n\nTL;DR AITA for calling someone a bint when they repeatedly told me that being gay was a choice",

      "description": "TL;DR at bottom.\n\nSo this is a bit complex, let me fill you in on background- we are both non-confrontational people. The disputes prior to this were minor. Let me also add that I absolutely **despise** lying. This has been difficult at times, as she was abused, emotionally and physically, in past relationships, and lies chronically to save herself from retribution of her SO. This behavior is well ingrained in her personality, however I have made leaps and bounds towards ending these behaviors and promoting honesty in our relationship. One of the results of her abuse however is her fear of upsetting me. (Let me add I have never and will never lay a hand on her in anger.) This fear manifests itself as her withholding information she fears will upset me, thus leading her to lie. This has nearly ceased over the past few months.\n\nTil tonight.\n\nWe have an extremely active sexual life, as it was in part some similar kinks that first jump started our relationship. We are a long distance relationship, so maintaining our sexual activities is heavily reliant on Skype based \"playtime\" which between our visits slates our thirst for one another. Without going into detail these consist of me telling her precisely what to do while we both pleasure ourselves in tandem. I have a good sense of her 'rhythm' and would compliment this with questions asking her if she was close etc. to time my commands accordingly. I thought I had it down.\n\n*Thought.*\n\nRecently, I purchased a toy for her that aides our bedroom escapades. This has given her some genuinely astounding experiences. However, during the post-playtime glow of endorphins, she broke down crying and told me something long the lines of \"I'm so sorry OP... I know you told me never to lie or fake anything (referencing a prior conversation about faking smiles for the same reasons) but I normally fake every orgasm you see me have.\" She then goes on to explain that this toy that I purchased for her has given her the best sexual experiences of her life. She explains that most girls fake orgasms through anything but penetration (a fact I know well) but this whole time I assumed she was one of the rare few who could.\n\nReasoning for said upsettness- ~~(English lvl. 100)~~ At the outset I specifically stated she should never lie or fake an orgasm to please me. I repeated this often. She reassured me every time I voiced these wishes that she wouldn't. She defied this. I am extremely hurt she openly defied my wishes and lied to me regularly in regards to a portion of our relationship that due to its nature is interconnected to practically all other aspects. She faked it. Lied to me every time. I am oddly hurt and angry.\n\nTL;DR- So, proctologist pros. Am I the asshole for being hurt and angry with my SO for lying practically every day about truly orgasming to 'please' me due to Pavlovian conditioning form past abusive relationships?",

      "description": "I live in an apartment with three other girls who are good friends. These girls sort of run the apartment's resources, like the kitchen, the bathrooms, and the laundry machine and dyer (naturally, as they are 3 people and I am only one). \n\nAll three of them do their laundry at least once a day. It's cool you do your laundry all the time, but it means that I hardly get an opportunity to use them to do my own laundry.  When three girls take 1-2 hours doing their laundry every day and I am only home for a few hours of the day, it means sometimes I can't do my laundry when I need to. Something they do is start their laundry while they're out of the house, sometimes for hours. This means when no one's home and I finally have a chance to use the damn thing, someone else's clothes are still sitting in there. Today I really needed to do my laundry. My clothes built up and I had nothing clean to wear. One of my roommates had been out of the house for hours and she still had her load of underwear and a sweater sitting in the washing machine. So I took her things out and put them in the dryer. There wasn't any particularly sensitive fabric I could see like satin or wool or faux fur, so I thought it would be fine. I started my load and tonight she's come home and told me not to take her things out of the washing machine and put them in the dryer again. She sounded very, very angry. I told her I was sorry and I wouldn't do it again-- I felt weird doing it to begin with. She didn't flat out tell me why but I assumed I must've underestimated a piece's delicateness and ruined it in the dryer. I don't know if this was the reason why but if it isn't, I don't see how its reasonable of her to ask me to wait for her all day when I really need to do my laundry too and it was a tiny load. If I ruined something I'll pay for it. If I didn't take her things out, they would've been in there till 11 PM when she got home. I have class and work tomorrow in the morning and needed to wash my clothes too. AITA?",

      "description": "This is my first post here so I hope this is the right way to do it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically a few months ago new tenants moved in above me. There were/are super loud (thinking stomping loudly, throwing stuff, banging cupboards shut) at all hours of the day and night. They're new parents so they have an odd sleeping schedule. I learned very, very quickly that they were very loud around 6-8 am. There kitchen and bathroom is directly overhead so they'd wake me up and keep me up until they were done their breakfast and morning routines. After a few days of this I went up there around 8 (I know, it's not that early but I'm a student and normally sleep from 3-11) and asked them to please be a but quieter because it's an old building and the sound radiates. The guy told me they couldn't be quieter because they had a baby and then shut the door in my face. I went to the landlord who told me I was imagining how loud the noise was. I tried ear plugs but they wouldn't block hot the stomping so I bought a white noise machine. This was an expensive machine and not in my budget but I need sleep. Anyway, apparently they can hear EVERYTHING from my bedroom (which is super embarrassing) and instead of talking to me to resolve the noise they just got louder and louder, meaning I'd turn my noise up higher to cover them. I didn't know they could hear anything until one day it was super quiet and I learned that had left to stay at a friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIMO this all could have been avoided if the family had been apologetic and a bit accommodating. They could have put carpets down, walked quieter in the morning, etc. Honestly, they could have come to me the first day after I had woken up and explained the noise was loud and we could have discussed and worked something out. Now it looks like they spend all their time banging, slamming and stomping so I end up playing my music even louder to cover it so I can sleep/study. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea if the noise bothers anyone else, and it looks like the landlord is going to try to fix the noise going UP to them but not their stomping or slamming coming DOWN to me. So TBH, I still plan on playing it as loud as possible hoping it leaks through, which probably makes me a bad person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, AITA in either/all of these scenarios?",

      "description": "We are both in our late twenties. Been together for 4 years. \n\nBF is not really a good gift giver. I kind of understood it when he was in college, but as we have gotten closer and moved in together I have seen his finances, and he has a lot of disposable income. He buys games on Steam like it's going out of style. \n\nThrough the past 4 years, he has never really given me anything I have wanted to keep. He values making things because  he feels they have more impact than something purchased off of Amazon, but he regularly misjudges how much time they will make, has terrible craftsmanship, goes the cheap route, or all 3. I don't mind him making me something, or not spending a lot of money, but it hurts when he essentially gives me something he didn't think through that I will never use.\n\nI have received a scarf I never wear because it is a foot long and isn't very neatly done. I didn't even get to pick out the yarn because he \"already had some he needed to use.\" (I have seen the things he has knitted and everything else has been fairly impressive. A glove, a hat, etc.) \n\nHe made me something I wanted out of wood. He got the cheapest wood at Home Depot and didn't know how to stain it, so after a month of it sitting there I had to finish and assemble my own present. He regularly watches videos on YouTube to try to learn new skills, too. \n\nIn contrast, I am a pretty thoughtful gift giver. I have a large family as well, so I have a pretty long wishlist on Amazon. WIBTA if I asked him not to make me anything this year? He talked about it the other day, I guess without realizing we're only about a week away from Christmas and he's busy both weekends. ",

      "title": "AITA for not including my coworker?",
      "description": "I'm a mid-20s female who is a long-time fan of a certain popular Monday night dating show. When I was in college and grad school I would find other fans of the show and we would get together at someone's place and drink wine, hang out, etc. while watching. \n\nI graduated last fall and moved to a new city for my job. When the show started back up in January, I decided that since I now live alone, I would take the initiative to get some of my grad school classmates (who also moved to the same city) together at my place on Mondays to watch the show together. I love our Monday night tradition, not only for the show, but because it's a great way for me to see old friends who I otherwise don't get to see very often.\n\nHere's the dilemma. One of my grad school friends, who I'll call Sarah, works at the same office as me. Sarah is also a fan of the show and is a regular Monday night attendee. We are both friends with another mid-20s female coworker, who I'll call Jane. Now, I have nothing against Jane; I think she's a really nice/fun gal (albeit a *tad* bit dramatic) and I have hung out with her and Sarah outside of work a handful of times. When I first got the Monday night group together, Sarah asked if I wanted to invite Jane. I told Sarah that I didn't think Jane watched the show, because she had always rolled her eyes when I mentioned my obsession, but that regardless I kind of wanted to limit the group to our grad school friends. Sarah seemed to understand and hasn't said anything to me about it since. Weeks passed and I continued to host the grad school group at my place every Monday. \n\nAbout a two weeks ago, however, Jane started dropping what I feel like are hints about my Monday night gathering. She hasn't said anything directly, but she has texted me out of the blue a few times now saying things like \"omg can you believe what happened on last night's episode?\" or sending me a funny articles about the show. I'm not trying to give my gathering too much credit here, but I feel like this sudden persistent interest may be a result of her hoping to get an invite? This also kind of makes sense to me because she recently (within the last month) went through a breakup. But even if she's not intending to drop hints, I still feel guilty talking to her about the show knowing that I have a weekly watch party that our mutual friend/coworker Sarah attends. I suspect it's possible that Sarah had talked to Jane about it, and Jane may think if she makes her newfound interest clear I'll throw her an invite too. \n\nLong story short, while there's no real reason not to invite Jane (since she's a perfectly nice person), I simply don't want to. I honestly feel like we spend enough time around each other at work, so I'd prefer to reserve this night exclusively for my grad school friends. I've also always been a person that likes to keep their various friend groups separate because when those worlds collide I get stressed out playing the mediator. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "This occurred yesterday while driving home from work.\n\nNow a little back story. I’m driving in the left lane with the flow of traffic doing roughly 78 MPH. As we were passing an on-ramp, another driver (let's call them Otter) wanted to get over to the left lane as quick as possible, but without getting up to speed first. Now there was plenty of room for a car to fit between me and the car in front, but that doesn’t mean it’s okay to merge. So Otter, who just came onto the expressway puts their turn signal on and comes over into the left lane causing me to slam on my brakes and drop my speed to 60 MPH. I was almost touching their bumper. Thankfully no one was close enough behind me or else I think I would’ve been hit from behind it was so sudden. I slam on my horn but of course that does nothing. They eventually get up to speed and we continue on.\n\nFast forward a few miles; this is where things get tricky because our expressway splits into two different expressways. But before this happens a third lane opens up for people to merge and make sure they are in the correct lane for the split. Keep in mind, myself and Otter stayed in the left lane all the way to this point. Traffic was moving at a normal pace for the split but Otter decides a half mile from the split to put their turn signal on to get over. Clearly they want to go right; however, they make no effort to actually get over. They don’t slow down or speed up. They stay at the same speed as the car in lane next to us. I see this and move over to get behind that car and get just close enough that Otter cannot squeeze in. We make it to the split and they are stuck in the left lane. I see them throw their hands up in frustration. To make it seem like I didn’t do it on purpose I continue to the right and take the other expressway, adding a few more minutes to my commute. I think it was worth it.\n\nAm I the asshole for forcing another driver to miss their exit?",

      "description": "my ex and i had a very toxic relationship. He was extremely manipulative. When we first broke up, he didn’t want to let me have my time off to move on. He insisted that we had to stay friends because i “promised” to. Eventually he let me have some space to myself although he would call me up or text me out of the blue. But I finally moved on and no longer felt anything for him. He has a girlfriend now but sometimes he still bugs me because he needs help with his studies or someone to talk to. I used to reply him because I pitied him (he loves to victimise himself) and on my birthday, he got me a lot of presents and even wanted to throw a surprise party for me (after we’ve broken up) so I felt like I should reciprocate since he’s being so nice to me. But I realised that I can’t forget about the tremendous amount of hurt he has caused me and him being in my life doesn’t help. Also I feel like he’s just using me as a back up plan in case he loses his girlfriend in the future. And I definitely do not want to be the one comforting him (i know i’m selfish). So recently i’ve been ignoring him and trying to distance myself and hopefully i can cut off the friendship. \n\nTL;DR - I do not want to be friends with my ex even though he’s pretty nice to me now.

      "description": "My horse has been with my mother on the family farm since I finished high school and moved to the city for work. He is/was a 27 year old Thoroughbred, so it was remarkable that he has lasted this long in the first place. In November, I got a call from my mother that he was unwell and starting to lose weight. We discussed euthanasia due to his age and poor health, but my mother decided that she didn’t want to put him down as she saw it as ‘playing god’. I wanted my horse put down as he had a bad arthritis and wasn’t eating much, and I didn’t want him to suffer in his last days. We agreed that we would wait a month, and put him down in December. December came and went and he wasn’t getting any better, but he still wasn’t put down as my mother was still uncomfortable with it. I reiterated to her that I didn’t want him to be in pain and suffering, and argued that it was kinder to let him go quicker rather than him wasting away.\nStill, nothing happened until last week (Feb) when she called me to tell me that she’d finally decided to make the euthanasia appointment as she’d ‘felt sick’ looking at him as he was now skin and bones. I was devastated to hear that he had gotten to this point but glad that my horse was finally going to be at peace, so we agreed on a day the next week where I would come down and we would farewell him together.\nI got a text message from my mother today while I was at work that he had passed away naturally earlier this morning. I am sad that he’s gone but mostly furious that in his last few months he was in pain and I feel like he suffered when he didn’t have to because of her refusal to agree to euthanasia in the first place.

I also reminded him the day of as well)  My mom interprets this as him not knowing where I am, instead of the logical thinking that,\" He's at Sam's, unless you've heard otherwise?\" This causes my mom to go ballistic, calling my phone multiple times and texting me multiple times as well.\n\nHowever, I did not see the texts or calls because my phone automatically goes to do not disturb at 10. Also, I don't always keep my phone near me as I try to actually hang out with my friends instead of be on my phone the entire time.\n\nAbout 45 minutes after she goes ape shit, I see the texts from my parents ( my dad had texted me a bunch too because my mom told him that I was avoiding her or something). I responded to my mom like this: my dad knows where I am, (she asked if dad knew where I was) Sam's parent's were ok with me staying the night, (they were) and that I had already told her throughout the week that I was staying the night at a friend's house Friday (3 times in fact). \n\nWhat's even worse, Sam tells me later that my mom had called his parents (who were asleep) multiple times around MIDNIGHT. On top of that, my mom texts me back that I need to start being more responsible and I was acting like a brat. \n\nToday she is still mad at me and now wants me to download an app that lets her track me 24/7. My dad brushed this whole thing aside because \"being a single parent is hard\".\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm so grateful to have parents that care about me, but I don't think her behavior can be swept under the rug because \"being a single parent is hard\". AITA for still being mad at her?\n\nTL;DR : Went to sleepover at friend's house and  notified my parents the days prior. Mom forgot about this and blew up mine and my friend's parent's phones up around midnight. Says I was being a brat because I hadn't told her every single detail of my day or because my I \"made my own plans\" without them knowing.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Context: I'm (18M), a student in a popular english city, and I live in student accommodation with 9 other people. Of us 10, 8 of us had planned to move in together.\n\nOur first problem arose when we realised 8 bedroom houses for 2nd year accommodation were all gone, so we would have to split into 2 houses of 4. Those in each house had been agreed on there and then. I was fine with this then.\n\nBut, yesterday, I couldn't attend a house viewing due to Uni work and errands, so by the time I arrived back at my flat, I'm informed plans have changed.\n\nMe and one other guy have now been put in a house with an on and off again couple, the male in that pairing I really didn't want to live with. He's overly noisy, obnoxious, has a new lass round every week, and is just a bit of a dick. \n\nWhen we agreed who would be in the houses originally, we were adamant that those 2 shouldn't be in the same house, and that those 2 plus the other guy would be a nightmare for anyone (e.g me) as they all do drugs and like crap indie music. Everyone agreed with that then.\n\nAs for the rest of the flatmates, well they're all content with their 4 people, and I get along better with them than I do the 3 I would have to live with.\n\nAITA if I want to speak up about this and say outright I do not want to live with them? It would then disrupt the entire housing situation and I would just feel awkward and told to suck it up.\n\nI had considered looking for my own 1 person place, but even then AITA for wanting to live by myself? It could look rude and anti social, and I do get along well with 7 of the 8 people, so I fear I'd be secluded and a bit of a loner if I lived away from everybody.\n\n",

      "description": "Background: (I’ll try and make this quick) 24(F) and I broke up with my ex 25(M) a year ago. During the time we were together we never progressed as a couple, never celebrated an anniversary, never spent the holidays together or birthdays together etc.\n\nI felt I was kept at arms length but I couldn’t see past him and couldn’t help but chase him and try and win his affection (Why idk). I brought it up from time to time but the conversations just ended in me feeling confused, unreasonable and apologising. We went on a break a few times because I said he couldn’t commit and he denied it. Anytime I said I didn’t want to be together anymore he said everything I wanted to hear but the words were never followed with actions. This went on for 2/3 years. Honestly I think I held on for so long because I was scared of being myself, scared that I wouldn’t meet anybody and scared of them not being a part of my life anymore. \n\nI broke up with him this time last year and we agreed we would try and stay friends. I didn’t think we would but even so it was comforting at the time. We spoke from time to time online just to catch up but nothing else.\n\nI started dating someone else 4 months ago. We decided to take it slow, dating for a couple of months before making it official. It’s going great and I know it’s early but I can wholeheartedly say I love him (even though I haven’t told him that yet). Anyway, my ex strikes up a conversation online asking how I’ve been etc, we get to talking and he says he misses me I’ve made a mistake walking away and he wants to try again. I tell him I don’t feel the same way and that I’ve met someone else. I thought that would be the end of it and he would leave it at that. Instead since he went out his way to speak to me online more, invited me out to do things with him and generally just asking questions about my new relationship I’m obviously not comfortable speaking to him about. \n\nI didn’t want to be rude to him so politely declined each time. He was giving me a hard time for not wanting to spend time with him and cutting him out my life. He just doesn’t seem to get I don’t think it’s normal to speak to/spend time with an ex, even more so when one of us is in a new relationship. More recently the last month or so, he’s still tried to speak to me but I’ve ended up just ignoring him. I don’t know how else to deal with it. AITA? ",

      "description": "My roommate and I are currently sharing a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment. We both work full time. She just told me that her family (mom and 2 sisters) are coming from very far away to visit her for 3 weeks around Christmas. We each have our own bedroom and bathroom, but her room is small so at least 1 person will have to sleep in our living room. The couch in our living room is mine and I’ve already told her that I don’t want anyone sleeping on it, especially when it would be every night for 3 weeks. When she told me this would be happening she didn’t ask me if it was okay, she just said it in a “this is what’s happening” way. Fortunately I will be gone to visit my family for 2 weeks during that time, but I really don’t want to have to share my apartment for multiple days with her whole family who I’ve never even met. Also, she works very long hours and she’ll be working while her family is visiting, so they will be at our apartment alone all day. I would understand the situation if her family couldn’t afford to stay in a hotel or something, but I know they’re pretty wealthy. I’m already pretty frustrated with her as a roommate for numerous other things, but this just seems really rude and inconsiderate. I’m a shy person and I prefer to just keep to myself when I come home from work, and the fact that her whole family will be living with us just makes me really uncomfortable. What do you all think?",

      "description": "History: My mom and dad have been divorced for around 28 years. When they first split and my siblings and I were little, they fought like cats and dogs, and there was much shit talking from both sides. Never any details, but always screaming that led to more screaming. There was a period of around 10 years where they seemed to get along, but then it was back to constantly fighting and us kids in the middle of it all. Needless to say, I have a very fucked up relationship with both of them. My mom is very high control and manipulative, and my dad is very sneaky, evasive, and manipulative. This has led to periods of both me and my brother )who is special needs) either totally blocking or limiting both of them from our lives at times throughout the years to maintain our own mental health. My brother has been in both of their care at different times in his life, but he now lives independently with some outside assistance. Most of their interaction in the last few years has been in relation to the care of my brother, as we found out my dad was doing some shady side shit with his money when we decided my brother needed to move out and live on his own. Every discussion between my mom and dad in the last few years has ended in the cops being called, a public screaming match, a screaming match over the phone, or various threats.\n\nThe conflict:\n\nMy dad had a hemorrhagic stroke and is in the ICU a few hours away from our hometown. My brother works during the week and will not be able to visit him until the weekend. My mom had also previously planned a trip to stay with my my brother the same weekend. My mom offered to drive him up to the hospital (even though some friends from my dad's church offered to give him a ride), and on a group call with me and my brother said that she'll be in the room with him during the visit as she's afraid it will make my brother upset and emotional and she wants to 'be there for him'. And since she assumed no one else would be in the room with him, she'll do whatever my brother prefers. I had literally just told her another sibling would be here by then to stay with dad long term and so he would not be in the room alone. She said she just wants to 'support both of her kids through this difficult time.'\n\nI told her she absolutely does not need to be in the room, as the goal to get my dad out of ICU is to get his blood pressure down, and her being in the room will certainly raise it. If his blood pressure gets too high, it could worsen the bleeding in his brain, or even cause another stroke. My perspective is whatever my brother feels (and certainly my mom) should come second, the priority should be on taking care of the patient. If my brother feels uncomfortable, it will pass and he'll be ok. Even if he has to go in the room without my mom (which he won't). I told her she needs to respect the patient, as well as what I'm asking her to do, and back off. \n\nMy mom will not let up on this and is adamant that she'll do whatever she feels she need to 'support her kids, especially my brother' (relevant fact: she lives 5 hours away, not sure she understands the irony of that). And I am adamant that she's not getting in the ICU, she has no place here, and she needs to back off.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway cause this account would be easy to find. Also sorry for formating, I'm on mobile.\n\nSo this all happened today. I'm currently in a hotel thinking everything through and I decided to turn to reddit for advice. My fiance got engaged two years ago, and we've been together for eight. At this point it honestly feels like we're married. With the wedding coming up in a few months, and the fact they we didn't get to see them for Thanksgiving, we decided to go to dinner with her parents. \n\nSome context on her parents, they are very rich. Her dad is some kind of doctor and her mom just comes from a wealthy family. They aren't very giving to her though- besides college, they haven't given her money since she left home. Which is fine, she's always been an independent person.\n\nSo while we were at dinner her mom said something along the lines of \"We were disappointed to hear that you rejected our offer of paying for the wedding.\" My fiance looked very awkward all of the sudden, and I was confused because this was the first I'd heard of it.\n\nThe whole conversation after this is simply that I asked to speak with my fiance privately for a moment. Basically she told me that her parents offered to pay our wedding, but she rejected their offer and never told me about it. This may not seem like a huge deal, but it was to me. I have a job. So does she, but it isn't a very well paying job, as her degree didn't really create that many career options. Right now she's a waiter hoping to eventually find a job in her field. We don't make much money. Enough to pay for our bills and groceries with very little leftover. That's the only reason we've been engaged for so long. We've been saving up so much money for so long to get to pay for this wedding. Now I find out we could've gotten this wedding for free? I know it sounds greedy of me, but these past years have been so stressful, living paycheck to paycheck. Even if we decided to pay for the wedding ourselves, how could she not even mention it to me? We could have discussed it together and made our decision together, instead of her just deciding to say no without even mentioning it. I feel betrayed by someone who I thought would never hurt me. I don't really know what to do, but I'm not so sure I want to go through with this wedding anymore. It isn't too late to get our money back on a lot of the things we've paid for. \n\nPlease, help me out. I don't know who else to ask.",

      "description": "Mom suggested, because I now have a job, I should consider giving money to her parents as a goodwill gesture for Chinese New Year. Traditionally, money is given in a red envelope from married couples to young children/adults, who aren't married. I'm not married nor am I planning to get married for years to come. \n\nAnd I want to clarify that, I started working a couple of months ago and I am not making much but the moment I started, I budgeted enough savings for the holidays. Since this was my first year to give back, I wanted to show everyone who supported me to get to where I am today, that I appreciated every one of them. I wanted this to be a Christmas everyone remembered. One of these individuals being my dad's mom, grandmama. Grandmama immigrated here with gramps one month after I was born and took care of me while my parents were at work. They gave me so much love and affection and taught me to believe in myself. Their love for me overshadowed the lack of love/borderline hatred I received from my mom's parents. Grandmama and gramps were my biggest supporters growing up but unfortunately, my gramps passed away a few years ago, completely unexpected, while I was still in university. That took a serious toll on my health but it's not about me - I know my grandmama misses gramps a lot, especially since it happened around this time of year. So I wanted to do something nice for her and I did. \n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks later and here we are. My mom is asking me to give her parents money to her parents because I gave my grandmama something. But here's the thing, the moment I was born, my mom's parents decided that they did not want to help raise me. They did not care that I was their first grandchild and that we lived under the same roof. They insisted on my dad taking me over to his brother's house, where his parents reside, and have them take care of me. They refused to pick me up from school even though it was 3 blocks away and had my grandparents take the train to pick me up. Her parents showed no interest in me and constantly berated me growing up. They told me that I would never amount to anything growing up because I just wasn't good enough and that I would never be good enough. This was traumatic growing up because they did not show me an ounce of affection or compassion. While I worked hard to show everyone I was worth it, I have to say, the other part of the motivation was to prove my mom's parents wrong. So I guess in a way, they did contribute to my success - just in a very unhealthy manner which is a reason why I need to see a professional to resolve these issues. I understand that by blood, her parents are indeed my family but that's not really how I define family... \n\nAITA for not wanting to give money to my mom's parents? ",

      "description": "Back in spring, I decided to get social media to get in contact with friends that I hadn't seen since 5th grade because I had moved schools (I'm in 9th grade now). I found a friend's Instagram (let's call her A) and I've known her since Kindergarten. Her account was private, so I had to attempt to follow her a couple times because she constantly kept denying my requests. Eventually, she accepted it and as soon as she did we had a conversation through DMs. When I initially messaged her, I described myself and asked if she remembered me. A said something along the lines of \"Omg, I do!\" I don't remember since the conversation has been deleted. We caught up, and we gave each other a basic gist of what has changed since we last saw each other (What school I go to, if A still goes to the same school, stuff focused on us and not on other people. An entire weeks goes by after that conversation, and I decide to ask her what my classmates at school thought of me after I moved, and A doesn't respond. The only thing I see instead is the \"seen\" thing that shows after someone sees the message. A couple days go by, and I say \"Hey, it's OK if they thought of me negatively after I moved, I just wanna know. If you don't wanna talk about it, we can talk about something else.\" Just like before, there was no response and just a \"seen\" at the bottom of our conversation. A few days after I sent that message, I deleted both messages asking the question and tried changing the conversation. Another \"seen\" as usual. At this point, I just gave up and proceeded to not attempt to talk to her. A couple weeks later, I find out that she blocked me ( I don't remember how I found out). This has bothered me for a while, and I wanna know who was the asshole in this situation. ",

      "description": "Usually this is something I’m 100% comfortable with, but this is weird for me. I met a girl at work the other day that I REALLY liked. Kids around the same age as mine. Really sweet woman. We started talking about one of our common interests and she invited me out for coffee and I was elated. I’m a social person but it’s a little hard for me to make connections like that organically. \n\nToday she messaged me asking me to post something for an MLM on my wall for her...\n\nI am beyond a little turned off by MLMs. I seriously fucking loathe them to the point that being the crazy MLM hater is a part of my identity. The friends I have know at this point not to even MENTION it to me. But she doesn’t know that, so it’s not as if she was totally oblivious. \n\nI can’t decide if I’m being too harsh. I hate to be so blunt but it’s easy for me to write off people I’m kind of friends with when they make a choice that they know, thanks to me lol, is unethical and exploitative and still have the balls to ask me to support it. Because they’ve taken what they know about me and ignored it. But this girl has no idea how deeply the hate flows through me, and she could be really nice...\n\nI feel like I’m not going to regret keeping another hun out of my life but my passionate hatred has been the subject of many debates among my friends and family and I just gotta hear it straight- am I being kinda an unreasonable asshole?

      "description": "Everyone in life has encountered someone/body with bad habits, and, though we may not want to admit it, we're guilty of a few ourselves. Knowing this, I've never been one to be too critical of other people's flaws. However, there are two bad habits in particular that I've always felt strongly about: smoking and overeating/obesity. I've always known these to be unhealthy, but it really started to hit hard with me after I lost two family members to these vices.\n\nMy maternal grandpa was morbidly obese, and my paternal grandpa was a heavy smoker (we'll call them MG and PG). I had a lot of fond memories with PG, and I had a few memories of MG when I was really little. \n\nAccording to my mom, MG was a decent dad to her, but his unhealthy lifestyle really dragged her and her siblings (my aunts and uncles) down. He was lethargic mentally as well as physically; not exactly a good role model, but not quite on the level of dead-beat-dad. Eventually, MG was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, got his toes amputated because of it, and then died when I was about 10 or 12. My mom had always taught me and my sibs to be healthy, but it was our experience with MG that reminded us what happens when we, in my mom's words, \"eat yourself to death.\"\n\nPG was a much sadder case. I spent a lot more time with him growing up, and, as a kid, I used to joke about him smoking all those cigars. A few years ago, though, PG was diagnosed with lung cancer, and when he was in his last hours, my family all stopped what they were doing, and we went to see him. He was completely comatose, able to hear us, but unable to move, see, or speak outside pained groans. My father occasionally gave him drips of water, and said things like \"Hi, Dad. It's us. Your family's here.\" PG died the very next morning.\n\nNow, I feel a particular sense of disgust when I see those who are morbidly obese or smoking. I know I can't get people to change their minds, but I can't just pretend I'm ok with it either. I used to be more abrasive about smoking when it was brought up in conversation, making comments like \"At least your lung cancer will taste like cherries.\" Nowadays, I don't confront anyone, but I'm still pretty passive aggressive about it. I either cringe or my eyes pop wide when I see an obese person, and I cover my nose when someone smells like they took a bath in cigarette butts (not just from PG's death, but because it smells REALLY bad.)  AITA?",

We both have jobs and live by ourselves. I love this man and I'm sure he loves me as well and the only issue I have is when it comes to our future.\n\nI've brought up visiting several times. Usually it gets brushed aside. Other times he tells me it's just a bad time but doesn't really give a reason. It just sort of blows my mind because he always makes comments that hint towards visiting/living together like \"I can't wait to take you to this place\" or \"It's gonna be nice having you here to help\", \"It's gonna be fun doing this when you're here\", etc etc.\n\nI know the thought of him cheating will come up. Is it possible? I guess, but I have no proof and no reason to believe it. We've exchanged pictures and video chat so it's not a catfishing type situation. \n\nI love him and want to continue to be with him. It hurts to even consider breaking up. I also want to visit him and be with him though. I can take the long distance but I need to feel like I'm working towards something.\n\nI want to give him an ultimatum and tell him that we need to sit down and discuss this- when a visit can happen otherwise we need to break up.\n\nWould I be an asshole for doing so?",

I raised my voice and told him to never come on my property again. He told me sorry and left looking so defeated.

      "description": "So this conflict has been resolved amongst ourselves but it's been at the back of my mind about whether I was in the wrong, hopefully that doesnt break the sub's rules.\n\nIm the DM (Dungeon Master) for a group of 5 players from my friend group. We recently finished the Lost Mines of Phandelver campaign after that sort of fizzled out and I decided to run them through Waterdeep Dragon Heist next.\n\nThe majority of my group, including myself, are relatively new to D&amp;D and it consists of:\nMyself, the DM- A D&amp;D newbie whose DMed twice and played as a PC twice\nR- Formerly a Goblin Bard, now a Tiefling Cleric in the new game\nJ- A Tiefling Bloodhunter who kept his character and we just rolled him back to Lv. 1\nM- The only veteran of the group, played ~4 years, who used to be a Lizardfolk Barbarian but wanted to be a Tiefling Warlock\nAnd two other party members who dont factor into this issue.\n\nI bet you cant see the pattern here /s\n\nSo J was already a Tiefling, as I mentioned the character was just carried over between campaigns, and then when we talk about trying out a new campaign R asks about trying out a different character because he's sick of being a squishy bard. He eventually comes up with the idea of a Tiefling Cleric.\n\nHere's where we reach the AITA:\nLike I said, M wants to be a Tiefling too. Straight off the bat I tell him 'I'd rather you not be a Tiefling as I dont want too many of one species' and I repeat this multiple times and each time he tells me no, he wants to stick with the Tiefling. Its not that I have a problem with Tieflings- having too many of any race is a problem for me. It'd be the same if I had a lot of Elves or Dragonborn, I'd want some people to switch. R and J were already Tieflings and they were Tieflings first so if anyone should change it should be M.\n\nI feel like the a-hole here because I was essentially forcing him to play a different character. To me it seems obvious that M is in the wrong but I asked people both inside the group and out and while I got some support a fair few told me that I was being too harsh or that it shouldnt matter what species he played.\n\n(M did eventually switch to an Aasimar Warlock but I wanted to ask a non-bias group about the situation because I didnt want to have been the a-hole over trivial things and its been bothering me that I couldve been.)\n\nSo pass your divine judgement, AITA?",

Am I the asshole? BTW he also admitted to abusing adderal and joked about selling hard drugs when we played online, then I'd ask like \"wait what\" \"wait you did fuckin  what mate\" and he panicked and said ah nothing.

We seen doctors, specialists, she's taken antibiotics, probiotics, supplements, we've both changed our diet completely to account for mineral and other factors, but it keeps happening. If we don't have sex, she's as healthy as a horse. One night of love-making and she's making zombie sounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I feel like crap. I'm totally fine, health wise, but I have to see the woman I love on the verge of tears for half a week after sex. So I began to withdraw. I told her exactly what I was feeling and why, and she says \"don't worry, it's my problem, I'll deal with it.\" But I can't ignore it. For the past year and a bit I've been making excuses as to why I can't have sex anymore (too tired, early start at work tomorrow, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's getting to the point where she almost drags me to bed in lingerie, and when I refuse, we argue for an hour why I'm denying her sex. My point has never changed: As much as I would love to, I don't want to do something to her that will result in her being in pain. She says not to worry about it, but it's damn hard to ignore when she's groaning in pain next to me for a few nights, and I know for a fact that i'm at fault (biologically at least).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife says I'm selfish and cold-hearted for doing what I'm doing, but from where I sit, it's either hurt her feelings or feel guilty myself knowing I'm (in some way) the cause of her pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fear I have become the asshole in our marriage.",

The kind of friend that's in your general group, but you're not super personal friends with, and we rarely to never hang out. \n\nRecently, he's been open about depression, and I understand how hard it us to fight, I've had depression throughout the past 2-3 years of my life and have only started feeling happier the past 2 months. Here's the thing, I'm not leaving him alone. I still talk to him when he needs to rant and when he's in a depressive episode, but every thing i seem to do or say he takes in a hostile manner. If he makes a joke and i laugh? He claims i only do it out of pity...and he's not necessarily wrong, but I can't just tell him that. If he makes a joke and I don't laugh, he gets upset thinking I hate it. We just don't share many interests and I find talking to the guy really hard, it's like a minefield.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking like this?\n\nTL;DR: Friend has depression, and I constantly lie and force myself to be with him because I don't really enjoy his presence.",

      "description": "I am currently a student at a large university located nearly five hours away from where my family currently resides and am the oldest child and the first to be sent away to university. My family is very close knit and prioritizes familial connection over pretty much anything else. However, recently there has been much conflict between my family and myself centered around holidays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeeing as I am a student who lives an apartment and must work to pay for go out, pay rent, and buy food I got a job at Target to pay for all of these things. This is where the issue arises, as I began work back in September. Black Friday meant that I had to miss out on Thanksgiving with my family, as I live five hours away without a car, reasonably enough this upset everyone and as a response I invited them to come up the following weekend to spend time with me in order to make up for missing Thanksgiving. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow it's on to round two, as winter break comes up and as such Christmas is approaching. My family is demanding I quit my job and get a job at the University so I can spend the entirety of the break with them; However, I don't want to do this because it means I would be taking a large pay cut as well as a massive reduction in hours. In trying to reach an agreement everyone could be happy with, I decided to take off from December 18 to December 28. This means I would get to spend time with my family while my mother is not working, while my father would be free, and while my siblings would not be in school. In light of this, my family has started a campaign against the idea, saying that it is still unacceptable and that I should quit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that my family wants me home for Christmas and to spend time with them, but I also need my job in order to keep paying for rent and affording food. So am I the asshole for not quitting my job and going home all of break?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: My tight knit family wants me to quit my job in order for me to go home and spend time with them all of break.",

      "description": "So this girl that I've been talking to online for three years now has recently told me that she has begun to cut her wrists because of things that have been happening in real life. After she told me about it, I instantly became very sympathetic towards her as purposely conflicting pain upon yourself is something that I do not approve of whatsoever.\nThese past couple of days, I have been talking to her about it and trying to get her to stop and to ensure that she doesn't do it again.\n\nGetting to the joke, it happened about an two hours ago now where she told me she had got banned from a Discord server for calling all 'People who are of X nationality are all idiots' so I said in a joking manner, \"I know an idiot, and she so happens to be X nationality too!\" she did not like that and instantly told me to apologise which I did. Afterwards, I stated that other people I talk to are able to take small jokes like that so she said \"Fuck off. Don't fucking compare me with anyone ever again\" which I replied with a simple \"Ok.\" and blocked her.\n\nI can understand where she is coming from with the comparison, but I can honestly say it wasn't meant to be a comparison of \"They can do this, so why can't you\", I was simply just stating something. I can also see that because of the wrist cutting, she is in emotional (and physical) pain and maybe that joke was said at the wrong time but with her, there never really has been a right time as pretty much everything has to be serious otherwise I'd just get ignored for some time afterwards.\n\nI don't want to be the person in the wrong here as I never like to make people unhappy and always try to diffuse things and keep people smiling if I can help it.\n\nThere have been previous accounts where I felt like I should no longer be talking to her anymore and I actually did completely stop talking for 6 months before shamefully going back.\nIf I am in the wrong, then I will unblock her and apologise once again and hopefully, she'll understand. But if not then I just don't know what else to do.",

      "description": "So my girlfriend of 2 years has invited her mom and 15yo brother to spend Christmas together (this was last year). We live in a different country, so she thought it’s be nice to celebrate festive season all together as she doesn’t see the family very often.\n\nMy gf didn’t really consult this with me, and bought the flight tickets for her mom and brother for one week at ours. This was kind of annoying considering we live a small studio (but we have room enough for 4). I thought 4 days with the family would have been enough, but not the whole week! Gf explained that the tickets were at reasonable price only for a 7 day period and that getting a hotel in the city is super expensive (which is the case).\n\nWhen her family came over, my gf was working, so she’s asked me to take them to the city and show them around. I was on holidays at that time, but I was still mad at her, so I declined (I also really needed my own space due to stress at work). Then Christmas came around and my gf and her mom were cooking dinner, also brought me some presents which was nice, but I didn’t want to spend Christmas with her fam, so I left to my office. When I came back, the whole family was watching TV really loud and I felt that that was too much for me, so I turned off the TV. Her mom told me to get back to the office if I kept acting like this.\n\nNext day, gf’s mom came over and told me that I was very impolite and she was mad. I told her that she didn’t value my space, literally doing anything she wanted around the house. She was also mad that I didn’t spend time with them at all over these 7 days, but I mentioned that I’m an introvert and stressed at work, and wanted to spend Christmas with my girlfriend only. So we got in a huge argument and since last Christmas I haven’t spoken to my her mom.\n\nAITA for getting into such argument with her mom?",

      "description": "I was diagnosed with autism from an early age. My parents made it seem like this was something I should be ashamed of, so they told me I should never tell anyone else.\n\nI started this job 6 months ago. Right from the beginning my manager stressed how much our team was \"like a family\". I thought that if I didn't tell her now, we'd get off on the wrong foot. So I later pulled her aside and told her that I'm a naturally quiet / awkward person; I don't mean anything bad by it, it's just something I've always been. My last job someone complained that I was antisocial and I didn't want to give off the wrong impression. She said \"Ok. Don't worry about it, we're friendly here.\" \n\nI still made efforts to be social even though it was uncomfortable. The basics like greeting people, \"nice to meet you\", smalltalk, etc. If I finished my work early I'd always ask if I could do something more to help, or help anyone else. Called in for shifts, asked to come in early, I thought I was doing everything right. Yes, I was always going to be awkward but I thought my actions could speak louder than words.\n\nWithin 2 weeks when she realized I was never going to break out of my shell she started complaining about me. Idk if she knew I heard it, maybe she thought there was more noise in the office than there really was -- but it was within earshot. I'd hear everything clearly. Saying I was too cold, kept to myself, even calling me an asshole. It was like she forgot about our talk, or maybe she didn't care. \n\nI took it as a wake-up call though and made more of an effort to socialize. I'm pretty much a homebody so my fallback for conversations was talking about nerdy things. I was talking with my manager about some TV shows (we both watched the same one, so I made sure she was interested first) and then she just cut the conversation short, turned to the other person in the room and muttered \"It's like dealing with Sheldon Cooper.\"\n\nI kind of withdrew from her after that. The weeks went on and instead of hearing just her complain about me, my other coworkers jumped on the bandwagon and started to too. These people were friendly with me before that so it hurt. I'd hear things like \"Now that she's here it's time for everyone else to leave\" , \"Oh great here comes our favorite person\" , \"No one even likes her\" , \"I wish \\[our other coworker\\] wasn't quitting so we wouldn't have to see her as much\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven after saying all this about me she recently invited me to go to the bar with the others. Honestly after hearing so much people talking about me this way, I turned her down. It feels like if I went out with them they'd just be using me to laugh at how awkward I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know autistic people can sometimes come off as rude because we can be blunt or accidentally interrupt people. But is it really that rude for a quiet coworker to keep to themselves? It's making me feel crazy because it's not just one person saying these things.",

      "description": "I’ve been talking to this girl for like a week and we’ve gone out together a couple times. Initially she seemed really cool and funny and she seemed to be interested in me too. I never really use Facebook anymore but I was thinking of  searching her up, low and behold I found her. Anyway I kinda continue to lurk and click on her fb profile and the first thing I see is her advertising a mlm (multi level marketing) company, basically those people who sell random shit like essential oils or workout amino acids w.e. Now I wouldn’t really be put off by someone whose in sales but those types of companies are literally like cults and are just super exploitative (look up multi level marketing scams if you’re interested). One of my old co workers was in one of these companies and got fired because he would literally try to sell shit like amino acids to customers (we were both cooks in a restaurant btw lmfao so imagine how crazy these companies have to be to compel a cook come out of the kitchen and try to sell to dining customers). Anyway after seeing that I got completely turned off like I’ve never had an attribute of someone I’ve been into be a deal breaker but for me this was too much. I cringed reading through a couple of her posts trying to sell stuff. Anyway I haven’t replied to her texts in a couple days and I really don’t know what to say but I don’t really want anything to do with her either. AITA? ",

      "description": "This happened a while ago, but in some ways my friend group is still dealing with the emotional fallout, so I wanted to get some unbiased opinions.\n\nSome background: I (24F) met my friend Frank (28M) about six years ago, when I was going through a really rough time. he was there for me when I needed him, and we started to hang out almost every day. Initially we had some issues with boundaries, since he is a very touchy-feely person and I'm generally touch averse, but we talked about it and he started to be more conscious of respecting my space. Through him, I met Alice (27F), who he had dated casually for \\~3 months back in 2012. She ended their relationship because he was becoming more emotionally invested than she was, and she wasn't interested in taking things further. They lost contact for a while, but reconnected as friends a few years ago and have been very close since. \n\nAround the time Frank introduced me to Alice, he would always gush to me about how beautiful, smart, funny, etc. she was, and how I would totally understand once I got to know her. It was pretty obvious he wasn't over her, but he insisted that he had no intention of pursuing another relationship with her. He also encouraged me to try dating/hooking up with her, but I wasn't interested in sex or dating at all at that point in time.\n\nNot long after Alice and I met, Frank moved to another state and we all kept in touch through messenger. Alice and I got very close since we no longer had Frank to hang out with in person, hanging out maybe 2-3 times per week just drinking and talking about life.\n\nAbout a year ago Frank came to visit for a few weeks and stayed with Alice. I knew they had been hooking up, and suspected he still had unresolved feelings for her. This was confirmed when they both talked to me (separately) about a conversation they had where they had talked about maybe dating again in the future, in the context of an open relationship. At this point in time I had been in an extremely happy and loving non-monogamous relationship for around a year, so I was fully supportive of the idea. (I just want to reiterate, they had only talked about it as a possibility, and neither of them said they actually considered themselves to be in a relationship.)\n\nAfter Frank left Alice and I started hanging out more and one night when we were both a little tipsy we started to make out. I don't remember what prompted it, but it was just casual and didn't go further than kissing and some very light bdsm. We both agreed that we were interested in continuing this dynamic, but we thought we should let Frank know what had happened and that it would most likely happen again in the future. When we told him, at first he responded by saying it was fine, but he later called both of us acting very upset, and apparently he told Alice that what she had done was wrong because I was in a relationship (even though everyone involved knew we weren't monogamous). He later apologized for \"acting weird,\" but Alice responded \"I would just like to be able to make out with people without it becoming weird and wrecking our friendships.\" \n\nShe told him that based on the way he had reacted she could no longer see herself being in a relationship with him, and he called me, saying that he was angry with her for changing her mind, leading him on, etc. He also said that when he had talked about me and her hooking up in the past, it had been a joke and I should have known better than to act on it. I told him that I understood he was upset, but I didn't feel I could honestly apologize since they weren't in a relationship, exclusive or otherwise, and he didn't have any right to tell either of us who we could or could not hook up with. \n\nAlice and I haven't hooked up since all of this happened even though the attraction's still there because we don't want to hurt Frank, but I honestly feel a little resentful that he gets to make that call for all of us. I've distanced myself a bit from their friendship as a result, but every now and then I feel like maybe I really was in the wrong and I'm being the selfish one here. ",

She loves her bio mom and her dad, but hates her step mom. She is constantly rude to her and tells her, her problems aren't real. For example she was born without a hip and had sergery as a baby. But as a result she has tremendous pain most of the time, but her step mom tells her it's not real and to get over it. She has pain meds but step mom gets really mad if she takes them. \n\nHer mom also gets really mad at her for the most ridiculous things, like getting fingerprints on the fridge. I have seen it first hand and I was blown away at how the step mom reacted. She yells at her if she finds a pine needle in the house. Just in general really small stuff that is insane to be punished for. \n\nShe has tried telling her dad about it but he doesnt seem to care and when she talks to her bio mom she just says she should figure it out with her dad. So it seems like she is stuck. But it's gone on for so long she despises going to her dads. I think since she is 17 she should have more say in where she stays especially if she is miserable for half of her life. \n\nSo would she be the ass whole for wanting to go to her moms house full time or atleast more than 50/50?",

That said, I have this friend I play video games with and she’s transgender(male to female) and I had no idea that she was until I figured it out when she said she was going to a gay, queer, and trans meet up. It was kind of in the back of my mind for a while but it didn’t really bother me. I asked her about it and she confirmed it like it wasn’t a big deal so I assumed she was pretty comfortable with people knowing. Again, this is all new to me as I have never met a trans person before. \n\nAnyways, enough of the back story. I was playing with her when my other buddy joined the call and we played a couple games. I could tell that they were getting along nicely. Couple of days go by and me and him were talking in dms when asked me if I was dating her. I said no. He asked me if I had any advice for talking with her and I just told him so stuff she liked. While we were talking about her I told him that she was transgender and thats when things went downhill. I don’t know what he said to her but she msged me an hour later extremely upset and pissed off. I know he didn’t say anything mean, I think it was mostly because I told him that she was trans.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nI think I should add that my friend was fine with her being trans. He’s bisexual.",

We had a house rented in Hilton Head with a small pool, bike paths, the works. Great set up. In the few days leading up to the trip, my son was not feeling himself. Took him to pediatrician two times, ears looked fine, lungs were clear, no problema. \n\nSo we hop on plane and get to Hilton Head. While we are waiting for check in, we are driving around, getting groceries, etc. Now the boy is vomitting. OK. Great. What can we do to ensure that he is not going to get the other family’s kids sick? \n\nSo we take him to the ER. Get a rapid flu test and sure as shit he tests positive. So now everyone starts wearing a mask around him and they close our exam room door—isolation. Get the picture? The ER crew thought it was the real thing. \n\nSo we get a hotel room. We cant stay at house with other family, because there would be no way to keep my boy from the other kids. Meanwhile, we have a sick pukey 5 year old in a hotel room away from home. Decisions.\n\nI got us on a plane back home the next day. My wife is walking around in a daze. She had been so looking forward to a week hanging with her buddy and their kids. She agreed that we had to leave when I got us back home, now she says she wishes we stayed. Of course compounding everything is the fact that my boy is running around like there is nothing wrong.

I find her rude, obnoxious, fake, controlling and she’s the type of person who will insult you with a smile and is a master of passive/agressive denigrating comments. About 5 years ago I snapped and sent her a text basically telling her to fuck off. Since then, my FIL has been coming to visit every few weeks by himself. He spends a whole day, has tea and leaves at 8-9pm. It’s quite nice because my husband and he spend the day working in the garage, watching sports and playing with my son, so I leave them to it so they have quality time together and I only join them for tea. This has been the unspoken arrangement for years. Now I’m being told that my FIL said to my husband that “we will come to visit tomorrow”. I told my husband I will not be there if she does turn up and now he’s annoyed with me because he just wants an easy life and doesn’t want to explain why I’m not there at our house for the entire day. I offered to call my FIL and explain myself but my DH said to leave it be. It fills me with anxiety just thinking about having to see her and I feel cornered where I will explode and tell her why I don’t like her and make things worse for my DH and my FIL, which I don’t want to do but will have to speak up if I’m here. I’ve always felt that my house is my safe zone and that I would never have to deal with this again! ",

      "description": "I (18M) have been with my GF (18F) for about a year now. At first things were great, it was my first relationship and I was excited to finally have all these moments and share experiences with a girl that I really liked. However, things started to change around the last month or so. Hanging out started to feel like a job and less like something that was fun. My GF and I hung out for around 4 hours almost every day, and I did enjoy the times that we were together. But, things would go down the drain once I went back to my house and the day was over. One of my favorite things to do was to get online and play games with some friends after hanging out, however, she would take it as though I am ignoring her and she would accuse me of \"hating her\", to which I'd reply that I don't and then all of a sudden a fight over text would break out.  It blew me away since it was such a 180 from what she was feeling earlier that day. This would occur every other day for a couple of days until I told her that it was a problem. She understood and stopped doing it for that time being. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen came last week Friday. Her and I had another date on Thursday, and she told me that we might not be able to hang out all day because she has something to do in the evening. I said that it's totally okay and that we can hangout Saturday. But, she said that we can still hangout on early morning on Friday. I said okay to that too and I went home. Well, Friday morning comes by and I wake up to no one home but my sister. This was around 9 so I assumed my parents were gone and so I had to watch my sister until someone came back. I played games for the time being, this went on until around 11. Then, once my parents came home, a part for my car came in and so I installed that right away because I needed to, this took around an hour. After that, my parents told me to go get an oil change and so I did, this took until around 1:30. Next, I came home and my mom wanted me to eat. At this point it was 2 o'clock, so I told my GF, who was starting to get irritated because I still didn't go over, that I am going to eat quickly so that Her and I can hang out for about 2 hours or so. She did not like that. She blew up on me, she started to tell me that I care more about my car then her and that since I wanted to play games, we won't hang out at all. I was taken aback and I started to worry. I told her that I had to watch my sister and that I enjoyed playing my games for that time-being. She did not care. She started to say that I didn't love her and that I like the people who I play games more than her, even though I play with these people once a week. She cussed and wouldn't listen to the fact that I told her I had to stay home and that I needed an oil change. She even accused me of liking other girls more than her, even though we ALL hung out ONCE and she was the one who was distant the whole day, while I was trying to bring her into the conversations and trying to have her not be so distant AND even though the girls that were mentioned were her friends for about 2 years prior, and I had only met them recently and I have never cheated or have lied to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about 2 hours of arguing over this I grew angry. I thought to myself that this was insane because I had hung out with her every day of last week for hours on end, and to get yelled at over something like that was crazy. I couldn't handle this and so I told her that I felt like I needed a break from feeling like I'm controlled. She said that she was very sorry and that she feels bad for telling me all the things that she did. The next day I agreed to see her and to talk about things. She started to cry and ask me what was going to happen, and I told her that I didn't know, but that I was sure I wanted a break from all the stress. This made her cry even more but then I asked to go home. Before I was going to leave she muttered, \"So you're gonna go play your games now aren't you\" in a sarcastic tone. I looked at her and she started to cry and apologize and I left. I texted her saying that I wanted a break but she kept telling me that she still wants to talk about it and come to a compromise. I then told her again to please respect my choice and that I wanted my space. She then told me that she dropped off my Christmas presents in front of my door while I didn't know and still proceeded to text me and tell me that she wants to talk. I kept asking her to respect my choice but she still persisted and so I blocked her number because I want a clear mind. I wanted to handle this in the most mature way but she kept crying and telling me that she will change and that I cannot shut her out of my life. I couldn't handle that anymore. Am I an asshole for doing this?",

Also, I don't have much PTO saved up and I really wouldn't want to take Monday off. As it happens I have a doctor's appointment at 3:15 this Monday so between that and the funeral/luncheon,  I wouldn't really have time at the office so it would basically force me to use PTO so I still get paid  for the day. Also I never knew my Uncle's mother. He married in to the family so I don't know anyone he's related to.  If I don't go to the funeral mass, and only go to the visitation on Sunday, Does this make me the asshole? ",

I want to message them again and just straight up ask if they deleted the comment or what, but I don't want to be so extra like that.

      "description": "Recently took a trip to Portugal and was about to embark on my first leg of a journey back to the west coast of the United States. My first flight was from Lisbon to Atlanta so keep in mind this was going to be a very long flight (\\~8hrs).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI boarded the plane and took my seat which was in the third row of business class. I was by the window and the way the cabin is configured (1-2-1) there is no one sitting directly next to me. I selected this seat upon purchase with both the view I'd have with two windows and not having to sit next to anyone since I was flying alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few minutes after I got settled into my seat a mother who is flying with her son who is around 10-12yrs old comes up to me and asks if I could switch with her so she could be seated in front of her son. I thought this was odd because they still wouldn't be able to talk to each other or even see each other during the flight the way the seats are set up. I was considering doing it so I then took the next obvious step asked her where she was sitting. She pointed to a seat in business class but it's the one seat that is still up against the fuselage of the plane but has no windows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her I would like to remain in my seat and I would have switched if it weren't for the lack of windows at her seat since I feel more comfortable flying when I can look out the window. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind these are not cheap seats and she booked her 10-12 year old son into a business class seat away from her instead of sitting in economy/premium economy where she could have easily sat next to him.

      "description": "For context, my baby sister is three years old. She has bad habits due to the rest of my family, same as me, which I have identified, and am trying to correct in myself, as well as her so it never happens to her.\n\nToday, she continuously smeared my shirt with spit covered toys and wiped her nose on/licked me repeatedly. Standard three-year-old being a three-year-old stuff. I decided after warning her for the 3rd time that she would get time out, and I took her doll, after promising to give it back after she finished her timeout.\n\nOf course she didn't want to do it, and kept looking for someone to cry to to get her out (My dad or sisters, she has been raised to know that if she cries loud enough, she gets whatever she wants, and I've been trying to correct this behavior). No one was home when we started, and they all showed up before she finished her timeout (10-15 minutes, initially 5 before she kept getting up and running around). Throughout the entire process I made sure not to yell at her or handle her roughly in any way. My sisters came home and brought food, insisting my punishment was stupid, and that she should eat. They relented and said that after she ate, she would go back for five minutes. I agreed, considering that I may have been over-reacting earlier. She kept going to them after she finished, and eventually I got her back into the chair.\n\nMy dad came home right after and went to his room, across the house. She started crying, and yelling his name, and he yelled from across the house, instead of wanting to comprehend the situation, because in his head she was an angel, could do no wrong, and could get whatever she wanted. He didn't even want to hear an explanation, and picked her up and told her she didn't have to do anything she didn't want. She asked for her doll back, and my father tried to force me to give it back to her. I told him if she finished her timeout she could have it, because she had to learn actions had consequences. He refused, and doubled down, saying he would make my life miserable if I didn't give it to him. My sister gave her a different doll, and the situation with him resolved itself in terms of nothing else happening, but the issue was still present. I told him he was teaching her that if she cried loud enough, she could get whatever she wanted. He said he didn't care, and that I didn't know anything about kids.\n\nI will give her back the original doll after she's forgotten about this, in a day or two because I'm not a monster, and I won't punish her for something she had no real say in.\n\nI didn't make this post looking for validation. The last thing my dad said to me threw me for a loop: \"You don't have any idea how to raise kids, you f\\*\\*king idiot.\" I'm wondering if I'm the asshole to my sister. I accept your judgments.",

      "title": "AITA for not hanging out with my friend even though she drove two hours",
      "description": "Background: I live about two hours from my friend. She used to come visit me pretty regularly and stay at my house before summer started and I started my summer job as a lifeguard. A couple times she visited me she got overly drunk and I ended up taking care of her. Which is fine, it happens to the best of us but it started to be constant. One time she came home and ate my parents leftovers from the fridge which she did not remember doing. Another time I had went to sleep at 2 am and she had stayed up (still drunk) until 7 am when my parents woke up and were convinced she had to be on drugs with how she was acting. She also left me at the bar one time for two hours to take home a boy. She paid for an uber to take him to my own house, while I was still at the bar waiting for her. \n\nI had forgiven her for that and understood there was a miscommunication. She explained she thought I had left the bar first and was only trying to get home(long story but kinda made sense). So I wasn't potentially trying to avoid her. However I stared work and I was working 60 hours a week, ten hour shifts a day in the sun. On top of that I had an online class. She started to come down and visit to meet up with a boy she met while visiting me once. She would get a hotel room since she thought my parents were mad at her for previous visits. She would not tell me she was coming until she was about to leave or already here. Now I could have seen her after work even if just briefly. But I had always made plans before that, I have an active social life, or I'd be so drained from work I would just want to sleep, or I had school work I need to do before the end of the night. (I tend to procrastinate). This happened three times, each time I explained I needed more notice so I could plan to hang out or rearrange my schedule. \n\nShe said I could have hung out with her for at least 20 minutes because we do not live close to each other. I think the worst thing i did was I asked to facetime her and she said I could come visit cause she drove down. I said no I was going to nap instead. I think this was the last straw for my friend since I offered to facetime which meant I did have the time to hang out but didn't. I had the time but not the energy, I had just gotten home and didn't feel like going back out. Had I known she was in the area I certainly would have driven to her straight from work. \n\nShe has never worked a day in her life so I feel like she doesn't understand the strain. My job is very easy but I get very sleepy from it. She no longer wants to be my friend because she feels like I am selfish for not putting in the time to see her and I did not defend her to my parents when she would be overly drunk at my house. I should have made more of an effort to facetime her and text her, I do note that. So am I the asshole for not putting in more time for her? It was multiple times she visited and I said no to seeing her but I feel like her intentions weren't even to see me and I am confused to why we are no longer friends. She was one of my best friends for ten years.",

      "description": "Ever since I’ve been little (I’m 22 now), I’ve always had to wait with my Mom outside of stores and restaurants so she could smoke. I’d always get so annoyed, especially in winter, but I never said anything because I never knew any different.\n\nYesterday me and my Mom were at the airport to catch a four hour flight to go visit my sister. She had just smoked a cigarette in the car and after we checked our bags and were about to get in line at TSA, she says she needs to smoke a cigarette.\n\nSo as she goes outside, I stand outside the TSA line with all of our luggage while I wait for her. I start to get pretty impatient because the line looked pretty long and was growing longer. \n\nAfter 5 minutes she finally comes back in and I told her the line grew pretty long while she was outside and she didn’t say anything. It irritates me that she just doesn’t seem to care that I have to wait for her to smoke all the time.\n\nAs we were waiting in line, I asked why she doesn’t just get nicotine gum or something for when she’s in public. She responds by saying she can just go outside anywhere and smoke so there’s no point. I told her in an irritated tone that it would keep everyone else from always having to wait on her to smoke.\n\nShe got defensive and said she just won’t smoke anymore, which we both know won’t happen. After awhile I felt bad and apologized for being disrespectful about it but I’m not sure I was wrong for saying something in general. \n\nAITA for thinking I shouldn’t have to wait on my Mom to smoke a cigarette?\n\nTl;dr My Mom has to stop and smoke wherever she goes. I said something about it and implied I shouldn’t have to wait for her to smoke, she got defensive. AITA?",

      "description": "Based on the title I would clearly be an asshole but there is a lot more to this situation, so bare with me. \n\nI had been with this girl around 11 months when this happened but we had been falling apart for several months prior. She was a very sweet girl, but she really bottled her emotions and she knew I could tell. \n\nFor the entirety of our relationship I could sense when she was feeling down, so I would periodically ask her how she was feeling.

I would have to constantly make decisions about pretty much anything because the only response I would get would be “idk or idc.” This frustrated me a lot because I just wanted to see her input on things and a bit of reciprocation. \n\nNow around 9 months into our relationship things were still extremely stagnant, other than our sex lives. Being 17 our drives were very high but the sex was also great and unlike anything I’d experienced before. But regardless of sex, I was still disappointed by our lack of change. It was around this time where I was convinced I had to end things. \n\nHere’s the catch: we both have the SAT coming up in a month, and she was obviously very stressed about the exam. I decided that I would just have to tough it out until we finished the exam because I didn’t want to distract her with a break up. But in this time she would shut herself away from me even more. \n\nAfter the exam we treat each other to a concert. At the concert I could tell that she was down I I just couldn’t figure it out. I confronted her and told her that I wanted to talk about her feelings just not at the concert. \n\nA week later I go to her house to study for a test. Every time we hung out we had sex, so it was only natural for us to do that. But further on that day I finally brought it up, where she confessed that she was barely eating to the point of being unhealthy. I felt devastated by this because I she was in pain, but I had tried so hard to help her. It suddenly hit me like a bus that it was really only the sex that held our relationship together. I didn’t want friends with benefits, I wanted someone I could be emotional with so we could connect better. After more than 11 months of a relationship, it was too dissatisfying to just have good sex. I then told her that we needed time apart because we needed to grow as people. \n\nAs a final point, I had not planned on breaking up with her that day because I didn’t want her stressed for this exam, but I just couldn’t do it anymore. \n\nI appreciate anyone’s input and I’ll gladly answer questions. \n",

      "description": "My wife and I have been married since July but have been together since high school. She brought up the idea of buying a house, telling me that she was talking to her best friend about it and this friend referred a realtor to us.\n\nI have my own concerns with buying a house, especially at our age (26) and with me not making quite as much money as I'd like. I brought up different variables to consider before we even talked to a realtor but she said they came off and me not wanting to do this. I'm all for looking into what it would take to get our credit in check and talking with a realtor about the next move we should make, but I LOATHE talking on the phone.\n\nEvery time we have to make important company phone calls, I'm left to call. Whether it's her name on the account or mine, I'm always the one calling. I too once had an irrational fear of calling anyone, but I quickly had to get over that because my wife hates talking on the phone just as much if not more.\n\nShe pushed and pushed and pushed to get the idea of buying a house set deeply in our goals for 2019 and then hit me with \"well you're gonna have to call and set up the appointment because I can't\". I asked her why she can't and she told me she just doesn't like talking on the phone. I told her \"I'm sorry but I don't like talking on the phone either, I'll support this decision and I'm all for it, but you have to call\". \n\nShe didn't take that very well. Already frustrated at her response, I told her, again, that I think she should call, it'll help her get over her fear. She asked me why? I call all the time and she \"physically can't\".\n\nAt this point I was beyond frustrated and I could feel my temper rising and I flat out told her \"I just want you to... (Trying to find an easier way to tell her, to no avail) ...get over it\".\n\nI was a little taken aback by how the words came out of my mouth, I'm sure I could've been a little more tactful, but I'm tired of dancing around and navigating through the many words swirling in my brain to come up with an easier/nicer way of telling her.\n\nCue the name calling. I'm an ass hole for trying to get her to call the realtor (or as I see it, following through on a plan she worked to hard to convince me to support) and I'm an even bigger ass hole for pushing the issue.\n\nI just want to help her get over her fear of calling people. She talks on the phone when she HAS to such as work or a random number calling her, but when telling her she HAS to because I don't want to is completely different I guess? I just don't wanna be a doormat and feel like she should be the one calling since she brought it up and debated on why we should buy a house instead of renting another year. Calling people on the phone sucks and I can't stand it. But my fears and phobias get pushed aside and if I say yes, I'll feel like a doormat. \n\nSo Reddit, am I the ass hole for telling her to get over it?\n",

      "description": "My wife and I have been married for 2 years now. I have about a year left before I am ready to graduate from college, while she is still in her first year (for context, I'm 24, and she is 23).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause we are students and live on incredibly limited income, I told her I didn't feel comfortable to start having kids right away. She was upset, but she understood. But now she seems dead set on getting a dog. She claims it would help with her depression, and give her something to nurture. I tell her if she gets assigned an ESA, that is totally fine, but I don't want to take care of a dog right now that isn't assigned or prescribed to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of medical reasons, my graduation was pushed back a year, which means that we are planning to have kids a year later than we originally planned. At first I didn't think this would be a big deal because I already compromised to start trying for kids in my last semester.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had dogs in the past, and I've seen how much care and money they can require. I had a dog growing up that got sick. It got better, but it required a ton of care, and cost my family a couple thousand just in vet bills. I don't want a dog because if that same thing happens, neither of us have the time or the money and would have to end up putting it down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of this, we live in a very small apartment. It is basically three rooms, one of which is our bedroom. I am also gone most of the day, usually spending 12+ hours on campus every week day. My wife works and is normally gone for 8+ hours  a day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wifes response is that if that happens, I should just get a job (I work sales jobs during the summer. I don't make a ton of money, but it is enough so that I don't have to work during school) and to not spend so much time studying. I feel like that is a really selfish thing to say, considering my tuition is covered by a scholarship that covers 85% of the tuition (dependent on grades) and my parents covering the rest (which is dependent on me keeping the other scholarship). I feel like I don't want to devote time away from my schooling this next year just so we could have a dog. I've tried to compromise with her and say 'lets get a dog in a year when I don't have to worry about school, or better yet, lets just have kids at that point' but she insists on getting a dog this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo today my wife told me that until I said yes to a dog, she is sleeping in another room, not talking to me, and not having sex with me. I feel like this is an over reaction to asking her to wait a year to get a dog. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSooooo....AITA for telling my wife I don't want a dog yet?",

      "description": "I went to a football (American) game over the weekend and my friend invited me to his tailgate beforehand. I informed him that I was planning on going to a different tailgate hosted by another friend and he said to just come to the game a little earlier and stop by his. I said ok I will stop by for an hour or so no big deal. \n\nI get to this friend’s tailgate about 4 hours before game time and stay for about an hour. They had bought a keg and were grilling hot dogs. Now since I was planning on eating at the other tailgate I didn’t bring any food, but I did bring my own alcohol. He offered to grab me a beer so I accepted and asked if I wanted a hot dog so I said sure. I had one 12 oz beer and a single hot dog. My SO was also with me and she had one beer as well. So in total we had two beers from the keg, and a single hot dog. I thank my friend and head out to the other tailgate.\n\nA day after the game I get a paypal request from this friend asking for $10 each for my SO and I - $20 total. He says this is for the costs of the tailgate. Now usually I am fine with arrangements like this if I am told in advance. However, since I was unaware of the arrangement and wouldn’t even have accepted his invite if I knew I was going to be billed for it, I don’t think I should have to pay this. Additionally, my actual consumption of things at the event would not have amounted to more than a few dollars in actual cost. I feel like he is just billing me to subsidize his fun.\n\nAITA for rejecting his request for payment?",

      "description": "Two years ago I got out of an emotion al abusive relationship with someone.  I have now been dating a new guy for a while now, probably about a month. Hes very sweet to me and treats me really well but I have noticed that he gets inordinately angry over things. For an example, earlier today he messaged me telling me he wanted to \"slap this little bitch\" that was sitting across from him. When I asked why his response was \"because hes has a problem and is making it my problem\". Again I asked how and he said something along the lines of the other guy acting like tough shit because he was sitting beside his girlfriend. \n\nI tried to change the subject because I was uncomfortable and he proclaimed \"I think I still have anger issues\" which I agreed with. I then tell him that anger issues like that tend to give me really bad anxiety because two years ago I got out of an emotionally and mentally abusive relationship with someone who had really bad anger issues. So I automatically start tensing ho around people when they get angry. When I brought it up with him he said he wouldnt be reactive around me and \"I'll keep my opinion to myself too around you\". And said he would never take his anger out on me.\n\nTldr\nAm I the asshole for now being worried about continuing to date someone with anger issues after getting out of an abusive relationship ? Not because I think he will be abusive like my ex but just because I know his anger will cause me anxiety? ",

      "description": "About a year and a half ago, my old car got totaled while it was parked in front of the house. A neighbor had a handyman type person over with a truck and he must've hit the gas instead of the brakes and demolished my car by backing into it. After being told I shouldn't have parked there and how this is somehow my fault for putting it there (I wasn't allowed to park in the driveway). \n\nAnyway, we begin talking about a replacement car. He said he would buy it, which was really cool of him. He said I could use the insurance money from this car plus a bit extra that he would give me to replace it. I picked out my choice and he didn't like it. The only alternative he gave me is that I should go to Canada and bring a car back because the currency conversion is in our favor. I did not like this idea at all, so I kept bugging him to get the car I found in our own country. \n\nI have to be fair, I was getting upset and being a bit pushy, since I thought his idea was trash and he didn't suggest anything else. Eventually he said fine, put the car on a credit card and when the 0% interest rate on it is over, he will take over. \n\nFast forward a year later and he flat out lied. I have all the debt on a credit card and I'm livid that he would do that to me. If he told me he wouldn't help, I would have gotten a cheaper car. When I ask him about it, he never apologizes, and says I was too pushy about getting the car and that's why it ended up like this. He said he didn't have the money now either. Well fine, I guess it is what it is.\n\n Fast forward a month and he buys a 70k truck. I was absolutely livid. I didn't blow up at him or anything but he was so confused when I didn't want to be involved with picking it out. He thought I was jealous of him and thought I couldn't be happy for him as a result. I just felt so neglected. Ever since then I ignore him. He asks me to find accessories for the truck to spend close to the value of my car on it, and I just glare at him. I go days without talking to him now. I feel bad though because I live with him and he feeds me ( not enough though, maybe every other day if I average it out). But that's the limit of our interaction. I'm just living there. When I need help, he curses me for contacting my mother and tells me to live with her ( i would but there is too much here that I would lose aka girlfriend and I just got a job). I can't depend on him for anything. Am I an asshole for being so resentful?",

      "title": "WIBTA If I tell my ex-best friend''s \"baby daddy\" he's not the father?",
      "description": "Basically I'm facing a bit of an ethical dilemma and I'm pretty deep into this emotionally so who better to ask than the internet? At the core, my question is WIBTA if I were to tell the \"baby daddy\" of my ex-best friend that he is most likely not the father, and at the very least he needs to get a DNA test done to confirm it before he throws his life down the drain? Seems like an easier question, but tbh my main motivating force behind this is revenge against my best friend, so that seems....conflicting.\n\nMy best friend is in her early 20's. I'm in my 30's, and male. A bit unorthodox, but we've had a strangely open and honest, close connection since we met, the age thing never bothered either of us, so we've just gone with it. It works for us. But we are in different places of our lives obviously. She's trying to be young and free and I'm looking more to settle down. I also have things figured out a lot more and she's trying to find herself and be young and free. So she is always needing support. Sometimes financially, and I've helped her with bills before, but mostly just always being there for her, being supportive, encouraging, and helping her see herself the way I see her when she's depressed. She is not able to do a lot of these things for me; she's been surrounded by garbage people her whole life that treat her like trash so I don't think she's ever really learned how to be a good friend. But I don't need the support usually the way she does, and we've talked about it honestly with each other, and she tries, and works to be better, so it didn't seem like a big deal usually. \n\nGlossing over a lot of drama (cuz she always has drama), I catch feelings and fall for her. We've always been flirty since the beginning, and we've gone back and forth on the dating thing, but thru it all we've been able to talk openly and honestly with each other so we've remained best friends. She doesn't feel the same way, but has off and on had romantic feelings for me according to her and has gone back and forth on it. \n\nWe end up having a fight (reason not too important, basically she told me she wanted to try a relationship then a week later told me she only said that to make sure I stayed her friend and so I wouldn't leave to go back on the road for work),  and she ghosts me for a couple weeks. She supposedly gets pregnant during this time with \"baby daddy\". The night of our fight tho, she had taken a pregnancy test cuz she was worried she was pregnant with a guy she had broken up with right before I got back and she wanted us to try. She had sex with him up to a couple days before the test was taken. \n\nI was suspicious from the beginning that it was really baby daddy's kid. She and I started talking again when she found out she was pregnant and then baby daddy ghosted her a week or two later cuz she wouldn't have an abortion. He was in college, came from a good family, and his parents saw her as white trash that was wrecking their sons life. I was a bit more distant when we started talking again cuz I felt like I could no longer trust her, but I felt bad for her situation and still cared a lot about her so I tried to help how I could. \n\nSo we're getting back into things over the next couple months, getting very close again, and start looking for an apartment together. I still have the feelings, she's still back and forth, but I just want my best friend to have a safe, good home while she's pregnant since she's basically couch surfing at this point after getting evicted. \n\nSo everything is good, I'm being crazy supportive again, we're having good times, I'm going to her doctors appointments with her, we're planning a home, baby daddy is nowhere to be found. Then as she's texting me pics of the place we are getting while I'm at work, she blows up about a flirty joke I send her. Says she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me, never will, and the apt is off the table. She said she only told me there was a chance between us to make me happy. It had taken a lot for her to regain my trust and I felt like our lives were moving in a good direction, she and I had talked a lot about how even if we weren't in a relationship she wanted me to be there as a male role model and doing all the pregnancy stuff with her had made me start getting really attached to the idea of having that kid around. And she knows I want kids. It doesnt help that im in love with her and we were planning a home. It was incredibly vulnerable territory for me emotionally, but i was trying to do the best i could so she was taken care of. All that was gone in the space of 20 minutes, for what I felt like was no reason. \n\nI asked her the next day what the hell happened. Her response is that baby daddy had shown back up, told her he loved her and wanted to be a family. I told her she was being an idiot. We tried to work things out for a day or two, but I was feeling incredibly hurt, incredibly betrayed (I already had massive trust issues she knew about), and she was dead set on never anything romantic and she couldn't see past my feelings for her. So she blocked me on everything and ghosted me. \n\nThe other day I noticed the time stamp on a picture I had of her, worked some math in my head, and realized her supposed conception date was literally the day after she had taken her pregnancy test. I am almost 100% certain at this point it is not baby daddy's kid. I am feeling hurt beyond belief, I feel like I lost my best friend for not a very good reason at all, and I feel like she was just using me this whole time for financial and emotional support. She won't talk to me, won't talk about what happened with our mutual friends, and offers no explanation. So I'm feeling super used and betrayed. I know if this guy finds out its not his kid that he'll happily bail. He never wanted the kid in the first place and she and him had been done before she discovered she was pregnant. Telling him will blow up her world and cause her immeasurable grief. I want revenge, as petty as that sounds, for being such an incredible friend to her and always being there for her no matter what hurt it caused me, and then her dropping the friendship like it meant nothing. That would make me an asshole, but the ethical dilemma is should the \"baby daddy\" be told the truth so he knows? I would think if I was not involved that he should be told for his own happiness, but I have to admit my driving force is revenge. \n\nSo yea, WIBTA for telling the \"baby daddy\" of my ex-best friend that it's not his kid?",

Fast forward to the morning, I tell myself to remember to grab my papers, but it's kinda shoved in the back of my head. We leave and it's not until we arrive that I realized I forgot my papers.

My mom is the type of person who will teach me life lessons when they come around in a real situation every chance she gets. But in my opinion my learner permit is a huge exception and she should let me off the hook.

She says that she might be able to take me back tomorrow, but there's no guarantee.\n\nI realize that this is my fault, but there was still an open window to run back and grab the paperwork and maybe my mother shouldn't be so hooked on teaching me a life lesson in this circumstance.

My sister wasn't at the party cuase she was at the party i was at as she wanted to be at my frist highschool party and he wanted to go to his cousin's party. Now fast forward today he comes back to school while my sister is home completely heartbroken. I got up to him and said \"what the actually fuck who even are you anymore what happen to the guy who would come over our house almost everyday for about a year what the fuck happen to the guy who was like my older brother what the fuck happen to the guy my sister cried on when my dad died in a car accident.\" He said \"Cody just get away from me i don't need anymore shit from you especially\" then i said \" what your upset that your friends don't talk to you anymore that you traded you first girlfriend of 2 years for a quick fuck at a Halloween party\" he said \"just leave me alone how many times do i got to tell everyone I'm sorry i was drunk if i could I would take it back\". When he said that I just stoped following him and let him go I'm having a weird mix of emotions like i fell bad for him but I also hate him. AITA",

( large house 30 years of woodworking and hoarding of \\*soon\\* reconstructed furniture my grandfather is hoarding and buying to resell) Im probably only there for 2 weeks.\n\nnow for the problem: Im currently working in a different country only coming home every 4-5 months at best. the reason why i can visit my home so frequently is because my employer pays for the trip back. The reason why he pays for it is because i dont work mon-fri. i work every day of the week.

I come from a strict Catholic family, so being gay did not go down well. I came out to my parents age 14 after almost a year with my boyfriend. My parents immediately kicked me out and I moved in with my boyfriend and his parents. His parents went on to literally raise me through my teenage years. My parents made no attempt to contact me, and tried to get my three siblings to stop talking to me also (although they didn't listen, thankfully). My parents and I never had an extremely close relationship anyway, so after dealing with the initial rejection I moved on with my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward six years. I was 19, been with my husband for six years, and he asked me to marry him. I said yes, and the news got back to my parents through my sister. My other sister let slip in conversation that my parents knew, and she was initially reluctant to tell me what they had said. After some prying, she told me the gist of it and of course, it was extremely homophobic and toxic - I thought maybe they would've changed or missed me, but I guess not. Again, I'm hurt but I move on. We get married two years later and I don't hear anything about my parents apart from a couple of comments about how it's a shame they weren't there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my partner and I have a four month old baby daughter through surrogacy. She is the light of our lives and we've been having a wonderful, not too difficult time. However, the news gets back to my parents, again. I think my sister thought this would be a time to build bridges. My parents suddenly get a change of heart. My sister gives my mother my email address, and she sends me a long, somewhat cheesy email about wanting to see her granddaughter. She says she will fly over from Italy to England where we live now, and she wants a relationship with our daughter. In this email, she only calls my husband my \"friend\" and seems overall disinterested in getting to know him or about our relationship. This really upsets me, obviously, and it seems like her coming over to see our daughter despite still disapproving of my relationship would be horrifically awkward and uncomfortable. I really don't know what to do. I want to tell her where to go, but at the same time I feel I might be being unfair. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Mother kicked me out ten years ago for being gay and has been consistently nasty about me ever since. Now I have a daughter and she suddenly wants to be in her life.",

      "description": "Sorry for the weird format I am on mobile.\n\nLet me just make myself clear, I’m not trying to say that what I did was completely justified, I am 15(nearly 16) and I feel awful for what I’ve done.\nI’ve noticed that every time I have a group of friends they seem to drift apart and so I’ve used a sort of strategy to try and keep them together.\n\nWhat I would do was make myself a major annoyance but try not to make myself get to the point where I would be not a friend, and I would always back off when I felt I was too much and attempt to make it up with gifts,food,etc. The first time I did this it worked from 4th to 7th grade. I’d either be annoying or shut stand at the sidelines and they would always make fun of me. It had gotten to the point where the insults had gotten real personal, but I didn’t say anything, I had just fired back with harsher words and actions. This went back and forth until 7th grade where I had made one of my friends cry, I cried too because I didn’t mean for things to get that far but I had said my crying was for other reasons. After this event I apologized and only poked around the group occasionally but not be annoying and try to atone for what I had done. We all went to different high schools including the new friends I made in the 8th grade that I really liked. (They were great and I didn’t even try to be annoying.) Some of the group said that they had forgiven me but I had always felt that was never true, and I still torture my mind with the words they had said.\n\nIn the 9th grade I had no friends and barely any people from my previous schools, but I eventually found a group that was very kind and I really cared for all of them. Two people in this group started dating and eventually went through a rough patch which split into three groups one trying to comfort the guy, one trying to comfort the gal, and one who was trying to avoid the bullshit. I had tried the strategy again but this time I knew I wouldn’t be apart of the group. I had annoyed them in the usual way by being cocky and acting like I wasn’t, but tried to make them laugh or at least be happy by showing them memes and funny videos I learned would appeal to them. It worked from what I know, but eventually I was just pushed to the sidelines and everyone just had their own conversations. After that I isolated myself, but always tried to think of how happy they are without me. I’m in 10th grade and still y’all to some of them individually, but I don’t consider them true friends and I’m pretty sure they feel the same. I know I’m a bad person and I am very sorry if I hurt you.\n\nI’ll be happy answering any questions about this and I just posted this to see how people would react if they knew what I had done.\n\n",

I normally leave a product if theres only 2 or 3 of them left on the shelf incase someone else wants/needs them and would just pick a different kind of bread in that situation. This time when I picked up the bread there were about 5 loaves left so I thought I would just take one and didn't worry about it too much. I spent the next thirty minutes doing the rest of my shopping and then went to pay. As I was waiting in line I saw a guy with his son (about 12 y/o) go up to an employee and ask if they had any more of the bread which I got, he said if there was none on the shelves then they didn't. I didn't say anything about me having one since I just finished work and wanted to get home and there were a few people in the queue behind me so leaving the queue to say something would've added a few minutes to my wait. I'm sure there were plenty other kinds of bread, just none of the specific one that I had. I felt really bad about not saying anything and think I probably was the asshole since he had a son and was polite to the employee.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I am a senior in high school and as more college acceptances roll in, I’ve been hearing back from some great schools. One of the schools I’ve gotten into is a prestigious and highly ranked institution in NY and a select few others from my high school have also gotten in. However I know someone who got in and is the most disrespectful, entitled, and vindictive individual I have ever met. I’ve known him since we were very young so I know he has always been this type of person. I’ve also been in the same classes as him since middle school because we are one of the few at our school that is in the IB program. While he has been relatively nice and respectful to me (since he thinks I’m smart from IB), he has done a lot of things to others that I feel are unredeemable. \n\n1. He takes pride in drunk driving without a license and then continues to post a video of it on social media.\n2. Talks back to teachers constantly and has no respect for any authority \n3. To add on to number two, he constantly smokes in class and disrespects his parents by stealing their car &amp; cursing them out\n4. He is constantly intentionally mean and finds joy out of picking at other people’s flaws.\n5. Has a very high sense of entitlement and narcissistic tendencies. He gossips about others constantly and puts people down. \n6. Posted other people’s private photos and details onto social media constantly.\n7. Harassed someone for a year and pressured them to be with him even though he didn’t have the same sexuality as him\n8. Cheats on everything and everyone  \n9. Outted his former SO for their sexuality on social media. This eventually led his former SO to lose multiple scholarships from other colleges. \n10. Lied to a mid 20 year old about his age and had sex with him when he was underage and thought it was funny enough to post this guy’s identity on social media and the entire scheme \n\nNote that he takes pride in all of these things and does not see these as wrong. These all happened within the past two years (most within a year).\n\nLess recently, (around 4 years ago) he lied about being abused by his parents to manipulate his former gf into staying with him. \n\nI don’t know what to do. I am super on the fence about doing this. I feel like it’s not my place. But I know this institution really values morals and also because he’s bragging to everyone that he got in and putting those who didn’t down. It’s feeding into his sense of entitlement once again and he’s using this to make others feel bad. To clarify, I’m not coming from a place of jealousy either. I also got into this institution and better schools than him so I’m not jealous. I just feel like this is something the school should know since he seriously has no morals or empathy for others unless it makes him look good. So WITBA if I did this?\n",

      "description": "I work in construction management and I am the only female in our jobsite office. I use coarse language but only when I'm frustrated or stressed. My voice is small and my general demeanor is kind of dainty so it often comes as a shock to some people. Well there's a new guy in the office and he absolutely hates it. Says it's not lady like (mind you, he's never complained about the guys who curse up a storm). I used to ignore him but his constant crusades about morality are ruining my otherwise very fun work environment so as an act of pure pettiness, I curse even more around him. But that's not the reason why I'm asking AITA.\n\nHe's an older guy who is a few years from retirement. When he got hired he claimed he was OK with computers but that's clearly a lie. He's no good with any of our software; he couldn't even handle a switch from outlook to gsuite and is in constant confusion. I've tried helping him out, even creating written outlines of how to use certain software but he ends up pushing everything back on me to just do for him (note: he never asks any of the guys). He laughs it off and says, oh you can't teach old dogs new tricks.\n\nSo after 2 months of being his unwilling personal assistant and IT support, he decided to have an info session on a new application the company started implementing. Honestly, it's an intuitive app and the training wasn't really necessary; nevertheless, he made it mandatory for the whole team. Midway through, I got fed up and started complaining at how useless it was to have a training on something we all know how to use. He shushed me and literally said \"I'm trying to teach you something young lady.\" This honestly irked me more than it should have and I went on an expletive filled speech about how I've been trying to teach him how to do his job for months and how he uses his lack of computer skills to dump all his work onto the younger staff members. He went speechless for a minute and then said that my foul language made him feel uncomfortable and I was a manner less girl and he'd be going to HR about my inability to behave appropriately. Like really? Of all the things I said to him, he was upset the most my my cursing? I'll admit that my words were harsh but that's not even what he took offense to! Some of my coworkers thought it was hilarious but my PM thought I went too far which is why I'm asking, AITA?\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for showing a screen shot of a paragraph to my closest guy friend of my best girl friend and me that said as to why she is the way she is (depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.)?",
      "description": "Me and my best friend were together as a couple when she told me about her family issues, how she was treated like crap her whole life, and she was super depressed. She would cry her eyes out to sleep, wanted to kill herself, and didn't care about the future because she didn't think she would be around that long. She had issues with her step-father as he wanted to be with her. We broke up and have since been best friends. \n\nThe guy I told all of this to is a really close friend to her and me. We talk to each other all the time, hang-out often, and even work together. I looked at her like a sister and him like a brother. \n\nI showed him the chat that I screen shot from Snapchat that was a paragraph of her saying what I said before hand except the stepfather part. She got furious at me for screen shotting this and showing him. I only screen shot this because I didn't want him to see everything else we talked about. I only showed him in person and didn't even send it to him. I even texted her after I screen shot it that I told him about it, I hope she doesn't mind and we are super close anyways.\n\nHe said that she didn't mind that I were to tell him about her step-dad and what happened with him but I ended up telling more as I felt bad for her. The thing is ever since I've found this out about her I've felt awful and every time I see the paragraph about her past I feel even more depressed because I didn't know if I could tell someone really close to her so we could help. \n\nSo I apologized after she found out, told her I only did it because I care about her and I felt like I was carrying a burden holding on to this as it hurt me knowing she was like this and I couldn't tell someone close to her so we could help (I've been like this for months). That I was stupid to do this, she was right to be angry at me, and that I would do everything in my power to earn her trust again because she is an amazing friend. She blocked me and deleted me on Snapchat and I don't know if she did my phone number either. \n\nThe guy friend tried to get her to understand and to tell her that I only did this because I care so much. I have wanted to help her ever since I was told this by her. That I've been dealing with her pain for so long by myself and no one else knows this about her but me. She told him to stop talking about me if he wants to be friends with her still. The thing is that I was friends with him before her and that he actually helped me pick her up as my wingman when we first met her.\n\nSo now I feel like I caused both my closest friends trouble. All I wanted was for her to finally have a great life and to be able to enjoy it without her issues/insecurities that she could fix/overcome with help (like us being support and her going to therapy). Shes had a horrible life up to meeting me and I wanted that to change ever since I learned about her past. Now I've messed up an amazing friendship and I don't even know if she will talk to me again at work on Monday.",

      "description": "A little backstory: I'm a current college freshman going into my sophomore year. In order to apply for housing, we have to have an entire suite (4,5, or 6) girls complete. \n \nAbout 2 months ago my roommate and I found 2 girls (A and K) to make a suite of 4 with in order to apply for housing. The first meeting with A and K went well, but K threw on us that her current roommate, C, would potentially be living with us because she had no other options, but was thrown into us, creating a 5. The only options for 5 rooms are very limited unless you overcrowd a room, but we had plans to switch to an apartment. Later we found out that the apartment was not an option for rising sophomores unless we had a 5 room originally and then emailed housing to move us in when anyone decided to drop out of the school or leave to go to another dorm. K, was upset with us about this because apparently it would be too overwhelming for her because she only wanted a single room (which would only happen if we had an apartment). We then had to have another meeting in order to decide again whether K approved of our plan or not. Through of all this she had been aggressive accusing us of withholding information. At each meeting K and C would show up late and leave earlier. After K finally approved of us doing an overcrowded room, she demanded that K and C demanded that they would have the double room, putting my roommate and I in the third with A. \n\nA, my roommate, and I decided that maybe it would be best to separate from K and C. With that we started looking for options to separate and create two groups of 4. We had vaguely discussed this as there was tension, but K (for reasons we dont know) was against it completely. Even C had said she was okay with splitting up, but everything had to go through K first. \nWe continued looking for other people because we couldn't handle K anymore and went on to find 2 girls for them and another girl to make these groups of 4. We sent the contact info of the other 2 girls and \n\nAfter, sending to K and C what we have decided, K blew up on us. \n\nSo really what I'm trying to find out is, are we the assholes for trying to move on in this way? \n\nTL:DR: We had original housing plans, but after the negativity decided to split up and gave them options on people to live with so they don't get randomized. Are we the assholes? ",

They used to live with their brother's family and roommates (wife with three kids and two roommates) we rarely talked. Call it a bit of a long distance friendship or whatever. After they moved across town, it started getting expensive to see with neither of us with a license or car.\n\nThey moved out, and now live with their parent again. They used to call me a solid 2 or 3 times a week while living with her brother. Now it's about 3 or 4 times a day. And they've very, very talkative. I mean like, 30 minutes of them talking and me maybe replying once every 5 minutes if I'm lucky. We used to have real conversations, but now it's like.. I just couldn't give a damn. \n\nThey don't have many close friends anymore either. I know they occasionally talk to others, but I know for sure it's not on the same level as they do with me. That makes me sound arrogant, but whatever. As far as I'm aware, they mainly talk to their boyfriend (they have a ldr) and I.\n\nAnd everytime they call me, I'm immediately met with pure annoyance. I dunno, I feel kinda bad about it and I'm scared cause we had plans to move in together in a year or so. I thought about telling them to give me some space and tone down, but I don't know how to do it without hurting their feelings. I hate confrontation let alone calling someone out when they probably don't see the issue.\n\nTD;LR- Best friend doesn't talk to many people anymore, so now they call me constantly in a day to talk and it fucking annoys me. Now I'm worryed about how I'm gonna feel towards them when we move in together. Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "Story: I moved across the country for work about a year or so ago, and my family has purchased flights for me to go back home for an event this upcoming weekend. This is not an unusual occurance; we (SO and I) have flown (~3 hr flight one way) to my families hometown 7 times in the past 12 weeks for events that \"we cant miss.\" They will pay for everything and guilt trip the heck out of us for not making it if we put up any resistance. To date we have not missed a single event.\n\nThis trip requires us to miss some days of work, and unfortunately this week is a very heavy work load for both of us. Not saying we cant miss, but it would be very tough to make up missed time. My sibling also is playing a very small part in this party and according to my mother 'would be very devastated if we dont come' (she did this exact party 3 weeks ago which we did attend). I am exhausted from this traveling and have tried to express this in a calm way, and have brought up our work load, but my parents only see me as being a spoiled son who \"needs his beauty rest\" and is missing the last event of the year. Any thoughts? Feeling pretty bad after turning down the flights, not sure if I am being unreasonable or not.",

I have a coworker who is a researcher who we'll call John, I used to temp here a couple times a week so we've met before and he was always very nice and liked to chat (that happens a lot in temp jobs, there is always one employee who wants to make you feel a bit more comfortable and all that jazz), I've always been cordial but had recently become more standoffish as I am in a real role and I have a lot to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis friendly ways have escalated since I officially started, it went from simply \"Hey! Good morning!\" to \"Good morning \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ how was your night? Got a lot of work today?\" I have openly told people I prefer to not talk about my personal life, simply because I am here to work and help maintain day to day operations. The only person who knows a minuscule of information is my employee, but she is only in 2 days a week. But the office is aware I will be in LA for 4 days in 2 weeks. But thats all they know, I have shared nothing else as I need them to grasp I'm 3 hours behind so I don't want to be annoyed with \"Can you order whiteout?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday was when I began to feel uncomfortable, during lunch everyone clears out aside from me and John who is sitting upstairs. At some point he uses the restroom (which is next to my desk) and during that time my boyfriend called me to confirm a few things for LA including what we're doing for day trip to Santa Barbara, during the conversation I heard the toilet flush and sink run but I realized I never heard him come out of the bathroom. Our phone call ended with \"Since you're working from home today, can you please taken some chicken down so we can make dinner right when I get home? Ok love you bye.\" I slide my phone in my pocket and BAM the bathroom door swings open and I'm met with \"You said you're going to LA are you going on another trip to Santa Barbara? Who was that on the phone?\" I calmly said Santa Barbara is only 1.5 hours from LA on the train, I am excited to see the Pacific Coast and a pretty simple, that was my partner. John left me alone for the day until it was 5:30 and he left and asked if I wanted to get a drink after work to which I declined because I don't drink and I didn't want to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night while eating I received 5 text from him asking \"did ur friend take out the chicken?\" \"what r u making?\" \"hello\" \"i ended up picking up a premade meal from wegmans.. i wish i had someone to cook with each night :/\" and my personal favorite \"are u more of an ice cream or sorbet girl? ur such a mystery!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I've been slammed with calls from reporters and other shit due to Cohen so the staff has been instructed to not bother me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut now I am faced with a dilemma, my the HR manager is my direct boss, but I have only been her on their payroll for 2 weeks, John is GREAT at his job he gets some of the highest markers out of anyone but I obviously know he isn't immune to being reprimanded. My fear comes with in the fact I feel I'll be looked at as an asshole if I talk to HR as I'm new and there is such stigma around reporting misconduct ",

      "description": "Hi reddit, new to this whole thing, so apologies for any formatting issues. I'm posting because this is really bothering me and I'd like some outsiders views.\n\nI have a large group of friends, and we're usually pretty close knit. One of my friends (lets call her E) is dating another one of my friends (we'll call him T.) They're at separate universities, so it's a long distance relationship, which of course comes with it's own challenges. We're all in the same age range (18 - 22).\n\nE and I are very close, and I care about her a great deal. She and T have been going through a rough patch for the past 2 weeks - he's been very short with her, has snapped and simply gone silent at her multiple times. It's not completely out of character for him, and I don't really appreciate him treating her like this, but it's honestly not really my place to say anything.\n\nHe told her yesterday why he was being so short with her recently. His friends at his varsity have been 'joking' about E in a very sexual manner. The comments they were making amounted to them discussing in which order they'd like to have sex with her, and how they would like to pass her around the group. T was unhappy with their comments, but didn't make any attempt to stop or deter them, and instead took his frustrations out on E. \n\nE told me all of this, and was naturally very upset and hurt by the comments. I told her I didn't think it was appropriate at all for them to be talking about her like that, and the fact that her SO was taking his anger out on her AND not making any attempt to stop his friends commentary was crossing a line, and that I would consider leaving him. \n\nHere's where I'd like to know if I was an asshole. I told E I thought T was immature, and not ready for a long distance, serious relationship. I used the phrase 'an emotional manchild.' \nE then told T about my thoughts, and he thought I was blowing everything out of proportion, and was unhappy I was being involved in this. He did, however, tell his friends to back off.\n\nHowever! My whole friend group, including E, is now not talking to me. I accepted that calling him names was a low blow and possibly quite cruel on my behalf. So I apologised to him for what I'd said and any boundaries I'd crossed in his relationship. \nHis response was \"don't fucking talk to me\". The other friends in the group think that E was being irrational, and that I don't understand how guys talk to guys.\nI think that treating anyone like a piece of meat is completely uncalled for, and your SO taking frustrations out on you is a red flag.\n\nSo am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I have these three very, very good friends. We have pretty dark humor. One of my friends, let's call him A, loves to make really funny jokes at the expense of others, though it's all in good fun; he never intentionally offends anyone.

One of our continually running jokes is at the expense of C.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yesterday, A was making so many funny jokes at the expense of C, and B was saying \"Okay it's getting really old.\" But A also kept making the jokes to annoy B. B kept telling me, \"You're encouraging him!\" but I said \"It's funny!\" Then B said \"Maybe the first ten thousand times.\" C doesn't even care; nothing gets to him; he plays along with them, and he makes funny jokes back at us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for encouraging S to go for it ten thousand more times?",

      "description": "Throw away just in case. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 4 years and have 13 month old son. We’ve been together since college and I’ve always known him to indulge in weed quite frequently. We both have good jobs and his usage is always after work/ on weekends and doesn’t interfere with his work. \n\nA little backstory: when first got pregnant, I thought it would be mice if we both abstained from things I personally had to like weed, alcohol, nicotine etc. (I don’t smoke weed for the record and have been nicotine free ever since that positive pregnancy test). He did not agree with this, which was fine it was a request not a demand. Though it did become a little less frequent. \n\nWhen our son was smaller, my husband smoked VERY infrequently, I could probably count the times he smoked the first 9 months of my sons life, and it was never a problem at home. He would go out and would always come back sober, have a nice time with his friends and a much needed break. \n\nNow that our son is 13 months and has started to walk more, he’s honestly tiring and sometimes hard to deal with. But in my husbands eyes he sees a kid walking as becoming more “independent” despite the fact that he’s able to get into much more things if he’s not being watched. He’s a curious baby. And my husband sees this as he can start smoking more frequently. \n\nHe’s not a bad father at all. I want to stress that, but the past 2 weeks any time he is high around the house, I’ve refused to let him be solely the only one around our son. This is because once, he got a little distracted playing video games while our son was playing with toys and he wandered into the other room and ended up getting pulling things down, almost on top of him. Nothing that in theory could hurt him, but it was incredibly scary for me. \n\nSince then, when he’s high at home, I’ll switch the schedule for the day so he’s never left alone with him. Even if he says he’s not feeling the effects of the weed anymore, he’s just kind of in that distracted haze for the rest of the day and it makes me uncomfortable. \n\nI think I’m the asshole because we got into an argument about it making my day harder. My son hasn’t been picked up from daycare yet so he didn’t overhear. But he just said I was being crazy paranoid about this, when I said I wanted  him to reconsider the idea of stopping smoking altogether.  I just feel its going to start a slippery slope and get more frequent and push more of the child work on to me. \n\n\n ",

      "description": "I have lived in my townhome for a year. Over this past year, I have had four different neighbors in one apartment next to me. This ain’t unusual as I live in a college town as well as a military town, so people come and go often. I’ve never had issues with neighbors until now, and in fact have a great relationship with the neighbor on the other side.\n\nOur lease states that parking in the complex is open and there are no assigned spots, but everyone is only allotted two parking spots. \n\nWe started to have issues with tenants having three cars or multiple guests over and taking other tenants “spots.” This never affected me as someone else was living next to me at the time. But because so many people were pissed about this, the property manager sent an email stating that everyone needed to stick to the two spots directly in front of their apartments to avoid conflict.\n\nThe new neighbor was a single guy who moved in and there were no issues. Shortly after, his girlfriend moved in (technically think she isn’t even on the lease and we’re not allowed prolonged visitors, but I have no proof that she isn’t on it) and she caused this ridiculousness. Once she moved in, she would have friends over and take up the spots in front of my building. I am towards the corner of it, it’s a row of townhomes and there are multiple rows in the complex. So when my spots were taken, I had to park further away.\n\nI tried knocking on their door one day to ask if they could avoid my spot but they didn’t answer. So I left a note (even apologized in the note for leaving a note and tried to be as nice as possible). Since then, she has taken to only parking in “my spot” even when all of the others are free. Not to mention, this spot is directly in front of my apartment and no one else’s, so she’s not benefitting from parking here. Now, you may say, “VeganMansion, why don’t you just park in her spot if it’s just one spot over? Don’t be an asshole.” Well the answer is I did that to avoid confrontation. Now, because she is a shitty person, she will get in her car at night and turn in her brights so that they shine through my window (again, this is the only spot in front of only. My. Apartment.). Sometimes she actually goes somewhere, sometimes she just sits in her car. If she does go somewhere I’ll move my car into my spot before she gets back. But as soon as I leave for work in the morning, she moved back in front of my apartment. And that night she will make sure she shines her brights through my window for a few minutes.\n\nI brought the issue up via email to the property manager who said she would send out a mass email telling people to park in front of their own apartments. This never happened. So tonight I sent another email, escalating the situation, telling them that this chick is shining her lights through my window every night (not entirely true, but it is a good 5/7 nights of the week) and hinting that she moved in without permission.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "\nI honestly don’t know if I have the right to be mad or not but to give you some context here: \n\nI go to college in Utah and we just got finished with a long week of school and some of my friends are wondering if they can come over and drink a beer and then go to a party in my same apartment complex (It’s hotel style complex). I say sure and about 7 people come over and we play a fun little drinking game until about 10:30 then go to this party and dance it up. (Keep in mind this party is blasting LOUD music and there’s like 60 people there and the whole fourth floor can hear it, we live on the third floor). The party ends at about 12:30 but we decide to come back at 11:30. That’s when my friend roommate gets a text from my other roommate, let’s call him T\n\n“It is unreasonable to ask you guys to be quiet after 12 some people are trying to sleep here” \n\nBackstory:\nWhen T moved in he told me he was a hermit and I have nothing wrong with that (we actually became friends if I thought so myself and talk about video games and class and how to make bread)\n\n2 days ago T told me he went 72 hours without sleep and I asked why?! And he said “oh just because” and I thought it was crazy but hey it’s his choice and we’re in college!\n\n\n\nAnyways I immediately tell everyone to be quieter and they listen and we just sit in my living room talking and laughing having a good time as it is Friday night and we just want to have some fun. \n\nThat’s when T comes into our living room saying in the most accusing and passive aggressive voice “can you guys be quiet some people are trying to sleep here” then leaves and goes down the hallway back to his room. \n\nAfter that all my friends left (it’s 12:30) and I cleaned up the kitchen and went to my room ( I haven’t said anything to him). I’m kind of mad at him because he ruined my fun Friday night. I don’t even believe we were being obnoxiously loud either, just talking and having a good time. I also know he has no job and no school tomorrow and I saw him this morning in his pajamas eating cereal than going back to his room. \n\nI talked to my roommate about it and we both think it might have something to do with the alcohol rather than it being 12:30 (I mean the party was still blasting SUPER loud music). Utah has a lot of Mormons and we know they do not drink so we NEVER pressure anything on anyone and we don’t care if they don’t (3 of the girls there are Mormon and didn’t drink) but we still like to have a beer sometimes and chill even if we get judged quite a bit. \n\nWith all this said, AITA for being mad at my roommate for making my friends leave and ending our little get together?\n",

      "description": "I was having a text conversation with a friend last night, and she told me that she was going to go to an AA meeting this week. She has had problems with substance use in the past (prior to when we met), but everything she's said to me regarding her current status gave me the impression that she was fine and was not having any issues. Regardless, I took it at face value and offered words of encouragement as she was clearly nervous about going.\n\nShe responded to my encouragement with, \"I'm going to meet other gay women to make friends. I'm not going for AA.\" Totally taken by surprise, I said, \"Oh shit that's hilarious.\"\n\nSo given that this is a text conversation and that I also know she's often...overly-sensitive/dramatic/etc, I have no excuses to offer regarding my response. I could have (and should have) answered differently. But I didn't, so that's why I'm here.\n\nOf course, she wanted to know why it was hilarious. I explained (truthfully) that it was a completely unexpected response when compared to the expected reason for going to an AA meeting, and that there was also an \"oddly specific\" quality to her response...that she was not simply looking for friends, but specifically gay friends (she is gay so I understand why she's looking for gay friends). On top of that, the whole thing reminded me of Fight Club.\n\nShe questioned me on why it would be weird for her to want gay friends. I clarified that it wasn't weird that she was looking for gay friends, just that going to AA with the singular goal of making friends was unexpected. Going to make gay friends added a level of specificity that made it even more unexpected.\n\nHer response was that people go to AA to make friends all the time, and then talked about how friendships form throughout the process. I said I understood and would expect that friendships would form in the process of attending meetings since attendees have something in common, and especially considering that they can talk about their struggles freely whereas talking about their struggles in public would likely elicit a negative or judgemental response. However, my perception was that people went there first for support/help, and that the friendships came in the process of attending the meetings...not that people went to the meetings to find friends and then found support in the process.\n\nAt that point, she said \"Never mind\" and didn't want to talk about it anymore because she didn't want to be laughed at.\n\nI think it's also important to note that she doesn't regularly attend AA meetings because she has a fundamental disagreement with the process/structure, and from what she's told me, AA groups aren't very accepting of different methods/ways to achieve sobriety. This is not a judgmental statement; I'm simply relaying what she has told me in the past.\n\nSo...am I the asshole for finding humor in this situation and completely misunderstanding how AA meetings work?",

      "description": "honestly, I think the post is how the title explained it.\n\nmy boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 and a half years. we're in our senior year of high school. he is the nicest person I know, and has put up with ridiculous amounts of my shit for nothing, including a mental illness rollercoaster that seems to be never-ending. I don't think I deserve him. \n\nhe has never liked school dances or events. I went to all three of the dances freshmen year, he went to the last one (formal) with me. we went to all of the football games together that we could (kind of like dates, but where I was a flaky bitch). we went to our football season kick off together two years. we rarely go to see school plays (but this one is more on me). \n\nwe both definitely thought we'd go to prom together BUT he has no interest in prom. the whole idea of prom and the plans my close friend, S, and I want to make surrounding prom just stress him out. he feels terribly anxious about it. I honestly don't think I reacted to him being stressed about it well, and I owe him an apology for that. \n\nhowever, when we were fighting about prom, I suggested he shouldn't go and I honestly stand by that. in my ideal prom, yeah, he'd go and he'd have a hell of time, but that's not reality. reality is that he is dreading it, he's not interested, and that he doesn't think he'd enjoy it. he still insists on attending with me though, and says he'll just feel anxious internally, and I don't think he should. I think he should stay home or go to work or do whatever he wants, and I can go to prom. I can go with a friend and I can have fun, while he has his fun. he says this means I don't want to spend time with him, which isn't true. I love him so so much. we try to spend all available time together. I don't want to spend time with him when I know that time is not enjoyable, especially when I know it's because of what I chose for us to do, and knowing that I'm keeping him there. \n\nI don't know. I feel like an asshole and I feel like I'm in the right. I know he went to bed upset at me and that makes me feel worse. I wouldn't mind him going with the friend, T, I'd be going with if he didn't go, but I think I'd be bothered if he went with someone who wasn't T. (also, I only know I'd go with T if my boyfriend didn't go because T is currently going with us to prom as a little group. S was supposed to come too but she found a date!!!) So Reddit, AITA if I go to prom without my boyfriend?",

      "description": "This is a pretty tame one but something that keeps coming up in my marriage.\n\nTo give some background, I am going to school for engineering and I work from home 10-15 hours a week. Because of this my wife does almost all the shopping and cooking. I never push her to do it, it's simply something she enjoys doing.\n\nA lot of the time she'll ask me what I want for dinner. I usually say, \"whatever is fine\". And I mean it. I have never complained about anything she makes, and I super appreciate it. However, my response bugs her quite a bit sometimes because she \"hates having to always pick what's for dinner.\"\n\nI don't like chosing for a couple reasons. One, I don't know what we have because I didn't do the shopping, so I'd just be guessing until I land on something we have the ingredients for. Second, I don't know how much cooking she is in the mood for. Some of the things she makes can take over an hour and other meals take less than 20 min. I'd feel demanding if I ever suggested she make something that takes a while, but sometimes she likes spending that time. It just doesn't make much sense to me to choose dinner. \n\nThe main reason she wants me to choose is because my wife doesn't like making decisions all the time. She feels bad for the other people and usually just wants them to be happy. I'm usually fine making decisions, but in this situation I would rather not. \n\nAnyway, I'm rambling, so AITA for not wanting to choose what's for dinner?",

      "description": "(Using an anon account for privacy. Sorry if it’s a little vague, trying to stay anon.)\n\nDuring my freshman year I joined an organization (I guess it could organizationally be compared to a Greek house, just for context, but it is not one) made up of roughly 90-100 people. It was one of those groups where everyone kind of knew everyone else, and you spent a lot of time with them collaborating together so you are kind of expected to be friends with some if not most of the kids in your class year. \n\nSo, like everyone else, I made a few friends in and out of my year for a few years. Because of the enormous time constraints of the organization, it’s fair to say these people were and still are my only group of friends on campus. But then, part way through my second year I left the organization for personal reasons. Around this time, I relied heavily on the support of my friends because this was essentially a huge social, mental and lifestyle change that I needed some support to transition through. Most of them were all very understanding, and did not just leave me in the dust.\n\nHowever, as time went on I realized that I was never seeing these friends because they were busy with the organization or they’d plan things together and forget about me. When I did tag along, their conversation topics mainly included their majors (which they all had similar ones and I had always been the odd one out in that regard) and the activities they were doing in the organization. I usually found myself with very little to contribute since it is all very specific and unless you’re there participating it’s hard to chime in.\n\nI’ve been considering just kind of letting these “friendships” die out since I don’t really have anything in common with them now that I’ve left the one organization that we’d all done, and I’m really struggling finding anything to talk to with them, and it makes me kind of sad that that’s the only discussion that is had when I’m around. (Also, not sure if this is relevant but I was reluctant to be friends with them in the first place because I’ve never really bought into friendships that are just based on circumstance (ie, being a part of this organization) rather than interests and values, so the fact that we no longer even have said circumstance and no common interests really makes me question what we’re even doing.)\n\nTL;DR: I have a group of friends based out of a common organization that I am no longer a part of and now we have nothing in common.\n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA if I stopped talking to them or let them know that I really just don’t think we have grounds for friendship anymore? \n\n",

      "description": "Obligatory I'm on mobile, English is not my first language yadda yadda. Also the country I'm living in is Germany. \n\n\nBackstory:\nA few years ago my mum started believing in conspiracy theories, went from pretty open minded to racist and started sharing populist thoughts basically saying stuff like \"there's a NWO organisation, Merkel is the granddaughter of Hitler, the white population is being infiltrated by non-whites and its being replaced by those filthy immigrants\" etc. etc.\nThis of course caused many arguments and disparities between her and the rest of the family since we all tend to be open minded and think that these kinds of thoughts are just complete and utter bullshit.\n\nNow onto the main part:\nA few months ago after my mum got diagnosed with cancer and after my stepdad at that time left her she started dating this guy who's sharing these thoughts as well if not even a tad bit more extreme. For example I know that he's a flat earther and doesn't like the way our system works, especially the school system since the kids are being \"indoctrinated the wrong thoughts and are being teached unnecessary shit\".\n\nI'm 19, my sister is 15 and has never been particularly good in school. My mum decided to take her out of school and to \"homeschool her at the school of life\" when she's ready, which is btw illegal since it's the parents responsibility to ensure the kids get the education and send them to school. \nMy mum obviously doesn't want to have any of that \"indoctrination\" in state schools being pressed into her kids head, that's why she took her out. \nWe argued a lot about this decision since I suspect that my sister will just use the time outside school to not do anything and therefore loosing contact to how the real life is, not getting a degree and not being able to not make anything out of herself. \n\nI and others from my family also fear that she'll try teaching my sister things that are coming from her reality. Things like those mentioned above, that the holocaust wasn't real and the allies faked it and that the talk about climate change is a huge scam caused by idk who.\n\nI'm having thoughts of reporting my sisters absence and my worries to authorities which would mean that my sis would be forced to go to school and I'd probably be dead for my mother since I betrayed her.\n\n\nSo WIBTA if I reported her to the authorities for neglecting my sisters education and probably destroying her future?

      "description": "My mom is an alcoholic. She has been for years and years now, but it only really hit me about 7 years ago when I was 12. Since then, I’ve slowly become resentful towards her because of her drinking, as has my sister and my dad. \n\nShe is a wonderful woman if she wants to be and is sober, and I love her dearly. She has depression as well, and it hits her hard sometimes. \n\nAs I was applying to colleges last year (18M), I knew I wanted to leave the area so I could get away from her drinking and live the college life like my older sister. I ended up staying and going to the local state school due to cost, but I regret it. When fall semester started, my parents moved downtown, which made my moms drinking problem worse. In October, my mom found texts to my dad from another woman, which set her off, I came home and she was drunk and crying and I was left to comfort her as my dad left, and came back. I supported her as best I could. They’re still together, but this only worsened her drinking. She told me my father has been cheating for a while. \n\nFast forward to this last week, my mom finally admits she is an alcoholic. She is crying and telling me that she’s going to get help. I told her I’m here for her and support her. She said that I don’t need to forgive her, but she wants to make it up to us. My family has always had to tiptoe around what we say to my mom or else it may set her off into a depression spiral, so I did not get to tell her how I really felt. She has hurt me many times, and my sister doesn’t even want to speak to her anymore. \n\nSo today she comes into my room and asks me what’s wrong since I seemed a bit cold today. I tell her that I am still trying to take everything in and I need some time to be ok. I did not mean to hurt her, but I wanted to let her know that I can’t be super friendly right now because I need to think about things. She has put me on an emotional rollercoaster the last several months and especially this last week. I know things have been rough on her especially, but I cannot always be her therapist (though I try when she needs it) and not be expected to have my own feelings about things. \n\nShe was clearly upset during dinner and went straight into her room afterwards clearly depressed about the situation, on the verge of tears. She said she didn’t want to be ignored in our own house, which my dad and I weren’t at all. \n\nAITA for trying to be honest with her? \n\nTL;DR: Depressed, alcoholic mom asks me what’s wrong, I tell her I need time to figure out how I feel about her alcoholism, she gets upset.

      "description": "For some context to start with, we have been together about 2 years and I very much love her. We built a very solid friendship but I pushed for something more and eventually we made the jump. We are quite different people, but we get on brilliantly and I could see me having a life with her.\n\nSo recently I was chatting to a close friend of mine over some beers. Not enough to be drunk, but we were both speaking quite candidly. He says he has been struggling to find a relationship because none of the girls he gets along with are \"his type\" physically. I responded basically saying maybe he should try dating someone like that anyway because if he did gel really well he could get past that. I could see he wasn't really taking me seriously so I said \"Seriously, I don't think /redactedGFname/ is massively attractive and certainly isn't my type\". Now he was listening I explaind that I though from an objective stance she looks a bit above average as women go, but nothing ground breaking, and that my type would be thiccer with decent breasts whereas she is pencil thin and flat as paper. But, crucially, I care massively for her and there is nobody I would rather be looking at. There are all these little things about her that make me love her. He seemed to take it onboard so we moved on and continued with the night.\n\nFast forward to 2 nights ago and he was at a party with my GF I couldn't go to because of workload. I didn't get to see her till late the following day. She said the party was fun, but was quite cold with me all evening so I asked of something happened at the party, and it turns out while drunk my mate had told her about our conversation and made it sound like I though she was unattractive. Now, I strongly believe in being honest in all instances, and I also didn't think there was anything wrong with voicing these opinions, and so I tried explaining to her the actual full opinion, but clearly she didn't agree with me there, saying things like \"how can you truly love someone if you don't find them attractive\" which is not what I had said at all. She also said this wasn't something that should be said, especially not to other people and that it'd a show of disrespect to her, which I would concede if it wasn't a close friend I was trying to give advice to. She left after arguing with me for a while and has been barely talking to me since. I apologies for offending her, but won't apologise for the sentiment. Love is complicated. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for seeking emotional support from a friend? He believes I gaslit him, and I think it's the other way around.",
      "description": "I have a deep relationship with a friend from undergrad. We now live a few hours away from each other by car but often call each other on the phone. He introduced me to Buddhism and overall we've been supporting each other for a while now. At least so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I was writing a thesis to graduate, and it wasn't easy. Though I started seeing writing as a tool for discovering my thoughts, meaning I had to write through my confusion (as opposed to putting down thoughts in writing, meaning I had to think through my confusion), I was still feeling very confused and many of my unresolved insecurities were coming back up. So I would call up my friend, believing he'd lend a kind ear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow mind you, my friend is going through a depression with its ups and downs. Recently, he's been battling with how neither stopping weed nor getting into a relationship with someone he is deeply attracted to solved his loneliness. He also is staying with his grandma because she's getting very old.\n\nWe tripped on New Year's and he realised how his worldview might have been limited by his lack of seeing different perspectives (through e.g. travel), and how he may not agree with the way the NGO he's organising for is going about its intentions (he doesn't work, his only job is that NGO). I realised how much of my confusion around the thesis was coming from a place of arrogance/hubris, and how accepting that I didn't know anything helped me see what I had refused to learn about and opened the door to changing my relationship with confusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo last time I called him, he more or less hangs up on me and tells me he doesn't have time for me, then texts me I am not his soapbox and if I seek help the only thing he can advise is to \"sit\" (i.e. meditate) and \"journal\". I respond to him that if those words were enough they'd have worked ages ago, and to check his own hubris, i.e. that he was acting towards my situation the way I used to act around my thesis.\n\nHe doesn't take it well, and I tell him that since he's not in the headspace to do so, I'll just hold off on it until the thesis is done and just get support from e.g. my parents. But he believed I was trying to guilt him into being there for me, which I said was his interpretation. Then he links me to a post about gaslighting, and tells me how I kept saying it was his interpretation was an attempt to absolve myself off the responsibility for making him feel bad to not have the space to help me with my problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think he's the one gaslighting me (albeit unconsciously), and it's not the first time either. This event brought up all the times he projected his self-flagellation onto my behaviour. Whenever I criticise him on anything touchy he blames me for making him feel bad. One example: he told me about a project that could happen where he'd partner with his friend to provide yoga and Buddhist teachings to groups, and then proceeded to lash out at me for twenty minutes because me saying \"then make it happen\" was me \"sounding like \\[his\\] father\". Combined with the fact that most of the times when he comes visit me it's a byproduct of an event of his sister (who lives in the same city as I do) that he's attending (wedding, graduation, etc.), whereas I often go to where he lives just to see him, despite having other friends there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall I'm tired of talking to him, because I do not want to be blamed for putting expectations on him that I'm not putting. It's a pretty basic matter of trust between friends to accept that I do not have an evil or burdening intent towards him when I tell him my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis pattern has got so bad I'm almost led to ask a WIBTA. Right before this shit happened, he told me he won't end up traveling because he took more responsibilities with his NGO, and I felt like he might have backtracked on his new year's realisations. But I didn't tell him that, I guess because I was so worried about walking on eggshells around his feelings. So I didn't tell him anything, and waited to submit my thesis before getting back and offloading to reddit the judgement on who's gaslighting whom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**: My friend believes I gaslit him because I told him that it's his interpretation that me telling him I understand he's not in the place to support me is actually guilting him into emotionally supporting me through a tough time. I think he's unconsciously gaslighting me by blaming me for his own perfectionism, and distorting my words to put in them an intent to burden him.",

The decision have been coming out in the last few weeks and it's taken a huge toll on me mentally. Needless to say, I'm confused, frustrated, and sad. Despite this, my school work doesn't stop and today I had more than usual. My mom asked me to stop at Trader Joes on my way home from school (it's right next to my school but school traffic sucks). I told her that I was too busy and couldn't do it. She said she would have my brother, who's home from college on break and does nothing all day, go instead. Now, seemingly out of nowhere, she starts screaming at me for not going. She called me a bitch (she never swears). I don't know if I am being unreasonable or if she is. Obviously this is biased bc it's from my perspective but I've been feeling like shit for the last few weeks so maybe it's making me an act like an asshole. Also, any advice for how to reconcile?",

Just my parents, brother and me. Even if we are in our own relationships, it’s always only the 4 of us. My parents said we “have to” invite her this year.

We’re immigrants and only really had each other as kids, so to be pushed aside hurts.\n\nAm I the asshole for getting frustrated?

I made it VERY clear that i'm not interested in men since the beginning of me knowing him, and he \"gets it, totally\" but he keeps flirting with me and most of my single female friends. He asked my friend for sexual favours once \"as a joke\" but its made our friendship strained. Most of the time he's really nice, but one on one, it's just really uncomfortable. He makes sexually suggestive jokes about me, and insists on hugging me when we leave, which i'm not comfortable with, I don't hug hardly any of my other friends, and even then only after years of knowing them. He also made out with one of my friends without asking her when she didn't want to, at a party. He was sober and she was not. **In short, he is overly sexual with me, but not in a way that i can call him out on for an specific instance. I have not reciprocated any of his advances**\n\nI'm on holiday at the moment, and told all of my friends that i will not be texting anyone during this time (this isn't unusual, i like my space to decompress). But he was REALLY insistent that i \"have to text him\" or he'll worry. i said that i wouldnt and he tried to pressure me into texting him more. i really felt dodgy about how he was speaking to me, so i left.

      "description": "My parents are pretty bad at English and clueless when it comes to taxes and stuff. They speak Korean but I’m shit at Korean. I’m ADHD so I can’t stay focused and get frustrated really easily when learning languages. (My siblings always say this is just an excuse)\n\nBut the bulk of the matter is that I’m always asked to take care of taxes and bills and insurance problems like that since middle school since I’m deemed the “responsible” one. \n\nFor example, when my younger sister had panic attacks and anxiety and needed a therapist, I did the bulk of the research and convincing my parents that mental illness wasn’t a call for attention. I was 14 and my younger sister was even blaming me for her anxiety in front of family and friends. When she was in high school with me, I always got called down to the office in regards to my little sister instead of my parents. \nThe thing is my older sister was 20 and home from college for a gap year and only helped with calming my parents down, not helping me get our little sister help. \n\nEven now, when I’m away at college, I’m expected to take care of my younger sister instead of myself. My younger sister is now able to take care herself and expresses that but my parents don’t believe either of us. \n\nAnd today, my dad told my brother (21) and older sister (24) he needs my help with the state tax amnesty program because my dad thinks the state made the mistake. The deadline is tomorrow and he tells this as my older sister is going to work and my brothers going out to get his haircut. So of course, they tell me to do it. \n\nWell, I’m on the phone with the Tax Amnesty thing and I’m told I’m not allowed to call for my father because I’m not his lawyer. My dad then gets stressed and yells at me and the poor state worker. He told my older sister and me that his CPA told him not to pay the tax. (I have a feeling this is illegal???). He won’t even listen to me when I say we can dispute the tax or listen to me to let me talk to the CPA and explain the situation. My dad doesn’t even understand the situation because he doesn’t speak English well. He yells at everyone when he’s stressed and says he’s not yelling. \n\nWell the thing is, I can’t handle the stress right now and I made it clear several times. Last month, I was hospitalized 3 times: once for a concussion, again for an overdose (I accidentally took too many meds while concussed), and again for serotonin syndrome. As a result, I have permanent muscle spasms and I cannot take ANY of my PTSD and anxiety medications for a couple months because I still have symptoms and it may set off another episodes.. Not only that but I had to take a medical leave of absence from college last semester so I’m kinda stressed about going back to school. \n\nI’m honestly more upset at my older siblings, who are supposed to be the adult. They always leave the formal stuff to me even when they’re home. (My older sister lives at home.) I just graduated high school 6 months ago. I feel like they should do this stuff more and because they don’t have as much of a language barrier (Older sister grew up in Korea for a bit) my dad doesn’t yell at them and act like they’re making the problem worse. I don’t even get an apology. \n\nI expressed my feelings earlier to my older sister and that it’s not fair that I’m asked to do these things right now because I can’t even take my anxiety meds. She should’ve asked my brother. My older sister said it’s unfair for me to say that because “I had to help with stuff at your age too. You’re considered an adult now too.” and “I also dealt with anxiety when he and mom asked me for help.”\n\nBut the thing is, she didn’t go to therapy regularly or get medicated. Plus I had to deal with more serious issues than she did and at a younger age on top of that.  \n\nI guess I cut my older brother more slack too because he’s only two years older than me and he’s busy at college and he also took care of me last month when I was in the hospital. \n\nI understand that my parents take care of me and my older sister is trying to get her life together but AITA for wishing I didn’t have to act like the adult so much? To be honest, I’m not sure if I’m just being a snowflake.\n",

      "description": "I’m gonna try to keep it short. There’s this girl who implied I sexually assaulted her friend, she said she doesn’t feel safe around me and I broke her trust but she’s not “accusing me” but said she doesn’t know if I touched her friend or not. Anyways, drama happened, witnesses were there and I’ve explained this story before. It was false and it happened to be right after she was caught cheating on her boyfriend.\n\nSo one of my roommates and his girlfriend took her side because both girls were friends. They’re friends. My other roommate and his girlfriend don’t give a fuck and they trust me more and know I didn’t do it because I was with them.\n\nAnyways, we’re having a huge event and usually we throw parties at our house afterwards because we have the biggest place. However, I don’t want to invite this girl over, I want to tell my roommates that if we have a party I do not want her to come. I’m scared it’s a douchey thing cuz I feel like everyone would hate me and wonder why and then she’d make up some excuse. \n\nBut I can’t trust a girl at my house drinking if she’s willing to make accusations and cause drama for me because she doesn’t want to look like a cheater. \n\nI’m thinking if that’s too fucked up I’ll tell her to pay me $100. I just feel like an asshole excluding people but she didn’t suffer any consequences and I do feel narcissistic in the sense I think this would let her know that what she did isn’t ok. ",

The last few days had been jam packed with our kids’ sporting events and my body and brain were just done!  The husband is next to me in bed watching his phone with headphones.  Just when I’m finally drifting off, he gets a phone call, and takes the call, in bed, sitting right next to me.  He has a naturally loud voice, and is not holding anything back!  It was so loud that it startled me.  My heart started beating super fast and I sighed out a “shhhhh” in hopes that he just didn’t realize how loud he was.  He proceeded to talk louder and continues the phone call in bed.  He was on the phone for a good 15 minutes with absolute no regard for me while I was sleeping.  \n\nOnce he hung up, I expressed to him how rude and inconsiderate it was that he didn’t take the call in another room or at least lower his voice.  He laughed and blatantly said “I do not care”.  He said it was only 9 pm on a Saturday night and to get over it.  He got shitty with me for the “shhhh”.  \n\nAm I being irrational/unreasonable?  Is it normal to go about normal activities while someone is sleeping?  I grew up with my dad working nights and slept during the day - we were always very aware and tried our hardest not to disturb him or anyone while they were sleeping.  Looking forward to comments/suggestions!  Thanks!\n\n",

      "description": "_I literally just discovered this website and I wanted to get a verdict, and want to at least TRY to get feedback. But I also know how Reddit in general works. I've tried /r/changemyview before. But I'll try this right now..._\n\nLong story short, I am not successful with women. It is mostly because I am short, an ugly looking dude, dark-skinned, and a little overweight and out of shape. I don't go for girls by looks, nor do I ever try to \"get tens.\" In fact, my physical type are girls a lot of men dislike (BBW's). Of the few women that have ever tried to talk to me in some way, they were _all_ 100% girls who were not-straight. \n\nI am straight; 100% heterosexual. I'm also 100% a \"CIS\" man. And I have ZERO interest in being with a lesbian. I am simply not attracted to \"queer\" women. Even among straight women, there are things that she could say that would make me uninterested. Like if a girl has a strong desire to be with tall men and me being a mere 180 cm, it would annoy me and make me lose all interest in her. If a non-straight girl tries to claim to show interest in me, it just legit pisses me the fuck off. Like, I'm feminine to her or something? I don't come off straight? I don't come off masculine to her?\n\nAnd yeah, I know. MOST guys are into lesbians and queer women. I however, am not, at all. I don't want to have any romantic interactions with a woman whose heart is set on being with another woman or just feminine people in general. If you're a lesbian or \"queer,\" I don't hold it against you, but I don't have any interest in ever dating you. So it pisses me off if a girl who enjoys sleeping with and being with girls essentially doubts my manhood or masculinity by implying \"Yeah, you'd make a good partner for me,\" of course it's gonna piss me off and I wouldn't want to be with her.\n\nAs I said though, it's literally the only time girls have ever implied an interest of \"being\" with me. And I'm not going to pretend to understand how people want to be \"sexually fluid\" or whatever you want to call it as I'm as hetero-vanilla as they come. I'm barely even into tomboys. But no, I don't want to be with someone who is turned on by femininity and women, even if a LOT of guys (especially trans people) are into those kinds of relationships. It actually annoys me more that the only women who've ever implied \"liking\" me where women who really want to be with women. \n\nIn fact, I even had a new friend I met recently. I thought there might have been real chemistry there. But as it turns out, she's into women. Her last \"partner\" was male, but he was also pretty flamboyant and feminine (as expected). We were talking casually and this organically came up, and I confided to her how I don't understand how every girl that's ever shown interest in me has been gay or on that side of the (as they call it) \"spectrum.\" That's when the friend revealed to me her partner before the last one being female. And from there, it killed any interest I might have had in pursuing something further. This conversation was about five weeks ago, and I really hadn't talked to her since (though she may not have wanted to talk to me either).\n\nSo to recap, I have zero interest in being with non-straight women, or lesbians, or \"queer\" women. I only want someone who's going to desire _me_ and think of me as being masculine and straight, because I am. Keep in mind, I _should be allowed_ to date or be attracted to whoever I want to be, and would not ever try to attack any gay person for \"not being straight\" or such. But when the issue is in reverse, or even involves a straight male not being attracted to a transwoman, people always get vitriolic and rude with it, because you're only \"supposed\" to support the LGBT side of these issues in their minds in such. But no, I'm not attracted to those types of non-straight women, even if they think of me as being feminine enough to try to hit on and be with.",

      "description": "TL;DR at the end\n\nLast month my uncle went to a neighbour to discuss an issue regarding the joint piping on their respective properties.\n\nSo they way her propery is structured; first you have a small gate to get into the front yard and then you're able to ring the door bell of her property. It isn't a huge gate; just like a small fence door you could basically step over. \n\nMy uncle first called from outside of the fence gate because he saw an open window, but when he got no answer he went in to ring her door bell. After ringing her doorbell he heard some barking inside the house (which was a surprise to him, he never knew she had two GIANTIC dogs) and out of nowhere they came around the house and attacked him. \n\nHis calve was bitten of, his arm was chewed into, when he fell on the ground one bit into his neck and the basically kept biting at him while he screamed and crawled out of the property, all this time no one came from inside the house to call the dogs off, regardless of his screams. \n\nA car passing by noticed, man stepped out, threw large stones at the dogs (wounding one, but not very severely) and dragged my uncle out the property into his car and drove him to the hospital (my uncle was already passed out at this point). \n\nHe had surgery for 10 hours and it will be 6 months till he can walk again. \n\nSo the police says that pressing charges basically means the dogs will be euthanized and that's it. \n\nMy uncle (dog-lover), who did rather not want to see the dogs killed for something that's in their nature, called the lady afterwards to solve it without police involved. She had no idea all of this happened at her house even though she claimed to be home, thought the blood on her property was from their steaks and my uncle was lying. She wasn't at all friendly or understanding, and wouldn't try to solve anything with him. She blamed him for coming onto her property, and that it was his own fault for being attacked (Police disagrees).\n\nSo now the family is torn between pressing charges or not. There is no way to relocate the dogs safely somewhere else, so pressing charges means they get killed (Even though the fault lies with the bad owner, and not the dogs).\n\nMy uncle and the rest think that they don't want to press charges, but I am basically the only one who disagrees. These dogs are dangerous and he could've died. I believe they have to be put down so no one else gets harmed by them. \n\nThe rest of my family thinks I am heartless and cruel for saying such a thing. Trust me if there was another option I really would't want them dead either, but this seems the only option. \nEverybody seems mad and disappointed in me for blaming the dogs and wanting them dead, and I think they're crazy for defending the dogs behaviour. \n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR uncle almost dies from getting attacked by neighbours aggressive dogs, pressing charges means dogs get euthanized.

      "description": "This is probably going to be one of most boring posts on this sub, so I'll try to keep it short even though I am so mad I could write a book.\n\nI live with my parents and my older brother (he is 29 and I am 21(f)). The thing is because he has a job and I don't(even though I'm trying to find one) my family expects me to do all the chores in the house and my brother doesn't have to do anything. I understand this but I look at it as me being considerate with him and not as an obligation. He doesn't help with money either, but I get that he gets tired from work and if I'm not doing anything at the moment, I can do all the chores by myself. But he had two days off, and today I told him that he should do the dishes and that resulted with him screaming at me saying that I should do it because I don't have a job and that I do nothing all day, that I should never ask for a favor from him again and even prohibited me from using his ps4. I feel like I'm not the asshole but my family makes me feel like I am. My mother even said to me that I have become unbearable to live with just for this. \nAITA? is it really my obligation to do all the chores by myself even on the days he is not working? \n\n",

      "description": "This actually happened awhile ago but something happened yesterday which is causing me to think about it all over again.\n\nSo when I first joined high school I struggled to make friends as well as losing almost all the ones I had from middle school (nothing happened we all just drifted apart) because of this I became incredibly socially awkward and I lost all my confidence. \n\nHalf way through year 8 I started sitting with a new group of people. 1 of them was one of my closest friends from middle school (I’ll call them Y) but apart from that I didn’t really know any of them. I sat with these people through out year 8 and 9 and never became close with any of them, apart from one, and even drifted apart from Y.\n\nThis one person, I’ll call them X, was the only person there who I really liked, we spoke a lot and became pretty close friends. I went to a pretty dark place because of the fact I felt really lonely as all I had left was 1 friend. And honestly if it wasn’t for X I don’t think I’d still be here today. \n\nX and I where in a similar situation of the fact that we didn’t really know / like the people we were sitting with but the thing is X stayed because I was there and I stayed because I had no where else to go. X had another group of friends who they were really close with but still sat with me at break and lunch. \n\nThen year 10 happened. In the UK when you reach year 10 you get to pick what subjects you want to study and so all your class change. One of the subjects I choose was history, in this class was Y and 2 other people I knew from my year 9 PE class. I was sat next to Y and because of this we became close again. Both of us also became friends with the 2 other people.\n\nAbout half way through year 10 I told both X and Y, at different times, about how I didn’t like where we were sitting and how it was causing my mental health to deteriorate. X said we could always move to sit with their friends but the thing is their other friends really annoyed me (they seem like nice people but I just find them irritating). Y told me they felt the same at that they only really like 1 of the people we were sitting with. Y also told me that they were thinking of asking the people from our history class if they could sit with them and asked if I wanted to go to.\n\nI decided to go with Y’s plan and I’m so glad I did because now I sit with 3 people I love with all my heart and my mental health is a lot better and in the half a year I’ve now been sitting with them I’ve built a lot of my confidence back up.\n\nX went to sit with their friends shortly after I moved and I felt bad because I literally just ditched them. I leant on them for support and friendship and then the moment I had the chance I moved away.\n\nWhen I first moved I tried to keep talking to them but the inevitable happened and we drifted apart. \n\nYesterday they sent me a letter saying that they were upset that we fell apart and that they were partly to blame. I quickly sent them a message saying they had no blame what so ever and it was all my fault.\n\nBut the thing is last night was the first time I really thought about that decision. I knew at the time of moving that if I was to move I’d almost certainly lose X as a friend and so it cost me basically everything but I went through with it.\n\nI don’t think I regret it because my mental health is so much better now. \n\nI know I’m the asshole here so I guess what my question really is, is my shitty selfish decision justified because of the fact that I’m so much happier now? \n\n",

I said that it was no problem, I know the type I bought already, so I paid them 1700€.\n\nFew days go by and I get a phone call that the supplier didn't have the colour I wanted (black). And if I wanted that colour, that it would take a month before it arrived from the manufacturer.  I was a bit disappointed, but really wanted a black one so I agreed.\n\n5 weeks later i went to the dealership and asked for an update about my scooter. \"Yeah, something went wrong at the supplier and it will take another month before we can order it.\" Wich means I will have it by the end of April, beginning of May.\n\nSo this time I'm very disappointed and a bit sad because now I have to go another month with public transportation to my work, which cost me 5 times more than it would by scooter. But because I'm not great at confrontations I just said \"oke\" and left.\n\nWIBTA, if I would go back and ask for some kind of compensation or discount, because they don't deliver what they said?",

      "description": "Backstory: I used to live in the same area as my cousin. It’s fondly known as the Hawaii of Canada and the city shuts down when it snows (general unpreparedness all around). I moved to one of the coldest and snowiest provinces of the country. For 5 years I experienced a true Canadian winter. It sucked but it’s the reality of life for so many. I then moved to a smaller city near my hometown that still experiences winter - but not to the degree of the previous province. We are actually in the polar vortex and it’s been -10 to -30C here with a fair amount of snow (a bit unusual but that’s life).\n\nSo here’s the story:\nMy cousin (along with half of my Facebook who lives in my hometown), posted about the snow. These range from dramatic complaints to posts of people enjoying the snow. My cousin took a photo of her car covered in about 2-3 inches of snow and captioned: “has anyone seen my car??? Gunna call it a snow day!”. A few hours later she posted a picture of her and her son playing in the snow. \nWhile scrolling through my Facebook, I “loved” the photo she posted of her son and “haha-ed” the snow day post. A friend of hers commented “get to work *name*” and she “haha-Ed” this reply. I also commented on her photo: “As a once *oldwintercityperson* this makes me laugh! Snow day? For a light dusting and sweater weather 😜😜😜. Enjoy the day!!! ❄️⛄️❄️”. \n\nWell, apparently I’m a huge asshole because this comment made her cry and she called her mom and sister (referred to later as other cousin) who have since messaged and called me multiple times to let me know what I said was cruel and insensitive. They want me to apologize. They told me I need to be more understanding since winter is very hard for this city and I shouldn’t be mean. That this city has hills which makes driving in the snow harder. I responded by saying that what I said was a light joke and I genuinely meant her to enjoy her day off. I also said that it’s untrue that winter is harder there. I live in a city built on mountainsides a few hours away which also receives the same wet snow. It’s icy and slippery here too, yet we manage. But I wasn’t speaking out of malice for her not wanting to drive in the snow, I was teasing. I also reiterated that I won’t apologize, and if she is so upset she can talk to me directly. My other cousin then went on to say that my post was like a terminal cancer patient telling her that her MS is not bad in comparison. I responded with “fullstop. This is about snow not medical conditions. This was a light joke poking fun about her reaction to snow and filled with genuine well wishes for her and her son to enjoy the day. If that makes me a jerk, so be it. Tell her to delete me, I’m done discussing this.” The response, “k.”\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole? ",

My father recently has been fired from hus job for some BS (crashed his company truck, Pennsylvania fire at will law). This has sent him into a depressed, alchoholic state for the last few months. He has had a lot of anger built up and often insults me, demeans me and overall kills my self confidence. It doesnt normally become physical but has, nothing too serious. This doesnt happen to any of my other siblings, so I am not concerned for their safety if I leave becuase they are all too young for him to hurt emotionally or physically. The final straw was last weekend when he left the house at midnight at 10 o'clock to surorise my mom at work while he was hammered while my cousin was with me. I tried to stop him and he told me that he didnt love me and that i am an asshole, my cousin saw this and my aunt offered to take me in. This would help also because I would transfer schools, which is great because I have approximately 0 friends.\n\nSo AITA for wanting to move in with my aunt?",

      "description": "So quick backstory: I (21F) am a dancer, and I currently work in a dance studio. For the past six months I've been dealing with my former dance coach (28M), who initiated a physical relationship two weeks after he was no longer officially my coach, and unsurprisingly the relationship ended poorly. We made it clear that we were not going to be friends anymore or associate in any way.\n\nHowever, we still have to see each other all the time because we operate in the same professional spaces. He's a coach, I work at the front desk of his studio, so he has to pay me every time he has a lesson, and he and his girlfriend/partner have to sign in whenever I'm here. He has repeatedly expressed what I personally viewed as an overt lack of professionalism: when I would contact him with a professional request he wouldn't respond, he would interfere with my search for a dance partner, he would ignore procedures at the studio because it meant he would have to approach the front desk, he would wait until I was no longer on shift to pay, or if I didn't leave eventually and worked until closing then he would throw the money at me and walk out. If I was simply practicing in the studio and his practice bag was in my vicinity he wouldn't approach it until I got up to do something.\n\nTo be fair, he made it clear that he didn't want to be contacted, but sometimes my job necessitated it, and sometimes I just wanted the awkward tension to end.\n\nI sent him a text requesting more professionalism, he said my presence in his life was negative for his mental health. He blocked my number and then my Facebook page. I sent him this message: \"I don't quite know what I've done to warrant this, because we haven't spoken in months and I have sent you two (2) texts in that amount of time, but if you are as uncomfortable with my presence as you seem to be I can stop practicing as \\[dance studio name\\] and quit my job there. All I have ever requested is a basic level of respect -- I felt that at least I had the courtesy to explain why and when I blocked you when I did. That is all I'm asking of you, and I don't think I'm asking too much. I do hope you're doing well, regardless.\"\n\nAm I the asshole for sending the above message, and for still attempting to remedy the conflict and be professional?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "To clarify some things quickly; My friend goes by they/them and this is not a “I have feelings for one of them so I can’t be happy” kind of deal, their “boyfriend” is just.. awful. \n\nI know friends are supposed to be supportive and there for you so maybe I didn’t approach it right but there’s just so much with this guy and hearing my friend moon over him after an earlier interaction in which we were both discussing nasty comments he made towards our underage friend is just. Jarring. And I finally admitted it was bothering me. \n\nFor context as to why I don’t like my friends boyfriend; \n\n- Boyfriend was 26 when they first met and basically groomed them and had sex with my friend the day they turned 18. \n\n-Boyfriend constantly makes nasty lewd comments about our underage 16 year old friend. Like really nasty shit asking my friend if a threesome is ever going to happen and basically sexualizing younger friend everytime they see them online. \n\n-Boyfriend has constantly moved friend to tears, calling them ugly or being outright mean for no reason, one time my younger friend and I came over only to find friend in tears over their boyfriend comparing them to a clown. One time their boyfriend “broke up” with them and claimed he was going to get married just to hurt my friend.!\n\n-Boyfriend insults their fashion sense constantly, making them insecure and weary about what they wear, they almost give up Jfashion hobby because of it.\n\n-Boyfriend is transphobic and does not respect my friend or their identity, he calls them a she all the time and doesn’t bother trying to correct himself. He’s also racist as shit, that’s not an assumption my friend literally told me he said he “doesn’t like “N*gge*s”\n\n-Boyfriend has borrowed money and hasn’t payed my friend back, like 200+ plus, makes excuses to not pay it back constantly.\n\n-Boyfriend has bluntly told my friend if he accidentally got them pregnant he would dip and go “back to Mexico” \n\nStuff like that and it’s all been building up. My friend has a history negative mental issues so I didn’t feel right telling them to break it off, and nowadays I mostly just respond as fake positively as I can to their excited text messages about the guy because they deserve to be happy, and I can’t put a hamper on that. They’ve told me constantly how this guy is their favorite person. \n\nIt’s always lowkey irritated and upset me with how much they make excuses for him, and that they rub it off with out regard when their boyfriend is being an asshole to them or being creepy about their friends. I understand my friend was basically groomed but I couldn’t hold my tongue today.\n\nAnd so earlier today my friend shows me screenshots of their boyfriend sexualizing our underage friend with the caption “eugh he’s so gross” \n\nThe picture in question being sexualized was a picture of underage friend eating a pickle innocently and he, a 27 year old fucking man felt he needed to make a comment. Both my friend and I discussed it with disgust and they were all like “eugh he’s so nasty” and then now, several hours later they send me a barrage of messages about how they’re going to an expensive date with their boyfriend and bought a new dress and all this stuff for him and I couldn’t bottle it up and responded;\n\n“*name* this is the same guy who made inappropriate comments about *young friend* earlier and I really don’t feel comfortable pretending to be happy for you atm” \n\nAnd they responded with a simple “oh ok” and deleted all their messages about him. I feel kinda bad and that I was really blunt, I don’t want to hurt their feelings but it just makes me uncomfortable at this point, knowing the things he’s done, which may I add is all things my friend has TOLD ME, I don’t have the energy to find reasons to not like their boyfriend, they constantly complain to me when their boyfriend does this shitty stuff like making nasty comments (along with all the things I listed) and then hours later they send me some lovey dovey stuff about him and While I usually go along, this time I couldn’t pretend to be happy for them.\n\nPlease give me feedback, I just, I’m kind of confused and worried I put a dent in our friendship. \n\n",

      "description": "In my school, we had a classwork assigned to us by the social studies teacher. For this assignment, we had to shade in countries that had people who immigrated to the U.S. And my friend kept pestering me about what countries he had to shade in. Keep in mind that these weren't tiny countries or countries that most Americans don't know of. These were great powers and popular tourist countries like Russia, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. I understood why my friend couldn't find Belgium and Austria, but I couldn't comprehend why my friend couldn't find these countries. Eventually, I got tired of him asking me for help (We sit diagonally from each other. I was getting tired of getting up, sitting back down, and then repeat. ) So I called him an idiot. He didn't seem to really care and I did help him afterwards. But I want to know if I was in the wrong for calling him an idiot. ",

I'm going to try to get my temporary license in the summer, but in order to do that, I have to pay for half of my driving school, as my parents will only pay half. So when I have an opportunity to make money (which is rare), I take it.\n\nCut to about three weeks ago. I brought my Switch into school and was playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate with some free time, when this jerk in my class makes a bet. 100$ on the line. I accepted it because I really wanted the money. I then proceed to win.\n\nNow... I still haven't gotten it. I understand it takes people my age a little bit of time to get that amount of money, but this guy has the latest iPhone, Air Pods, and his dad is a higher up for my school district, so at this point I'm getting upset. \n\nEvery day I ask him if he has my money, and almost every time he fakes me out. Like today I asked him if he had my money and he said \"yeah,\" so I asked him to get it for me, to which he replied \"yeah about that, I don't actually have it, but I'll get it to you before school is over.\"\n\nI've called him a couple of mean names, like \"liar\" or \"asshole\" in class. I've had problems with him before which is why I'm being more mean than I normally am to peoppe. I know at the end of the day it's really not a big deal but I really need that money. AITA?",

      "description": "  \n\nBit of a long one here but bear with me. So this happened about 2 months ago and I have opinions from my friends but I wanted other peoples’ opinions on the matter. Over the summer my friend was at her annual army training for a month, away from her boyfriend, this has never been a problem for them because it would be her second time doing this while they were together, not to mention her leaving once a month to go on drill. Anyway she comes back and they begin having some relationship problems, mostly about what they want to do with their lives, I should also point out he is nearly 4 years older than her (almost 25 now). He has his life set and a career in front of him and she wants a career in the army which could send her basically anywhere in the world.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks and they “break up” for the first time, so to take her mind off of it we decided to go out with a group of friends for some drinks, she planned to sleep on the couch at my house and her boyfriend did not like that fact (I am a guy and he has never been a fan of me). So when she left that was when they “broke up”. When we were out and she got some drinks in her it was like she never even was dating him, let alone the fact that they were together not hours earlier, but she was just all over any guy that would give her attention, especially other guys in ROTC with her.\n\nThis cycle continues a couple more times and one day when I was home over the summer she texted me saying she wanted to hook up with me and that she has wanted to for a while now, she was of course, absolutely wasted, and complaining that her boyfriend doesn’t pay any attention to her like she needs it. I texted her that she is going to regret what she is saying in the morning and she did. Then I get a call from her saying that she had gone home and slept with a bartender from that night and that she didn’t know what to do or how to explain anything to her boyfriend. This is when I tell her she has to be up front with him about it and take whatever he does on the chin or just break up with him.\n\nShe opts for neither and decides to not tell him anything for a while. I let it slide because I knew she was trying to figure some stuff out about her future. But then she started hooking up with the lieutenant that was in charge of her at school. For those that don’t know thing about the military this is a BIG no no. this went on for a while and it started to really irritate me because she would be late to meet ups with myself and other friends because she was “busy” with this guy. During this time, her and her boyfriend were going through a rough patch but they weren’t officially broken up yet. Eventually I confronted her about the whole thing and told her she was jeopardizing her future by doing this and a fling when you’re this young isn’t worth risking your career.\n\nShe takes my advice and afterwards it seems like she is going to cut things off with her boyfriend officially and just be done… until he came to her house crying one night because he missed her, and she bought the whole thing. I will point out she did tell him she had been talking to other guys during their rough spot but he didn’t care that she had been “talking” to other dudes.\n\nEventually I hit a breaking point, people had recently been not up front with me about important things and I didn’t think what she was doing to him was at all fair, so I told him, “I know you’re not my biggest fan but I am not one of the guys that she hooked up with”. This of course started a shitstorm of epic proportions, my friend even tried messaging the girl I had recently ended things with asking if she wanted to do “mean shit” to get back at me.\n\nI dint feel bad for what I did because if I were the guy I would want to know the truth about what is going on, plus from my point it was a generally unhealthy relationship on both sides (I really think he is just staying with her because he wants to be engaged with someone in less than a year) so big question, am I the asshole for doing what I did and exposing my best friend to her boyfriend?",

      "description": "I (26/F) and my coworkers (various ages and genders) were told by our two bosses to attend a team meeting lunch today.  Our bosses have brought up this lunch the past two team meetings, so this has been discussed at minimum, for a month, in addition to having the team decide where to go for lunch.  All of us were told to not schedule any appointments to make it to this “team building lunch”, and payment was never discussed.  For background, the last 2 company outing/lunch were paid for, where each person was told we have $15 to spend on the company’s dime.  My coworkers and i assumed this would be the case again. \n\nMy coworkers and I all show up the restaurant on time, and we were all in good spirits, where my boss (60/F) was arriving late.  We waited anxiously as we have not heard from her and she is the one with the company card.  She arrives, we sit at our reservations, when she suddenly states that we are to all pay individually, and that she doesn’t understand why we would think this was paid for.  All of us are in shock, but one of my coworkers became upset and told my boss that she will be leaving this lunch as this was never discussed prior and she attended believing that this was free and required.  I and the other coworkers convinced her to calm down and come back, as my boss angrily stated she would rather have my coworker stay and that if it’s an issue she will pay for her.  \n\nI’m not condoning my coworker for snapping at our boss, but I am also very confused to why my boss would repeatedly reference this lunch, call it a team building, and not speak out regarding payment until we sat down.  This is not the first time my boss made plans and didn’t pitch in her money or time, so it was a buildup of sorts as well.  \n\nWere we the assholes to assume this lunch was free and feel upset?  This is super petty but I’ve never seen a boss behave this way.  ",

OK, fine. \n\nAround Xmas, I started distancing myself after the coworker and I went Xmas shopping together and the next day she told me I’d be going out with her again (I hadn’t agreed to) - I told her that I didn’t want to because I have an autoimmune disease that was flaring up to which she sent me some messages along the lines of “Oh. I see. No matter then. I guess I’ll just go..... alone”  I thought she was kind of crazy; especially after we hung out and she  and her wife allowed their 3 year old son to repeatedly hit me (hard) and expect me to babysit - so I just left her be and distanced myself.  A few months later my mother died, anyway, so I had a lot going on with that - and then I became pregnant and I’ve had a high risk pregnancy since then; so a lot has been going on. \n\nSkip to this past Thursday I receive a Facebook message that I didn’t read at the time because if I read a message whilst busy I sometimes forget to reply in between a busy social work job / high risk doctor appts and personal life - but it said something about hanging out from what I was able to see. I left it unread. \n\nOn Sunday I receive another messenger message saying “do you still have my pashmina and hat???”  I do, and I told her this 6 months  ago and asked to see her so I could return it - to which she said it was OK right now, maybe later. Again, I left it unread because I’d had a rough weekend / was painful / had worked a very long week and knew I’d have to address the first message too. \n\n\nJump to today I receive a text on my phone “I’m sending you messages on Facebook!” \n\nI didn’t reply as now I’m just kind of frustrated. She’s messaged me 3 times in 5 days and I feel it’s a bit excessive. I plan on returning her pashmina and hat and I’ve tried on several occasions already, but AITA for leaving her messages unread for a few more days or should I return this ASAP?! I don’t know if I’m in the wrong here by holding onto her stuff despite her messages? ",

I say \"cool with it\" because we never really resolved it by talking it out, it just kind of went away, but it's been bugging me for the longest time now.\n\nSo basically, me and my 2 friends are a group for our research paper, and the first term is reaching its end. I notice that our progress is kind of shitty, so I go ahead and ask one of my friends, what the plan is since I don't want to just decide things by myself. For some reason he becomes visibly frustrated and refuses to answer me, he just ignores me and walks away. I get irritated about this and for the rest of the day we basically ignore each other. For the next few weeks this goes on, until we as a group have a talk where we formulate our plan for the next few weeks. Even though we talk to each other for the sake of the research, the issue still lingered with the tension and whatnot, and only really dissipated about a few weeks later. I looked back on this and decided that I may have just been insensitive, but I don't really know, so AITA?",

      "description": "Obligatory posting this on a throw away account, so here goes. \n\nI was working in a record store, which I absolutely loved. I was only making 11 an hour, but that's pretty good for shitty retail. On top of the fact that I was a loved employee who always showed up on time and did their work right, I had a full-time position. Very rarely did I get less than 40h a week. It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst, either. I was happy, had co-workers I loved being around, got to listen to music all day long and generally just have a pretty chill and lax atmosphere to be in. \n\nNow granted, I was absolutely awful at the retail part, but my bosses didn't seem to care. They liked me enough to even offer me an office position at one of the store's parent companies that would boost me up to 14 an hour. Pretty swell, right? That's what everyone else said, proud of me for being considered, hyping it up to be some grand undertaking and a wonderful, exciting beginning to some new chapter in my life. It rubbed off on me. I let their excitement get to me, and I scheduled an interview the very next day, and took the job offer without a second thought the following Monday. \n\nBut then it all started to sink in that week. The \"my god, what have I done?\" I was filled with nothing but dread as the days crawled on. Everyone told me I was being silly. My boyfriend was especially irate, wondering why I'd gone from excited to completely and utterly anti-job position. \n\nToday was my first day, and it didn't suck. It was a cushy desk job with easy enough work that, don't get me wrong, I was super lucky to be offered in the first place. I'm very grateful they considered me for the position. \n\nBut I hate it. I'm not built for a desk job. I'm 21 among women in their 40s-60s, who are all absolute sweethearts and the nicest people possible. But I don't fit in. I went from music distracting my thoughts to utter silence, forced to stare at a clock all day and hammer a headache into my brain as I did nothing but tap numbers into a computer. \n\nI cried in the bathroom on my break, I was so miserable, and I just went straight to bed after getting home. My boyfriend is, understandably, still mad and irritated that I'm being so dramatic over the situation. He wants the pay raise, so we can do even better than what we do for our situation. Which I get, I want to be able to take care of us and my family too. \n\nBut we were doing okay while I had the last job. We weren't in danger of losing our apartment. I took the bus the mornings I needed to, and didn't have to stress myself out over a Lyft. I really, really enjoyed my quaint little record store job, and I want it back. \n\nBut I feel like a pathetic fool and an asshole for not being grateful over something handed to me on a silver platter.

      "description": "Background: My friend was sexually assaulted last year and the case finally went on trial in November. Many of the people involved in this case are international students whose English is far from perfect. The court did hire an interpreter to help the jury, but at the time, I’m the only other perfectly bilingual person in the courtroom.\nThe victim testified as a witness, regular drill, then it was the officer who interviewed my friend (the victim), and then it was the other witnesses. The judge asked if they need an interpreter for help, and one by one they said yes. The first two testified smoothly, nothing went wrong. But the third witness started to speak really long sentences and hard technical words when answering questions, and I could see the interpreter starting to stumble. Finally, he made an error, which I considered significant- he misinterpreted “I can’t just say random stuff without knowing” to “I can’t lie to help the case”. Knowing the consequences of contempt of court, I stood up and yelled “your honor, the accurate interpretation would be...” upon finished, I was escorted outside and warned verbally by the court martial.\nObviously it’s not my job to “check” the interpreter, and I feel that I may have jeopardized the case. I felt extremely ashamed, and I still do. I apologized to my friend over and over again but the only thing she said was that I “should’ve been more calm”. She didn’t blame me at all and we’re still great friends. Eventually the jury convicted the defendant.\nTl;dr- interpreter didn’t interpreter a line accurately, I heckled to correct him. Got kicked outta the courtroom.",

      "description": "I have recently turned  18, and I just thought back to two situations that happened a few years ago, probably 4, and I'm wondering if I was the asshole in the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nMy friend, let's call him John, and I were friends for a good 5 years at this point. We had been childhood friends, since we were both around 7-8. It was an exclusively online friendship, until last year when we finally met up, just to clarify. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently joined a Skype group chat that he was in with a good 15-16 of his friends, but I knew only one of them. They weren't too close to him, sparing a few. The girl I knew was more of a acquaintance then anything, I had only put myself out there to say \"I'll help you if you need anything,\" as she was dealing with depression at the time, so we had some sort of a relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the center of this group chat was a girl who we'll call Ana, and she was \"suicidal\" and \"depressed.\" Now, I would just like to clarify that I am not one to make fun of these things, but I just couldn't believe that she was dealing with these issues. Or rather, I couldn't believe that her \"issues\" were truly causing the problem in these situations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Situation 1**\n\nWhen I first met this girl, I was only about 12 and she was 13, and I was hanging out with John around this group of friends. I didn't join their group-chat for a long time, just for the one time. I asked John if he wanted to have a go on our current fighting game of the time, and when he said yes, she said \"If you go with him I'll go cut my wrists.\" 12 year old me went ballistic, saying that no suicidal person would say that. She wasn't dealing with any current issues, she literally said \"I'm in a bad mood, and if he leaves I will have nothing to do,\" and once I replied \"We can stay in the call and talk to you if you want, but we just want to play,\" she instantly denounces what I said and continued to push the fact that she would hurt herself. We got into an argument, but I had no \"back up\" because my friend was a mutual friend, and has always hated confrontation. Realizing that there was no persuading her, I backed off. She was just pooling her friends to gang up on me, and talking over me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Situation 2**\n\nThis brings me to when I was 15, and she was 16. I joined the group-chat to hangout, assuming she might have matured by now (I hadn't talked to her since the incident), to find out that she just didn't remember me, which I was fine with. We hung out for a week or two, until one day that John and I had plans. I needed help with a school project, and he was a year above me and agreed to help a week beforehand. We had to postpone it to 1 day before the due date, but it wasn't going to take long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe joined my call, a 1 on 1 call, to help me and after only 15 minutes he said \"brb\" and left. After two and a half hours of waiting, I decided to message him. Nothing. My anxiety was starting to act up, as I dealt with problems with it as a kid and it sometimes popped up in stressful situations, and I was GENUINELY WORRIED for his safety. His family situation was in no way safe, and he often had sporadic-emergency situations, as he was living in a very bad part of his town. Six hours after it happened, I checked the group chat, which I hadn't before because I was on \"Do Not Disturb\" and found that he had been calling with Ana that entire time. Apparently, she asked for a quick 5-minute rant session, but in fact wanted him to \"sit with her for the entire day.\" I joined, and asked what was up. \"Well, she's not feeling good and she won't let me leave, whenever I say I gotta leave she says she refuses to be without me, and that she'll hurt herself.\" I asked the situation, and she said \"My mom had a run in with the police, so I'm at the station just sitting on my computer, apparently she'll be fine, but she just needs to fill out some paperwork,\" I asked how that had taken six hours, and she didn't want to reply. John told me it was true, and realizing there was nothing I could do I asked if we could work on the project in the call with her there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"No, I want just John\" she said, and no matter how many times I pleaded, with the deadline approaching, she said no. She wanted no compromises. I got on her, telling her that I need to get it done. She replies \"if you keep this up ill kill myself and write you down on my suicide note as a bully.\" I flip, and my friend just sits there, trying to defend her. He said that he wanted to be \"neutral\" despite later telling me he ALWAYS thought I was right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter TWO WEEKS of trying to repair my reputation from her rumors, I sat down each and every person in the chat, except her boyfriend, and told them my story with full chatlogs. They all eventually agreed with me, but called me an asshole for \"calling her out instead of waiting until the next day.\" I then got into an argument with my friend, saying that if he believed I was right, that he shouldn't leave me out to dry, and that he should help defend me against the mob of strangers he introduced me to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Was I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I (38 M) live on the west coast of the USA, and I travel 10 or so times per year for work. Next month I have two trips to the east coast which happen to fall really close together. I have a week of meetings in DC followed by a meeting in New York the following Tuesday. I'm thinking it would be a lot easier (and possibly cheaper - although my company will pay for it either way) to just stay the weekend in New York rather than spend all day flying home on Friday, only to turn around on Monday and spend all day flying across the country again.\n\nProblem is, when I brought this up with my girlfriend (36 F) she got pretty annoyed. We live together and have been dating several years, and we normally spend weekends like that together just hanging out. But we don't have any specific plans for that weekend, and my kids are with my ex wife, and like I said it just seems more convenient. And, to be honest, I live in a smaller town and I do enjoy spending time in the big city. \n\nBut her response made it clear she's mad about this and there is a full blown fight in my future. She said that I'm being \"weird\" and \"avoiding my real life\" and \"being a workaholic\". I don't know if she's being insecure, or if she just doesn't want to spend the weekend alone, or if I'm actually being weird about this. I mean, I do enjoy being in the city and I have some work friends I might grab drinks with while I'm there, but most of the time I'll just be alone in my hotel room that weekend. So maybe it's objectively kind of insulting that I'd choose a lonely weekend alone in a hotel over a weekend of Netflix with her? I honestly don't know. \n\ntl;dr I'm planning to stay the weekend in New York rather than fly home between work trips, and my girlfriend is upset about it.",

      "description": "I know the title sounds ridicilious, so let me explain a little. So I saw this conversation going on in Jodel (anonymous app for short conversations) where a guy wanted a -i quote- HONEST OPINION OF HIS BODY. He states that there will be no dick pics, only one pic with body showing. I promise to give him an honest answer, and so do 2 other girls. \nSo he gives us his kik account. I start saying that everybody have a different type of bodies and I think every bodytype is beautiful etc. He sends a picture with him in his underwear and i notice that he have a huge erection in this picture. Fine, what else you can expect from that kind of conversation. Then he asks me if I want to review his dickpic. I politly say no, I think strangers dick pics are weird. \nThen I go back to the Jodel thread and ask from those two other woman that did he ask them also to review his dickpic. They both said yes.\nThis is the part when the man starts to get FURIOUS. He claims that I'm the asshole for even bringing that up in his thread. Then he says I'm a rude whore, who just got him to hate woman. I ask him what was wrong about me asking other girls just a question. He says that I humiliated him because I did tell everyone in that thread what he asked for. Then he creates multiple threads in channel, where people are looking for sex, asking if someone would bang me and giving my kik-account to everyone. He's trying to act like a girl so now I'm having flood of messages coming to my kik-account.\n\nSo, Am I the asshole for asking other girls that if the guy has asked them a same thing? Is that a violation of privacy?\n\nPs. Sorry for my english, not my first or even my second language, still trying to lern!",

      "description": "So, long story short here. Me and my wife had a dog for 5 years that we rescued from the pound. We absolutely loved him more than anything, but he was extremely aggressive towards strangers and pretty much anything that wasn’t me or her.\n\nThis was fine, and we managed it (despite him biting like 5 of my friends and family members). We tried everything under the sun to train him and get him trained, but I think his past life just screwed him up beyond repair.\n\nFast forward to when we had a son. He never really liked him, but we kept a very close eye on him and everything seemed fine. Last week though, he bit my 18 months old face viciously to the point where we had to take him to the ER to get glued. It was the straw that broke the camels back and we regretfully had to give him up. We found an elderly couple that have had experiences with dogs like him and promised us they’d take super good care of him and let us visit whenever we want.\n\nIt killed us, and since then the house just seems empty and we’re both shattered by having to give him up. We’ve been visiting dogs everywhere and we found a Bernedoodle puppy that we fell in love with from a reputable local breeder. We did adequate research and found out they’re super friendly with kids and are perfect family companions. Additionally, we feel like having him from a puppy age and raising him with kids, will make it part of his lifestyle. \n\nWe might bite the bullet and drop $1600 to get him tomorrow but I feel awful knowing that we just gave our other dog away. So Reddit, please AITA here?",

      "description": "My partner and I are friends with another couple. Let's call them A and B. A has bpd, anxiety, and another handful of mental disorders. Due to the nature of bpd, she used to hate me when we didn't know each other that well. \n\nI started dating my current SO who was also in that circle of friends, and because of that she gave me another chance. I have PTSD and depression and overtime we bonded over some similar a struggles we go through and she apologized for hating my guts. \n\nThings have been amicable between us for months, and we take turns hosting weekly with our group of 5-7 friends.  This weekend even though I've been feeling really sick, tired, and emotionally fucked up because I'm pregnant, I still hosted the party. (It's too early to tell anyone).\n\nSunday we were supposed to go for brunch on a double date. It was A's idea. I woke up and confirmed that we still wanted to go. A said that B was still sleeping but we set a time to meet. About 10-15 minutes later I started having really bad morning sickness and overall body aches. (I've been getting every uncomfortable pregnancy symptom imagineable). \n\nI message A and say \"I actually don't feel good enough to go out and I'm really nauseous and bloated.\" I sent that and then rolled around in pain until passing out.\n\nI woke up later and got a huge block of text from A about how rude I am and that last minute cancellations really triggers her bpd and anxiety along with other things. Since I didn't apologize or propose a rescheduled date she said she would no longer try to make plans with me because it causes her too much anger.\n\nI'll give her that, I did forget to say sorry or suggest another time. But I was in so much pain I wasn't over thinking my cancellation like I usually would.\n\nI have yet to respond, I left it on read. I'm tired of walking on eggshells around A, it's quite exhausting for me. AITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Giving context, I have two classes which overlap due to my poor scheduling and some circumstances that were out of my control. I am in my final year / semester of university and am expecting to graduate, but in order to do so I need a single math credit. Unfortunately I have an overlap of 30 minutes for two of my classes. Normally I skip the math class as Im semi-confident in the work, but I have an exam this upcoming Wednesday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for the AITA bit, I told my teacher two months ago that I would at some point have to miss a class for atleast 20 minutes so that I can finish this exam, but I'd only be late rather than skipping entirely. She didn't exactly say it was alright, but that we'd talk about it on a later date, but she did state that if anyone was going to miss that letting her know would help her schedule around it. The class is a seminar class, and I won't be presenting that day so it would just be my comments for the presenter that would be missing, and it has no effect on my grade whatsoever. Today however, two days before the exam I just wanted to remind her that I would be missing for a portion of the class, and she decided to yell infront of the entire class to be about how she expects 100% attendance, and how I would have to make it up with the professor of the other class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if I'm being an asshole for missing the class even though I told her months prior that I would have to miss and she didn't seemed phased by it at the time.",

      "description": "I am a university student and the door holding etiquette on my campus is, in my opinion, extremely excessive. People have held the door for me when I’m a solid 20-25 feet away, in extreme cases. I HATE this because then I have to walk faster to not make them wait and it just feels awkward and unnecessary for everyone involved. This is in all academic buildings, the student center, basically anywhere people walk between classes. \n\nAnyway, my general rule is that if the door would naturally close before the nearest person behind me reaches it, I don’t hold it for them. However, this means that sometimes I turn around and look at the person behind me (to see how far away they are) and then don’t hold the door for them. Sometimes we make eye contact. Sometimes I get a little frustrated with the whole situation and don’t hold the door even if people are a little closer. I never just let a door slam in someone’s face, but should I be doing more to match the general campus culture? \n\nEdit: I am happy to hold the door open for people close (like &lt;10 feet) behind me. I often go out of my way to open the door for people carrying packages/who would struggle opening the door themselves for any reason. I just don’t like when door holding for the sake of politeness turns into this awkward show that both delays the door holder and makes the person behind them feel the need to do a weird half-jog to the door to not waste their time.

      "description": "Some back story. I'm white, my best friend since middle school is a black dude named Rob. I'm not a white guy who says \"I have lots of black friends\" because I don't, but Rob and I have been thick as thieves since we went to Jr nationals for wrestling. I literally love the guy like a brother.\n\nWe are in second semester of freshman year at our state university. Since we both hope to apply to professional grad schools, we've been searching around for community service groups in order to make contacts, get experience and maybe even help the community. We both volunteered for a veterans service organization where we go around and make sure that elderly veterans have thier basic services covered and aren't living in a dirty house. So far it's been kind of a waste of time because everyone we check has thier shit together and seem to resent us as busy bodies. Whatever, the leader of this group thinks she's saving the world and Rob and I are gong to stick it out to spring break and then find something else.\n\nSo the group had this dinner on Wednesday night at a restaurant and we went because, why not free food. I have no idea what Robs deal was but I looked across the table and Rob was cutting and eating his hamburger with a knife and fork. I about died laughing because it looked so ridiculous and I had no idea what he was doing and I've eaten meals with him thousands of times and I've never seen him do such a thing. It was hysterically funny.\n\nSo I looked at him and I said \"hey Rob are you eating your burger with a fork because you don't like black people touching your food?\"  Rob literally laughed so hard that he coughed up the piece in had in his mouth. We say stuff like this to each other all the time. \n\nBut the reaction from everyone else was the most ridiculous \"clutch the pearls\" shocked white people reaction you've ever seen. I may as well have shot Rob in the face. I was scolded by the head of of the volunteer group in person, while literally every other person present came over to Rob to make sure he was \"OK.\"  I knew I fucked up but as we were leaving we got a huge laugh about it and Rob told me that some of the cuter volunteer chicks might actually feel sorry for him enough to have sex with him. I thought it was over and done with.\n\nWell yesterday director lady sent out a group email talking about the \"horrors of racism\" and how words have power and how racism must be ripped out by its roots wherever we see it and at the end she said \"u/Monsterof will be apologizing to the entire group at Friday's meeting.\" Not apologizing to Rob who my joke was directed towards...but apparently to the group of angry white peoples who were sleepless over the mean words (not directed at them) I said to my best friend ok the planet.\n\nAgain, Rob and I got a big laugh but I'm really pissed she said I WOULD be apologizing when I hadn't even been consulted yet. I think I should just quit and leave her hanging. Rob wants me to get up there and make a mockery of her apology but I don't even want to do that. \n\nNot necessarily looking for advice because I have until 3 when the meeting starts, but am looking for am I the asshole or not?",

      "description": "**Bare with me if this is overly dragged on, or my punctuation or abbreviations aren’t the best. Also if my grammar is trash, I’m sorry. I’m more of a browser than a poster**\n\nOkay so I’ll try to make a long story short. My cousin, 17yo female who we will call A, has been sneaking around with this 28yo woman who we will call M. (M has a girlfriend of like 4 years). Anyways, I introduced A to M years ago but M is a big party person and honestly she gave me the creeps if I hung around too long. She had a crush on me when I was younger, now that I’ve grown up not so much but that could be because I don’t see her ever. So little background on A, she has absolutely no parental figure in her life ; aside from me but I’m a 22yo who still hasn’t figured anything out. She didn’t graduate high school, she dropped out at like 14. Her mom has multiple sugar daddies and a low key drug addiction but she wants to mean well. Her dad works all the time in a different town and well A only really shows care when it’s her pay day which is $100 from dad twice a month. Sooo A and I shared two best friends. They both died. The first one died in Nov of 2017, the second who was actually the sister of the first, died one month ago. Now we were all just starting to accept that our best friend had died, and now her sister did to, so that door has opened back up even wider. A has now reconnected with M, has been drinking straight vodka with M every single day for the last two weeks straight, lying about silly things such as where she is, or who she is with (she’s never lied to me before) however she did tell me that her and A have a connection and do things to each other when M’s gf isn’t around. To me it sounds like M is kind of a predator and sees that my cousin is in a very vulnerable state of mind, let alone young and will give almost anyone affection who shows interest in her at this time in her life, or more so gives her an abundance of booze to wash away the pain. To top it off, A’s mom just had brain surgery today for her aneurysms and A didn’t even send a text. She may not be the best mother but she’s still her mom. SOOO WIBTA if I find a way to contact M’s girlfriend and tell her that M is sleeping with A in their own house when she’s not looking? I feel this is the only thing that will get A away from M and ease her drinking.  I’ve talked to A, I told her my thoughts, asked her what she thinks will happen between them, etc. it’s to the point now where she is completely ignoring me. I just wanna know what I should do. I really don’t care if she gets mad at me. I would rather that than have it be her funeral I’m attending next. \n\n",

I said something along the lines of \"Listen, buddy, maybe instead of invalidating my frustrations and acting superior you could, oh I dunno, give me helpful solutions and/or just fucking empathize with me?\" (That was a TLDR, I actually typed out something much longer.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo which he replied \"There's a book I'm not going to read\" (Referring to the long paragraph I texted the chat) And then out of nowhere \"Maybe if you want to keep your friends you should stop pushing them away\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was it. I was done. I said as much and left the group chat, and I'm very much planning on not speaking to this friend again. Am I the asshole here? I feel a little bit of guilt, but at the same time I feel I can never vent to this dude, he always pulls this shit and says stuff like \"just accept it\" with that same superior tone and it pisses me off more every time.",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm calling her Emily. She's abused.\n\nI am abused too. My father was an alcoholic drunk and my mother doesn't care about me, but my dad's out of the picture now. I was basically raised by my older brother but now he's in college, and I'm at home.\n\nAs a result of this abuse I'm depressed, anxious, and I hate how I look. I weigh 80 pounds and I'm way too fat, so I don't eat much.\n\nSome backstory on this is that in July, some drama happened in our friend group and one of my friends, I'm calling him Jon, ended up accusing me of using my abuse as an excuse and he said I wasn't trying to improve even though I was after Emily ended up crying or something when I started getting self-hating thoughts and left.\n\nWe fought and he wasn't my friend anymore, and I called Emily saying that Jon called me a selfish attention whore, which he basically did with the way he talked to me. She told me she agreed with him because sometimes I hurt her because I feel bad about myself alot and when she tries to cheer me up I \"accuse\" her of lying. I don't, I just have a problem thinking everybody hates me sometimes, so when she cheers me up its hard to believe because of the abuse I went through.\n\nShe also said it was basically all my fault that her girlfriend Sarah spent their anniversary talking to me instead of her because I called Sarah saying that I wanted to kill myself and she ended up texting me all day instead of doing whatever they were supposed to do. I told her that my mental health was at stake and she got mad because I \"should of known\" because I accidentally did the same thing before, its not my problem to remember their anniversary. Plus, I've known Sarah longer than she has and thats why I turned to her first instead of my other friends for help. She just didnt understand how Jon made me feel - I felt like he was my abusive father, yelling at me. She didn't even have any sympathy for me, and I told her that, that she couldn't understand how I felt because she wasn't abused as bad as I was (she only got verbal abuse and a few slaps - not as bad as me) and how hurt I was that she didn't have any sympathy. She called me abusive and left, which was really rude and hurtful.\n\nI told Sarah about it and she got really mad at ME, which was really hurtful. She stopped talking to me, but I figured I'd let it blow over.\n\nA week later I decided to be the bigger person and apologize, and told her how she made me cut myself so she apologized as well. Everything was back to normal except she was acting weird around me, and wouldn't spend as much time with me as before and hung out with Jon alot. Because of my abuse and my anxiety I thought it was because she was secretly gossiping about me to Jon and Sarah because Sarah hadn't talked to me since, and so I got really mad at her and asked her if she hated me alot because I needed the reassurance that she didn't because of my anxiety.\n\nOne day I told her about how I thought she was talking about me behind her back because I can't help thinking about it due to my abuse, and I thought she'd reassure me again. Instead she got offended and told me it was rude to say that because it meant I didn't trust her as a friend but I explained that due to my abuse, you could put me infront of the worlds most honest person and I still wouldn't trust them. She told me to get a therapist if I can't trust anyone and I told her it was offensive of her to suggest that all I did was sit around and do nothing about my mental health because my depression is so bad that I can't go to school. She told me that she \"tried \\[her\\] best but \\[she\\] can't anymore\" and blocked me and stopped talking to me and since then my other friends have also told me that they don't want to talk about my personal problems anymore even the ones i relied on when I think about suicide so that makes me think that she's gossiping about me.\n\nThe other day she agreed to give me a second chance after I bumped into her with her friends in the mall and talked to her about it saying how nervous I was and that I admitted I was taking out my frustrations about Sarah ghosting me on her. I cried a bit when I saw her and I told her I was sorry and that she made me cut myself because she left. I really wanna fix this because this is the last chance I have with her and she honestly helps alot with my problems when we aren't fighting so I need it because everyone else can't help. She hasn't talked to me since we bumped into each other though and she still blocked me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I have been with my girlfriend for nearly 2 years - even though I'm 34 and she's 28, we've had a much different relationship history. I've never really had anything go beyond a couple of months while she has been in 2 long-term relationships (4+ years each) - the 2nd of which resulted in a child who is now 5.\n\nGiven that I'd spent the whole of my teens and 20's effectively single, the little aspirations I did have of having kids basically dissipated away. In fact, I was initially unsure of pursuing a relationship with my GF because she had a son and knew that committing to her would ultimately mean committing to him too.\n\nI have committed and while I have a great time with him and am happy to provide for him (his Dad is pretty useless but does see a lot of him as he lives 2 streets over), I don't feel that I have that 'unconditional' love that I even have for my nieces.\n\nWhile my girlfriend has said that she has no interest in going through a pregnancy right now (her pregnancy was pretty horrible), she didn't want to say never. I said that I felt that my time to have a child has been and gone as I wouldn't want to even have her conceive until we're married which would be years down the line and I'd be in my 40's by the time my child started school.\n\nShe seemed fine with that but then I said, and this is where things changed, that 'I also worry that, subconsciously, I might give preferential treatment to my biological child over my stepchild'\n\nShe seemed extremely upset that I don't consider her child mine and that I was some kind of monster for suggesting that I could show preference to one child. It was at this point I brought up the fact that the father of her child already had a child and asked her if she loved them as much as she does her own to which the reply was \"that's different\" and left the room.\n\n\nThat was about 3 days ago and since then, barely a word has been exchanged between us, other than being told how selfish and uncaring I am.\n\nI really don't think what I said was so bad and I didn't say for a fact that I would favour my child over a step child, merely that there was a chance that I could and I would hate to do that to my stepson so would rather not have a child at all.\n\nTL:DR\nI tell my gf that I'm not particularly bothered about being a dad, partly because I couldn't guarantee being impartial with my child and my step-child.

She showed me a photo of two black girls. They were super adorable, and I asked if her kids were adopted. She said \"No, I popped them out of my vagina.\" I apologized and that was that. \n\nFast forward to present day, on Facebook she wrote a post about how she encountered a rude person at the mall who asked if her kids were adopted infront of the girls. Her post went on to vent about how people are so ignorant. Many comments followed along, stating how people are rude and they have no business in knowing how their kids came to be. \n\nI also remembered that she shared what I said to our coworkers over lunch. We were talking about stupid things we can personally say, and I added to the conversation that I say inappropriate things at inappropriate times. That coworker said, \"Yeah, like the time you asked me if my kids were adopted.\" Many of her close friends were at that lunch table and looked horrified and gave me a very dirty look. \n\nAm I the asshole for asking if her kids were adopted?\n\nIn my defence, her kids are very, very dark and did not look like they were mixed.. It happened a few months ago, and I don't know whether to apologize again or not. I apologized immediately when it happened... but seems like she's keeping a list of all the people that have said similar things to her as her Facebook is flooded with posts explaining these encounters...

Most teenagers wouldn't bother learning the language, leaving mostly adults that are able to speak Spanish. I come from a Spanish speaking family and is fluent in Spanish.\nM=me\nQ=friend\nC=other friend\n\n\nSo, Q has always shown digust towards Spanish, but in a much heavier way than most teenagers. He often uses gags such as: \"Yo no poderéis hablamos el Español bien\",\"Spaniish is stupid\" or \"Le êspangole c'est bête et mal\", the last gag is said with his knowledge of French (We get French lessons in school). At first, I used to think it was funny, and laughed too. But one day he sent me a pic, a very rude one(in my opinion), it was a before and after. It had a ink cartrige box and it had two \"flaps\" to open it, one says \"open here\" and the other one says \"abrir\". He put a disgusted face emoji and a text that said: \"Me: spanish is disgusting\" for the unopend box as the before and \"What I did\" for the opened box as the after. He oblitirated the \"open here\" side. I told him that the foto was racist and that he should remove it. It could have not been racist if he didn't put that emoji and changed the text a bit. But he then proceeded to tell C and C says:\" Aww, you're going to break his heart\" and laugh (Since that is what he always does when Q tells him one of the gags mentioned above). Then he told another classmate the same thing and she said \"Just because he doesn't like Spanish doesn't mean he's racist\" without seeing the picture. So, my question is:\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Background: My son´s father and I do not have any official custody agreement. When we lived in the same city son´s dad would come over a few times a week. The place I was renting was sold and I ended up moving to my home town 40 min away and we did the every other weekend thing. Then I had to move 4 hours away, but still in the same province. Neither of us drive - myself for medical reason and my son dad just never got their licence. I had been taking the bus with my son  down to my home town on long weekends and my son dad would pick him up from there this cost $300 for me and $25 for my son´s dad. My son´s dad very rarely came to pick him up and when he did there was a 6 hour delay between the bus getting in and the bus going back during which time my son´s dad would stay at my place, very uncomfortable for me, but I put up with it from my son.  \n\n\nThe issue is that my son´s dad rents a room in an apartment, this was supposed to be a temporary setup and they were supposed to move out within a few months - it is now going on 6 years. My son has no separate sleeping area, not even a mattress on the ground, they share a bed. My son is about to turn 11 and it doesn´t feel right to me that they still share a bed. In fact I think it is illegal in my province for their not to be a different sleeping area for kids over 5. Because neither of us drive there can´t really be day trips, my son´s father asked me to take him down to my home town so he could see him during the day, but it cost over $300 to do so - money they do not help with, whereas the trip is only $25 from their place to my home town. My ex´s idea on how to solve this is for them to stay at my place because I have an extra bedroom, but that is not going to happen because I cannot have my ex staying at my house, it would be awful, the 6 hours they stay between buses is bad enough.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want my son to see his dad, but this isn´t working for us. WIBTA if I tell him he needs to find alternative sleeping arrangements. ",

      "description": "My cousin was coming to the US for an intensive English program and it was assumed by my family that we would take her in for the semester. A week before she arrived we learned that she was pregnant, by that point it was way too late to change our minds about the living situation. \n\nWe run an Airbnb out of our home, and she needed a job so we decided to give her the cleaning fee and she would clean it. We ended up paying for her food, and she would cook in exchange. Otherwise she was not helping around the house, and if I asked her to follow a house rule she would just ignore it. \n\nI know she is very homesick so I invite her to watch TV with me and my husband when at home, we invite her to hang out when we have friends over. We also help her get to class we drive her to and pick her up from the train station everyday. Still she mostly she just hung out in her room. \n\nShe isn’t very quiet about going down the stairs in the morning, so I told her that she was walking down the stairs very loudly and if she could keep it down to not disturb the guests. She responded that “it’s not like they try to be quiet, they are loud and keep us up at night” (the guests last night were on the louder side). I said they were our guests and they paid us to stay here, and it’s not like you pay. She stormed off made sure to be sure to stomp down the stairs. On the way out I made a comment “you can leave if you want to...”. \n\nWhen I came home all of her stuff was gone and she went to live with a friend she made at school. I did not expect her to move out from a small argument. It just happens to be our equivalent of Christmas today, and I feel terrible. ",

Since then we've had contact through texts mostly and meet up about twice a year for a cup of tea.\n\nLast week he asked if I wanted to meet up again, I asked him if Saturday (today) was okay at 12.30 in the afternoon. He said it would be early because he would go out drinking the day before till about 3am but he would manage.\n\nToday I woke up and immediately felt a big depressive episode flare up. I argued with my fiancé literally over making breakfast and then burst out crying. Not really a good way to start the day.\n\nAt 10.30am I texted this guy to ask him if he was okay with moving the date since I needed to take it easy (he knows about my depression and I told him about my morning). He didn't see it until 11.45 and told me \"I just woke up really early but ok.\" I gave him a few dates during which I am available for a drink and he just said he could only do tomorrow. I can't since I have another planned event then, so I told him that. \n\nLater he asked me if he could go back to sleep then if we weren't meeting up so I said sure. He then texted me \"But I can't fall asleep anymore\".\n\nTo be honest, I feel shitty but I have my reasons for moving the date. I told him on time and he chose to go out till 3am (I usually get drunken texts throughout the week from him so it's not like he never goes out). AITA? ",

      "description": "Title says it, but I'll go into a couple important details: Before our son was conceived, we were talking and she was saying how if she had kids she wanted them to be healthy and eat vegan like her. I was like ehh I mean I guess that's an interesting idea. I never said oh yeah let's do that. We weren't planning to have a kid by the way, this is when we first got together, maybe a couple months after, then we had our son maybe 2-3 years later. I never agreed to this, just humored the idea, ya know, and I'm being serious about this, not twisting the story. When he was born or a little before or after, can't remember, she told me that he was going to be vegan and that if I had a problem with it, I could leave and she could do it on her own. After the baby was born she was living with my mom and I. I obviously told her no, I'm not going to leave, but I think that it's unfair that she makes this huge decision without really saying anything about it, and putting me in this \"guilt trip/ultimatum\" spot. We argued and fought over it, she threatened to leave and said he can be vegetarian instead. I wasn't going to give up my son for some dumb shit like that, so I said fine. We argue from time to time over it and I was wondering if I have a right to still be pissed off about it and I had a right to be pissed off in the beginning as well. She also pulled the same kind of ultimatum when she proclaimed he was going to be Catholic and go get baptized with her and her family one day. I said wtf no why? I want him to be baptized at a baptist church because that's what I was. We had actually talked about this before. She said she doesn't even have a religion, she was Catholic as a child, but hated it blah blah blah, and that it was fine if I wanted to take him to church and stuff. Like I said she pulled the same ultimatum stuff, but then later gave it up because the appointment or whatever fell through. Thanks guys, sorry for the long post.",

      "description": "I’m 16 almost 17 and she’s 17. Our parents (my dad her mum) got married this year and we now live together. It’s fine, we don’t not get along, but we’re not very similar. I’m a lot more outgoing than she is and we’re just into different things. I’m often out at a party or clubbing while she stays home. My birthday is coming up and me and some of my friends are gonna go to a club, I was talking about it the other day and I think she might have been upset that I didn’t invite her. The thing is, because she’s not really that outgoing she probably wouldn’t really fit in with us and I’d feel like I have to kinda babysit her if she came, me and my friends often get quite drunk too and I just feel like it wouldn’t really be her thing. \n\nMy dad told me I should invite her. AITA for not inviting her? ",

She shouted at me to hurry up, which led to me shouting back at that moment saying why did you shout at me. As we ppoceeded to sit down, she said in a voice loud enough to be heard by the bus driver. Don’t blame me, the bus driver was scolding me already, saying he had to leave at 22.20. I was really tempted to reply in a loud tone as well taht he should be leaving at 22:22, and why was he rushing, to see his hospitalized Mother? \n\nI didn’t do that last part in the end, didn’t wanting to start an argument on board.\n\nAfterwards, my mom told me he even shut the doors for awhile while my mom was asking him to wait for 20ish seconds.

So to recap, we went out for a $70 dinner which I paid for. No worries. Then we grab some Starbucks, I ALWAYS buy her coffee almost every day tbh. She ordered herself coffee and just paid for it. This instance sort of upset me because she didn’t even think to offer to grab me a coffee, and I sure as hell didn’t want to pay for one after this pricey dinner. \n\nEarlier this week, she mentioned that she had $150 for the next week and she needed to spend it wisely. I figured this would be her reason not to pay for my coffee, which was cool, so I didn’t ask her about it. Later that night she brags to me about the amazing savings she just got on victoriasecret.com and that she just had to buy something because the $30 price tag was so cheap.\n\nAITA for being annoyed that she didn’t even consider a simple gesture like grabbing me a coffee today?",

      "description": "For context: we’ve been dating for 1.5 years. Also for context, we’re both pretty private with our phones, her more than me. Her notifications don’t go to the lock screen, and she has a complicated password I’d never guess (not that I’d normally care; I barely even noticed until now). \n\nThis happened last night and I can’t shake through whether or not I’m justified. We were cuddling and a name called “Ken 😜” popped up on her phone on FaceTime. She tried to reject it really quickly but it seemed suspicious to me. I asked her who was that and she hesitated a moment before admitting it was her ex. This bothered me because we both don’t really say positive things about our exes, and I have no idea why he’d FaceTime (I don’t know if it’s just me, but video calling seems a lot more personal than phone calls or text messages). \n\nI asked her if she normally talks to her ex and she says no; they never talk, and doesn’t know why he called. I asked why was his name saved as that if she never talks to him, and she got annoyed and maintained that it was from when they were dating and she never deleted it. \n\nI asked her if she’d mind if I saw her text messages; not for everyone, just for that specific person. Or if I could look at her call logs. She looked at my like I had four eyes and was **PISSED**. She said that why do I want to go snooping on her phone? It’s a breach of privacy. I replied that I didn’t see it as snooping; it was just suspicious that a name she supposedly never talked to FaceTimed her, and it wouldn’t really take much to confirm her story. She restated that if I kept up acting crazy, she’d lose me, and I’m acting ridiculous. We fought, and as of now, we’re not speaking. \n\nI never really had a reason to not trust her, which is why I think I might be acting crazy. At the same time, it would’ve taken a quick 5 second glance to confirm her story. As it stands, it just sounds sketchy, and I can’t tell if she’s just that private, or is hiding something. I would normally NEVER go through my partner’s phone without probably cause, but an ex FaceTiming you and the sketchiness just seemed weird. \n\nAITA for wanting to go through her phone?",

      "description": "I live in a building with a parking lot, all owned by my rental agency. There is a house along one side that shares the lot and has a parking spot, but they do not own their spot. When I moved in I did not own a car, so I allowed the neighbors to use my allocated spot for themselves or their friends. \n\n\nAfter I got a car, the neighbors started to act in an unfriendly way towards me. They are both men, we'll call them Jim and Bob. Jim immediately started complaining about how I parked too closely to his car. The lot has to accomodate 9 people and it is a tight fit but no one else complains. I was well within my lines, it wasn't as if I was parking half in his spot. Just too close to the edge in his opinion. A reasonably good driver would still have ample room to get out. It felt like harrassment more than it did a real complaint. He would come out of the house and ask me to repark the car to his liking. He would also come out and stand on his stairs whenever I was coming and going, for what purpose I don't know. I am a careful driver and have never had an accident, nor have I ever dinged someone's car. I felt like he was not treating me with the good will that I had shown him when I allowed him to park in my spot before I had a car. \n\n\nToday we got a lot of snow so I went out to shovel. There was a huge pile of snow behind my car. I was frustrated and immediately assumed the couple was responsible for it. That they had shovelled out one of their cars at their convenience. I was angry so I started shovelling and piling snow in a way that would leave them with more work to get their second car out. Bob comes out and says, \"Don't pile the snow so it will be harder for me to shovel myself out.\" I replied, \"I would have appreciated if you did not pile snow behind my car.\" Jim comes to the door and claims someone else came by and did that. They immediately start hurling insults at me. I tell them to fuck off. They go back inside. \n\n\nAs it turns out, a snow removal crew was responsible for the pile behind my car. They were having issues with their plow and returned later to finish the job. Bon and Jim come out and make small tall with the two man crew, saying loudly stuff like \"It is nice to know there are good people left in the world.\" \n\n\nI feel bad for accusing them and losing my temper. But my thought processes was that this was something they were capable of, since they had treated me poorly and in a bullying fashion from the start. AITA for losing my temper and accusing them?  I would have gone and apologized for the misunderstanding, but for the fact that they had threatened to stick a meat hook in my ass and have generally treated me like a subordinate when they have no place to do so.",

      "description": "On mobile so screw formatting right?\n\n     So this happened when I was 16 at the time. My brother was deported for having an drunk underage girl with an almost empty bottle of gin and a baggy of weed in her hoodie and having his pipe out and another baggy of weed in his trunk. My mom spent well over 40k on an attorney to have almost all of the charges dropped. He was still convicted on possession of marijuana, parafonalia and a DUI . He was going to get 4 months in a county jail but I started laughing at his trial and he threw his chair at me and they made it a year and a half.\n\n     So my mom barges into my room and starts to scold me about getting a job and how my brother worked at 14 and how lazy I am. I was pissed and told her that I can't get a job whilst holding a visa for education and if I was caught I would be deported. She said that some random lady's daughter was working at Hardee's and she was here for education too. I said that I would rather focus on getting good grades and stacking my things for when college application time comes around. She just scoffed and told me  to find a job. But for the mean time she drops it\n\n     I cue me telling my dad that I have a test for my French 3 class and if I get a high enough score I get a stamp on my diploma proving I can speak it fluently. I told him I wanted to take the same test but for Spanish as it would look better than just saying I know Spanish. He got mad and said that I shouldn't do it since it was a waste of money, even though it only cost $20 to take the test. My mom just starts talking about how my brother is so hard working and how much money he made (illegally) and that I should follow in his footsteps.\n     \n        I then brought up that I'd rather get good grades then be a druggie at a dead end Job that has to go to a remedial school because of his shit grades and all his absences. She starts yelling about how disrespectful I am and how I should never criticize my brother cuz he's just a hard worker. I clapped back with,\" Really, what job is he working rn in Mexico?\" She got red and tried taking my phone. I told her that if she wants me to be like my brother that I'd gladly go buy some weed rn and  crash the car so I can get deported so I could leech off my parents at 23yo. She told me that my brother never asked my dad for $20 a week . I asked her if that's really what she wants to fight about rn.\n\n       My mom doesn't cook. We're not poor by any means. My mom doesn't like buying food either. I can't legally get a job so I have to ask my mom to let me buy food. She always thows it in my face whenever we argue so I just decided to ask for an allowance from my dad. So I told her that $20 is just too hurtful but that she'll gladly go spend 10k each on my brother and the random bitch he found at a bar to bring them here illegally. Her voice started to shake and I said that if the $20 a week I ask for so I can eat lunch since no one cooks at home and there's nothing to cook with even if someone wanted to.\n        \n         So is $20 too much to spend on a 16yo boy that is supposed to be eating more and growing more and that even the doctors say that she has stunted my growth to then Turn around and spend $300 a week on a grown man that is perfectly capable of taking care of himself. To give him money to order supreme and Gucci online because he thinks \"Looking poor is gross\". That she would rather buy him $400 frames and $100 lenses but then refuse to let me have glasses because you think of people with glasses as disabled.\n\n          To give him 2 cars and have him irreparably crash both. To give him a phone since he was 10. To give him a new phone 13 different times because he kept breaking them. To let him refer to you as \"stupid Bitch\" and let him call you \"The whore\". To let him emotionally manipulate you time and time again for money. That if she thinks that $20 a week is enough for a teenager to eat off of. I was livid at this point. I said that she should pray and hope I let her see her grandkids if she keeps treating me like I'm just some bill she has to pay. \n        Oh and a side note. My parents never remember my birthday. Something just clicks in them making them itch to to ruin what is supposed to be a happy day. I have never had a birthday where I wasn't left crying from getting yelled at by my parents. But when it comes to my brother they have all the love I the world to give. So am I the asshole.\n\n\n\nTLDR; My mom compares me to my brother and tells me to get a job even though I'm not legally allowed to, I brought up everything that my brother has ever done.

      "description": "I'm kinda torn about this and think I fucked up.\n\nA week ago a friend of mine tells me she will break up with her boyfriend. I assume she did it and we meet on friday as planned some time before. After a few hours of hiking with her and me being quite tired due to having partied a bit too much the previous night (hangover, diziness and so on - I know hiking wasn't the smartest idea), she accompanies me back to my place. \n\nI sort of get better after drinking a lot of water, we watch Netflix as we usually do and she starts a pillow fight because I joked about her being small. \n\nOne thing leads to another and we're snuggling. At that point she asks me \"assume we have sex right now, would you have sex with me because you desire me or because you have the opportunity of having sex with a woman?\". Well I was honest with her and told her that I indeed find her very attractive and that it wouldn't be the same as having sex with a random woman.\n\nNow this is where I should have asked \"but did you quit your boyfriend?\". The idea went through my head but I directly assumed she wasn't the kind of girl to cheat on her boyfriend so I dismissed it.\n\nAnd well the next morning I asked her how did her breakup go. That's when she tells me she didn't breakup, because the moment she wanted to her boyfriend told her his grandmother died and she didn't want to add more pain. She then told me she wasn't proud of what she did and that I was an asshole for not assuming I was helping her cheat on her boyfriend and trying to be morally intact from this story. \n\nSince then, I'm feeling bad because well, my last girlfriend cheated on me and I was devastated for months and I'm the sort of guy who believes that I shouldn't do to others what I wouldn't want them to do to me. She left him yesterday though, but won't ever tell him this story. ",

      "description": "So my coworker took me out to dinner one night since we’re both here on a project and he paid with a company credit card. He makes a joke about how his boss got onto him for spending too much at restaurants while traveling some time and he mentioned it’s because he usually tips around 20% which I thought no big deal. \n\nNow for some context, my coworker has been working here ~10 years or so and I just started so he’s not exactly my boss, more like a mentor, so he does have some superiority over me(idk if that’s the right phrasing but hopefully you get what I mean). \n\nWhere things get questionable is when the bill comes by. The total is like $69 before tip, so to tip 20% he puts under the tip $14. No big deal. However he did the mental math wrong somehow and put $73 for the total instead of $83. I noticed it but didn’t say anything because I didn’t want him to think I’m smarter than him or make him feel stupid especially since I’m new and don’t want to start things off on the wrong foot with a mentor. Now AITA for not saying something since there’s a chance that the waitress will only get a $4 tip on a $69 tab? \n\nI genuinely don’t think he did it on purpose since he just said he tips 20% and he’s also everything but an asshole. I just don’t know if what I did could be considered assholeish behavior. ",

      "description": "Okay, the reason I’m posting this is because I have mixed results from my coworkers and friends. I’m on mobile, so sorry for any issues. TLDR @ bottom\n\nSome backstory; I’m a 16 y/o shift manager at a fast food chain. Over the summer I was working 50-60 hours a week, and when school started I said I can only work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. This was obviously a blow to the management team, which consists of two full time managers (GM and AGM) and then another part time student who only works Sunday . \n\nHere is where the controversy comes in. I want to quit very badly. The reason is that I asked off 2 weeks ago for this coming Friday because I have finals this week (my school runs trimesters, weird right?) and I want to work on papers that are due at midnight. So my manager, when doing the schedule last thursday, got mad at me and told a coworker that she’s going to schedule me for Wednesday because i shouldn’t have asked off for a day that I usually work. \n\nWell, I’m screwed now because I have finals and a presentation due on Thursday and I will be working to ~11 Wednesday night, when I specifically said at the beginning of the school year I couldn’t work schooldays. My coworkers are saying I’d be an douche because I would leave the management stranded with no closer for Friday thru Sunday, especially seeing that we are starting to get busy now that the weather is picking up. \n\nTLDR: GM got mad at me because I asked off for a day I usually work because I have finals, so she schedules me a close in the middle of finals week.  Our management team would be fucked if I left, but I want to quit. \n\nSo WIABTA\n",

      "description": "For starters I've been with my SO for 3 years, and we are very much in love. Despite the 3 years we have never spent Christmas together, as we usually spend it with our respective families, and even though it's a bit sad to not spend the holiday together we are both happy enough about the arrangement.  \n\n\nThis year, due to a hospital, scheduling and flights, my family has decided to 'delay' Christmas and celebrate it after the date to ensure we can all be together.  \nThis means I am free to spend Christmas with SO's family.  \nAnd I have chosen not to, despite being invited.   \nMy first reason is that I have a lot of allergens. This basically means that a Christmas dinner for me is not traditionally. It would mean I would need an entirely separate dinner that wasn't contaminated by the rest of the food. (I wouldnt die, I'd just be sick)   \nI asked could I prepare my own dinner but was told guests cant be in the kitchen. Personally I would feel awful asking someone to prepare an entirely separate  dish (when they are already stressed trying to make the first one perfect)  \nSecondly, I have misophonia ( I know people feel like this is made up-but the sound of people eating really gets to me: think of it like, being afraid of spiders, but having to eat a dinner in a room crawling with them, or being afraid of heights and eating dinner suspended from a cliff) I mean totally could do it, but it's upsetting and you may end up having a panic attack.  \n\n\nNow my SO is cool with my decision, and has been very understanding about it, but the question is:  \n\n\n is this rational or am I being a total selfish  asshole (and therefore need to apologize with a kick ass Christmas present)",

      "description": "tl;dr at the bottom\n\nContext: A little over a year and a half ago my ex and I broke up after roughly 2 and a half years of dating. It was a pretty messy situation and I ended up moving back in with my mom. Since this time, she has repeatedly caused me significant problems one way or another, such as extorting me for $500 or so dollars and filing false sexual abuse allegations against me with our university (which ended up getting totally thrown out because it was utter bullshit filled with white lies and misrepresentation) leading to me having to take nearly a year in time off school. In hindsight, she was a very good manipulator and was nearly 3 years older than me, leading to me to make many dubious decisions for my own well being in order to further her own agenda and financial security. Last contact I had with her was shortly after the case resolution, when I informed her I had taken out a restraining order against her since I couldn't afford any more serious legal action against her.\n\nThe Story: Flash forward to roughly a month ago when I found out I had overpaid for something a fair while back (what it was doesn't really matter) and asked to receive a refund for that amount. They obliged, saying they can only send out a check and it might take a bit for it to process. So, I wait and wait, figuring Christmas season may result in slowed mail service, but nothing ever shows up. Finally, I call them to ask where the check is, and they said it had been received and deposited. WTF? I was absolutely clueless how that could have been the case, so I actually go in to review information with them and find my shipping address had never been updated from my old apartment I shared with my ex. Huh, that raised red flags. I did a little more digging and discovered she had taken the check, forged my signature, and deposited it to her account. \n\nIt wasn't a lot of money per say, but seeing as I had never really been given the chance to seek legal recourse against her, I naturally reported the check fraud to the FTC (and the local police) who said they'd get back to me about the status of it. Shortly after that initial conversation, the police reached out to me and informed me they (them and the FTC, I'm guessing) are indeed investigating the case and she could face serious criminal charges/fines. Frankly, I was happy with the result, even if it meant I'm not going to see the money for a little bit. When I told this story to some colleagues, they told me I'm a dick/shitty person for reporting her rather than just asking for the money back, even knowing the bad blood between us. She has had me blocked on all social media and forms of communication for awhile and it would have been virtually impossible for me to reach her and ask for the money back other than by letter, let alone get a response at all.\n\nSo, AITA for reporting her crime, albeit partially motivated by revenge? I'm not usually a vengeful person and anyone else I probably would have given a chance to return the money but with no way to reach her and a history of her trying to wring money out of me, I didn't feel very inclined to any mercy. \n\ntl;dr: crazy ex who has really messed with my life in the past accidentally receives a check that was for me and forges my signature to cash the check. I report her to the FTC in a final act of revenge but people are saying I'm an asshole for going straight to that instead of seeking out informal means.   \n",

      "description": "  At new years, my great aunt was being extremely rude to two of my cousins. She insulted their mother, saying she was too self centered to care about her family and show up (she was working.) They told her to lay off and that talking about someone behind their back is rude as fuck. She went of on them for being disrespectful to an adult (they are 23 and 26 so?). She got worse as she got more tipsy, calling them lazy (they aren't) implying their mother was unfaithful and that they may not be their dads biological sons (no reason to think this). She was so nasty both cousins left.  \n\n  \n   My sister and I were planning hosting a bbq at our house, and the two cousins will be invited. Last time we had seen rude aunt prior to planning had been a few days before when we were at our grandparents house and she came over for dinner. She started trying to talk shit about the cousins until my grandpa told her he didn't want gossip at his dinner table. So we knew she hadn't let this thing with the cousins go. My sister and I invited most (but not all) of our relatives in to town to this bbq we are hosting weekend after next. We did not invite rude aunt, but invited a few other aunts an uncles, including some of her siblings. She found out about the party, and called me to ask details. I calmly told her she was not invited because at New Years and at dinner she demonstrated she could not be civil towards other relatives and my sister and I did not want that in our home. She got angry and once she started to raise her voice I said sorry goodbye and hung up on her. Later another aunt called my sister to tell her we were being rude and unforgiving and that \"Christ wants us to forgive\". She told her sorry but it was never about forgiveness for past actions to begin with, it was about aunt's current attitude. She got angry and got hung up on as well. Later the two cousins called and asked if rude aunt really wasn't coming. I guess she had been being a bitch to them and their mom ever since new years, like insulting them on facebook and to other relatives and to their faces, and they had already skipped another event just to avoid her.  \n\n  \n   We thought all this was sorted and we would just have a bbq minus 2 aunts, but we went to grandmas today to find out that this has caused some sort of civil war in the family. Half the fam think my sister and I are assholes, either because we should be forgiving or we should mind our own business. Now I guess people are uninviting people from events based in their \"side\" of this.  \n\n  \n   I feel like we were justified in not inviting her but now I'm wondering if we made this bigger a deal than it needed to be. In trying to avoid a fight, we created an even bigger one. Are we the assholes for causing this family schism? Did we make a mountain out of a molehill?  \n\n  \n   TL;DR We didn't invite an Aunt to a barbecue because she was rude to some cousins and caused a split in the whole damn family. ",

      "description": "So, I'm from a SE Asia country where getting married is an extremely big deal. Like, from the moment a child is born the parents start saving for its wedding because it's really important in our culture.\n\nRecently, my best friend got engaged. And she's really excited about her big day. Theres a hundred different functions with rituals and designer outfits and food and what not. She confided in me that her wedding budget is somewhere near $300,000. And their family can easily afford it. It's not like she's forcing someone to.lay for her wedding \n\nBut the thing is, I come from a poor country. I see so much poverty around me. Homelessness. Kids on the street who are suffering from malnutrition. And I just can't help thinking how much help this money could have done to them but now it's been spent on a two day event. I don't want to feel like this because my friend is a sweetheart with nothing but joy and positivity to give to everyone but I have started resenting all this spending when there's so many money related problems in the world. \n\nAITA for feeling this way?",

      "description": "My girlfriend has just gotten a 5 month old puppy, who is usually mild mannered, however is not yet properly trained to relieve itself outside, somewhat frequently resorting to using her apartment floor as a substitute for mother nature. Before adopting this animal, I told her that most, if not all, of the caretaking would be up to her, and she fully agreed to it, as she is in the process of registering it as an emotional support animal, and her general outlook on life has, admittedly, increased since it got brought back to her place. I have provided transportation (3 total, there and back), money to adopt the dog in the first place (which will be paid back, eventually), as well as more of my own money, which I have said does not need returned, for a cage and bed. Originally, my girlfriend had wanted to take this dog into work with her, a nursing home type facility in which others are allowed to bring their dogs, but she has been told that a 5 month old, 25 pound border collie mix is \"too large,\" and is not entirely welcome, even though the place that assigned her to this nursing home said that it would be fine. For clarification, she was hired by a third party, and this nursing home works in conjunction with the business that she works for. I told her that, if she was to move in with me in several months at the end of her lease, that I did not want a small dog, such as a terrier. That simply comes down to my own preference, and since we will be living together, her dog will become *our* dog at that point, even though the main responsibilities will lie on her. Just today, she has asked me if I would be willing to stay overnight at her apartment while one of her roommates and her friend are there as well, in a separate room, while she undertakes a 24 hour shift at the nursing home. After quite a bit of deliberation, I said that I was largely uncomfortable with it, that I didn't want to sacrifice my own comfort for the convenience of several others. To make up for my lack of willingness, she will currently need to either take her dog with her to work, and potentially get in some(?) amount of trouble, or leave it at her apartment with others around, and financially compensate her roommate to tolerate the noise that it creates, feed, and potentially pick up after it. There have been many situations throughout the time that the two of us have been together that she has felt very poorly about telling me no about something, and while I do not say no very often, I have decided to tonight, for now, and feel like absolute shit about it. She said that it was my decision to make, and while it is not the one that she would have preferred, there's not much that she can do to influence me, and simply remarked the situation by saying \"oh well\" similar to how I do with her saying no, and left it at that. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for not wanting to watch her dog?",

      "description": "For some background info, I live in EU,  I'm 18-year-old athletic guy, I like planing my life financially and in many other ways. I'm saving for university and general costs of living.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story wraps around one particular military program, that I have applied for, a training program that helps me to become a peacekeeper. All the training and a deployment takes around 2 years. It normally takes half a year if your going to be a normal infantry. The thought of me becoming a peacekeeper startled my father, he doesn't like that, he wants me to go straight to college or university and finish my army stuff as fast as possible. But my plan has been to serve a little longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad is the problem, he has said time to time that you aren't cut for the job, this pisses me off, I shrug it off. I don't want to argue with him. As i usually say: \"I have already made my choice\", but I still listen to him. I should've listened to my closest friends advice, not tell parents, like his brother. I thought this would be more harmful to family relations, but after seeing the results of telling my parents about this, I can tell that I should've done the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalf a year ago I had final exams to study and forgot about the army thing. The problem started yesterday when I mailed an application where I accepted to partake in the trials, me and my parents were going to a shopping mall, trying to find a mailbox and get some shopping done. As I was stepping out of the car, father said to me to think this through again, hinting that this was a stupid idea. I froze for a second to process what he said, I quickly gathered my inner self and stepped out of the car. After dropping the letter in the mailbox, it ruined my fathers day, he got sad and ruined the day for everyone else, but I didn't let the feelings get to me even though it was hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater in the evening when I was going for my regular 3 kilometer run. He gave me a note, I read it. It was demands that I start buying and cooking my own food now on, wash all the dished and so on. I could still live in the house and he would still pay the gas for the car because we shared his work car. I just want to add that my father has always done this, a punishment for doing something wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Applied for peacekeeper duties to get money for university, lost some family respect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hi people of the sub, I had to cut the story dramatically to fit the 3000 word limit, I have the original one which is near 5000 characters long. I can post it, if asked, it goes in to detail about everything. But I hope that this would be enough to make a judgement.** ",

      "description": "So we broke up almost a year ago, in March, due to things not working out the way we wanted, not from anything dire or situational.

We used to talk but weren't very close. However, with some damn mighty fine timing, she came back a few months after me and my ex broke up.\n\nWith a mix of post breakup loneliness, and the resparking of an old friendship, I developed feelings for her best friend.\n\nWith that being said, I'll describe it very broadly to  get the gist: last November, while I was alone one day just talking with my ex about random things, it came up, and she eventually got it out of me that I had feelings for her best friend.\n\nShe seemed fine at first, then after a few minutes I saw the anger and hurt set in, and she left me there.\n\nA few days later she told me how selfish of a person I was not only because of that, but also during our relationship. She handed my ass to me with all the baggage she still carried from our relationship and let me know how hurt she was not only after but during it. \n\nIt just confuses me now that this is 8 months after our initial breakup, so it's hard to think about it objectively.\n\nMe telling her my feelings for her best friend causes her to lash out on me about that and about our previous relationship, so am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "My now ex girlfriend lives with her sister, and I would often spend time with both of them and sometimes just her sister. For the first two years, I was madly in love with my ex and the sister was always supportive. We all got along besides small fights between my ex and I or my ex and her sister. \n\nHowever, after year two of dating, I started to notice some problems that my girlfriend and I had. Things like her not being as kind to me as I would have liked or her being very extroverted and me being very introverted. We would frequently have fights revolving around these issues.  Despite these issues, we were still working hard to rise above them and live happily (nothing worth breaking up over).\n\nNow brings me to the meat of the problem. My ex girlfriend's sister was introverted like me and was much kinder to me and all people in general. Granted she had her own problems, but they were issues that never really bothered me. Because of this I saw myself falling for her sister. I still loved my ex at the time, but I couldn't stop my feelings over her sister. I also think it's important to note that I never acted on these feelings besides maybe some mild flirting that I quickly ended when I realized what I was doing.\n\nI tried for multiple months to suppress these feelings and find ways to make me not be in love with her sister. I tried everything I could, but I finally decided I had to end things with my long term girlfriend. She was shocked and angry to say the least. I explained that it was because of the other problems mentioned before (partially true), but I never mentioned her sister. She was very angry with me saying it was abrupt and things were improving. I said how sorry it was, but it just couldn't do it anymore.\n\nI have since cut off all contact with both her and her sister, and I have no plans to try to make a relationship with her sister.

      "description": "So I had 7 bridesmaids. One of them was my cousin. \n\nMy cousin just had a baby this past December. My cousin has always been kind of lazy and a flake, but now with her new baby it’s even worse. She is saying that she feels depressed, sleep deprived, and fat. I’m thinking she could potentially have post partum depression, but this is just a hunch. No official diagnosis has been made. \n\nIn November, I start asking everyone’s schedules so that I can get appointments made for picking out bridesmaid dresses. I made two appointments in February because getting all 7 to come on one day was going to be too much. My cousin picked the appointment later in the month because she wanted the extra time to lose weight after having the baby. No problem. \n\nIn January I sent out reminders to everyone about their appointments. I got a response from everyone except my cousin. I sent 2 more reminders to my cousin with no response. But the messages I sent did show as read so I know that she saw them. \n\nA few days before her appointment she asks if she can reschedule, but doesn’t give any sort of reason why. I tell her no, because I made 2 appointment times for everyone to pick from and I had made them months in advance. She said ok and that she would make it to the appointment. My aunt (her mom) said that she was wanting to reschedule because she hadn’t lost enough baby weight and she wasn’t happy with how she looked. \n\nWell today was the appointment day and the other bridesmaids who were scheduled showed up, but my cousin did not. My cousin didn’t message me or call or anything. Then I get a call from her after the appointment is over saying that she’s so sorry that she just woke up and that she has been really sleep deprived because of the baby. The appointment was at 1:30 in the afternoon. She was asking me if she could reschedule. I told her she can, but I won’t be going with her to whatever new appointment she makes as I’ve already done my part by making the original appointments. \n\nI’m nosy and so I checked her Facebook to see if my cousin  had been posting anything prior to the appointment time. Yep. She posted a status a half hour before the appointment time. So she definitely did not “oversleep”.\n\nThen her mom (my aunt) calls me and says my cousin couldn’t come because she didn’t have the money to buy a dress and that she would be lending her the money to buy a dress and making sure that she showed up to her new appointment. Whatever. \n\nAt this point, I was so fed up that I told her not to worry about it. I don’t want someone to be in my wedding because their mom is forcing them. I feel like it’s like pulling teeth to get her to do anything she supposed to do. If being in my wedding was important to her, wouldn’t she have found a way to make it to the appointment? I really don’t understand why I am being ignored and lied to. Or am I not being understanding enough? I don’t have any kids and so I’ve never had post partum depression. \n\nAITA? \n",

      "description": "I've (25f) been debating giving my mom (50s,f) an ultimatum. Im tired of her chainsmoking when Im around and not having respect for my health. She also drinks 2-3 beers/alcoholic drinks on her normal days. This wouldnt be a problem if she didnt underestimate her limit (she weighs a lot less now but thinks she can handle it the same).   She becomes so overbearing when she drinks and I always just want to leave. I do not drink or smoke, so this is important to me.\nI was pushed over the edge because of a trip I took with them over the weekend to visit my brothers family. Its a 10ish hour drive to and from and the whole time her and her bf smoked 1-2 cigarettes each an hour. Its their car, they're driving, I toughed it out on the way there.\nNow on our way back, Im sick (Sore throat, runny nose, etc.) They lit up the entire time. I told them when there was about 4 hrs left, no more smoking. I was getting seriously nauseous at that point. \nIm just so tired of her addictions and how she acts when I confront her about it. I just dont to be around it anymore. Would I be an Asshole if I cut her off because of these things?",

      "description": " \n\n\\*\\*Repost of my other post but wanted to fix the title...To start, I don't ever like being the bad guy...i normally go out of my way to avoid being the bad guy, but in this situation I couldn't hold my tongue anymore...\n\n***For reference; K is my roommate, B is my roomate's son and J is my roommate's mother.***\n\nK (29F) and I (30F) are really good friends and she helped me out when i was in a really crappy situation last year... I moved into her huge 5 bedroom house in July 2018 with her BF (30M) and her 11 yr old son, B.\n\nThings have been going great so far, going on 6 months...we all cook, clean, laugh, enjoy each other's company and respect everyone...except one thing...K's mom J, is one of those mothers who thinks she needs to be involved in everything that's going on while she's staying at the house..even though she doesn't live here or pay any bills..Not only that, she brings her annoying 2 year old Husky with her every time and we always have to make sure he is not getting into it with the other animals as he is rowdy. She overstays her welcome every. single. time and makes all of us feel uncomfortable in our own homes.\n\n*Ok..so here is what happened...*\n\nK and BF were going out of town for a wedding over the weekend and K's son, B was going to his fathers house till Monday night due to the three day holiday weekend, so i will have the house to myself!! FYI..there are 4 people + 6 animals living in this house so when i get a chance to walk around with no pants on (*one of my favorite things to do*), i'm going to do it, Dang it!\n\nK and BF leave Friday morning and J had come over the night before to stay the night because she doesn't like driving in traffic (she lives 30-40 mins away from us) or driving at night so she could take B to her place and his dad could come pick him up...cool.\n\nFast forward to Monday.. I've had a great, quiet weekend to myself and J planned on bringing B back home later that day..I worked till 5 pm and was expecting it to just be B and i at the house that evening. **Nope**...\n\nK and BF were suppose to be back Monday night, but because of weather restrictions, they elected to stay another night...I mention this to J and let her know that I would be still be taking care of the household (getting B on the bus for school in the am and etc.) J gets extremely upset at me because she got her \"feelings hurt\" when i expressed my dissatisfaction of her wanting to stay not just one night at the house, but two nights. I tried to explain to her that she doesn't need to stay as she is just going to be in the way when K and BF get home from traveling for 6 straight days.\n\nI ask her to go home in the am as her help is no longer needed..She stays the night last night and this morning, J was so far lodged up my roommates butthole all morning long while she was getting ready for work that i got play by play of this via text message when i left for work...JUST GO HOME!! AHHHHHHHH\n\nTL;DR: AITA for wanting roommate's mother to go home with her annoying dog while roommate is out of town ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I had a free day yesterday so I decided I’m going to go to mow the grass at my aunt’s but when I arrive, her lawn mower was gone. Turns out it was at a repair shop 2 miles from the house. No one at her house (her, uncle, or their daughter) was willing to take me down there to go get it to drive it back to the house.\n\nI walked 2 miles to go get it. On my way to bring it back, I almost run out of gas. So I stopped at a gas station, used my own money to fill it all the way up, then kept driving it the rest of the 2 miles back to aunt’s house (going 6 MPH I might add). I got back to her house, mowed the 6 acre yard, and by this time, it was night time. So I went home for the night.\n\nSo I went back the next evening to make sure the yard was looking good. Before I got a chance to go fix the 3 little spots I discovered I missed, “Rando! WHAT THE HELL? YOU LEFT HERE WITHOUT FINISHING LAST NIGHT! AND ONE OF THE WHEELS FELL OFF! YOURE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT!” So I went outside to see the supposedly broken lawn mower.\n\n\n\nTurns out, the wheel that fell off was a tiny wheel for the blade cover. Completely inconsequential to the overall running of Mower. I found the wheel out in the yard. No big deal. My aunt demanded I mow the spots I missed right now. Afterwards, I am to drive the mower back to repair shop, pay for wheel to be bolted back, and bring it back to the house.\n\n\nSo I mowed the spots and she came outside to check on it. She said that wasn’t good enough because she is having friends over this weekend and it has to be absolutely perfect with absolutely perfect symmetrical lines even though the lines were visible and symmetrical already. So I went back over the ENTIRE 6 ACRES AGAIN! Now,  I’ve mowed the yard twice, gotten yelled at the whole time, and now it was time for ME to drive back over to the shop and pay for tiny wheel’s repair. Well the shop was now closed for the weekend because of my Aunt making me go over the yard again! \n\n\n“WELL RANDO, LOOKS LIKE YOU FUCKED AROUND AND MESSED UP THIS WHOLE WEEKEND FOR ME! MY FRIEND’S ARE GOING TO TALK SO MUCH SHIT ABOUT MY YARD!” \n\n\nShe storms off. So I left and I’m thinking about just not going back for a long time. I feel really insulted and disrespected.\n\nBest part about all of this is that....\n\nI DID IT FOR FREE AND WITHOUT HER EVEN ASKING ME TO DO IT! I DID IT ON MY OWN VOLITION TO BE NICE! \n\nAITA for not wanting to go back on Monday to take her mower back to the shop? Depending on the consensus here, I might change my mind. ",

She now wants to hang out, comes into my car when I arrive at school and tries to talk to me. I’m always nice to her but I don’t really feel attracted to her. She said to me tonight that she is really stressed out about all this and is worried about what she is gonna do to herself if I don’t date her. Am I the asshole if I say I don’t want to talk to her anymore?",

I just want it to be me and my friends (so 4 total) because we rarely get to hang out with us all working and school.

      "title": "AITA for breaking things off with a guy after finding out how old he is?",
      "description": "So right off the bat, the title alone makes me feel like an asshole. But here's the situation: \n\nA short time ago I was out with some friends and was approached by a guy who asked for my number. We chatted for a bit and I found him charming and attractive; we agreed to meet up at a later date. We ended up going on a few dates and hitting it off generally; he seemed older than the men I'm interested in (appeared to be mid to late twenties), but he's a graduate student at the university I attend, so I wasn't too put off by that.\n\nWell... last week he left his wallet at my place, and I took a peek at his driver's license. Turns out he is in fact 40 years old. So he's got great genes or wears his sunscreen, apparently, because I was pretty shocked, and not in a good way. When he next texted me to meet up I told him (in as polite a manner as I could think of ) that I'd had fun with him but wasn't interested in seeing him anymore. He pressed the issue, and I told him that it was an age thing. He seemed to find this *more* objectionable than if I'd just said he wasn't attractive or something, and essentially made the case that this was a shallow reason to write someone off. \n\nSo my question is - is he right? Was that an asshole move on my part? Because the truth is I can't really put into words *why* his age was such a disqualification for me - it's just that the differential made me feel strange. Also the fact that he'd be that old and interested in someone my age (18) is kind of weird to me. For the record, a couple of my friends have backed him up. Basically the argument is that I was clearly interested in him, and retroactively cancelled him out just because I saw the number on his ID. Which I do find compelling. \n\nAITA?\n\n",

He showed us a video and it was a really full glass and it obviously got all over the booth, the table and the floor.  \n\nWhile the rest of the family laughed, I couldn’t help but say “that’s a dick move.  Somebody else is gonna have to stay late to clean all that up.”  It was like a needle scratch moment.  Everybody stopped and stared at me like how could I possibly say that.  \n\nWe got home yesterday and my fiancé is still on me about it.  I was a server in high school and I would have been furious.

Well she got a cab and met us there. Well the next day she went off on my saying how hurt she was and she could have been jumped or raped. And how we shouldn't have left her stranded and so on. I feel bad because she is right, but at the same time she knew her phone was dead and the bus was coming any minute. So am I the asshole? Is she? Are we both?",

I figure out that the people in the church are really terrible. I also found it difficult to believe anything priest ever said. So I decided a long time ago that Christianity isn´t really my thing and I told this to my parents. They were very hostile towards me and basically forced me to finish sacrament of confirmation to what I said to them that I will do it but it is the last thing I will do as a Christian and then I´m done with this religion. It was two years ago. After confirmation, my father stopped forcing me into Christianity, but my mother is still angry. She said multiple times that I´m selfish because I don´t want to go to the Church and I should do at least that for her couple times a year. I don´t want to be mean to my mother, but I don´t want to go there. I hate that place. So please help me.

      "description": "So I'm a junior in JROTC and I went to a community service for setting up and helping a local 5k-10k run. After we had set up the over-all CO (Commanding Officer) who is the instructor in charge of the program at my school said that if we brought money we could go get breakfast at the nearby diner. I brought 2 cadets with me, we sat down, and ordered our food when the student NCO-IC (Basically the student 2nd in command of the event) told us to have intervals with one of us getting food, while the others did our jobs (which was passing out water to the finished runners, but the run hadn't even began. I said it was BS but I'd do it. I waited, our food arrived, and I went to go get the other 2. The NCO-IC and the O-IC (essentially student 1st in command of the event) told me to wait while the other 2 got food, I actually called that BS and went to go do my job, I passed the CO and asked him about it and he said it was illogical, I should go get food. I told the NCO-IC and the O-IC and they were pissed because I didn't inform them that I was going to the CO, violating the chain of command. I technically did do this by not informing them, but I went up it as I was supposed to. Anyways I got my food, which the 'ICs complained I didn't get to go and got back, and started my job with a few minutes to spare. \n\nIt's long and confusing if you were never in JROTC but comment if you have any questions.",

      "description": "I can't go into details on anything so i'm just not going to use names or what the study was about because reasons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent 6 years working on a study for a fairly large research institution. It was basically about human consciousness and the varying \"levels\" of cognitive abilities and how it relates to a person's success in life. The study was worked on by 80 or so scientists it was an 8 year long study with me being a part of it for 6 years. The budget was in the millions. It was a huge study. Anyway it gets peer reviewed and published and it is received fairly positively and a couple large media sites wrote about it = and it's the first thing i've worked on in my professional career so I was happy and proud of it . but anyway I gave the paper to my family to read just in case they were interested and I guess the findings were offensive to my sisters bf and he had a problem with it. He works in construction and there was a section about manual labour jobs and he found it particularly offensive. As if the whole study was my idea he gets mad at me. Basically his whole argument for why the study was bullshit is to repeat the popsci bullshit \"Correlation does not imply causation\" and I kept asking for more information and he just keeps repeating the same shit so I kind of snapped and said \"I don't expect someone who didn't graduate high school to understand the study so make an argument or shut up\" . That's it. I don't believe he understood the study since it wasn't negative towards manual labourers at all. ",

I’m talking topics where no one else could possibly know better than himself, and yet he never trusts his own instinct. \nI’ve tried helping him by simply giving someone to talk to, however this is mentally exhausting. He’ll essentially say something bad about himself(often true), and want the other person to give him reassurance that it is not true.\n I’ve tried giving him validation to ease his nerves, but I honestly now feel like I am feeding a bad cycle by doing this.\nAs of now I simply avoid talking to him in most cases, as I feel like he needs to learn how to trust his own instincts for himself, and to stop needing validation from others.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

      "description": "So I'm 17F, I work two jobs at a fast food restaurant and cafe. Basically between the two jobs I work maybe ten days and then have one day off? I work casual shifts for both which change weekly, but generally end up with a 10:1 ration of working:days off. Anyway, today I worked 7am until 3pm at my cafe job. At around 3:30ish, my other boss called me to ask if I could work that night at the fast food place. I was pretty tired but I lowkey need the cash so I asked what time the shift was (we close at 10pm, and the \"close\" worker generally has to work until 11ish, or however long it takes to get the tasks done). My boss told me the shift would end at 9, or 9:30 at the latest. I told him that was fine, but I really did not want to close because I was pretty worn out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the second I get to work, its a different manager on, and she immediately says \"I need you to stay till ten\". Kind of annoying, but because I wouldn't be the close worker I could leave dead on ten and go home, so no big deal. I'm like okay sure, but I'm not staying any later. Fast forward to 9:50ish, and we're completely swamped by customers. Close is really behind and is going to take longer than usual. There are two people on close, which is unusual but really good for them. Despite this, one of the closers and the managers are suddenly mad pressuring me to stay back and help them. I tell them I've worked all day and I was told my shift would end at 10, and they go off about me being selfish and unhelpful. As a casual shift worker, I'm under 0 obligation to stay, and they already have another person anyway, but they're being really forceful about it. Eventually I tell them I am absolutely not staying, and they start saying stuff like \"well I'm not doing x for you\", and \"I'll remember this next time we work together\" etc etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nits a couple hours later and while at the time I was really pissed off, I'm thinking now I was a bit of bitch for not just staying the extra hour or so. They were genuinely stressed out and had a lot of work to do, and maybe I was just being grumpy and unhelpful. pls help reddit x",

      "description": "Last night, my fiance and I got in a squabble. I was washing dishes (which is normally his chore, but he cut his thumb), and so he took out the garbage. By the time he came back inside 5ish minutes later, he was all pissy and started snapping at me about the things I choose to recycle. He thinks I recycle too much and claims I'm \\~wasting our tax money\\~ by forcing recycling people to throw out our things. This isn't the first time he's argued with me about what goes in the recycling bin, but the main things he complains about are Tim Hortons cups and I googled it and Google said those were recyclable. If I'm wrong about other things I put in the bin, I can start throwing them out, but I'm not just going to take his word about it when he didn't even own a recycling bin before I moved in.\n\nWhen I didn't back down, he got mad there was a tissue in the recycling bin. It was one he'd used to wipe up his mess after the last time we had sex--he'd left it on his nightstand with a bunch of other garbage, and we don't currently have a garbage can inside the house, so I put it on top of the recycling bin. He was mortally offended by the existence of this tissue, but seemed to drop it and came to come help me dry the dishes. I was quiet, because I was upset he had snapped at me instead of just calmly talking to me about it. He was being mean.\n\nSo I moved onto doing the laundry. He asked what was wrong, and I told him he was mean to me. He got silent and went into the living room to ignore me for the rest of the night. He texted me later to tell me that the tissue in the recycling was \"heinous\" and I called him a drama queen. Why is this a big deal? It feels like he's mad at me because I got mad at him first. He slept on the couch last night and avoided me this morning.",

He also had multiple affairs before this, that I dumbly forgave. We almost got divorced over a year ago as well, when the cops were called when he assaulted me at a party in front of multiple people. He manipulated me in going back to him, as at the time I was jobless and homeless, and constantly pressured me into coming back as I pretty much had nowhere else to go.\n\nNow, two months later, I live with my grandparents. We are seperated as in my state, you have to live seperately for a year to get divorced. In my state it is legal to see other people while seperated (I haven't)\n\nI started talking to someone who is very kind, but they live an hour and a half away. We want to meet up sometime soon, and have both expressed interests in eachother. However, based on my past traumas, I feel very nervous that if I begin seeing someone, he would get angry and find a way to mess with my life. He constantly posts my photos on social media expressing how much he misses me. Constantly messages me about how sorry he is and how sad he now has nothing to come home to after deployment.\n\nI am 100% over him, no chance of ever taking him back. EVER. However, because of his manipulation I feel very worried that somehow i AM the asshole. He knows i want to see other people and constantly calls me, messages me, and etc crying. Am I the asshole, wibta if I end up dating someone. even if it's not the gentleman who has been talking to me. For all I know, we just end up good friends. But a lot can happen in a year and I worry that somehow I would be the asshole moving on and finding someone new.\n",

      "description": "This is my first post ever and I'm not a native speaker, so I apologize already for all the mistakes I will make, but I am kind of stuck in a situation, where I am doing everything wrong.\n\nSo first a little backstory. My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for 4 years now. He was born in another country than I but his whole family moved here when he Was 2 years old. Despite of the ability to speak the same language as I do, they always speak in there own - I get that, their language is more natural to them and I am not a family member, I am just the companion. I am trying to learn this language, but right now it is impossible for me to even follow a conversation between them.\n\nSo fast forward to now. My boyfriend's father and his wife offered us to come with them visiting their homeland and go skiing. They've offered this for the last few years and so finally we said yes. They've really been very very generous, understanding and nice, but the problem is, they are very very spontanous too. So there was always a sudden change of plan and I always ended up with not knowing where I was, who this people are, we are spontaniously meeting and I always seem to do the wrong thing. Standing in the way, beeing to slow, packing the wrong stuff, because we extend our journey somewhere or we wouldn't meet as we planed... (Have you ever been on a vacation with your boyfriend's father and didn't have any underwear to wear? Great feeling!) I feel constantly overwhelmd with every thing and that I don't have a minute to just relax, because I have make a good impression. I constantly have to ask my boyfriend, what is said, but he says, it's to exhausting for him to translate everything, so I really feel left out and alone. This has been going in for 10 days now and I am really exhausted. So in the last days it seems that I sometimes snapped at my boyfriend, when I AGAIN did something wrong because of not understanding anything. I am really sorry for that but it is too much for me. Now He won't talk to me because I snapped at him, because He didn't told me in a discrete way that his father want's me to go to the toilet before we are leaving and it ended up with his father and the wife loudly reapiting the Word for \"go pee\" in their language. Maybe I am to sensitive but this really was embarassing for me!\n\nSo reddit please help me, am I the asshole here? Is my skin to thin and am I really ungrateful? ",

      "description": "Okay so I have two cats that were formerly fosters. Long and short of how they came to stay was: Boo (the older cat) came to live with me as a very very sick kitten so she would have a comfy place to pass on, instead she got better and has been with me for four years. Coco I found this summer on a bike ride, as tiny as kittens come, brought her home and took care of her. Was going to rehome her but my girlfriend grew attached and we kept her. Both are super cuddly and affectionate, and are adored by everyone who comes over. \n\nFast forward to a recently. My girlfriend of almost two years has had aggressive diabetes since she was born, and was recently told she has 10% kidney function and will have to go in dialysis, and she's only 25. Her failing kidneys meant aaaallooottttt of dietary restrictions, including Claritin. She's allergic to cats and has had to take a pill or two just to come hang out when we started dating, otherwise she looks like a bee stung her and she's barely comfortable in her own skin. So with the news, I decided I'd rehome my cats, letting them go live with my recently widowed step mom and my two little sisters (this way they'll be loved, my family will have a li'l happiness in a shitty time, and I can see them whenever I want). The girlfriend was racked with guilt and has been depressed already with all the changes we're making over her health.\nI told my friends over group chat about the cats leaving and why and they were more upset over me giving away the cats than over my girlfriends predicament, especially one girl in particular who kept making it sound as though I was personally killing the cats \"for some chick\" . Two days ago was our roommates birthday and that same girl got a card that said \"happy birthday teddy bear, sorry straightupforrealtho is killing your favourite cat (boo) just for his girlfriend\". My girlfriend was heart broken and embarrassed , especially since she spent the day cleaning the house and baking a cake and decorating just for everyone to have fun.\n\n I'm really trying to do the best I can for both my cats and my girlfriend, but am I the asshole here? Cause my friends are making it seem that way. ",

      "description": "Throwaway.\n\nI was originally kind of dating this boy (Lucas). We weren’t official, but we agreed to be exclusive. Found out he was seeing another girl behind my back and having sex with her. I was really hurt as I didn’t think he was like that. Ended stuff with him and cut all contact.\n\nI met Harry a few months later. Harry knew Lucas as they both went clubbing the same places. The first time I met Harry in person was at a club and Lucas was there. He was drunk and he couldn’t even walk straight so I just took him back to mine. I noticed Lucas immediately leaned in and tried to kiss me while I was with Harry (he knew we were a thing) but I put it down to being drunk. When we got to mine, he tried to have sex with me, I said no (we never slept together) and he became quite forceful so I rang him a taxi and sent him home.\n\nI decided to give Lucas a chance at being friends as we really got along well and he’d had a really nasty past, he clearly had a lot of issues and I wanted to be there for him. Me and Harry’s relationship blossomed, and Lucas eventually told me he couldn’t be friends with me anymore as he loved me so then cut contact for a while. All was well and good until he approached Harry’s friend out of the blue and told him I’d cheated on Harry, who then subsequently told Harry. Lucas then continued to approach Harry several times on nights out and informed him I had been unfaithful and other bullshit lies. Harry believed me 100% but wasn’t the confrontational type so never called Lucas out. Our relationship suffered as Harry hated hearing these things. Whenever I’d go out in town, i’d have random girls approaching me and threatening me because Lucas has told them I’d badmouthed them etc. He would follow me in his car when he was with friends and really did everything to make my life hell. Lucas apologised on a night out and I forgave him but didn’t involve myself with him.\n\nSo me and Harry have been on and off for a while and eventually we broke up. Harry’s friend must’ve told Lucas as he messaged me and asked if I wanted to meet up. I didn’t really but felt shitty so decided to. I don’t know why but I went to his and slept with him. I then slept with Harry again the next day, and have not told him about me and Lucas. I feel like a shitty person because Harry was insecure about me and him throughout our whole relationship as he was really obsessed. Sorry for rambling, and sorry if this is a weird post. AITA?",

      "description": "Upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. Its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). In the privacy our relationship, I playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. However, he has complained in the past about how much he hates \"locker room moments\" when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not. \n\nSo the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. One of the cues was something like, \"things that are short\" and I write down, \"my boyfriend's penis\". They were all read aloud and when its revealed that I wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. My boyfriend tries to brush it off \"oh you got me! Ha ha\" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him \"oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!\" more laughter.\n\nAfter we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. He said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. He said that by making that joke, all I have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. He wasn't mad, just disappointed. He said that he would never make fun of me if I had something unappealing about my body because he would never want to give me a negative impression about myself, that he would tell me I was beautiful no matter what. \n\nI felt really, really bad when he said that. I have apologized and things are fine now but I think that maybe he is blowing this out of proportion? Am I the asshole or should he maybe not take this so seriously? ",

Before I started my job, I told my current boss in my working interview that I was 2 months pregnant, but wanted to continue working after having the baby. I also said that I was looking into daycares. \n\nNow, (1) after looking into daycares and (2) being 7 months pregnant, my perspective has changed. I have found that daycares are very expensive. I don't make a lot of money with my job. If I were to continue working after the baby was born and placed my baby in daycare, my wages would not cover daycare expenses plus the cost of gas driving to work and back. Also, I have never felt so tired in my life and people are telling me after the baby is born I will be even more tired.\n\nI feel guilty for changing my mind. My boss is a lovely person. She has kids of her own and started her own business to be able to spend more time with them. She has been very encouraging about my pregnancy and has even given my baby items that she no longer uses. But when I mentioned starting maternity leave, she appeared stressed/uncomfortable talking about it and mentioned how she worked up until her due date. \n\nMy husband works at a job that covers all of our expenses, so I don't really need to work. We (my husband and I) don't live around family/friends that would be able to watch the baby after it's born.

      "description": "First off, my boyfriend and I are heavy gamers. We each have our own Xbox. He works a supervisor position and long hours so when he gets off he wants to relax and get on the game which I have absolutely no issue with. He works hard and deserves to do what he wants to relax when he gets home. \n\n\nFact of the matter is we started all these shows on Netflix and Hulu that have now been sitting in our cue for months or even over a year unfinished. We game together and still watch movies together but these shows have been put on hold for a while now. I've asked to continue watching them but we usually buy a new game whenever it comes out so most of our free at home tome is spent on gaming, and he always says we'll watch them later.\n\n\nI'm still invested in them so I started watching them when he leaves for work, he leaves a couple hours before I do. We promised each other that we would watch them together, and promises mean something in our relationship on both sides, but anytime I ask to watch one he puts it off. Point is I broke a promise and it's eating me alive, even if it's for something so menial. I thoroughly enjoy watching him game so it's not like I'm bored because we still spend a lot of time together, but I'm so damn invested in these shows, like a good book you can't put down, that my curiosity got the better of me and now I'm sneaking to finish them. \n\n\nI actually got caught with Vikings because you can see the episodes you've watched and which you haven't. He asked about it and I couldn't lie so I told him I've been watching it, (he doesn't know about the other shows) but now he doesn't want to finish Vikings because I am several seasons ahead of him. I feel like the asshole because I made a promise but at the same time any time I ask to watch a show he puts it off, but after over a year of putting them off I'm at the point where I feel like he isn't really _that_ interested in them like I am. The only show we %100 watch together now is Game of Thrones which is awesome.\n\n\nI've talked to him about how much I want to finish these shows and he is pretty understanding, but when he gets off work he wants to game with his boys and I can't blame him for that. He was a little butt hurt over the Vikings but he doesn't know that I've been watching the other shows either that we haven't watched in months. I plan on telling him either today or tomorrow but then he's NEVER gonna wanna finish those shows and on top of that I made a promise, even if it takes a long time it's still a promise and I feel like I'm in the wrong.",

      "description": "So I am the oldest child in my family and have been working in the creative industry for a few years since I graduated. My brother, who I get on with very well, is also working, but in a professional and what I think most people would describe as a 'grown-up' job.\n\nWe live in the suburbs of the capital city. A few years ago I decided to move out of the family home to live in the city with friends. This was a very big deal at the time as in our culture children usually stay in the family home till they are married (and sometimes even after marriage). My relationship with my parents was extremely fraught at the time, but it has now recovered and gone back to mostly the way it was. I come home pretty much every weekend and see them all the time, I just like the independence of living on my own. My parents still hate that I don't live with them and implore me to move back all the time, which I feel some guilt about. I was planning on moving back home later this year to save up some money for a down-payment and mortgage for a house.\n\nMy brother on the other hand, after graduation, got a job in another city where the rent is about half of what I pay on average. Obviously, he has managed to save much more money than me, even though he hasn't been working as long as me. I make a decent amount of money for what I do but I have much higher outgoings, and I also am much more spendthrift than my brother - I like to spend money on holidays, clothes, going out etc.\n\nThis all came to a head a few days ago when I overheard my parents talking to my brother about helping him with a down-payment on a house in the capital as an investment. They went quiet when I walked into the room and when I questioned them about it, they very pointedly asked me how much I had in savings, how much I earned and how much I paid in rent every month. They then asked my brother how much he had in savings. The subtext was that I had been extremely foolish with money and that I should be embarrassed that my younger brother had more in savings than his older sister. I found it really humiliating to be put on the spot and tell them exactly how much money I had.\n\nI don't really have an issue with parents lecturing their children about their finances, that is a normal thing for parents to do. What I did find hurtful was that my parents had obviously decided to reward my brother with a house because he had more money than I did. Now, I don't expect anything from my parents - I've never ever expected them to help me with a down-payment on anything. I just found it really hostile that they were basically punishing me for moving out - my dad made me calculate how much money I've 'wasted' on rent in the city out loud. That's fine, but it was my choice to spend that money. They laughed out loud when I told them how much I had in savings.\n\nA few months ago I had a vague conversation with my dad about how it might be a good idea to buy a house with my brother, possibly with some help from my dad. Their thinking has obviously now changed and they would rather come to an arrangement with my brother.\n\nFor context - my brother moved to another city because that's where he got a job, so he didn't have much 'choice' about moving out. This is opposed to me, who 'chose' to leave the house when I didn't really need to. I also want to say that my brother found the whole thing uncomfortable and felt a bit sorry for me.\n\nAITA/oversenstive brat for being hurt about this? Am I not seeing things from their point of view? I now feel quite distant from my parents and don't want to share anything with them about my life.",

I skipped going to Florida for Christmas this past year because I didn’t feel like driving back and forth and I wanted to relax for Christmas (I still hear about this), my family doesn’t like how I parent and try to undermine me when I get onto my kids or tell them no about something (my kids need a routine or it throws their week off). I could say more but I’m going to leave it at that. \n\nI recently started working a job where I work 40 hours a week, take care of two kids by myself and take care of a house as well. My spouse works over the road as a truck driver so I rarely see him as well (one week every 2-3 months). It’s tough on everyone and I still hear my family trying to get me to move back home on top of everything else. \n\nOn April 12th I’m taking a week and a half off of work to spend time with my husband as we’ve both have been working really hard. We never get alone time like quality alone time together. My mom and grandmother are coming up to take care of my kids. They’ve complained about coming up and how I should just pull them out of school, how it’d be much easier if they were in Florida around everyone else. I said absolutely not. Then she complained about wanting to pull them out 1-2 days early so they could beat the holiday rush. I still said no and I’m still the asshole. My mom has tried getting us to cancel this trip since we booked it in October. Am I the asshole for taking a vacation away from my family and spending quality time with my spouse? Also, the last two days I’m off I’ll be dealing with doctors for health issues. ",

      "description": "I am conflicted on whether or not I'm an asshole for this. So my girlfriend and I are both STEM people in our second year of college.  That being said, we are both pretty progressive and open-minded people. She recently just took a course in feminist psychology and it really opened her eyes to sexism and objectification, and she told me it gave her a completely new way of thinking. I have been trying to learn those topics from her second-hand by reading some articles from her class and having her try and explain the concepts, but she tells me that I'm not going to get the true experience unless I take the class myself. \n\nThe problem is, I only have a certain number of general education electives, and I would not want to use one on a class on feminism for a couple reasons. \n\n1) I would feel incredibly out of place in a women's studies class. I am kind of an awkward guy and I think the classmates (most likely majority female) will find me creepy and only in the class to virtue signal and pick up women. I would also feel so weird when they talk about patriarchy and like all eyes would be on me to denounce it or something. \n\n2) I could still get the experience by reading feminist literature on my own \n\n3) I'm just not as interested in it because it does not pertain to my own life experiences.\n\nI feel like 3) will qualify me as the asshole, but I feel like that is the reason why most men do not take women's studies courses. It isn't that I don't care about women's issues, or I don't try to combat my own biases. It is just that talking about menstruation and female oppression is just not as interesting to me as other topics. I am open to learning about it, but just not in a classroom setting, where I would have to write formal papers and get graded on how I talk about feminism. \n\nAm I an asshole for even having the luxury to not put women's issues at the top of my course priorities? Needless to say, my SO is pretty upset that I won't take the class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I didn't know whether to post this on friendship subreddit cos we're not friends anymore. I just want to know AITA or am confused or what?\n\nIt's pretty long (that's what she said) (I use humour as a coping mechanism, I apologise), but i really need unbiased opinions.\n\nIt started in 10th grade, we were best friends since we were 10, but something felt off. I'd be there for her, whenever she had drama with some girls, or when her mum was giving her a hard time. But in the starting of the year, when I lost a really important student body election, she was with the people who won, and I was there for them too, but they knew how  heartbroken I was, but she couldn't see it, and dismissed it as irrelevant. That year she was never with me, but proclaimed she was best friend while never actually being one. Paraded me around, vented about how the teachers were giving her a hard time, but when I tried to tell her that if she just did what they wanted, she'd talk over me and never gave me a chance to actually tell her what's going on. I know that she was going through a lot of shit, and I really tried to be there for her, but it felt like I had no one to talk to, and that made my social anxiety so bad that even today I can't make friends without overthinking every part of them hurting me, or me never telling people how I feel because I'm used to it. \n\nWe lost touch, or rather I cut off all contact because I realised how alone I felt with her, never being able to ask for help. She reached out to me now that we're in different Universities, and told me that I never even tried to stay in contact, and that I ran away and that I was never there for her. I told her I pushed everyone away because of my mental health hitting rock bottom and I told her that all I thought about was dying and I couldn't even think straight, but she kept blaming me for not trying.\n\nBut this is where it gets conflicted- am I just covering up the fact that she had much bigger problems than I did? or am I justifying me not being myself and constantly having to guard my tongue and say each word carefully just because I'm overthinking about this being toxic? Or am I just being a selfish, whiny baby? or AITA?",

      "description": "So this whole spiel doesn't have any \"justice\" or any serious conflict, I just really need to vent. I live with my girlfriend, who is still in university. Her mom is a single mom who runs a series of businesses that keep her busy pretty much constantly. English also isn't her first language, although she speaks it near perfectly conversationally. My GF's mom calls her everyday, usually multiple times a day to have her do various things for her. Booking hotels, ordering things online, making her appointments, having her call places to find stuff out (find out how much it'd cost to rent a truck/buy this thing/etc). This pisses me off because my GF is very busy working, in school, and she volunteers. She claims she doesn't mind (or accepts she doesn't have a choice) because her mom is busy and has trouble looking stuff up due to the language barrier. But it's stuff like having her looks up a restaurant nearby for her mom and her friends to go to while her and I are in a different city doing our thing. \n\nIt also pisses me off because my parents are the complete opposite. My parents never ask me to do anything like that, and if they did they'd be super grateful which GF's mom doesn't seem to be, she just expects it. So cue today, she calls up GF and says \"you and samurai456 need to rent a uhaul tomorrow and help me move some stuff for one of my stores\". Well that sucks ass but the best part is the stuffbwe have to pick up is 4.5 hours away and then we have to drive back 5.5 hours to drop it off at her store. Tomorrow. If she'd asked even just a week in advance I'd be thrilled because I have friends in both cities I could've seen to at least make it a fun trip. But no, and no choice for me. I'm pretty much fuming while my GF seems pissy like I'm being unreasonable for not jumping up and down for the opportunity to help. Am I the (an) asshole?",

      "description": "We are on vacation in Edinburgh with a couple. Despite being very vocal about not liking to travel, it ends up being \"my present\" for every other occasion, and she never understands my under-enthusiastic reaction. It'd be like me giving her a videogame because I wanted to play it.\n\nYesterday when we finally got to the apartment, after a day walking around, we cuddled for a while, but it's a hot room and she was resting right on top of my stump. When it got uncomfortable I asked her to please move.\n\n15 minutes later she gets up upset. What is wrong?, but you know what's coming next. Nothing, she said. Eventually she says \"I'm going to eat\". Alone? I ask,wondering if she had set it up with one of them. Yeah alone. She didn't ask if I wanted to go, or if I wanted her to bring me something.\n\nI don't know why she is pissed but I persist \"wait, let me get my boots on, I'll go with you.\" She goes out, while saying she isn't her mother. I'm still getting ready, (it takes a bit longer, one armed) but that's when my patience reaches it's limit. Boots off, feet back up on the bed. She always gets pissed at a fly on the wall, and I end up being the punching bag.\n\nShe eventually gets back (like half an hour later despite going next door) and she grabbed me a sandwich. It could be a good faith gesture, but it's like going to McDonald's and bringing someone a burger without asking what that person wants. I was right here. Asking me what I wanted, would be the normal thing to do. \n\nI think she realized she was on the wrong, and decided to try and act like she wasn't pissed and what she did was normal instead of apologising, going back to the market to buy a sandwich, which would better account for the 30 minutes.\n\nWhen I didn't act like what she did was remotely normal, she tried to blame it on me.\n\nShe starts by saying \"she is not like her mom, and she is not here to take orders\". I haven't really asked for anything. Then she goes for another defense, that I don't talk to her, and we just lie on the bed or \"I can't even lay next to you without you asking me to get off\".\n\nThen it was \"People went to eat without us!\" which if it was true it's an understandable reason to be mad, but at them. Alas I heard them leaving after her. \n\nThey message us to go to the pub. She replies she doesn't want to leave me behind (after leaving me behind).\n\n\"Aren't you going to eat the sandwich?\" I did what any person with self-respect would do. Got my coat on, and said \"I'm going out to eat\". When I got back she was sleeping/locked in the living room. \n\nIt's the next day. I had agreed to go to Glasgow, not because I'm curious to see more men in kilts playing bagpipes, but because she wanted to. But I'm not going.\n\n---\n\nI know I hold a grudge and tend to overreact but I never start a fight, because I just want peace and quiet. But once it's on, it's on and I can't turn it off.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So there’s me (m19), my “friend” poe(m18), and my girlfriend, sarah(f18). \n\nMe and poe have been friends for 3 years, and I met Sarah though him last May. Sarah and poe have been good friends for a while.\n\nMe and Sarah have been dating for 3 months now long distance and we had been together for like 3 months before that. She and  I just got back from a week in California last Sunday. Tomorrow poe is taking the train from his school to visit her. I was alright with this happening when she was planning and when she asks me today if I’m comfortable with it I said yeah but I felt a little uneasy. We kept talking about it and she brought up something I’d never heard about. \n\nSo before they ever made the plan I had talked to her multiple times about how I don’t exactly trust poe with her. I didn’t really have any evidence to support my claims but I always felt uneasy about him. Since poe is also a really good friend of mine I kinda just tucked it away as jealousy. \n\nBut earlier this evening Sarah brought up how poe told her he had feelings for her. The night I told her I was in love with her. This was over the phone and she was with poe that night. She said she had to think about her feelings before she said it back. And she was with poe this night. \n\nNeither of them had ever brought this up before and I felt betrayed by the both of them. Although she turned him down I still feel very wronged by the fact that neither ever told me. Not when it happened and never when I we had similar conversations. \n\nWe were talking on the phone on and off for hours. She told me she didn’t think it was relevant and that I didn’t need to know. Although she didn’t do anything wrong I still felt like shit because she had been keeping it as a secret. A huge breach of trust the day before he goes to visit her. She talked it down saying it wasn’t a big deal and she didn’t seem to think it meant anything. \n\nI told her I felt uncomfortable with him visiting that weekend. I felt like a dick but it didn’t seem crazy given the situation. I told her specifically that I wouldn’t break up with her if she did but I made it clear how uncomfortable i felt about it. She denied it and we never came to a resolution and I’m still really upset. \n\nI wrote this last night and today he is still going to visit her. I talked to him and he called me crazy. \n\nTLDR: best friend tells my now girlfriend he loved her the same night i did. She’s just telling me this the night before he comes to visit her for the weekend. ",

      "description": "Yesterday, me, my SO (Julia), and our friends went to a bar for a nice evening out. We all got buzzed a bit, Julia downed 4-5 glasses of wine, while I had two bottles of beer. Around 2 AM we got back home and started to cuddle and chat in the bed before going to sleep. And by that I mean she was full-on cuddling me at the edge of the bed, and I had no room to move anywhere. So while she was talking passionately about something random (not that I don't care, but not related to this story), I noticed that her breath was smelling REALLY bad. Like, completely reeking of wine and alcohol. Which is fine, but since she was facing me and I had nowhere to move, I was taking the full blast of the smell. For a few minutes I tried to move my head to a comfortable, less smelly position, but no luck. After a while I started feeling nauseous. A few more minutes later I said \"Sorry if this comes off as rude, but your breath really smells like alcohol and it's making me nauseous.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that moment she completely flipped out and started to angrily tell me that I was being condescending and insulting her. I do admit after THAT I also got agitated and told her that I shouldn't need to tell her to brush her teeth. Eventually we cooled down and agreed that the whole thing was stupid, but I still think that it is not condescending to tell your SO that their breath smells when you are alone and intimate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I was in line at the supermarket earlier today. The lady in front of me, who was maybe in her 50s, had a baby in the front of her shopping cart. The lady had coupons for some of her groceries, but the items she actually had on the belt weren't the same ones listed on the coupons. (In other words, she had the right *brand* of dish soap and ice cream, but the specific *products* the coupons applied to were slightly different from the ones she was actually buying. Thus, she wasn't eligible for the discount. I hope that made sense.)\n\nNow, this lady didn't yell and scream at the cashier or anything, but she made the poor woman explain why she couldn't use the coupon over and over again. For several minutes. I cannot see any possible way this lady didn't understand the cashier's explanation, and I really think she was just trying to frustrate the cashier to the point where she would just give up and run the coupon anyway. (By the way, the store was crowded enough that I didn't think it practical to move to another line.) Finally, she asked the cashier to get a manager, and the cashier paged him. \n\nAround this time, the baby started making little babbling noises, and the lady turned to me and said, with all smiles, \"Isn't she cute?\". Pissed off, I just replied, \"No.\" The lady's face fell like a dead fly, and the cashier looked stunned. We all just stood there in tense silence for a few minutes until the manager showed up (and gave her the damn discount, SMH). The cashier was a little cold and just kind of gave me a *look* while ringing me up. She might have just been put out by the whole incident, but I kind of got the feeling she specifically disapproved of *me*.\n\nSo, AITA for telling cheap coupon lady that her baby wasn't cute?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "On mobile, worry for formatting issues\n\nSome backstory: So I (20F if it matters) am an athiest/agnostic. I was raised religious but not extremely. We went to church maybe twice or so a month and prayed in the evenings and all that. So I told my mom I didnt believe in God when I was in middle school and she... didnt take it well. Crying, saying she felt like a failure, all that. Luckily my dad was very supportive. Eventually she accepts it, though she doesnt like to talk about it still. \nNow to the meat of the issue, my grandma is pretty religious. She goes every Sunday, volunteers and is in church groups. She doesnt know I'm an athiest, I think she just thinks I'm still religious, I just dont like church. She hasn't ever confronted me about it, she made some comments about how we should go to church when I first stopped going but nothing else recently. I am pretty close to my grandma and I wish I could tell her my beliefs, and for a long time I was too scared. I recently asked my mom if I should tell my grandma and she said not to because my grandma would blame her and get upset. I also asked my brother and my best friend and they both said I shouldn't because it will just upset her and there's no point. My friend also mentioned that he has lost family for having similar beliefs, and he told me it's better to just stay quiet even though it sucks sometimes. I understand what they're saying, I just wanted to hear what you all think. I'm leaning to ward not telling her right now but I feel like at some point I will need to. \nTldr: my grandma is religious and im not, family and friends say not to tell her but I kind of want to ",

      "description": "Bit of background:\n\nMy SO (47m) has been separated from his wife for nearly three years, but are not officially divorced. They have a 5 year old.\n\nI (28f) have never been married and have no children. I don't want children either, which works well for us.\n\nWe have been together for just over a year and when we first started seeing each other we both agreed it should remain casual because of his priorities to his daughter. However, we ended up caring more than we intended and decided to make things an official relationship. \n\nDifficulty is, his wife doesn't know he's moved on. He is concerned that if she found out, she would prevent him from seeing his daughter. I agree, based on some of her behaviour, that this is a valid concern. As a result, we don't go out anywhere in case she or a mutual friend of theirs sees us.\n\n I can't contact him when he visits his daughter as he goes to the marital home every weekend to visit. Adding to the annoyance, she likes to spring things on him last minute as some form of power trip and force him to drop everything to go round there. As a result, I never know whether I'm seeing him or if he's going to have to bail. \n\nSome examples of this include, ficticious hospital trips, emergency household DIY, exaggerated family drama etc etc. She's a real piece of work who has punished him standing up for himself by refusing to let him see their child several times before.\n\nI've given him my key so he can come visit whenever, but during the week he works crazy long hours and is tired. He's often too tired to visit. When he does visit he spends his time worried that his wife is going to send someone to his new house (which she has done before) and demand to know where he is as he isn't home. \n\nI work a 50 hour week myself so I know how tired he is weekdays and his work ethic (and love for his daughter) are two of the many things that make him so admirable.\n\nHe's with his daughter every weekend. It used to just be Saturday mornings but recently it's been all day Saturday and all day Sunday. He's so happy to see her more often and I'm really happy for him but...I also feel like I'm not important at all. I tried to talk about it last week, but he said he doesn't need another bout of drama as he gets enough of that from 'her down there,' which hurt quite abit.\n\nI feel like an awful person for feeling sidelined.

      "description": "Background: I have been dating this woman for one and a half years as of now, let's call her \"Lucy\". We have a lot in common, care for one another, and helped each other get through a couple of rough patches in our lives. \n\nLast week, her dad died at the age of 74 of a heart attack. To be blunt, me and him have a shitty relationship. Since Lucy introduced me to her family, her dad has taken a lot of time to insult me personally and put me down. I tell him my profession, (factory worker) and he says \"Yeah, you don't look like the kind of person who uses his head much\", never mind that I casually mention that I had a 3.5 GPA and got a bachelor's degree in criminal justice earlier. He also likes to criticize my looks, saying that \"I look like shit\" and once when I went to his house to return some containers we used for a party he says \"I thought I smelled something fowl enter my home.\" He does this when Lucy is not around (bathroom, helping in kitchen, etc), but he'll be more subtle with his insults when she is around.\n\nLucy tells me the news and I put up a fake smile because I care for her and she lost her dad. I ask when is the funeral and she doesn't say. I asked her last Wednesday and no date has been confirmed. During such a time I agreed to dog-sit for a family friend who would be out of country the day after Valentine's Day. I tell Lucy this and she says \"oh that's when my dad's funeral is at x time, can you make it to the reception?\" I tell her I can't because I need to take care of the dogs and because I don't want to go. She asks if I don't like going to funerals, I tell her that I'm ok at funerals, I just don't want to go too her dad's funeral.\n\nAt this point, Lucy is getting upset and starts yelling at me that I never liked her dad and that I should go because she needs support. At first, I keep calm because she's getting emotional, but after a while I snap at her. I tell her what her dad says to me when she's not around, that I never liked him as a person, and that if it wasn't for me loving her, I would have nothing to do with him. I then tell her that I don't want to sit in a room feeling sorry for a man that I don't respect or have any sympathy for. Lucy snaps and calls me an \"asshole\" and that she'll have to rethink our relationship after the funeral is over.\n\nThis fight happened on Sunday and so far I've not received any text from Lucy since then. I'm afraid to text her because the only thing she would want to hear is an apology or an agreement to go too the funeral. I don't want our relationship to end because I do care for her. So am I the asshole for not going to the funeral of her dad?",

      "description": "So I'm an artist (who kinda falls under the starving artist stereotype) and any artist can tell you that family and friends will want free art. My mom will buy me materials for a painting and the rest is on me. I've done so many paintings for her as well as gifts that she insists that I make for two of cousins for their weddings. Frankly I'm tired of doing paintings for the bare minimum (i.e. the materials) and have recently started commissions (mostly cartoony/anime-esque, digital art since that's more my style). It's been slow going, but it's a start.\n\nSo when my grandmother was visiting she asked if I was doing paintings now. I asked what she would like and said that it would cost her AFTER she said she would pay. After she left mom told me to make it a present since my grandmother \"gets me stuff.\"\n\nAm I justified in wanting payment for something requested of me or am I just being a greedy asshole?",

      "description": "So, I’m not a particularly great story teller. But I’ll see what I can do. For the past few weeks I haven’t been going to church on Sunday. I looked into the history of the LDS church and decided I want out. That’s been going fine. Until today, when three of the neighbors (two 16 year olds and one adult) showed up and started *pounding* on the door. Now, I’ve been at a robotics competition for the last few days. The beds we slept on *sucked*. So the chance to finally get some rest was appealing to me. Nope. The neighbors show up and pound on the door for around ten minutes before I drag myself out of bed, put some clothes on, and go to meet them. First question is; was it rude for me to wait that long? I figured they would leave soon, but that didn’t turn out to be the case. Anyway. I open the door and get hit with the standard “hey, how are you?” I’m not particularly happy, so I let them know. “Well, I was a lot better before you guys showed up.” &lt;— that’s the part I’m mostly asking about. We talked for a little longer, I politely declined their invitation to go to church. And I mentioned to them that if it takes ten minutes of pounding then the person inside probably doesn’t want to come out. Anyway. AITA? Personally, I’m leaning towards yes right now. ",

      "description": "  \n\nAbout a year ago I met a girl in a Kpop Facebook group. We had been talking for quite a while but realized we lived about 30 minutes away from each other, so we decided to start hanging out in real life. At first, I was happy to have someone outside of the internet that had the same taste in music as myself but the more I got to know her, I started noticing things. \n\nTo start off about 98% of her friends were online friends. She literally had me and someone else who she actually hung out with in real life and I understood since I’m not exactly a pro at making friends but then it would get ridiculous. We would be having dinner together and these internet friends of hers would be blowing up her phone and she would stop talking to me to message them. In general, she never took her eyes off her screen and if she saw a notification from a group or person she liked she would drop everything and check her phone. To top it all off, because she was basically glued to her Facebook, she would post constantly about EVERYTHING. If her coffee was cold she’d post about it, if she had a headache she’d post, literally everything. One thing she would constantly do would be making these long posts about how much she loves her friends except I noticed she never mentioned me which normally wouldn’t bother me but since she claimed I was one of her closest friends and she was always posting about other friends I was a bit confused.\n\nAfter talking to her family and listening to things she’d share, I found out she had some mental difficulties, I’m talking ADHD, anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and many many phobias so I tried to give her a pass, but things just got worse. On top of basically feeling like a babysitter, I then began having to remind her to take her meds and to make sure she ate, showered and did other things. It got to the point where I even offered for her stay at my place for a week over Christmas because apparently, she had issues with the family that was going to be at her place. That was a week I would never get back. I ended sleeping on an air mattress with her in my basement (with a night light and a pile of stuffed animals) since my single bed was too small for her and she was too afraid of the dark to sleep alone in the basement. She barely wanted to do anything with me and spent the week on her phone with these online friends even though I had a million things planned for us to do together.\n\nWe went to a concert together and we spent two hours before the concert walking around the city looking for these people she had talked to in a group chat because “she wanted to talk to other fans of the group we were seeing” even though I was right there and loved that group and as much as I wanted to leave, I had no idea where I was in the city and was too terrified to get lost by myself. \n\nAfter the concert she told me she would pay me back for the ticket I had bought her since I wanted to make sure we were near each other and we agreed on a deadline for her to pay me back. Fast forward to now, I have received no money and she has been spending money on gifts (waaaaay above the amount she owes me) for these online friends of hers and on other concerts. Basically, I realized that even though I had been there for her in real life and had done so much for her, these online friends of hers would always come first and clearly there is no room in her heart for me.\n\nI told her I didn’t want to be her friend anymore and now I’m being bombarded with messages by all these people including her about how I’m being selfish and that she needs me and that I can’t just abandon someone in her situation.\n\nTL;DR -&gt; AITA for leaving someone who has been depending on me even though I clearly am not that important to them.",

      "description": "I'm using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nSo Christmas is coming, my family knows what they wish to have. We have always been quite wealthy. Money has never been a problem because my mom has a very well paid job. On the other hand, my father has been a self-employed person for the past 15 years or so. He says it's because he \"never wants to work for someone again\". I'm simply going to say that he earns almost no money. He doesn't pay the bills, he doesn't pay for food etc... He uses my mom's money to buy things (that are often useless: such as an electronic door lock for the house when a standard one does perfectly the job. Keep in mind that he paid $500 for it using my mom's credit card). If I had to make a rough estimation, he probably earns on average between $200 and $500 per month. His business has never worked but he doesn't stop it because he \"doesn't want to work for someone else ever again\". \n\nSo as I mentioned before, Christmas is coming. My family composed of my 2 sisters, my dad, my mom and I know what we wish to have. I wish for a new phone. My current one is a cheap one and since I want to have more storage and better camera, I asked for a new one (I'm not going to tell which one but it's quite expensive). I really like taking videos &amp; pictures of everything. I think it will come in handy in a few years. My sister wishes for some decoration for her student appartment. My other sister wishes for a tablet on which she can watch Movies, Series, YouTube etc... \n\nMy dad wishes to have an Apple Watch to go with his current iPhone. I told him he should get the 3rd gen one instead of the 4th because it wouldn't make any sense to have the iPhone 6 with the latest one. He agreed. \n\nMy mom said that she was going to tell Santa about that (so basically, she's going to pay for all of that but she says it in another way because of the Christmas mood). When I say that she earns a lot, she really does. I do not want to say how much but it's a 5 digits monthly earning. \n\nAnyway, after she said that, I asked her what she wished for and she replied to me that she wishes to have a fitness watch. I proceed to look for some on the internet and find one that costs about $150 and looks good. It has a lot of features and I'm sure she'd like it. I tell my dad about it and he replies \"Son, I don't have the money for such a thing\". I immediatly get angry and tell him \"Well then maybe you should get a real job instead of doing jack shit at your office and relying on mom's money all day!\" to which he replies \"Get the fuck out of here before I beat the shit out of you\" and I say \"You know, everybody here knows that you don't get a real job because you're afraid of getting fired. Yeah, we know that your former boss fired you because business was not good enough and he had to make a choice! Did you seriously think that he was going to keep you at the expense of his life? No, it's his fucking business so he did what was necessary to keep himself alive.\" I was about to start another sentence when I see his hand coming towards my face, I block it and kick him in the belly. Not too hard because he's almost 60 but barely enough to keep him away from me. I did Karate for 7 years so I know how to defend myself with my bare hands. I go back to my room and don't talk to him for the rest of the day. I do not regret exposing him like that and I hope he will get his shit together before Christmas. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? \n\nHow can I try to reconciliate with him? I don't want to be on bad terms with him but I felt like I needed to tell him this.\n\nDo you have any advice on how to do it? \n\n(please note that I'm only 15 years old so I'm not old enough to get a part time job to pay for my mom's present and she told us that we shall not pay for her present. Also, I'm not from a English speaking country, I'm still learning the language so sorry if I made some dumb mistakes. Thank you.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I tell my dad that she should stop relying on my mom's money and get a real job and we almost fought each other.",

I mean she wanted to do *everything* together.\n\nshe was also the type of person who would compare traumas, e.g. if I was having a bad day, she would basically say “well my parents abused me so I’m having a worse day” or “oh you feel sad? Imagine how I feel, my parents don’t love me!” which made me feel like my emotions were invalid..\n\nI was hospitalized for mental health reasons and she did a lot for me as a friend and roommate. I won’t deny that she was a good friend. and for all the times I sat and listened to her rambling about boys, drove her to class, cooked for her, etc. I thought I was a good friend to her too.\n\nI moved home for mental health reasons and we drift apart a bit. Then one day out of the blue she starts texting me again, and it was like 15-20 texts at a time talking about whatever was going on in her life. this is when I realized that being her friend was too emotionally draining for me.\n\nagain, I told her I needed some space. she said fine (by sending 10+ messages) and reminded me that she cares and other nice things.\n\nthen she texts me again, so I ask her for space, again.\n\nthe next day, same shit. I ask her for some space again.\n\nthis time, she says “you know what, whoshebe? I’m gonna tell you off now”. and she proceeds to send me 100+ messages telling me about how I’m a horrible person, my family doesn’t love me, I’m a mess and no one will ever love me, all of these hurtful remarks that, as intended, make me feel like shit.\n\nthere were a few times where I wasn’t the best friend to her, but she met me at the lowest point I’ve ever been in in life so I didn’t have much friendship to give.\n\nI feel like an asshole for hurting her, but she knows I’m suicidal and decided to go on a horrible rant insulting me anyway. so, AITA?\n\nTL;DR a fast friend of mine decided to randomly be extremely mean to me after I asked for some space",

As we were walking around and I'm helping her get ready, I give her a hug before she gets out the door, and I forget what I said, something along the lines of, \"what's wrong\" and after a little prying she says she doesnt think I care that I'm not gonna see her all day. \n\nI dont get that. Cause from the second I woke up to her leaving I was basically on her ass that whole time. Cause I knew I probably wasnt gonna get to see her. So I ask her why and it turns into the whole \"who do you feel like that\" \"I dont know\" game over and over. So then I ask her what do I need to do to make her feel like I'll miss her, and once again I get \"I dont know\" so we are arguing at her car and she slams her door and rolls down her window saying she doesnt know what to tell me and starts backing out. \n\nAt this point I dont know what to do so I just tell her I wont go and she says if I dont go she isint coming home tonight.

      "description": "I have a feeling people at work think I’m an asshole for calling an older guy (50s) a rat faced goblin.\n\nThe back story is I’ve been working on a weld line for lawnmowers since July. I’ve always worked around this person but not directly. He’s about 5’5” and has unflattering features with a giant beer guy and a speech impediment. For this reason I tend to be overly nice to him intially. \n\nEveryone at work messes with him but in a big brother way. Probably because they see him the same way as me but they still mess with him while I never do.\n\nHowever, I think the way people interact with him has caused him to feel like he can treat me with disdain and indifference. I assumed it was just that the fact I was new and young. The thing is though all the other workers help each other out and at the end of the day I usually sweep up the pile that everyone sweeps from their areas. Some guys will help out and do it if I’m busy. Basically it’s not beneath them. This person though will refuse, go out of his way to let me know the pile is ready even if I’m still cleaning up my area.\n\nThis has been going for quite some time but I ignore it because who cares. He gets to push around ONE person and maybe he needs it somehow.\n\nThe past week I’ve been going from a button pusher welder that runs a robot to welding. I ended up welding with this guy because it’s a two person job.\n\nImmediately I noticed him sandbagging and acting like a douche, making other people check my welds and basically having a hostile attitude. I didn’t get it but whatever.\n\nWell today I go back in and he’s even worse than ever. Refusing to weld his side unti i welder nine and had somebody check it. I wasn’t even making that many mistakes, I had improved. \n\nHe started acting pissy and at one point started slamming his shit around and I just looked at him and said, “what’s your fucking problem.” He mumbled something I couldn’t understand so I called him a, “fucking rat faced goblin.”\n\nThat’s basically it. I think he deserved it.",

      "description": "I live in an apartment building which is adjacent to a house. The people living over there have had two big shepherd dogs in the last 10+ years. First one they had for 8 years, then one day they literally got rid of it and got a shepherd pup.\n\n Now this shepherd pup grew out to be really huge and aggressive, and also loud. For the last year and a half I (and the other neighbors living nearby) had to deal with loud and aggressive barking sessions for 30 minutes at a time (it's closer to howling than barking), at any time of the day. I can't count how many times I've been woken up at 6am on a Saturday.\n\nWhen I'm walking in my building, I got to pass by the fence of the neighbors yard, and every third time I come/leave home I can hear the dog charging from a distance, ready to \"protect\" the home of its owners. Sometimes it recognizes me and looks disappointed, other times it continues to bark like I am a threat. \n\nI decided enough is enough and called the cops on them today. I don't understand how a family of 5 (mother in her 70s, son and his wife in their 50s, the grandson in his mid 20s) adults, were never annoyed by this nuisance. To mention, yes, the previous shepherd they owned was also behaving like this, but not as extreme. And also, I've rarely seen them walk the dog. I see the neighbor down the street walking his husky almost every time I leave the house, but I would assume this family only has a big dog for the purpose of protection (even though this is an upper middle class, safe neighborhood)\n\nEven one neighbor that moved in here, told us (the people living in the building) that he couldn't stand the dog, claiming his reason of moving out was the dog. \n\nTL DR : Neighbor family has an annoying shepherd dog that barks really loud, a lot of times during the day. It scares nearby passers and the fence that keeps it guard is too short, it can jump it any time. Neighbors don't seem to care so I called the cops. They showed up, had a word with them.\n\n(Maybe I should have talked with my neighbors about this, but I would doubt it would make a permanent change, so when time comes for me/someone else to call the cops, they would bother me)",

      "description": "My husband (M28) and I (F26) have been married for 5 years and have been together for about 10/11 years. We have a five year old daughter. He also has an 11 year old son with his ex gf from high school. \n\nWhile we were dating, It was always difficult for me to accept that he had a son with another woman because it made me feel really insecure. They were on bad terms for some time but I asked him to call her so he can see his son and try to connect with him. Even thou he and his ex are not together he has gone to her house to visit them every Sunday for a few hours. Although I felt very insecure about it, I was the one to encourage him to go see him. I grew up with out a dad so I didn’t think it would be fair that I let my jealousy get the best of me try to keep a child from having a dad.  \n\nOnce we got married, I made a promise to myself and decided to get over my irrational insecurities and try to become friends with his ex. It was a slow process on my part because I felt very uncomfortable going to visit them, I felt like a complete out cast and I felt very stupid. She was actually very friendly and we became somewhat friends. We don’t call each other every weekend or hang out often, but when I do I go over her house I feel very comfortable hanging out and drinking and dancing. We really do have a good time with her best friend and her siblings and I also truly enjoy hanging out with his son. \n\nHe took that comfort and friendship away from me, she is very close to her siblings and best friend so I know she discussed these texts with them. I no longer feel like I can look at any of them in the face. I’m just so hurt.\n\nHe made my biggest insecurities come true. This wasn’t a random girl from the internet. This is a woman that he has a child with and that I was very jealous about for years. We built a friendship but it took years of hard work to feel like I could let my guard down. She didn’t respond to his texts and did not lead him on, I really do appreciate her and respect her as a woman. But I just can’t look at her or go to her house. She isn’t the problem, it’s my husband I know but it’s still very hard. \n\nSince we got married and I became friends with his ex, I always felt very safe and secure with my relationship. We absolutely love our daughter and we get along so well. I have been faithful and so has he, so we have never had a reason to not trust each other so I’m completely shocked by this. I just don’t feel safe anymore, I feel alone. He was the one person I could call and count on. I feel like he robbed me of a friend, which is him. It probably sounds stupid but I feel like he isn’t my friend anymore. \n\nHis excuse is that he is an idiot, but that it wasn’t a big deal since nothing happened. When I confronted him he tried to say it wasn’t him and denied it. Nothing happened because his ex respected me enough as a friend and woman to not cross the line, or betray me behind my back. He didn’t even apologize until the third day and that’s only because I told him he hasn’t even sorry.   I just feel as if he is so selfish. \n\nI feel like he doesn’t understand what he he took from me, how much my relationship with her meant. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting him to leave our apartment? I have also been looking in to divorce but don’t know if I am overreacting. \n\nHe didn’t physically cheat on me, but I can’t help feeling emotionally disturbed. I have been crying since I found out. He doesn’t want me, he doesn’t respect me. He wants to have sex with other people. He is asking other people for nudes. I feel like he has taken advantage of me. I work a full time job, I take care of our daughter and her needs 95% of the time. I do his laundry and always have food made for him to eat. I try so hard to make his life easier. I do all the cleaning, I handle paying all the bills.  I feel so dumb for trying so hard. \n\nI’m so confused, like how long has he been doing this behind my back? I have never snooped his phones or checked his call or anything , I have completely trusted his word and give him his space. I am feeling very stupid right now. \n\nI just feel like I lost respect for him, we are very open with each other and have agreed to tell one another if we ever loose interest or are attracted to someone else because we should at least have that respect for one another and not cheat. But he didn’t tell me. I happened to open our laptop and the messages started coming in and the text was displayed so I read his texts asking for sex and nudes. If I hadn’t opened the lap top I would have never known, and he would have never told me.\n\nAm I the asshole for asking for a divorce and asking him to move out?\n\nPlease shed some light on the situation because I can’t. I’m just so hurt",

      "description": "I live in a house with some other dudes and we have neighbors with young children. A kind of friendship has been formed between the kids and a couple of my roommates. And I don't know when it started, but one of the kids has been coming over to our house in the morning and asking for a ride to school when he over sleeps and misses the school bus. A couple of my roommates are willing to give him a ride, but typically, I am the only one awake, or home, at that time. However, he comes over about the same time I leave for work, 7:25am. So that means I have to go try and wake up one of my roommates to give him a ride. My roommates have raised the question a couple times as to why I can't give him a ride. I have a couple issues with giving him a ride and I would appreciate your help in understanding if I am just being an asshole. \n\nThe thing is, even if I didn't have that conflict with leaving for work, I still don't want to give this kid a ride to school. For one, giving this kid a ride when he misses the school bus just teaches him that it's okay to oversleep and miss the school bus because one of us will bail him out. Plus, the more roommates who are willing to give him a ride will increase the frequency that this happens, I feel. \n\nAlso, as I mentioned, a kind of friendship has formed between the kids next door and a couple of my roommates. They come over to our place sometimes asking for chores to do for money. I want no part of this because I am worried that someone, like a neighbor, is going to get the wrong idea and we are going to have the cops come knocking on our door. So, for that reason also, I would prefer to just keep my distance from these kids and not give one of them a ride to school.\n\nI feel that it is one thing to be friendly with the neighbor kids, it is another thing to give them rides to school or let them come over and do chores for money.\n\nAnd before people inevitably ask, I have no idea why his parents can't give him a ride to school. I also asked my roommates the same thing and they have no idea.\n\nSo am I just being an asshole here for not wanting to help this kid out?",

She also has this tendency to expect rides from me because she doesn't like walking around in the cold.\n\nSo fast forward to today. I'm rolling groggily out of bed, pissy and uncomfortable, and I get a text from Alex. She's like \"make sure to come by my apartment later at 2:30 for our observation clinical!\". I was confused because of \"our\". I did not plan an observation at all, so I text her like \"what do you mean by \"our\"? \"Oh! I told Dr. Prof that you could come today! You are free Tuesday afternoons, so I figured it would be fine.\"\n\nTypically, yes, I am free Tuesday afternoons, but not today. I had to pick up a shift at the daycare I work at because, due to one of our teachers passing away unexpectedly, we're shortstaffed and scrambling to remain in ratio. I felt bad so I took the shift to lighten the load on our director. I told her that it was going to be tough at work and I was planning on doing the observation *next* week, when things were a little less crazy, but I'd consider trying to find a gap this week. In the end, I didn't find a gap and didn't tell her, which I should have. But she didn't ask my schedule when planning this.\n\nI was really mad. She became the brunt of all my anger and frustration for the past month. All my lack of sleep, my loss of a friend, my constant running, never getting to relax... I called her and exploded. I was yelling into the phone, asking her why the hell she would schedule something that important without consulting me, we're supposed to be partners, she knows this semester has been awful for me, why would she do this...\n\nShe just squeaked out the saddest \"I was trying to help\" and then hung up. She's not answering my texts, but her boyfriend and all our friends are asking me why she's so upset. I don't even know if we're still going to this observation clinical or she needs a ride. I called off work. I brought my clinical clothes to campus today. I feel like an awful bitch for yelling at her because I think I overreacted... But I also feel like I'm being guilted into feeling this way by her and the people in our friend group siding with her. Am I the asshole here or am I justified in feeling this frustrated and upset?",

      "description": "So this happened last year, with my now ex. But it keeps bugging me, for some reason. \nI'm a 16 year old girl, and I go to a public school in Colombia (if that's any relevant). My classroom is on the third floor, so I have to forcefully take the stairs to get to class.\n\nSo it's class day, so I normally wake up and first things first I get dressed. Shirt, socks, skirt, etc. My school's uniform also includes a kind of sports short that is skin-thight, and you have to use it under your skirt to prevent any kind of situation where your panties can be shown.\nBut, oh no! Mines were dirty that day, and it was too late to change into pants. So i said, i don't fricking give a heck, and just went to school with my skirt.\n\nSo, in my way there, when I was about to arrive my classroom, the wind blew and my skirt went anime tits and I think a fraction of my butt showed, but as far as I know no one was around to see. That was it, that was all that happened.\n\nSo after class I arrive home, and text my bf to see how he is. Naturally, we talk about what happened in our days. So I tell him about the skirt, and about what happened before I entered classroom. No biggie, just a qUiRkY embarassing moment, right? \n\nNope, he went fucking feral on me.\n\nHe got extremely mad for something I though was so little. He first said, that how was I so stupid to with no shorts (he's from my school so he knows) and that anyone could have seen below when I was taking the stairs. He told me that the girls that went like (me) at school were sluts, asked me if i liked showing myself (???) to others, and said that I have no respect for myself, or for him. Basically he spoke to me like I was a whore.\n\nI tried to explain myself, but he just didn't listen. I literally didn't understood anything. I thought what I did was harmless, heck, I didn't even put thought into it, i just did it. But i definetly thought that it was unfair he was mad at me, for something I didn't have control over.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: I went to school without shorts underneat my skirt, like how girl uniform is supposed to be. I told my boyfriend, and he got furious, saying that how could I go around displaying myself like that, and talked to me like I was a whore. AITA for not wearing shorts? Is he in the right to be mad?

Today at school she came up to me crying asking what she did wrong but I didn't even speak to her, I just walked away. Her friend called me an asshole  but i think i have a right to cut her off.

      "description": "So when fall semester ended I went back home to work and get money and my roommate stayed at our apt by himself. Now all the previous times I lived at the apt myself I never charged my roommates (previous and current) for electric when they weren’t actively living there (the electric is in my name, and I lived there over the summer when my roommates would be at home). But when I left for winter break, my roommate stayed at our apt. He has a habit of not being very energy efficient (he will leave our front door wide open, turn the heat on full blast when it only needs to be on low, leave every single light on that he can find, play video games until 5am etc). I’m not the richest person and I’m half expecting a $180 bill for electric that someone else used. When I get the bill I’m planning on just handing it to him and having him pay it all since I haven’t lived there the past month. \n\nI took out all my electronics, cleared my stuff out of the fridge when I left, the only thing I did was put my heat on low in my room so my pipes wouldn’t burst.\n\nI would be fine sharing the bill if we both left for the winter, but I don’t think I can afford to pay for his expensive habits (if I’m not there to be his “mom” he won’t take care of the place) \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I recently graduated and live at home. Well, I live with my parents, who rent a low-income home. I help contribute rent, internet, phone, etc.\n\nWhile I was away, it seems that the relationship and situation with my dad has worsened. Four years ago, he was diagnosed with cancer and underwent surgery. I am thankful that he is still with us and grateful for each and every second I have left with him. That being said, in addition to taking anti-rejection medication, he also has COPD and asthma. He struggles to perform activities like vacuuming but does take the occasional walk or two every day.\n\nWhenever I come home from work or am at home for the weekend, I see him lying in bed most of the time, reading or sleeping. He sometimes sleeps 12 hours a day, and some days does not leave the house. I have communicated my frustrations with him leading such a lifestyle, how he should not use his condition as an excuse to not be able to lead a meaningful life. I've offered to help him find other hobbies or join a volunteer organization but he continually makes excuses as to the condition of his health or his lack of English speaking for not doing so.\n\nNot wanting to be influenced by him, I have distanced myself from him. I do not go out of my way to ask him for advice nor spend quality time with him. I begrudgingly say, \"Bye, Dad\" in the morning when I leave for work and \"Hello, Dad\" when I come home from work, but I do not see how we can recover our father-son relationship if he does not want to accept my help. I long for a healthy, meaningful relationship with him, but I cannot accept the lifestyle he has adopted, living day in and day out without a meaning or a cause greater than himself.

      "description": "First time posting, gonna try and not be ranty. \n\nMy sister has some type of medical condition similar to Down syndrome but not Down syndrome. Best way I can describe it is she acts like she’s 4 and has a horrible short term memory. She’s 10\n\nWe have to take several precautions due to her being accident prone, and not learning from her mistakes. When confronted about her mistakes she gets angry and says she isn’t doing anything wrong. \n\nShe gets up at around 2-3 am to wander around the house. We have to lock the pantry, and our bedrooms at night, the issue is whenever we get up for school we have to use those weird key things for doors with the tiny hole. \n\nShe wakes up our mother who is near always sleep deprived. At 3 am.\n\nShe asks for food at restaurants like normal, but then refuses to eat it. Then when we get home asks for food. \n\nBegs for food that she doesn’t like. She doesn’t eat salad but always asks for it. \n\nWanders around in public, this is where the really embarrassing parts come in because I have to interact with people. \n\nShe will drop everything (literally) whenever she sees a dog or a baby. She will go and pet it, yes even babies, and I have to pull her away. The hard part is most of the time it’s a service dog or someone who just looks like they had a bad day. \n\nShe has to be held by the hand everywhere we go, as she refuse to follow our general direction otherwise.\n\nShe doesn’t understand that you have to buy things and tries to take whatever she wants. \n\nBut the one thing that drives me insane and i cannot mention without ranting is baby doll videos. You know, YouTube kids stuff. Johnny Johnny, finger family, god that stuff drives me insane. She’s still learning the alphabet but somehow can recite finger family and Johnny Johnny from memory. Neither of my parents see an issue but she watches these videos every car ride, without headphones. Full volume. Whenever we try headphones she unplugs them. She unplugs anything in her iPad, including the charger, and will wine when it doesn’t work. \n\nI don’t like her, I don’t like finger family, and I have hidden how much I dislike her for fear of my family.

      "description": "First off, I'm on mobile, so, formatting, yadda yadda. \n\nMy dad got the family a set of the tests as Christmas gifts. I think they're an interesting concept, but after going to school for cyber security/digitial forensics I've grown wary of people and companies collecting my information. I had actually found the kits a month early, and it had been on my mind since. \n\nI'm generally an anxious person, so I did some research myself. TLDR, They have to claim ownership of your DNA to get it tested. They say they won't use it for anything else, and you can request your information to be deleted, but who knows if/when either of those will change.\n\nI expressed to him this, saying that I really liked the idea, and appreciated the gift, however I didn't want to take the test right there and then. He got very defensive, and said \"If you don't take the test, you're not going to get your other gifts\". I eventually bit the bullet and just did it to prevent a bigger scene; also while setting reminders for myself to contact Ancestry and request the deletion.\n\nAITA? A sidenote, my brother (3 years younger) flat out refused to take the test, without providing a reason. (This was before I gave mine. He had been told to leave, and that he wasn't getting gifts.)",

However, one of the cities is one of the girl in our friend group’s hometown, and so far she has not been a part of our spring break planning. She is really only close with one of the girls going, but more importantly, she hasn’t been a very good friend recently. \n\nShe got a long distance boyfriend a while ago and has completely changed. She used to be bubbly and wanting to go out and have fun. Now, she never really hangs out with us, and when she does, she’ll leave early because “she promised him she’d call at x time”. She even said she’s been feeling excluded from our group because “all we do is go out and party” (not true). She hasn’t really been around much this past semester, and when she has, she acts super reserved and is always on her phone. \n\nSo, WWBTA if we didn’t invite her on a spring break trip that left from her home city?",

      "description": "Her roommate, let’s call her X, is very opinionated, so I don’t particularly like her. She’s said things to my girlfriend that make me wanna reach through the phone and strangle her. She’ll say shit like “honestly you’ve eaten so shitty this week, you shouldn’t be thinking about yogurt” and my girlfriend just takes it because she’s too nice.\n\nSo this past weekend I drove up to see my girlfriend because she’d just finished midterms and I wanted to treat her (she’s a nursing major and *always* working her ass off). I’ve never met X in person because she usually leaves before Friday. I got there around 9ish and my girlfriend had just showered (she tries to get in a morning run every other day to de-stress). So while we’re packing up some of her stuff to leave, X starts saying some shit about cardio being stupid. Keep in mind, both my girlfriend and I were/are runners. But then she starts specifically targeting my girlfriend’s BODY, saying that running will make her scrawnier and less attractive than she already is. My girlfriend, of course, just laughed it off. And not that it would matter, but my girlfriend’s body fucking *rocks*. She’s got nice toned legs and a cute little butt, not to mention that beautiful smile.\n\nAt that point hearing her do this shit in person sent me off the edge. I told her to fuck off and to focus on herself because my girlfriend wasn’t the one who needed fitness advice. They both just looked at me and then X walked into the bathroom, slamming the door. After we leave my girlfriend gives the typical “she’s really sensitive and it wasn’t a big deal” spiel in the car.\n\nFast forward to last night and I call my girlfriend as usual. Awhile later X comes back in and they start talking, so I just sit back and let them finish. After 40 minutes or so, I say that I’m gonna go shower. But before hanging up, I hear X say something alone the lines of “it’s weird how he calls you ‘baby’ when he’s a baby,” and laugh, so I ask what she meant by that. She responds with “you’re literally still in high school, you’re basically a baby”. Then I just started cussing her out and telling her to grow the fuck up, etc. This time I hear her cry and my girlfriend hangs up.\n\nMy girlfriend is 2 years older and it was a big insecurity of mine when we first started dating because I didn’t feel like I measured up. I know it’s stupid but it’s something people tease me about, so I took it too personally. I still think X is a shitty person, but I feel bad after hearing her cry. I’m usually not that hot headed, but I hate the way she talks to my girlfriend.\n\nI’m probably gonna end up apologizing either way because I feel like absolute shit, but I wanna know if her being a shitty person justifies me being shitty back?\n\nTLDR; cussed out my girlfriend’s roommate for insulting her body and making fun of our age gap, made her cry twice\n",

      "description": "Background: I suffer from mental illnesses, the specifics aren't important. Normally, I can live around them, but lately due to a lot of personal stress, my mental health has been suffering, so I decided to take a break from everything. I posted on Facebook explaining that I needed time to myself to regroup and recover, and for the most part, everyone was supportive and respected my No Contact rules. I texted my boyfriend before I made the post, just because I felt weird about him finding out through a Facebook post, and his response was \"sounds like a break up but ok\", which was annoying, but whatever. I made it explicitly clear it wasn't a break up, and it wasn't just him, might I add.\n\nFast forward about two weeks to present day.  Still going through a lot of personal shit, but I feel guilty for cutting contact with everyone, and starting to ease myself back into talking to people, including my boyfriend. We talked over text and in person when he showed up at my work (this is normal, and I don't really mind if it's slow, but sometimes he stays too long and I don't want to get in trouble), and I think everything's going to be okay, but he starts pushing to hang out again. Like, later that day despite me having errands I've been neglecting, and tomorrow (today, now) when I said no. After work he texts me if we can still hang out in the morning, and when I tell him I'm not emotionally ready to hang out with anyone right now, he got upset, pointing out that last weekend I had gone to visit my brother, and if I can go see my brother there's no reason I can't hang out with him. Yeah, I kinda get it, but at the same time, my brother needs surgery, and it's moderately serious and I wanted to see him and offer support if he needed it, and that visit caused me a lot of stress for reasons I won't get into. He accused me of not wanting to see him, and making things up for attention, and doesn't understand when I say I do want to see him, but right now, even talking to my roommate for two minutes is extremely draining. As for the making it up part...I honestly just pretended I didn't read that because wow. He sent me a good morning text earlier, but I haven't responded yet. I just don't want to deal with him right now.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is Am I the Asshole for wanting to slowly reintroduce myself into socializing again? Or for cutting off contact with everyone in the first place? I'm starting to feel really guilty about the entire situation.",

      "description": "Ok guys, honestly just found this Reddit, and every so often I wonder am I the asshole for this. So a little bit of backstory (On mobile so I’m sorry for formatting): A  friend of mine, we’ll call her Tal. We’ve been friends since kindergarten, she was there for me when I had no friend, (I was very shy) and she was honestly one of my first real friends. \n\nAnyways we’ve drifted apart once we both hit third grade, fast forward to seventh grade, I was staying at my school later than usual because I just finished tutoring a friend when I saw Tals mom coming in the school asking about her to the facility, as it seems she tried to kill her self in the school bathroom. When she was found I started to try and be connected with her again, at first it was great, we would play video games everyday and talk on Skype for hours. \n\nBut she relapsed again in eighth grade and Took pills to take her life, she told me what she did and told me I was like a brother to her. I went to then councilor and got an ambulance to come and pump her stomach. Prior to this a lot of my close friends would tell me not to bother because she is; an “attention whore” and it wasn’t worth my time. I never believed it because this was my oldest friend. But soon after she got taken to the hospital she accepted my friend request on Instagram and I saw how a lot of her posts were about how much she wants to die and how nobody loves her ETC, what took me by surprise was she actually posted about her and how she tried to kill herself and even tagged me in it, claiming: “A friend saved her life” Soon after that she would post pictures of her cuts, and cutting. This activity persisted for another year.\n\nOnce we hit high school she took a turn for the worse, she would only come to school once a week, she would ignore me and anybody else, and would just sit alone no matter how much I invited her to sit with our old friend group. The next year she dropped out of high school, we still talked but a lot of what she said seemed to be more about how nobody loves her and she should just die. Suicide has been especially difficult for me as one of my exs threatened suicide if I didn’t date her.\n\nThe reason I don’t want to contact her isn’t because I don’t want to deal with her or her problems, it’s because I feel like she uses me to get attention or something. She would make me worry and freak out and call and text her, then act as if everything was normal, I couldn’t take it, the last straw was when she told me she was enrolling back in our school, and only said that so I would tell her everything that she missed, ie: the drama and such, at the time I was just happy she was getting her life back on track. \n\nWell, I recently graduated and her mom contacted my mom giving me her new number. I want to help her, but I feel like she only wants to talk to me so that I can give her attention. I really care about her but I don’t think I can help her anymore. AITA",

      "description": "So I get home after two 12-hour lifeguard certification training days and right on my bedroom door is a neat aquatics sticker exclusive to my current high school water polo team. Well you could only get one (only one per person ) during the recent water polo season (if you're on the varsity team).\n\nI thought it was pretty cool and was saving it to put on a water bottle, surfboard, bumper, etc. \n\nNow, last time I was at this house (my mom/stepdads place), I had the sticker in my LOCKED (locked since I have a 3 year old half sister who likes to get into things) room.\n\nImmediately. I questioned my mom with suspicion because she mentioned how she wanted the sticker about week or two ago\n\nShe claimed that my little sister got it and then stuck it on my door. This seems valid, right? Well, that's what I thought until I realized that the sticker was placed on the door about 6 feet off the ground.\n\nMy little sister is about 2-3 feet tall so obviously my mom placed it there.\n\nWhen I confronted my mom with this she conceded that she actually did put it there after my sister retrieved it from my room (which would only be possible if she was let inside by my mom).\n\nReasons I'm ticked off-\n1. My mom completely ignored my telling to not let my little sister in my room anymore because she has lost many of my personal items previous times.\n2. My mom blamed it completely on my sister, a 3 year old child, instead of taking responsibility for her actions (until I called her out for it).\n3. My mom did not think about how it would affect me at all (it's my personal belonging) and she placed the value of my right how have personal belongings items below her lazy desire for convenience ((she easily could have just placed it back on my desk and locked the door)).\n4. My mom repeatedly shows a lack of respect for other people and their belongings.\n\nSo I'm giving her the silent treatment for a week.\n\nI'm not mad about the sticker itself, but at how she doesn't think about others at all and has shown that over and over again.\n\nAm I just a petty-as-fuck little asshole?",

I paid up through Friday. Before dropping her off yesterday I got some money to pay the sitter. It’s 25$ a day.

I used to work with animals and  the dog wasn’t a puppy so it wasn’t play biting. She was full grown probably around 150 lbs. the sitter comes in the room and was like omg did she bite you?! I felt bad I know it’s not logical since I didn’t do anything to provoke the dog.  I firmly believe that the owner put the dog in a situation she was not comfortable with since she had previously told me the dog doesn’t do well with strangers. So when I got back to pick my daughter up the dog was inside again and started barking at me. The sitter then put the dog outside. I told her my schedule changed and I would let her know if I needed her to babysit. I was trying to be nice about the reason I didn’t want my daughter there. But about halfway home I realized I forgot to give her the money for babysitting that day. I honestly do not want to go back there. I think the dog is dangerous to strangers ( she seems to do fine with the family). And I feel like if I go back I’m just asking to be bit again. So aita for forgetting to pay the sitter 25$ for yesterday and deciding not to go back and give it to her because of the dog? ",

      "description": " \n\nMy sister-in-law is getting married soon, and my husband and I were super excited to go to the wedding until we received the invitation. The wedding is adults only, no kids allowed. My husband and I have a 2-month old who does not sleep more than 2 hours and is still breastfeeding. The wedding is far away and would have to be a weekend trip. Because we would have to be gone for so long, and because our baby is pretty high maintenance, there is no one we feel comfortable giving that burden too. My husband considered going on his own, he was supposed to be in the wedding, but I am barely getting by as is I don't feel like I could handle a whole weekend with the baby by myself. He agreed that it would be difficult and decided to decline the invitation. His sister is extremely angry with us for not coming to her special day, she feels abandoned, but she does not want to budge on the no children rule, so it is what it is. Am I the asshole for asking my husband to miss this important day so that I am not alone caring for the baby?",

      "description": "So I'm a 16 year old boy who loves to bake, I'm pretty good at it, I've done it since I was very little and took a bit of a break in high school, but started again last year. So a few days ago I was making chocolate cupcakes for the first time in ages, and I was wanting to teach myself icing to improve my presentation.\n\nI had just taken the cupcakes out of the oven, and they had cooled a bit, and my mam came in the room (she's a genuinely lovely woman), and she asked for two cupcakes for her and my dad to have with their tea, and I said no because I was wanting to have quite a few for the icing (there was ten), and them she asked again, and again and again for around five minutes, I kept saying no. About ten minutes after she left I realised that I might not have enough icing for every cupcake, so I went into the living room and tried to give them some cakes, when I did that my dad (again, a usually genuinely lovely man) shouted at me to get out seemingly out of nowhere. \n\nI ended up having enough icing for all of the cakes and they came out pretty decent, but my dad refused to eat any because I didn't give him any, and my mam didn't have any because my dad told her not to. My brother gave up cakes and biscuits for lent too, so I had a full batch to myself! My dad has been acting kind of mad for a few days, and my mam said that he's \"livid\". Apparently he's talking about charging me for the electricity I use when I bake (I don't have a job, so that'd be difficult), and my mam is trying to get me to apologise, but I'm not sure if I should because I don't think I'm in the wrong, and I know he'll still be mad.

      "description": "**The Issue:**\n\nMy dad just got suspended from his job yesterday. For those wondering, he took a lunch break when he wasn't supposed to with a bunch of his coworkers. Somebody found them in the back room but only picked 3-4 people to blame and my dad was one of the unlucky ones. \n\nWe don't know how long his suspension will last, and I don't know how the decision process works when it comes to \"un-suspending\" someone.  From what I've heard when it comes to suspensions, there's a slim chance companies will ever allow an employee to come back. \n\nThe main problem is, his job was our main source of income. He's had this job for 15-20 years or so; it'll be difficult for him to work his way back up and still receive the same benefits.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nNow the problem is my mother. I almost never speak ill of my family, but she's been a complete ass about the entire thing. She went to me first yesterday evening and told me everything. I was her shoulder to cry on.\n\nBut then, the next morning, she went around telling us (my younger brother and I) this: how we wouldn't have any food at school, in order to save money. How we would probably be homeless within 3 months. \n\nShe told my younger brother, who's only 10, about everything, with the exaggerations. He has serious anxiety and ADHD, so he's not the best at school. She stood in front of him and told him: \"I don't even care if you fail school anymore. Study or not, we have bigger problems now.\" \n\nAnyone who's seen as \"relaxed\" gets yelled at. I didn't say anything. I simply got off the couch and did my chores. Then I did homework. \n\n\\~\n\nAlthough there's a reason she's like this, literally anybody can see she's being a bit much. I feel like she's almost using this moment as a way to \"build herself up\" for her own benefits. You know what I mean? It almost feels like she likes the fact that her husband doesn't have a job. \n\nI woke up this morning and heard her singing in the bathroom and rushed over to her and asked if Dad got his job back. She immediately shut me down and called me an idiot for even thinking about such a positive thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I snapped at her. I degraded her and her part-time job. I let her know that in the past 24 hours the only issue I've been seeing is her attitude towards the whole thing. I told her that as an adult its her responsibility to do what's right. I let her know that her son peed his pants in the middle of the night out of fear. Fear that she created. I let her know a lot of things that I do not wish to say online. \n\nLastly, I told her that she's the worst mother on the planet and literally anybody else would know a better way to take action and pull the family together. I let her know that *she's* being useless right now, not me. \n\nI stormed downstairs to the basement and haven't left since 9 AM. It's 12PM now. I've been making my dad a resume and looking up jobs in the area. I've been thinking about which of the things I have in my room that I could sell online.  I'm still in high school, so trying to get a job to help in the middle of the school year will be bit tricky, so I've been trying to avoid that option. \n\n\\~\n\nI feel guilty and I need someone who can think clearly to let me know if I'm in the wrong or right for yelling at her. Was yelling at my mother and \"letting her know her place\" a good idea at such an urgent time? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "title": "AITA For Profiling African Americans at the Store I Work At?",
      "description": "Hear Me Out…\n\nFirst off, I would consider myself a tolerant person. I’m a college student going to a primarily liberal college and I’ve learned a lot about the many hardships that African Americans had to suffer through.\n\nI work a part time job at a drug store (Don’t want to give too many details on where I work). My main duties are to stock shelves, keep an eye out for shoplifters, help customers and occasionally work the register. I’ve been working at this establishment for a little over a year and a half I’ve noticed a pattern… I’ve noticed that a STRONG 90% of the shoplifters that come to the store are African American. About twice a day a grown African American man or woman (mostly women) come to the store and shop lift. At first, I thought I just be a coincidence, but it keeps on happening! Our shoppers are roughly 30ish percent black 50ish percent white and 20ish percent other races if I made a guess. I am aware of selective attention bias and when I first started noticing a pattern I always tried my best to make sure that I’m paying equal attention to everyone, but it’s gotten to the point where the only people that I have noticed shoplifting are African Americans and Kids. I’m not one of those people who thinks they steal “BeCauSE iTs iN tHeRE dNa” I understand that the mostly likely explanation is the population density of low-income houses/apartments in the vicinity of the store. Because of this, whenever an African American comes into the store I take their race into account when considering if I need to keep an eye out on them. This isn’t the only basis I would use, for example, Shoplifters often LOOK/ACT suspicious, there always staring at me and my coworkers and pace back in forth in one spot. (The point I’m trying to make is that I don’t SOLEY base it one race.)\n\nSide Note- I would NEVER accuse someone of shoplifting unless I was 1000% sure that they are. I am WAY to socially awkward to blindly accuse people. Its one of my nightmares to accuse someone who isn’t shoplifting of shoplifting, I would look like such a dumbass. Additionally, when I’m suspecting someone, I don’t make it obvious I’m observing them. I believe everyone should feel comfortable when shopping and not feel like they are being watched. I use the mirrors we have on the ceiling and try to only observe without their knowledge. (cuz they usually shoplift when they think they aren’t being watched, and if they don’t shoplift I don’t want them to feel targeted.) Also---- EVERY SINGLE TIME I confront someone who I am 100% CERTAIN is stealing (1. I saw them take something and store it in a suspicious place. 2. They try to leave without paying it.) The NUMBER ONE excuse that is given is “Ohhhhhhh, Because I’m Black?”-NO! ITS BECAUSE I SAW YOU PUT IT IN YOUR FUCKING PURSE CUNT!\n\nAnyway, AITA and I should just defy all of my and my coworkers’ observations and act like the African Americans in my area don’t steal a disproportional amount compared to anyone else?",

      "description": "A bit of backstory: I love my parents but my mom is a hoarded. Not as extreme as what you see on TV, but a hoarder none the less. Every counter or tabletop in the house is cluttered, hallways have several stacks of clothing, family heirlooms, or containers piled up. There are two rooms of their house that are unused because they are filled to the ceiling with furniture and knick knacks. My mom's room has a path leading to the bathroom, her bed, and the laundry room.\n\nSince 2012, this has been an apparent issue. I've tried multiple times to get her to sell or let go of some of these possessions. All the while, she continues to buy souvenirs and furniture while on vacation and inheriting pieces from dying relatives. I moved back in with them in 2016, and lived there for the past two years saving money to go back to school. Over that time I kept the house clean, but I wasn't able to get her to let go of anything. I've tried everything: getting her to donate things to charity, selling it, or taking pictures of it so she'll at least remember it.\n\nI moved away for school and came back to help my mom decorate from Christmas. The house is worse than ever on top of just being dirty. It's completely overwhelming and I've shut down. It would take over a day just to get things clean enough to put the decorations up. I'm tired of this seemingly up-hill battle to get her to downsize. I'm concerned about their health: the fridge and pantry are full of moldy and expired food, there is black mold in the shower, and my dad already has mobility issues, he shouldn't have to navigate an obstacle course to get around the house. The house almost caught fire last winter when my mom stacked clothes on the heater. She won't accept professional help because she's concerned someone may steal or move something.\n\nWould I be the asshole for telling them I can't visit the house until they clean it? I don't want to help decorate. I don't want to reorganize only to have her reintegrate everything into the house. I literally get stressed whenever I visit. I don't think I even want to visit for Christmas if I have to stay there. I know they gave me a free place to live the past few years, and they probably expect me to clean, but things are so out of control I'd have to get rid of things just to clean. I mean I've organized the house well over 20 times in hopes she would process through some things and downsize, and I'm tired of wasting my time.",

      "description": "Okay so, a week or two ago, I accidentally told my friend I had received insurance money after my mom passed away a couple of months ago. How did I accidentally tell him? Basically we got to talking about driving and stuff and I blurted out that I'm going to start trying for my drivers license finally and said I got insurance money from mom. They're pretty expensive in my country.\n\nMy friend just messaged me asking me to lend him money so he can go to the vet with his dog, and he'll pay me back a little bit every month. I don't want to. I've set this money aside for a license and I'm trying to find a house.\n\nHe works, and he works night a lot, which means he gets paid double or close to. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work, which I have been since May, and I'm finally about to start job training.\n\nBesides, 90% of the vet clinics let you pay off monthly, if not, he has his dog insured, insurance can pay for the visit if it's an emergency, and he can pay them off. Loaning my money won't make it any cheaper.\n\nHe's somehow always broke because he keeps taking loans from his friends and family, so after paying rent, bills and paying them back, he's left with scraps. Idk where all this money goes, that's his business.",

      "description": "When sister 1 got married it was kind of a all hands on deck situation.  She was pregnant and neither her or her boyfriend had very much money.  My mom paid to rent out the fire hall and for the kegs of beer.  I paid for and cooked all the food.  My other two sisters set up the tables and chairs as well as the decorations.  \n\nThe food was pretty expensive and both sister 1 and her boyfriend kept adding requests, literally up until a couple hours before the wedding itself.  It was a lot of work and I really didn’t enjoy doing it.  \n\nWhat kind of sealed the deal as far as not ever wanting to do this again was during the toasts sister 1’s boyfriend thanked my mother and sisters for all that they did.  I know it’s petty to be so miffed about not being thanked, but it did really rub me the wrong way to be the only one overlooked after I just dropped so much money and work for them. \n\nSister 2 is getting married now.  It’s not really the same situation.   Her fiancé has an ok job as far as I know they can afford to have it catered.  While she was talking about it came out that she assumed that I would cater hers since I did sister 1’s.  It’s not a ridiculous assumption or anything, but I corrected her that I really didn’t want to do that kind of thing ever again. \n\nShe didn’t say anything at the time, but I guess she’s angry at me about it.  Both my other sister and mother have texted me about it now.  I can see how it would look a little shitty to do it for sister 1 and refuse to do it for her, but I really don’t want to drudge up years long shit from the previous wedding to explain.  Besides it was out of necessity for sister 1’s wedding.  Sister 2’s situation is different.",

      "description": "Hey dear friends, especially those who upvote my posts even when you disagree. \n\nI am a student of eighteen years old that still lives with his parents. They are loving people that still make my bread before I go to school and make sure that dinner is ready when I get home. \n\nThis love is not for everyone. They are very racist and especially pessimistic people. I do not share these views with them. When I tell them how I think about situations, they tell me that I am wrong because I am only eighteen, and that I will learn how the world works as I grow up. \n\nAnother thing that bothers me, is that they make a fight out of every detail. For example: last night, I went out for dinner with friends. I've never had friends before, so for me this was an important thing. They offered to pick me up when I would be done, which I very much appreciated, since it is more than an hour extra when I have to travel alone. \n\nDuring dinner however, I discovered that we would be done way later than I expected. I expected us to finish around 20.30 (we started at 18.00), but we were only halfway through. I informed my parents that this would take longer than expected and that I wasn't willing to leave yet. Understandably, they could no longer pick me up, since it would become late for all of us and they had to go to work today. I understood, so I told them I'd travel back home on my own. \n\nNow they are very angry at me. They've told me that I behave like the house is nothing more than a place to sleep to me and that I am never home (which is sort of true, I only eat at home twice a week or so, but that is because I have school in the evening) and that I do not respect their rhythm. \n\nNow we are in a silent fight. I am being ignored and my attempts to talk about it result in nothing more than insults. Useless fights with exaggerated arguments happen all the time (approximately every two weeks). \n\nNow, I am done with it. I'm ready to grow as an individual and I am done of dealing with this toxic environment. I have a place to sleep and I have no possessions besides my clothes since I live a minimalistic lifestyle. I could leave any minute. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to leave my parents over this? They are loving towards me most of the time, but the tension is too much for me. Leaving them wouldn't be in cooperation, so I would just leave for school and don't return.\n\nSorry for the long read and the horrible English. As you might've guessed already, English is not my native language. ",

      "description": "As the title goes, I have been in a relationship with my significant other for about four years now, and we have lived together for the majority of the time. Being in college, my SO is often very stressed out with work, classes, and focusing on graduate school, which I completely understand, I am in the same exact position. However, about three or four days a week, my SO cries over different things, from ruining dinner, to not being able to see our cat as much, as we are very busy a lot of the time, to crying over dropping a pen or other little things like that. I try, especially in the beginning, to comfort my SO and be there with whatever they need, but it never seems to make any impact. After a while of this, I became calloused to it, for lack of better term, and while I do comfort my SO and try to make life as easy as I possibly can, I have noticed I have been getting more annoyed rather than empathetic recently, as whenever these happen, the following several hours are me stepping very carefully, as my SO tends to get easily irritated or annoying before and after these crying sessions, and I don't want to upset my SO any more than they already have been. So my question is, am I the asshole? Also any advice is welcome!",

      "description": "To start off, one of the cats in the house are fat. Really fat. Every time I walk into the kitchen, she runs over to her food dish and starts meowing like crazy, as if she hasn't been fed in a week, yet she gets fed breakfast and dinner. And the worst part about her is that her shit STINKS BAD. HORRIBLY BAD. I'm talking the FBI could synthesize the smell, and use it to clear rooms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet, my grandma seems oblivious to how obese she is. When she feeds the fat cat in the morning, she'll give the cat a Mount Everest sized pile worth of food, so when she's not looking I have to split it up between the two food plates (we have two cats). Before we leave for school, she'll give the cats treats, and then the dogs treats. I asked why do they get treats so much, and she'll say \"I'm feeding them??\" First of all, treats are called \"TREATS\" for a reason. They are to REWARD your pets for good behavior, training them, etc. She just gives treats to our dogs just because, not for good behavior. She also likes to feed them air-popped popcorn a lot, I mean a lot. I'll be sitting watching TV with her while she's eating popcorn and toss a piece of popcorn to each dog at least every 5 to 15 seconds (I counted with my fingers, 1 1000, 2 1000, 3 1000, etc). Based on a search, air-popped popcorn isn't harmful, but she puts butter on her popcorn, which is fattening.\n\nI'm starting to get afraid that before we know it our animals are going to have obesity problems. How should I handle this?",

      "title": "AITA for remaining friends with SO's best mates recent ex?",
      "description": "My partners (Dan) best friend (Keiran) has broke up with his girlfriend of 2 years (Clare). Apparently, certain unspoken social rules say that you must remain friends with your SO's best friend in this situation and stop talking to the other party. Well if these rules are applicable to adulthood even though I think they're childish as f*ck, I'm really not willing to follow them. \n\nI met Keiran and Clare at exactly the same time, and I found Keiran loud and inconsiderate to people's feelings, I have autism and I felt he was always trying to fish for a reaction from me and winding me up. He would question my autistic quirks and tell me I'm daft for liking things done a certain way. I immediately wasn't a fan but I was civil for Dan's sake. I got on really well with Clare, however. There is a significant age gap between them, he is 29 and she is 21. I'm 30 and Dan is 28. \n\nLong story short, Clare is in uni and last year went to do placement in another city (London) a good few hours away for 4 or 5 months. I don't know what happened over there and don't really care to ask but she ended up breaking up with Keiran and he started sleeping with another girl (Sarah) quite soon after. However, Clare came back up to get her belongings and they sorted things out and got back together and she returned to London to continue her placement. Keiran however continued sleeping with Sarah behind Clare's back. \n\nA few months down the line, Clare has completed her placement and is back in our city for studying as normal. We're all out on a double date and decide to go clubbing. We go to our usual haunt and Sarah ends up being there. Keiran sees her and for some stupid reason says to Clare \"I have no idea who that is,\" that's cool, Keiran but why say it about just her and not the numerous other girls in the club that you don't know? Clare finds this odd and they break up that night when it comes out that he had been cheating with this Sarah girl well into Clare's placement. \n\nShe messages me to tell me what has happened and says that she hopes we can remain friends and I tell her of course, not even thinking about any unspoken \"rules\". She has blocked him from everything\nIn the following weeks after the break up, Keiran hits rock bottom and apparently downs almost a full bottle of straight vodka in front of some paramedics, telling them he's going to kill himself. I don't know where he was or how he came to be in range of emergency services but they then call Clare saying that he wants to talk to her and that if she doesn't comply then he is going to put himself in danger. She ends up talking to him as she feels she has no choice to do so, and they arrange to meet up and start sleeping with one another again. She then realised it's a mistake and backs off again. \nKeiran messages Dan asking him and I to remove Clare from Facebook and to stop speaking to her and if we don't, he'll stop speaking to us. I immediately get my back up about this and instead of removing Clare, I remove Keiran. It's no skin off my back. Keiran realises what I've done and proceeds to tell Dan a load of what may or may not be lies about Clare not liking me and saying shit about me when I'm not there. I don't get upset cos I only have issues with people if they piss me off directly. \n\nDan and I go on a date and end up at the same club as last time and bump into Clare. We don't spend too much time with her as she's with her own friends and Dan feels uncomfortable with being around her cos of where his loyalties are. A few hours into the night and Keiran messages Dan to say they can no longer be friends because of me remaining friends with Clare. Little does he know that Clare has told me that he has also been messaging and calling her off an unknown number asking to fuck her, then turning on her when she rejects him. \n\nI feel as though I'm my own person and can be friends with who I want. There's no issues between Dan and I because he knows I'm capable of making my own decisions and that Keiran isn't the type of person I'd willingly be friends with. Am I the asshole? Should I have deleted Clare and remained civil with Keiran?\n\nTl;dr SO'S best friend breaks up with girlfriend, I remain friends with girlfriend even though SOs best friend tells me to stop talking to her. Drama ensues. ",

      "description": "I ride a motorcycle and my girlfriend has been very vocal in the past about how much she hates that I ride it, is always worried sick whenever I ride it. Even just for my daily commute of 38 miles. \n\nI had to ride up to her parents house on Christmas eve to spend Christmas with her and her family. Then ride back Boxing Day to work. A much longer trip of about an hour and a half. When I arrived she said she was worried sick the entire time and hated every second that I was driving. I do have an Bluetooth attachment on my helmet so she could call me but refuses to on the grounds that this will distract me and be dangerous.\n\nSo for the ride home we both downloaded some app that showed my location, updated every couple of minutes, and showed my top speed of all my journeys. After the long ride, I mentioned getting rid of the app as the idea of being tracked made me uncomfortable. But was talked into keeping it.\n\nSo tonight she sends me a meme about someone's husband surprising them by leaving a note on their car while they're at work. I said I can't do that as you've got me electronically tagged, this was meant as a joke but I guess with serious undertones. That sparks an argument where I state again that I feel the tracker is disrespectful to me, and our relationship. And it makes me feel very uncomfortable. This apperantly means I must have something to hide and I'm ignoring her happiness for my own sake.\n\nShe's deleted the app in a rage. Am I the asshole for not being okay with being tracked 24/7?\n\nTL;DR Girlfriend made me download a app that shows her where I am constantly. I said I'm not comfortable with it. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So in China in a few weeks it's Chinese New Year. My fiancé has been talking about us going to his hometown to spend the holiday with his family. I'm a bit nervous about this because my Chinese isn't great and actually his older family members only really speak a dialect instead of standard mandarin, so communication is gonna be difficult but it's fine, we'll manage.\nMy issue is this: there's no bed for us to sleep in. My fiancé (currently unemployed with no savings) said that I could share a bed with his mom (??) while we're there (for 3 weeks) or I could buy a bed, while he shares with his brother. I'm not into the idea of sharing a bed with an old lady I don't know and won't be able to communicate with, so I thought okay, I'll buy a cheap bed because we're only gonna be using it for 3 weeks so it doesn't matter if it's crappy, when we visit again we'll just buy a nicer bed. I find a cheap and okayish bed for about 1,000 RMB. He flat out refuses, telling me it's too cheap, and instead finds a couple of beds for around 3,000 RMB. I don't have savings because I moved here a few months ago and basically used up all my savings to get here. I'm the only one of us with a job but the fact that he knew this was going to be an issue and decided not to tell me until one month in advance (or save up a bit so that I wasn't the one paying for the entire bed) means I'll have to spend a quarter of my paycheck on a bed I'm barely going to use.\nI want to just not go, honestly. CNY isn't a big thing where I'm from, and I can't imagine ever suggesting to him that if we went to my home country he either fork out money for a bed or share a bed with my dad for 3 weeks.\nOn the other hand I know that CNY is a big deal here and I think if I don't go at all I'm going to make him look bad. So I'm torn, really.",

I’ve never been close with my actual family and when told I could invite people I asked 2 of my closest friends if they would like to attend. I told them it’s in Chicago and that they would receive tickets to it when The dates set. A couple of hours ago one of them messaged me and told me I wouldn’t have to worry about paying for her hotel because she would be staying with this guy she has been talking to.  I told her I wouldn’t be paying for her plane ticket or her hotel and now she is really upset and told me she doesn’t want to go if she has to pay to come see me. I’m really confused, am I supposed to pay for everyone to come to my graduation??",

      "description": "So my roommate likes to leave things on top of the shared fridge, like pasta, bread, and snacks. We have a fridge where the freezer is on top. She left for the weekend and was in a rush and apparently just shoved all her shit on top of the fridge/freezer. She must have left some stuff on the top of the closed door of the freezer. I woke up the morning after at like 5 am to get ready for school and opened the freezer, and her container of spaghetti came falling down along with her bread and bagels. Her container is [this one](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-POP-Container/dp/B000UHT0MM/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1MBTC3M17YD25&amp;keywords=tall%2Boxo%2Bcontainers&amp;qid=1548183589&amp;sprefix=tall%2Boxo%2B%2Caps%2C290&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1) . It broke on the bottom, just a small hole on the corner, still usable lid and stuff just a busted bottom portion.\n\nI texted her after I did it letting her know that I broke it and she said it was fine. Today, about a week after it broke, she comes in my room and asks for money to replace the container. I was confused because she didn't seem too irritated by it before but she said the containers are expensive (they are, who the fuck pays $15 for a plastic bin and lid?) so I should pay her back.\n\nI said I don't think I should have to pay for it because she left the container in a precarious location and I didn't do anything wrong to have caused it to be broken. She said I should have checked the top of the freezer before opening it, but that's kind of ridiculous to think to do at 5 am and also I'm 5'2\" so I can't really see the top of the freezer anyway. I also said she could just tape the hole closed on the container and it would still be usable. So now she's off in a huff and called me a cheapskate. Honestly I'll give her the cash if I'm the asshole here but I legit think no one is really in the wrong here, so I shouldn't have to pay.\n\nAITA? \n\nTl;Dr: Roommate left her $15 pasta container on top of the freezer and it fell when I opened it. I don't think I should have to pay because she is the one who left it in a dangerous spot and the container is still usable with mild repair. AITA?",

      "description": "I am a woman, married to a woman. I’ve known about my attraction to women for basically my whole life, and because of this I have argued about gay rights with my conservative extended family on many occasions. One such instance had a great aunt (let’s call her Marge) pull out a petition at a family dinner to have recently legalized gay marriage in our state repealed. I was closeted at the time (and only 16), but I argued with probably 4 different fully grown adults over rights for a solid half hour before I had to just leave so I didn’t accidentally out myself in anger. When I announced my marriage, Marge sent me a letter telling me (amongst other things) that her religious beliefs kept her from attending my wedding (she was never going to be invited, but I just loved that she thought it necessary to shit on my wedding /s). \n\nYesterday, six months after my wedding, she sent me another letter asking me if I would be coming to Christmas Eve at her house with the entirety of my homophobic family. I know this could just her trying to be kind, perhaps bridge the gap of whatever knowledge she has of gay people and the person she has known me to be, but I just want to ignore the metaphorical olive branch. If I go, it’s going to be a bunch of old people asking me about my wedding, and then being awkward because my wife and I are the only gay people they know. And they haven’t even met my wife, yet, who already has anxiety in situations where she doesn't know anyone.

About halfway through the question got popped that was, “If someone grows up in a negative environment are they going to be a negative or destructive person?”  So the normal thing was happening with people going back on forth and then this girl, we will call her Alex speaks out and says, “ Well it’s like saying that a young girl grows up where her father gets killed in a car crash and then her mother remarried a man who was a pedophile who raped her even though she was around 6 and then the step son that came with her would emotionally abuse her and touch her sexually and the father would beat her if she tried to speak out.” Now she continued on about comparing it to Frankenstein but it was in that moment of her talking that I cracked a fairly loud chuckle and I put my head down to laugh and because I was getting awful looks from other students and the teacher looked upset with me. I as a person have a very dark sense of humor and just the sheer randomness of her bringing up that kind of event out of the blue when we were talking about Frankenstein caused me to lose it. I had a couple friends in the class who also share my sense of humor and they all were also trying to contain their laughter I just let mine come out because I was so shocked. ",

      "description": "Background about us: I’m a 2nd gen American and speak both English and my native language fluently. My roommate is a 1st gen that can understand basic English but can barely speak it.\n\nBasically when we first met as coworkers, he would occasionally ask me to make a call pretending to be him for personal stuff like problems at his apartment, his business, etc. Now he relies on me to do all the speaking for him. I’ve already talked to him about taking classes and having the willingness to learn if he plans to continue living in the states. He says he’ll start taking classes soon but I dont see any initiative. He’ll barge in my room with phone in hand already making a call and shoving his phone in my face, while explaining his situation as the call goes through. Personally, I find this super annoying and confronted him about it. He would get mad and say something along the lines of “is it that difficult to make a simple phone call?”. While its true that its not a particularly difficult task, I dont want to be constantly bothered. I told him I plan to move out after the lease ends.\n\nAITA for telling him not to bother me with his problems anymore?",

      "description": "I understand that this might be a little but long so there is a tl:Dr below.\n\nA month ago my dad was admitted into the hospital for a bad case of pancreatitis. The doctors told my family and me that he had a stone obstructing one of the main ducts that caused massive damage to his pancreas and his other organs. Fast forward to today, he is on recovery and slowly getting back up from the whole situation.\n\nDuring this whole process, my father's condition into some low points and we almost lost him but luckily we didn't. At the time, I took a few days off work to go see him at the hospital and be with him. \n\nAfter he started improving on his condition the days of my visits started to be less frequent due to some key factors.\n\nFirst point is that unfortunately I had to return to work as me and my wife are currently on a rough patch regarding money and with this my visitation got less frequent. \n\nThe second point is that  it takes two hours to reach the hospital from my workplace I am forced to visit on weekends.\n\nThird point is that due to taking the days off to see my father a lot of my other responsibilities have been left behind and I am trying to pick up the pace with them.\n\nThis has started to cause issues with my mother who has asked me  to stay with him during visitation hours. She tells me that she needs help with him so she can go out and clean the house or do some other thing like cook ( mind you, she never cooks no matter what). I told her that I would stay with him but I couldn't stay all day as I have other responsibilities to do as well. At the time she got angry and screamed at me and told me I was an ungrateful son. That time I caved and stayed with him all day along with my wife. \n\nToday I received a call from my mother that went along like this:\n\nMother: hello, I need you to go and be with your father for the Saturday and Sunday.\n\nMe: mom I can't be all weekend with him, I can visit but I can't stay that long.\n\nMother:  I need help. I need to clean the house and do some groceries.\n\nMe: You never clean the house, my brother cleans your house. What do you really need? ( My 30 year old brother lives with her)\n\nMother: (screams)Fine, don't go!  You are an ungrateful son.( Hangs up).\n\n\nSo here is the kicker. I feel like I am between a rock and a hard place as I understand that my father is in the hospital. I really want to be with him but due to being so short on money and the trip is so long it makes it hard to be with him.\n\nSo, AITA here? \n\n\nTLDR: Dad is in the hospital, can't visit as often or stay as much as my mother wants due to money issues, responsabilities and a long distance between my workplace and the hospital. Mom calls me ungrateful when i say I can't stay as much as she wants.",

      "description": "I have a really big cottonwood tree in my yard that is right over my neighbor's garage and recently had a branch fall through my fence. This thing is dangerous and needs to go.\n\nI had several estimates and they ranged from $4500 to $6000 for the one tree. I also have some other smaller trees that were dead and I wanted removed but planned to do it myself.\n\nI thought I lucked out and found a company that would cut down the big cottonwood and my 'non priority trees' for $3600. I was pumped and immediately told them I was interested. In the conversation I had mentioned that the job would need a crane.\n\nThey arrive a few days later with a lift truck and a crew of guys. This is the first time the owner had seen the tree and informs me he'll need another $500. Bringing the total to $4100. I was annoyed, but still $400 cheaper than the next offer and I wasn't going to have to cut the other trees down myself.\n\nThey started by cutting down the smaller trees.  Then I got a text message from the owner asking me to come outside.\n\nHe Informed me that the big tree has a split in it that he hadn't seen and it would be dangerous to cut and that it would be a gamble trying to not destroy my neighbor's garage in the process. He explained that if he touches that tree and it goes through the garage his insurance would cover it but he'd lose his business. He tells me he can't cut the tree and it would require someone with a crane.\n\nI told him that I had told his estimator that it would need a crane and he tells me that his company never uses them. \n\n\"Why did you take the job then?\" I say.\n\nHe says that it was his mistake and he's sorry but he can't do it. At this point my yard is a total mess of tree debris and they've been working for a couple hours cutting trees I could have done myself.\n\nI realized that I'd now have to pay $4500 to someone else to get this dangerous tree gone and told the owner that if they couldn't remove it that I wouldn't be paying them anything. He's the expert and it's not my fault he botched his bid. They had already upped me $500 and now I was going to have to go up another $400 with someone else.\n\nHe was upset but we both calmly discussed it and he agreed it was his fault and he knew the other trees weren't a priority. I wouldn't have called them if it weren't for the big one they were walking away from.\n\nHe understood but also told me he rented the lift for 3 days for this job specifically for $1100 and would also still need to pay his guys. \n\nHe explained that they had 100% 5 star reviews on Google and he said he'd rather take non payment than have me trash them online. They stayed another 5 hours cleaning everything up meticulously and when they were done came to the door to apologize a second time.\n\nI felt terrible because they busted their ass in cold weather doing dangerous work. I told him the least I could do was give him 5 stars which my wife and I both did.\n\nIt's been a few days and I still feel bad about it. AITA.",

Upon his request, I promised not to bring \"E\" over to the apartment because O hates E over old high school drama. \nE has been a close friend of mine for 2.5 years. To cut a rant short, I believe he's a good person and I choose to keep him in my life. O has never tried to stop me from having this private friendship. \nE lives with an insufferable, abusive father. I hate visiting over there, 2 hours away. I wanted to have E over at my home instead. \nOn a weekend when O was out of town, I had E over to the apartment. At the time, I was looking more at the logistics of the situation. E was nowhere near any of O's belongings and stayed primarily in my room, which is not shared space. They didn't see each other and didn't exchange a single word. E ate only my food, and O wasn't home. \nBut O only cares that I broke the promise. Once I came to that realization, I drafted and sent a lengthy apology to O that included my thinking and the realization that this was about trust and not logistics. \nA few small in-person confrontations and a talk with O haven't improved things. He told me we're friends, but he's unfriended me on social media and hasn't talked to me in weeks. We adopted two cats together and now I'm the only parent they have, taking care of them alone. Our kitten misses him and cries outside his closed door every time O ignores him. \nI was the asshole, but this is my first offense in our 4 year friendship. Is it reasonable to expect he work with me through a problem instead of throwing 'us' away? Who is the asshole after the fact? \n\nTl;dr: I screwed up a month ago and now my 4yr best friend seems ready to end it all over the first offense.

      "description": "Last night around 9-10pm I went for a walk and came across an incredibly friendly, but possibly stray, cat. The cat was young, very affectionate and pretty fat, with no collar. But despite being short haired, it had a big patch (the size of a couple of fingers) of matted fur (solid like a dreadlock) on its back near the base of its tail. Possibly worth mentioning is that I was able to touch the matted fur and move it about, so I know that it was definitely matted fur and I doubt I would have had difficulty removing the matted patch if i had scissors etc with me.\n\nI petted it as I left for my walk and then came across it again on my way back around 10pm. It wa as few houses down from where I was initially, so I stopped, petted it and had another look at it to see if it was ok. It then followed me as I walked past another few houses and then I lost sight of it.\n\nThe cat seemed to belong to someone because of how fat it was and how friendly it was, but my feeling is that if the cat was outside that late at night, without a collar and it’s hair was clearly matted, then maybe I should have brought it home and taken it to a vet to look for a microchip and have the matted hair clipped?\n\nI’M really not sure what was the right call in that situation, but I’m feeling kind of guilty that I didn’t get the kitty some help, so AITA?\n",

Good god this is way longer than anticipated, whoops:\n\nI've been good friends with this person for a little over a year now. We met at new employee orientation. Soon after, we decided to start carpooling to work, as we both live in the same city that's about 50 min from work. We decided that I would do all of the driving, and she would pay for my gas. The idea was that she'd pay for \\*all\\* of the gas I used for our commute, rather than us splitting it, because I was the one going out of my way to pick her up and drop her off every day, putting miles on my car, etc. This was not ideal, because her job often prevents her from being able to leave work on time. I work in an office setting, and can leave as soon as my eight hours are up, but she has to stay at least 8.5 hours a day, and is often here for upwards of 9 or 9.5. \n\nI should mention that I've really never felt that we were super compatible as friends. She is very direct and expects open communication about everything, while I'm much more reserved and find it difficult to convey what I'm feeling in certain situations. She has no problem asking for what she wants, while I'm a huge pushover and find it hard to assert my own feelings. This has led to several huge fights during which we basically just screamed at each other the whole time about how the other person didn't understand where we were coming from. It's been very frustrating for both of us. \n\nThis was obviously amplified by the fact that we were spending 2 hours together in a car every day. After about a year of doing this, I was feeling a little taken advantage of since I was the one going out of my way/spending unnecessary time at work to carpool, but I also recognize that this is my fault for agreeing to it in the first place. Anyways, in October, I texted her basically saying that I didn't feel like carpooling made sense for me anymore and that I no longer wanted to do it. She was pretty annoyed by this, but it wasn't a \\*huge\\* deal, and she hasn't really brought it up since we stopped.\n\nAnother thing that I have often done for her in the past is watch her dog while she's away. I dog sit as a side job, but have always watched her dog for free. [I actually posted about it here recently.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aayaac/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_friend_always/) As I said in that post, this has been nagging at me for a while, but I felt bad bringing it up because it feels shitty to ask friends for money. In addition to the dog sitting, she also used my apartment as a delivery address for her packages for a long time, because she didn't want them getting stolen from her doorstep. I agreed to this when we carpooled since I saw her daily and could easily get them from her, but once we stopped carpooling, she always asked me to go out of my way to meet up with her and hand off the packages. Finally, a small cherry on top, she uses my Spotify and Netflix. \n\nFast forward to now. Whether or not I'm justified in feeling taken advantage of for all of those reasons (still not sure if it's totally justified or if I'm just being selfish honestly) the fact is, I do feel taken advantage of. I've been watching her dog this week, and this feeling has REALLY been weighing on me. I'm just so annoyed by the fact that I've been pushed around for so long, and it's only compounded by the fact that I have to watch her dog for a week (which sucks because he has multiple accidents in my apartment every day, requires a lot of walks and it's cold as fuck right now, is very needy in general, and has to be given Prozac every night, which is not easy to get him to swallow) for free. \n\nSo today, I decided to finally talk her about it. In retrospect, yes, I probably should've waited until she got back in town, because I feel like I've kind of ruined her trip now. But I felt like I couldn't take it anymore. So I explained to her that in the future, I'd like to be paid for watching the dog. I thought it was a pretty benign text, I didn't accuse her of anything or say \"wow your dog sucks pay me next time thanks\". Enter her bitching me the fuck out. In summary, her text said something like \"I mean I always get you snacks or take you out to breakfast afterwards (note: she has never taken me out to breakfast). Does that not feel sufficient? We are friends, so I figured it didn't need a formal arrangement in the way a stranger pays you to watch a dog.\" And then she went on to accuse my boyfriend of being the one who was convincing me to say all of these things to her, because it \"doesn't sound like the way \\[I\\] would approach this\".\n\nWe're still going back and forth with long texts, but the main takeaways are that...\n\na) she's offended that I said I feel taken advantage of, \n\nb) is super pissed at me for bringing this up while she was on her trip rather than saying something earlier or waiting until she got back, \n\nc) thinks that the way I went about this (and the carpool situation) was abrasive and mean, \n\nd) feels that I've made no effort to initiate plans with her since I started dating my boyfriend (which is true, because I've been feeling this disconnect for a long time), \n\ne) claims that my boyfriend isn't just encouraging me to speak up for myself, but encouraging me to \"go over the top\" with my opinions (what?), and \n\nf) now she knows that watching her dog, who she \"considered to be family to me\", is \"all about money and a job\". \n\nSo I basically apologized to her and said that I don't know that we're compatible as friends. I'm feeling very ambiguous about how this whole thing went down, which is why I'm asking for your help. I know that I should've made my feelings clear to her long ago, and I feel bad for that, but I can't change what didn't happen, and I'm trying to be better about asserting myself now. I'm still not sure if I'm being selfish, or if she's just talking me into feeling like I'm in the wrong, which she always does. I guess it's just hard for me to identify the difference between someone rightfully being upset because I did something wrong, and someone trying to make me feel bad simply because they're angry.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should I feel bad for what I did? Am I doing the right thing by ending this friendship? Other thoughts? I really appreciate your feedback, I'm sorry this is soooo incredibly long.\n\nTL;DR: I asked my friend to pay me for dog sitting in the future, and she's now calling me greedy and trying to tell me that my boyfriend is encouraging me to be \"over the top\" about expressing my opinions.",

      "title": "AITA for encouraging my fiancé to begin introducing food to his children that their mother believes they are sensitive to and not tell her? (Long, involved, and filled with medical stuff)",
      "description": "*This part is kind of a tirade, but I think it's important to give context. Skip if you like*\n\nTo begin this, I am a big proponent in the scientific method and a believer in the findings of the scientific community. My father is a surgeon and my mother is a nurse, so I was ingrained to believe in medical science and have developed a lack of respect for people that don't. The mother is an antivaxxer and takes her children to chiropractors and naturopaths in lieu of licensed medical doctors. She also refers to people with doctorate degrees in homeopathic and naturopathic medicines from unaccredited, often online, institutions as doctors, which I know is to attempt to give their opinions more authority and find absolutely insulting to people that have undergone doctoral programs that are recognized and scrutinized by the educational community. She also believes that any questions brought up about these findings and opinions are an aggressive attack on her as a mother and a person and uses it as an excuse to be an aggressive and noncommunicative co-parent.\n\nThis is all to say that I highly question any medical decisions and opinions that she has to bring to the table when discussing the health and wellbeing of the children. This is also to admit that I have very strong feelings of distrust and disrespect for her as a person and this could easily lead me to justify my own immoral actions.\n\nAnother side note: the fiancé has a tendency to agree with me. He says it's because I put a lot of thought and research into my opinions and ideas, but I know for a fact that he was like this with his ex, which is why the kids are in the dietary fiasco that they are in now in the first place. So his opinion on the matter is also...questionable...I consider him to be easily influencable in general.\n\nSo there is an 8 year old and a 4 year old. When the younger one was an infant, she had trouble keeping food down. They tried a lot of things and eventually the mom, on advice from her chiropractor, took her children to an unlicensed person who drew their blood and determined they had a litany of food sensitivities. This includes, but is not limited to: dairy, eggs, gluten, soy, various nuts, etc. They were also told that they should both be staying under 10 grams of sugar a day. According to the father, they stopped giving them all of these foods for an extended period of time and the problems got better but didn't go away. They then reintroduced all of these foods at the same time for a couple of days and the problems got worse again, somehow proving that they were sensitive to all of these foods even though that, from my research, is not how proper food elimination testing is done. None of this was done with any research or supervision from anyone except the...unlicensed random person at the chiropractors office. For some reason, I'm skeptical.\n\nThe little one always complains about pain in her stomach and has trouble passing food. The mom consulted a naturopath (you can read about that in a previous post) that prescribed excessive amounts of vitamins. I was weary of the safety and efficacy of this treatment, so I encouraged my fiancé to take her to her pediatrician. Pediatrician said the vitamin supplements were safe for a short period of time but wouldn't actually likely help with digestive issues.\n\nShe then did a physical test on the daughter and found that she had significant fecal impaction. She gave us a list of foods to avoid, which were mostly the gluten alternatives that she had been eating to excess her whole life, and bananas and apple sauce. I believe the irony of this was lost on the mother. We were also told to give her more fiber and introduce her to flax oil and pure aloe vera juice. We were told that if she still has symptoms after a week, we would be referred to a gastrointerologist. We were given good advice on how to continue addressing her dietary problems and have been doing so ever since. She hasn't had problems since. \n\nThe mother reverted back to the original diet almost immediately, never talked to us about the diet changes or gave us health updates, never contacted the pediatrician about it, and tells the children more or less to ignore the youngest's dietary change suggestions. We know this because anytime we explain that the youngest should try her hardest to drink her special smoothie because the doctor says will help her tummy, or that she's had enough gluten free bread or rice today, they both tell us mommy says we're wrong.\n\nThis experience has given us as a couple the incentive to go ahead and do true elimination and reintroduction testing with the girls to figure out what and how much they can eat without it negatively effecting their health.\n\n*context/tirade over*\n\nThe girls have been 'diagnosed' with food sensitivities from questionable sources and with questionable methods. I believe that, with the help of a licensed dietician, we can come up with a strategy for food elimination/reintroduction that can determine if and what they are actually sensitive to. \n\nThe problem is that the mother is very certain that all of these sensitivities are valid and holds us to them militantly (not herself however. For some reason she doesn't seem upset with herself when she gives them 'allergens') Their diet is 'very important' to her and she talks about it all the time.\n\nTheir sensitivities are often times unreasonably difficult to stay away from (particularly with celebratory events that's have sugary cakes filled with gluten, dairy and eggs) and anytime they are aware of breaking their diet, we hear about their terrible digestive and emotional distress and how we're not being good enough at supervising their diet. But when they are unaware of breaking their diet, it's radiosilence from them and their mom. This leads us to believe that the best way to actually test their sensitivities is by not telling them or their mom when we give them something they've 'tested positive' for.\n\nI am concerned about the limitations of their diet on their physical and mental health, social habits, and overall life experiences. I'm also very concerned about their constant state of 'stomach disturbance' which seems to hit them fiercely when they're supposed to be doing things like cleaning their room, homework, or acknowledging their responsibility in a negative action. At best, I think they have been reinforced too heavily that their digestive health is constantly a problem and excuse for them. At worst, I fear they have misplaced blame for stomach disturbances from severe anxiety to dietary issues. For these reasons, I believe it's important to address this quickly and effectively before they are given more misplaced food issues.\n\nI can't shake the feeling that this could be viewed as using the kids like lab mice and deceiving their mom on something she clearly cares a lot about, even if that caring is objectively misplaced. I'm not even their stepmom yet and I already have so much influence over their life, which the mom absolutely hates. When she finds out that we did this, will her rage be justified? When she sees me as the bad guy, will she be right?\n\nReddit, does this make me an asshole?",

      "description": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome years ago my then 3 year old step-daughter accused my dad of touching her inappropriately.\n\nThis came completely out of nowhere as my dad has never acted suspiciously around kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife believed our daughter. My mum could not believe my dad would ever do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had some doubts of my own given my dad had only ever been a good kind honest father to me - but I buried them and decided it was better safe than sorry and stood by my wife. I agreed with her that my mum and dad would be cut out of both our kids lives - I had an infant biological son with her then (he's bigger now).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy extended family did not want to get direcltly involved and my wife took this as tacit support of my dad and while I forgave them for their path of least resistance, my wife did not. Again I agreed that my extended family (brothers, sister, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents) would also be cut off from the kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife insisted I cut them all off completely too, demanding I sever all contact with them myself. This caused several huge fights. We somehow held it together, however at this point I had not agreed to cut contact myself. Later that year my sister celebrated her birthday. My dad was away on work and I decided to attend. My wife kicked me out for a week because of this and I was only allowed back after agreeing never to see or speak to my family again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be honest and say I had no intention of permanently honoring this promise and communicated with my mum and other family members occasionally and made plans to see them even more occasionally whenever I felt I needed to.\n\nI have always been very close to my mum and have strong bonds with my sister cousins and grandparents as well.\n\nI was close to my dad too, altho now we are... estranged\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife feels that even though I have agreed to keep my family away from our kids, the fact that I had contact with them is a betrayal of our daughter. I can understand this but from my point of view I am protecting both my children by keeping somebody who may have abused my daughter away from her forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor info, we contacted the police as soon as my daughter made the accusation and they did a thourough investigation which went nowhere and the case has gone cold (they never close these cases)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy entire family cannot all be blind or enablers and all of them (dads and mums side) still love my dad and unanimously believe is innocent. My daughter had not ever made an accusation like that before and has not made one since and I do not believe the accusation was malicious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I know I am the asshole for lying to my wife.**\n\nBut am I the asshole for not wanting to personally sever ties with my entire extended family forever over this?",

      "description": "Before I act I want to get a feel if this is an asshole move or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother and mother had an extremely strained relationship. At 19 my brother went with his girlfriend and moved out where he joined the military, went to college, and eventually got a nice job far away as a software developer. I have stuck around with my mother. I went to college and got a software development job. Hard times happening.  My mother lost her job. She slipped and fell at home and is now living with chronic back pain that essentially left her bed ridden. Disability doesn't pay nearly as much. So taking care of bills, medications, groceries, rent an extra room, and shit put into quite bit of debt even after cutting my expenses extremely thin and getting a better job. I gave up my social life and good bit of my hobbies and free time. I want to pay down my debts and save up for retirement (28 and I got $0 ).\n\nI talk to him once every other month to see how things are doing. Things are doing extremely well for him and his wife. I go to his facebook and he shows off his expensive purchases (I know it's probably wrong for me to assume it's from his own money etc etc). He was showing off his 4K TV, new PC, pricey kitchen appliances, and Oculus Rift. It got me thinking. I am here struggling to take care of our mother. I wonder if it would be right to ask him fork over some money every month to cover expenses. I am talking about $200 a month which is realistically like 35% of expenses dedicated to my mother minus what is covered under disability. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* One side of me says: He obviously wants nothing to do with my mother. And if I really wanted to be out of the situation I should have left long ago when I had the chance. I would be an asshole to pop up out of the blue and start asking for money. It would ruin the positive relationship I have with him.\n* The other side of me says: Whether he likes it or not, she is his mother and he should chip in paying the expenses. A mere $200 a month isn't much and will go a decent way to cover expenses. If he doesn't want to help out even a little bit, he is the asshole for leaving me alone in this predicament. ",

      "description": "This is a super long story and my first post was removed for length. I’m condensing it so let me know if you need more info. \n\nI work for a chain company. There are two of us that, up until a month ago, were supervisors trying to get promoted to manager. I worked for one store and have been with the company less than 3 years. The other, Maria, worked at a near by store and has been with the company for almost 6. \n\nWe interviewed for our promotions on the same day, were given offer letters at the same event, started training on the same day, and today we got certified at the same time. We are also working under the same district manager. The only difference is that Maria is going into the normal “probationary period” all new managers go through. She will become the assistant manager to someone in our district. However, my old store needs a general manager. So I am skipping the probation and being given a store of my own. Knowing company history, Maria will most likely be benched for years before she gets a store. She is not happy about it and has expressed such to our boss.\n\nWe had a district meeting scheduled for after the certification today. I got there first. I want to make it clear to you that Maria was NOT THERE during the next part. \n\nMaria’s new manager brought her a congratulations gift. The manager tasked with helping me get settled in my store jokingly said “I didn’t care enough to get you something.” I laughed and said, “it’s fine. Im getting a store anyways. I don’t need flowers.” Apparently that was a huge mistake. Some of the other managers told me it was an extremely bitchy thing to say. \n\nHere’s my thing though: A) Maria was not there and I didn’t say it to her. I wasn’t even thinking about the fact that she won’t be getting a store. B) I’ve already been running my store since the vacancy opened. For 5 months they had me do everything without offering me a pay raise, training, or title change. Yes, Maria has seniority, but I fought tooth and nail for this and I’m just glad it’s finally over. Besides, frankly, I’m damn proud of myself and the work I’ve done to get here. \n\nSo am I the asshole? Should I have just kept my mouth shut? Or are the other managers exaggeration how bitchy I was?",

I have a quick story that just happened to me, please be aware that I am mobile so formatting might be sketchy. \n\nSome background- My family, (mother specifically) is a religious family. While, I myself am more of a less religious person (I still believe in God), she believes herself to be a prophphone? d speaker for God. Every night my mother would come into my room to pray and lets pick off from there. \n\nSo, normally I would just let her as she usually isn't there for long and doesn't touch any of my things however, this night I was extremely tired and just wanted to sleep. She comes in, as usually and prays but, when she leaves she left my bedroom door wide open letting light and her while she walks arouns praying in. I get up to shut the door and she stops me from doing so. She demands to have the door open and I try to explain I just want to sleep but, she'll have none of that. She then, demands for ny phone if, I am going to close the door. I understandably say no, and she trys to wrestle my phone from my hands. \n\nMe, being stronger than, her easily pry it from her hands and she reacts by sitting in the hallway floor and calling a \"badperson\". My sister, who had been sleeping just seconds her opinion without asking what happened. \n\nSo, reddit AITA for trying to close my door and keep my phone",

      "description": "I’m a 19 year old girl. I live with my parents but I pay them rent, pay for my car, buy my own groceries, etc. I’ve been paying for all of my stuff for a while now too. My 25 year old brother lives here too and yet my parents treat him like a baby (buy his groceries, pay for his car repairs, etc).\n\nMy mom nickel and dimes me a lot. I work for her business and she’s very greedy with giving me work and paying me, and she’s very quick to take my money for rent and for my phone. Sometimes I’ll have a really light work week and I’ll ask if she can take my money next week, and she always refuses. Sometimes I won’t be able to buy groceries because she’ll take the money I owe her monthly before the month is even up. She’ll scream at me when I ask her to wait until the week later (which is usually when the money should ACTUALLY be due). \n\nAnyways, my parents really needed to pay their mortgage. They’re pretty broke but live a very luxury lifestyle. I don’t feel bad for them because they’re awful with finances and don’t prioritize. I work 2 jobs and am saving, but I decided to offer to lend them the $2000 because I felt bad. My mom was overjoyed and I felt good about it. \n\nYeah well, now this has become a common occurrence. They ask me to lend them money all the time. I’ve said no before and they’ll ask again another time. I did it the first time because they hadn’t even asked, now they just demand it from me and are rude as fuck when I say no. I try to explain that they need to prioritize better and am told it’s “none of my business”, but it becomes my business when they ask for a handout every month. Not to mention, she’s very quick to take my money and has never helped me out when I need an extra week before paying. She’s very money hungry and curses me out whenever I don’t want to help out, or whenever I need more time for a bill. I’ve worked my ass off to have my savings and she uses it against me, saying I “have all this money sitting around”. I work 7 days a week, with 2 jobs, while also going to school full time. \nAlso my dad literally just doesn’t work. He sits on his ass all day but tells me my life is easy. \n\nAITA for not wanting to give them money anymore??",

Since I've started working there i've helped with paying rent and letting my mom borrow money when she needed a little more to last. Roughly i pay about 300-400 every month to help her out. \n\nOnce I turned 18 back in December I decided to start becoming a bit more independent. I got a pay raise. I started looking into my own Insurance plan starting up this month finally, looking at getting an apartment this summer with my friend, etc. etc.\n\nI've started going out of town to see friends from school more and my mom took issue with it since I no longer ask to go, but instead tell her im going out of town for the weekend, going to do stuff without asking first in general. The car I drive is technically in her name still but I am the main carer for it, i get the gas, use it for work, and have put over $800 into it to fix issues its had over the last year. \n\nShe also works full time so oftentimes, we don't have anything ready for dinner, on these nights we just make whatever we want to eat and call it a night. I usually go get something cheap to eat and will ask my younger brother if he wants anything and usually its just something small. My mom takes offense that I don't ask her, despite that we both no she refuses to let me get her anything in the first place. \n\nAITA for starting to become less dependent on her for everything? I still love her and she has been a great mom but I feel like i've earned my independence. ",

      "description": "Let me explain. Also, this is my first reddit post EVER so I’m sorry if I’m sloppy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up, I was never a bad kid. I was just a normal kid. Spoke too loud, ran too much, a little spoiled, but I was never BAD. I never threw temper tantrums/ hit anyone/ broke things. However, my parents, especially my father, would be angry with me all the time. He would whip me if I locked doors/ walked on grass/ traced a stencil using the sunlight on a window. And he was quick to say to me and my sibling “you better cut that shit out or I’m going to send you to bootcamp.” He also mistreated my childhood dog if he needed to lash out and we didn’t do anything “wrong.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward, I moved out to dorm at college, and I began to forgive my parents for what I went through as a child. I told myself they were immigrants and that’s all they knew. But then, something bothered me more than usual. I started bringing ( serious ) boyfriends home and my dad would hurt my dog in front of them. It was so embarrassing and cruel. I flipped out and cursed at him, calling him an asshole and such and so forth. And on top of that, I found out he had 4+ kids with his late girlfriend before he met my mom and just abandoned them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths afterwards, we found out he had stage 4 cancer. I forced myself to forgive him AGAIN so we can support him through his treatments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFamily dynamics were getting better when he had cancer because we all had a fight worth fighting. My parents were on the brink of divorce but still living together because my dad always convinced my mom to stay. They were both shitty in their own ways may I add. Anyways, we started having dinners together and sharing jokes, etc. I was happy, ironically. The cancer somehow brought the family together.  I would drive hours to drop him off and pick him up for treatments and I would ALWAYS pray and check up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then the other night my mom texted me a picture of my dad’s girlfriend’s post on FB.  I didn’t know how to react. I was mad and sad. She confronted him and they agreed to a divorce. Then last night, he was calling this woman from across the world until 2am on speaker and my mom ( who sleeps in a separate room ) knocked and said, “can you not talk on speaker?” He said straight to her face “we’re not together, why does it matter.” The woman only the phone asked who’s that and what’s that and my dad said “oh it’s nothing.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was just so disrespectful to me and my mom. I don’t know how he can go cheat when has has a family AND A NEWBORN supporting him through his cancer. And why he tried to cling on to the marriage only to cheat. I just want to cut him off and never see his face again because he abandoned those 4+ kids before me,  and now he’s abandoning us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to cut him off even though he has cancer? I don't want him to die being hated, but if I had cancer, I would enjoy the time w MY FAMILY not some random.. ",

      "description": "So this is my first post on here, So let me start with 2 years a ago I met girl I really thought was beautiful and really kind, Well so I start talking to her and become her friend and everything is great and all for 1 year and I liked this girl of course but she saw me as just a friend. Okie so let get into the details She loved this KPOP band called BTS and I didn’t mind I actually liked some of their song but this girl didn’t just love the bad a folder with 10000 photos of them mainly this guy named tae, Well she would constantly send 100/70 something photos In 1hour and at first I didn’t mind at all but she begun to only talk about that and didn’t seem to care about my traits/interests but I didn’t care, she was still a hella good friend. (Ok so let me say this I have massive anxiety and went homeschooled cause of it so I don’t have many friends) and she knew this of course, So are conversation normally went like this\n\nMe: Hey, hru\n\nHer:(4hours later)HI, I’m good. You?\n“Sends me like 10 photos of bts”\n\nMe:(10 minutes later) I’m good, Thanks\n\nHer:lol(12 hours later)\n\nThen most of the time she wouldn’t respond for another 4hours so usually I could never start a conversation so one day I asked her to stop spamming me with Korean guys and she would like act like she knew them and stuff, so she stops completely and that sounds good but in reality it wasn’t cause then she wouldn’t respond for 6/7 hours at a time, so I told her she could send it just not a lot so a time passes and I want to hang out with her but she says her dad won’t let her even though I have a gay personality(not gay I just don’t act boyish) well anyway that was lie because she was allowed to go hang out with guys at night all the time so I didn’t understand why I couldn’t hang out with her on Saturday at the movies with other people:( but anyways time passes and she still makes the same excuse so slowly stop talking to her cause it fault like a one sided friendship and I fault like I was just emotional support  and so I confronted her about it andddd she blocked me(lastly she was really defensive of bts so like she would ignore me for days if I did wanna listen to one of their song",

      "description": "The incident happened Friday night, but I'm going to pre face this by telling how I ended up at this jam session. I dont post much on reddit, so I will try to format for easy reading.\n\nA couple months back I was letting my son play at a church playground. When we pulled in I noticed a older gentleman sitting on the bench, but I thought nothing of it since service didnt start for a couple more hours.\n\nThis man and I had been talking for awhile and we get on the subject of playing guitar. I tell him that I'm self taught and would like to find a group to listen to / follow along with to learn. He tells me about a little get together they have on friday nights at a church, encourages me to come check it out and to bring along my family.\n\nFast forward to this Friday and I'm hyped about it. I walk in with my wife and child and I start to feel like maybe we are a little out of place. There was about 10 -15 people there with instruments and around 30 more people in the crowd. All of the guitars looked almost identical, with blonde tybe bodies and here I am with a midnight edition esteban I had gotten from my mamaw when my papaw .\n\nI sat down on the seats lining the wall near a couple other pickers and they introduced themselves. I explained how I don't feel I'm a very strong guitar player and that I was just there to try and follow along. That's when they asked a question I hadn't prepared for,  \"Well, Do you sing? \"\n\nI laughed it off and began to loosen up and the man asked again overvthe mic after he led a song. He said, \" Your a new picker in here with us, I'd really like for you to sing us a song and Jeff and I will play with you! \" I stood up and asked if they knew the song Wagon Wheel from Old Crow Medicine Show and they began to smile and gesture me towards them. \n\nNow Reddit, I only sing when I play because none of my friends I usually play with will. I definitely had never sung at a function like this but I was feeling great because I have practiced this song alot.\n\nI'm up there and i start singing a little out of time but by the end of the first verse  me and these two fellas are getting it together. I'm staring kind of cross eyed at the mic to keep from looking at the crowd but I can see a few in the front swaying back and forth and I can hear them clapping. We finish the song and when I sat back down the man I was sitting beside told me thats something I should do more often.\n\nI was feeling great about myself and my guitar playing until we left, and this isvthe part that makes me feel like an asshole, my wife mentions that when I got done an older woman made the comment that was NOT the type of place for that song and a man beside of her asked her what was so bad about it .\n\nAm I the asshole ?  My son is wanting to go again next week but I'm really having second thoughts about it. I'm sorry this is a long post . ask questions if you want, ill answer!",

I (22 F) also suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts and ideation, so I understand what he’s going through. A few weeks after we started dating, he had a pretty bad depressive episode, and I offered that he come over so he can get out of his house and away from his family for the day.\n\nHe told me what had been bothering him that day. I listened to him, and I said “I’m sorry.” He got angry at me for saying that, telling me that I was making it about me. He said some verbally abusive things, and by the end of the night, he was still yelling at me and I was in tears at that point. He left my house and didn’t talk to me for days after until he came back as if nothing happened. I was still very much upset.\n\nNow, because I don’t want to deal with the verbal abuse, when he days he’s depressed or suicidal, I make myself distant. I don’t engage in conversation with him about that topic anymore, and when he does, I don’t offer any advice. I leave it open ended, because I’m still very much upset. Am I the asshole for not wanting to deal with his anger?",

I expressed my desire to compete in the couples' category to my mentor, and she asked me if I'd already thought of a partner and if I wanted them to be male or female. I didn't even think of this detail because I assumed she would just assign a female partner to me. But she asked me and I figured it would be cool to have a male partner. I chose one, he agreed and we've been practicing for about 2 weeks.\n\nHere's the thing. My dance partner is gay and I'm gay and I have a boyfriend (together for 1.5 years). My boyfriend didn't seem too worried about this, however, my best friend was appalled when she heard I was DANCING with another MAN several times a week. She told me I was an asshole for actually choosing to have a male partner when given the choice. If I was assigned a male partner, then fine, but according to her, choosing a male partner is unacceptable, shitty-boyfriend-behavior. She is also convinced that my boyfriend is pretending to be cool about it because in her opinion he is \"too cool about it\", so she has *casually* started asking him *subtle* questions about it. He usually just jokingly changes the topic.\n\nI'm starting to get paranoid because 1.5 years isn't that long and even though I think I know my boyfriend well, I guess there is a chance he's pretending to not mind.

      "description": "So I’m in a weird spot right now. My girl and I are going through a lot in our relationship, so right now we basically split finances. She gives me her share (which is like $300 a month) while I pay the vast majority of all the bills; rent, car note, utilities, groceries, rent-to-own stuff. While she handles the phone bill, that’s all. Whatever extra money she has she basically gives to her mom.\n\nHer mom hasn’t had a job in over a year since she lost her dad. I understand grief. I’ve lost many people close in my life, earlier this year I lost my father in January. Anyway, my point is I understand not wanting to work and having depression. I have dysthymia. On top of PTSD, OCD and anxiety. \n\nRegardless, all our extra money goes to her mom in the end; $10 here for a Lyft, $40 here for groceries, $12 for another Lyft. All of that adds up. My hours just got cut because I’m attending college so my paychecks have been smaller than normal, luckily taxes and tuition have helped out for the past couple months.\n\nAnyway, today was the final straw. I left my phone on the table after her mom called this morning asking for $12. Well I left my phone on the table to take my dog out, and just found out that she went into my phone and into my bank account and transferred herself $12.50 to give to her mom. \n\nI told her I’m done today. She has yet to reply. That supporting her family isn’t feasible anymore when we can hardly support ourselves. I feel like an asshole because her 16 year old sister lives with her mom and I don’t want her sister to suffer. But at the end of the day, am I supposed to be nickel and dimed because her mom won’t get a job? ",

      "description": "So I knew this one person, and they were incredibly clingy to me. I thought they were fine at first, but eventually, all they would do is complain about their problems. Every time I would be around them, they would just sit down and sigh, and stare at the ground until I talked to them. And once I talked to them, they would just warp the conversation into complaining about some part of their life. I would try and be friendly, and give them advice, but no matter what they never even came close to trying to fix any of their life issues. They would shrug off any help I tried to give them, and then rant about the same thing the next week. They didn’t want help, they wanted attention. Talking with them was not only frustrating, but pointless. Eventually I decided to text them less and less, and essentially slowly ended our “friendship”.

      "description": "This happened about a year ago but it still weighs on my conscience and now that I've been asked if we can put it behind us I want to know where I stand morally.\n\nAt a family event, a distant relative's kid(10 yrs old) was saying that her new step dad was always swearing at her. She also said that she was pushed up against a wall and told that she wasn't wanted (all with a semi smile / semi concerned look). The mother and the rest of the family was there and no one really batted an eye. The step dad wasn't there. On top of this, I heard the mother say in front of the kid that \"you were great until you started talking\", \"go away\", \"I don't want you here\". \n\nI admit the kid is known to be annoying but apparently at school they are very well behaved. It's only at home that they behave 'like this'. \n\nAs all of this was happening I was getting angrier and angrier. I realised that if I didn't leave I was going to say something. I got up and quickly grabbed my things to leave, but on the way out the mother looked offended and shocked and asked if she did something. I snapped and said that what she is doing is abuse, that the kid is being abused. It sort of exploded after that (she kept on screaming that since I'm not a parent I have no right to say anything) but I think I just dissociated and stood there still and crying. I left once a family member ushed me out because I certainly wasn't able to do anything on my own.\n\nSo reddit, AITA? Should I just have said nothing? Am I the asshole for just trying to leave? \nThanks.",

He is almost 4 years old and was always allowed on all the furniture since my partner got him as a puppy. But now that we live together it is my bed, too (they moved in with me). The dog just takes up a lot of space and I just never liked anyone touching me when I want to sleep. He also leaves a bunch of hair on the blankets and I gotta washed the sheets every other day because he leaves stains from licking his butt. Also him jumping on the bed, wanting to cuddle or play ruined the mood more than once. \n\nSo, I want to teach the dog not to go on the bed anymore, but he is so used to it, of course he doesn't understand why the change. He absolutely hates not sleeping with us and gets mad. So he would just whine at night until my partner would let him under the blanket.  I said he will never learn if you keep giving in, but I understand him not wanting to be annoyed at night. He feels bad for sending him to his dog bed and likes having him to cuddle.\n\nAITA? Is it to late to change this habit anyway and I should just give in or do you think its reasonable?",

My class consisted of 20 people, 5 guys and 15 girls. So basically there was this girl in my class that often left school early complaining of period pains. She would simply get up, pack her bags and waltz straight out the door saying she had period pains. The teachers normally did not stop her but if they did she would glare at them until they let her go.\n\nSo, me being a young man, decided to complain to my friends, a group of girls, about how she was faking it and skipping school. They didn’t have none of my shit and proceeded to criticize me about not understanding how a girls body works, how period pains were the worst feeling in the world and how insensitive I was.\n\nAll I wanted was to make a light joke and voice my annoyance about how my classmate could simply skip school by saying she had period pains but I guess nobody else thought it was as funny as i did.",

      "description": "(Forgive for formatting, am on mobile) So a little back story, this girl has been my friend all through high school, we are both now 18, and we have helped each other through bad moments in our mental health, and we were each other’s only friend for a long time. \n\nHowever, this year our friendship became kind of rocky and we argued constantly about small and ultimately unimportant things. Usually she would get annoyed and I would feel like I had to defend whatever it was she was attacking. It got worse over time; never to the point where we were hurting each other, but it got old and to the point where I didn’t look forward to being with her as much. One day I even asked her, “why do you hang out with me if I annoy you so much?” She replied with a simple “I don’t know”, and moved on. \n\nHowever, a few months into this school year I met one of her friends and we really hit it off, we hung out all the time, and we got decently close, I never cut off contact with friend A, but it diminished significantly. Over time we stopped talking and I heard from one of her friends that she was hurt. But I never contacted her. Then one night she texted me saying she hated me, and to never talk to her again. Asking how I could have dropped her after everything we had been through, how she never stopped caring for me and that I obviously didn’t care about her. \n\n I feel like an asshole for cutting her off, and I should have talked to her, but I just wish she would have acted like she knew why she was my friend in the first place. \n\n— I know this might not seem like the biggest deal, but it’s been weighing on my conscious ever since she said that.

      "description": "I'm a recent graduate in a unique field. Recently I was flown out by a company via standby travel for an interview. I go to the job interview and botch it. So I leave and go the airport hoping to get on an earlier flight  (an interviewer told me the flights were full the next few days to my destination and  they're flying me home standby). I get to the and don't make it on the flight since Im so low on priority (standby is a free ticket for airline employees as long as there are seats and prioity is based on seniority with the company) Since I don't work for the company I had the lowest priority. The last flight of the day comes and I didnt get on. So I called the rep from the company I interviewed with and they were nice enough to put me in a hotel for the night. Then they said if I don't get on the first flight tomorrow, call the company and they will \"figure something out because it's our responsibility to get you home\". \n\nThe next day I didn't get on the flight so I emailed and asked if there was anything they could do to help get me home. They respond and told me flights were pretty full for the next 3 days and advised me to buy a ticket. \n\nTickets are nearly 700 dollars but I didnt have much of a choice.\n\nSo I put the flight on my credit card and leave later that day. I had interviewed for another job a week before unsuccessfully so was feeling down. \n\nI get home and call my mentor from an internship wanting advice. I told him the situation and he called me (and the entire millennial generation) entitled. He said the company didn't owe me anything.\n\nThen he goes to reference my internship. \n\nAt the end of the internship my performance was reviewed on a scale of 1-5. During my evaluation, I was given all 4s. So I ask what it would have taken to get 5s and they said I would have had to rescue the CEO's wife from a burning building. I laugh and say ok. \n\nBack to the phone call. My mentor references me asking that in my evaluation and says that I am entitled cause I thought I deserved 5s and that if I didn't change that mindset I would stay the \"loser\" that I am right now (after not getting the two jobs) and that he wants me to be a winner. \n\nI later say that I'll be in his area soon to visit a nearby military base to \"see if it is a good fit\" (if I were to join I would be spending 10+ years with the people at the base so I thought this was fair to say). He responded by saying that sounded ridiculous and just shows how entitled I am and that if I want it bad enough I should just make sure they like me. (He has no experience in this process) I thought that was obvious but there are other units around the country and each one has a unique culture and I'd like to join one that I like.\n\nHe ended the conversation by saying I need to stop thinking the world owed me something. \n\nNow, after all that, am I the entitled asshole?

We have been married a year and a half. \n\nOur relationship is normally very loving, he is my best friend. I had some mental health issues before we got married, (depression, anxiety) but I am now pretty damn solid on that front after almost three years of therapy. However, we have an issue I don't know how to resolve. \n\nIf I get upset about something, angry or sad, he tunes me out until I get over it. Like, I handle that shit on my own. Sometimes this means I'm crying my eyes out or fuming and he's in bed, or in the next room, ignoring me. I've told him multiple times that I feel really lonely and uncared for in these times. I am an emotional person, but not irrational, ie; I don't pick fights or cry for attention. \n\nHe usually has a reason he isn't talking to me. \"I thought you could use the space,\" \"it's too late at night, I don't feel like talking,\" \"as far as I'm concerned the issue is resolved, why do we have to keep discussing it?.\" If I was sad before, now I'm pissed. That's how I rank? It's too late in the evening to patch up after a fight? I'm talking and he's on Reddit or watching TV--no eye contact, no verbalization. \n\nIts frustrating because it's the same 3-4 things that hurt my feelings/make me mad and he refuses to work on them with me. I feel like if I was as important as he says I am, he wouldn't be able to watch The Office instead of trying to make me feel better....\n\nIs that ridiculous? Is being lonely just a part of this? Am I being an asshole for expecting him to prioritize my happiness?\n\nTldr: husband basically shuts off when I have \"unpleasant\" emotions. I feel incredibly lonely.",

      "description": "So I'd started seeing this guy semi-seriously. And then this happened. I'm trying to figure out if I'm the asshole here for ending this relationship based on his reaction to 2 things\n\n1. I happened to mention that me and my roommates had needed to go to a food bank this month because we had some unexpected expenses and were left a little short.  His reaction was \"I'm worried about your ability to financially take care of yourself, it sounds like I need to take control of your finances to make sure you're being safe\" \n\n2. I had a flare up of an existing mental health issue. I told him I may have to go to the hospital. Instead of responding with support I was told \"oh you just need a pacifier. The pharmacy can give you an emergency dose of Ativan you'll be fine\". \n\nIt just felt like I couldn't trust him to be there for me when I needed him. But am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "My wife and I have been together since college, married for \\~4 years now in a commitment ceremony. Found wheelchair-suitable housing last year and moved in together.\n\nThe obstacles to us becoming parents are:\n\n1. Financial. We split rent and utilities 70/30 every month. She works P/t at $10 an hour. I work F/T at $15.25. TL;DR - we absolutely could not afford her to stop working entirely AND the expense of a child. We'd be slowly going broke every month, at best.\n2. Medical. She was born with Spastic Cerebral Palsy and has a 50-50 chance of dying if she gets pregnant. None of her female friends have accepted her request for surrogacy. We REALLY don't want to hire one either, too many horror stories.\n3. Emotional/Mental. We both have...a fair few issues we're working through. Mostly childhood traumas on her end &amp; poor memory/ADHD on mine. We've achieved a stable but fragile state of harmony, but without giving out TMI I can pretty safely say that if the kid is anything short of a junior saint we're going to be at each other's throats.\n\nI have exhausted literally every higher-paying job I qualify for on several job search sites as of last month, to no avail. I've thrown out or donated 80% of my electronic gear and most of my old hobbies to make more room in our apartment. We went to couples counseling (which helped) and I've tried to help her keep in touch with her friends.\n\nMeanwhile, for the past few years she's been constantly back-and-forth on the issue. At several points she's literally set a date to try for a child complete with Fun Times, we've bought tests and commiserated when they came back negative. She has also (supposedly) picked boy and girl names out already and talked to adoption agencies.\n\nYet nothing ever seems to come of the latter and she also takes her birth control pills every day without fail. Whenever I try to VERY GENTLY remind her \"pills = no baby\" or ask if there's been measurable progress on the adoption process she either gets angry, deflects the issue, starts crying or all of the above. It's become a conversational landmine I can't even approach without risking a \"boom\". Trying to approach the issue of children issue otherwise either ends inconclusively or in a minor-to-major meltdown, no matter HOW hard I try.\n\nAll this lead up to a conversation this morning where I tried to politely tell her that we needed to put this issue to bed. We're not getting any younger, higher income does not appear to be forthcoming, and I'm just plain tired of the stress of going back-and-forth on this issue for going on half a decade. I love you honey, I'm not going anywhere, let's hug on this and let it go.\n\n...suffice it to say that her meltdown rivalled Chernobyl and Fukashima put together.\n\nBetween tears she accused me of \"not liking kids\", of making a big decision without her, and a dozen other things. \n\nAm I really a monster for saying I'd like to put this issue to rest rather than have it lurking in the closet?",

It was clar from how he spokr about her and i thought it was really nice that he finally found someone to fancy. But a couple of weeks ago he said that he had asked her out but she had said no which was a bummer for him. So a couple of weeks goes and he said to me that he no longer have any feelings for her but i know him and i know that it was a lie. He wanted to have a party where I, his crush and a couple others were invited so I came and said hello to everyone and joined in on the party. And he introduced me to his crush and we started talking and we became fast friends but the next day after we slept over we started talking again and exchanged eachothers snapchats. So we started talking there now i did not mean to like her but it just happened and i started noticing that she were starting to like me too and later on today actually we ”confessed” to eachother that we you know ”like” eachother and that is where It is right now for the moment. I would want to know should I be shaking in self pity over this like i am ( and yes I know that confessing that you are shaking because of self pity is self pity) I’ve come here to reddit because here i should get an unbiased opinion how big of an asshole am I cause i do know that this is an asshole thing to do but i could’nt do anything about it.

      "description": "Hi, so a bit of background here.\nI'm gay, but I'm also a trans man, so I didn't have the exact same experiences as someone who knew they were a guy since birth. It took me a while to know my identity.\nSo perhaps I might be offensive accidentally to cis gay guys but it wouldn't have been my intention.\n\n\nThis post might be a bit stupid but I was wondering about this situation.\n\n\nA few days ago I was browsing the Internet and I made \"joke\" that a guy must be in the closet.\nIt was regarding a post made by a guy on social media. The person said he wouldn't have sex with a girl if she was wearing mismatched underwear (yeah...).\n\nMy joke was careless, I commented quickly without thinking. \n\nA few minutes later, a woman who isn't LGBTQ said that I was being offensive towards gay people and that not all of them are misogynistic, etc.\n\nI wasn't trying to imply that at all and I  replied that I wasn't trying to be rude and that I am actually LGBT.\nI also explained that there are a lot of \"straight\" men who actually prowl queer dating apps asking for brojobs and they are all afraid of being seen there. Some of these men are misogynistic. My joke wasn't exactly about this, but it was close. Again, it was a careless, quick and stupid comment.\n\n\nBut again, I wasn't trying to imply that gay men are misogynistic, and I would have no reason to do that.\n\n\nShe then said that having a different sexual orientation doesn't excuse the person of being an asshole, which I agree with, though this might also have been a jab at me.\n\n\nI ended up apologising and removing the offensive part of my initial comment, but my conscience is still heavy and I actually felt so bad as to have a nightmare lol.\n\n\nIn hindsight, I should have written more elaborate responses from the start.\n\n\nAt the same time I really wonder if she wasn't overreacting.\nI see straight people making the same joke as I did and I never saw anyone getting angry. I never found that bad either.\n\nSince she was an outsider, I'm not sure if she really understood me and I don't think she had to right to say what is offensive or not.\nAfter all, when you're part of a \"subculture\", sometimes you can make jokes that would normally be strange to an outsider, or criticise certain behaviours from the very group you belong to.\nThere is such a thing as \"N-Word Privileges\".\nI'm also part of other marginalised groups and sometimes I see outsiders trying to speak for us.\n\n \nThere is a trope called \"Offending The Creator's Own\" and I feel like it's my exact situation. I also asked another gay friend and he said that I wasn't being homophobic or anything of the sort. My mother told me to just tell the lady to fuck off.\n\n\nI try my best not to be prejudiced even towards my own, but it could happen, and I will always apologise and try to change if it does.\n\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Background:\n\nWe moved abroad. Supposedly, I already had a job contract. We sold everything in our home country and moved. When we got here, the contract had irregularities that made it impossible for me to get a work visa and, therefore, my wife was unable to get a residence card.\n\nWe had no way of going back, not atleast without being literally homeless and jobless. Since my mother in law was living here, she took us in while we figured out a way of fixing this.\n\nWe have 3 kids.\n\nAbout 2 months passed and I managed to get some freelancing gigs. Moved out of my MIL after 6 months of being taken in. Ever since I've been doing freelancing work from home: 2 part-time jobs + translation + ocassinal full-time jobs (all this simultaneously and for the past 2 years). My wife, however, without her residence card can't work anywhere -- literally no-one will take her. She was forced to being a housewife, which I know she dreads.\n\nGiven my insane daily workload, I work on and off for about 10-11 hours a day.  \n\\- I wake up at 7am, prepare breakfast for the 3 kids, and lunches for 2 of them (the 3rd has her lunch provided by the school)  \n\\- At 8.30am I take the eldest 2 to their school. We don't have a car, yet, so we ride our bikes to school (900m ride, not bad).  \n\\- I then come back and pick up the youngest who has to be at school by 9am, also on my bike. I scavenger the job boards for freelancing gigs for 10-15 minutes before taking off.  \n\\- I come back and make breakfast for me and my wife, we have breakfast, watch a little TV in one of the few moments we have alone, chat a bit and by 10am I have to check in to my morning job.  \n\\- At 11.45am I go and pick up my youngest kid.  \n\\- At 1pm my wife picks up the eldest 2 (sometimes we switch with the one above)  \n\\- I take a small break to have lunch with the family and by 1.30pm ish I'm back at work  \n\\- I then make another break around 3pm to take the 3 kids to school again.  \n\\- I then come back and around 4pm I switch to my afternoon job  \n\\- 3 days a week I have to go pick the kids at 4.30pm and I'm back by 5pm  \n\\- I then work as non-stop as possible until 8pm (kids need attention and come chat with me, show me their drawings, I make afternoon snacks, put a movie, etc.)  \n\\- Most days I put the youngest to sleep at around 9pm  \n\\- If I have a freelancing gig I tend to go back to work as soon as the youngest falls asleep, up until 11pm or even 12 or 1am depending on the workload.\n\nI know. I work too much. But the thing is, I kind of need to since my wife can't work and we need to re-build our life here (we were literally sleeping on the floor the first month after we moved and have ever since purchased the stuff we need little by little) while we pay rent, utilities, food, clothes, extracurricular activities for my kids, etc., etc.\n\nEver since the very beginning of this situation, my wife has felt like shite for having to be a housewife (she used to work and even earn more than me, she had a good job and didn't foresee this situation). She still does most of the stuff at home.\n\nShe's always getting mad because I don't help her with the house as much as she would like. I understand she has a HUGE load on her end. But I have an equally big and stressful load on my end too.\n\nThis time, 50 minutes ago, she was triggered because she was playing games on my work PC (she has a laptop of her own but isn't as powerful as mine and games are unplayable) and I needed to call a customer. Even though I have been reminding her that I had this call schedule, when it was 5 minutes before the call, I reminded her again, and she gave me this look like \"here you come again being annoying\". I told her \"I know it sucks but I have to work\" and she looked at the clock and since it wasn't o'clock (the time of the call) she kept on playing. I told her, with an unfriendly tone \"Are you giving me a minute to prepare for the call or no?\". She flipped and started saying I was being an asshole and that I took the chance to treat her badly and whatnot. To which I replied \"I HAVE TO WORK because you can't\" in a shitty effort of trying to make her see my point... which failed miserably.\n\nShe got ultra mad, and to be honest, the fact that she is not capable of understanding that I DREAD having to work this much to make ends meet, drives me fucking insane, to the point in which I just tell her she can fuck off, and she tells me to fuck off back. To sum up, a completely and utterly shit situation.  \n\n\nAITA for thinking and telling her that even though the situation is far from ideal, she needs to come to terms with me being the only one who can work for now, while she takes care of most of the house stuff? This will end in about a year when we both can get our residence cards and she can finally work again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I am an asshole for getting mad and arguing about it, but I need to know if my thinking is wrong.  \n\n\nThanks.",

My team consisted of 1 student and 1 part time employee, who I want to call Lisa (33F).\n\nOur company has a HQ in one city and a subsidiary in another, about 100km away. There are about 25 people working in HQ and another 30 at the other location.\n\nA while ago I was told by a colleague that the general manager of our subsidiary, Rose (45ish, F), has been talking shit about members of the HQ team. Most notably, she has voiced her (partly legitimate) grievances about how the company is being run to her own employees. This supposedly got personal very fast around christmas when she outright started talking shit behind peoples back to her team. One of those things was her telling others that Lisa only had her job because her old supervisor thought she was hot. Verbatim it might've been something like \"because she is his whore\".\n\nNow, before I did anything, I approached Lisa and told her about this, and then after she agreed to it, we escalated the issue to management. What happened afterwards I don't know, because I left the company in the mean time (partly because of what the culture had become). \n\nNow, several weeks later, Lisa gave me a call and told me that she is really unhappy that I told her about what has been said about her and that it has negatively impacted her work life, because she has to see Rose semi-regularly and sometimes also interact with her directly and that is causing Lisa to feel a lot of bad things.\n\nI told her because I would want to be told this if it was me, especially before others are told about it in a formal process.\n\nYet, Lisa now told me that she wishes she'd never learned of this and blames me for having told her.\n\nThat leaves me to wonder: Am I the Asshole for making her aware of the lies that people are spreading about her?",

They always tell kids to tell their parents but they never really tell you, the parent, what to do. I called the school multiple times, my ex wife even threatened a law suit against them. They've still done really nothing, he's still in my son's chess class, still have the same P.E, still have the same lunch. Nothing.\n\nI kept telling him to defend himself but he won't listen to me or he thinks of some cute but ineffective insults. I wouldn't care if he cussed him out at that point. The kid ended up threatening to put hands on him and he did, my son ended up breaking him arm. The school still did absolutely nothing. \n\nI was completely over it and honestly wanted to beat up that kid myself. But, I taught my older son some self defense techniques like holding a combination lock in your hand while you punch, avoid grabbing, how to take someone to the ground, the usual stuff. Since his friends were also there, I taught them too. Then, when I was picking up my son. After, he told me what the kid looked like. I told my son and his friends to just get him. \n\nNow, my ex wife, is all pissy about it. She keeps saying that what I did was wrong and she's calling me a psychopath and all of these things. I know it's kinda morally wrong, but, is it really?\n\nNote: didn't want this to follow me so I made a throwaway account. ",

Overall my wife and I have adjusted really well to our lives as new parents. \n\nThe one issue is diaper changing. I have an embarrassingly week stomach. I told my wife before we even started trying for a baby that I can’t do diapers. I think she didn’t take me seriously or thought I would feel differently with my own kid. But I do not feel differently. Obviously I will change her if I am the only one around (which hasn’t really been the case yet because my wife hasn’t really spent any time away from the baby yet, which I get). It’s just not something I want to be a primary responsibility for me. \n\nFor context, my wife is an RN but she isn’t working right now. I work full time, so my wife takes on more of the household labor but I pitch in a lot too, especially because the baby has us both tired. I will do feedings and baths and all of that and I don’t mind any of it. And I love spending time with my daughter, of course. \n\nMy wife hasn’t made a huge fuss about it but she does make some passive aggressive remarks and “jokes” about the fact that I don’t change her. I don’t want this to become a point of resentment. But I also don’t think it’s that serious if this one task is delegated (almost) solely to her? \n\nAlright, judge away, I guess. \n",

We both have private medical insurance (We are in the UK so it's not mandatory to have insurance) with different companies and hers is up for renewal, when she was shopping around for quotes she got a quote for couples insurance from both my company and hers and it does work out cheaper. However we don't have joint finances or anything like that and I don't want to end up being the one that is paying for what essentially amounts to a luxury for us both, also I worry as its a 12 month contract so it'd cost money to break it if we split up. Now we've been together about 18 months and our relationship is solid but I just don't feel comfortable having joint insurance until we have joint finances down the line. She's fuming with me and says it's proof that I'm not committed to the relationship, AITA here? ",

My neighbors to the side of me (town home development) made a joke out of it last night, laughing at the fact that they have heard everything -- I was quite embarrassed.\n\n So this morning before leaving for work, I disabled the WiFi to my home - it just so happens the router is in my room which I locked.  I live in a residential area where the closest shopping center is about three miles away.  I felt a twinge of remorse as I got to work, but hopefully he'll learn a lesson.  \n\n",

      "description": "My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me a couple days ago and as I'm trying to make sense of it all and move on I've found myself unsure of my own morality or if I'm overthinking. I'll try to lay down all the facts:\n\nYears ago we went to a party, we both got completely smashed. I was told, because I couldn't fully remember the night at the time, that I was drunkenly trying to find her thoughout the night while he was flirting heavily and physically with a lot of the guys. It's been years since that party and when I see some of my guy friends who were there, they still tell me about what she was trying to do with them. It was hurtful but I tried to look past it.\n\nComing away from that party left me with a feeling that she wouldn't be faithful in the future. Expressing this to her led to arguments that I am bi phobic. (I'm a lesbian, she's bi.) I tell her I would be upset whether she was on other girls or boys or both. She says I could never understand because I'm not bi. So eventually I tried to forget about it because at that point I had loved her so much that I was willing to be with her even if she was unfaithful.\n\nThat year the marching band took a trip to Hawaii to march in the Pearl Harbor parade. Her dance team didn't end up going for whatever reason. After the parade some of the girls on my old color guard team and I went to get shaved ice. On our way back to the hotel we noticed a man and his friend following us and as teenage girls in cheerleader uniforms naturally we were nervous.\n\nI actually end up talking to them because they approached us and my social anxiety at the time prevented me from just telling them to go away. We exchanged phone numbers and texted each other occasionally. \n\nCome Christmas time he sent me care packages from Hawaii. Although I we talked, I never sent him any pictures of me, suggestive or not. (I was 16 at the time and he was probably in his mid twenties.) He was 100% preying on younger girls on purpose. I knew that from the start but I continued to talk to him anyway because he gave me more attention than she did.\n\nLater, I find out she kissed the guy who was sending her dick pics while he was at her house. I got upset and let it slip that I knew something like this would happen and the whole biphobia arguments come up again. \n\nA few months later she goes to Boston for about 10 days and comes back with her personality completely taken over by kpop. Sure, it's okay music but you know how kpop bands have cult followings of fans? It was like that. She'd spend hours of the day dancing to YouTube videos, she made a blog, everything. It's an extreme hyperfixation. To the point where I felt she prioritized kpop over me. She then claimed that I never let her enjoy her own things. She cited us going to the same school (where we met), me being uncomfortable with her getting handsy with other guys, and other similarities we have as people. Anything that she enjoyed I apparently wasn't allowed to express my own enjoyment from.\n\nNot long after, she calls me to the park and since I was at a family dinner and hadn't driven and had my dad drop me off. She says she wants to break up because I wasn't invested in kpop enough for her.\n\nTL;DR: long time gf contradicts herself am I the asshole for kpop being the last straw of all things?",

      "description": "So there's this convenience store that's walking distance to my house that I'm in just about every day to buy cigarettes. It has a rotating staff of guys that are all cousins/brothers/various relatives. They're all flirty to every girl that walks in, so I dont take it seriously when they do the same to me. They know I'm married and have kids. It's all jokey and everything is fine. There are two non relatives working there, one of which is my friend. \n\nEnter the newest relative dude who started there a month or so back. Guy makes creepy eye contact, starts calling me a nick name (I'm assuming it's a word in Arabic, but no clue what it means), and generally just chats me up every time I'm in there. Whatever, not an issue...until today. \n\nI went in like normal and the guys asked for my number. I told him I was married to which he responded that this was between me and him, then bragged that he had his wife on the phone when I came in. I got super flustered and didn't want to cause a scene or anything, so I had him write his number down. I took it, sat on it for an hour to figure out how to let the guy down and then returned it and explained that I was flattered but it wasn't going to happen. \n\nWhen I got home I texted my friend (his coworker) about it and that I was weirded out and going to be avoiding the store for a few days. She responded that she was going to talk to the owner about him. The implication being that he'll be transferred to another store or fired and shipped back home.\n\nI feel like I should just have kept my mouth shut at this point. All he did was ask a girl out. Am I the asshole here for venting to my friend about it and possibly costing the dude his job? ",

      "description": "This is a long post so bear with me. I’m still upset about the conversation that I was stuck with earlier today. \n\n\n\nA little background, I have known my new neighbor across the street for about 14? Years. She is a few years older than me and has lived across from my in laws since I was in high school. We had become friends for a period of time,we both had very young (toddler) children. Her oldest was a couple years older than my oldest and I even sort of looked up to her as a mother. Years go by, and we sort of grew apart as the kids grew older until a couple years ago when my in-laws built a new pool. They were coming around a little more often and she and her his dad even helped us a little on building the pool deck. \nThat summer her family sort of acted like we owed them something for helping us. My husband and I didn’t live there but they definitely benefited a lot more than we did. Probably even swam there more than the owners did. They would go over there while MIL was at work in the afternoons/evenings. Finally my MIL had to tell them she didn’t want them there without us around anymore. It got to a point where one day my family had time to go to the pool and she texted me INVITING HERSELF AND KIDS over to swim. I had to tell her my husband wanted a day with just us and they could not come over. She was furious, mentioned something about her girls being super sad  and disappointed and then didn’t talk to me for over a year.\nAround Halloween time they showed up at a party we were hosting and she said she was sorry and how much she missed me blah blah. We went for a walk once together after that and really still didn’t talk too much. During that time we came across an opportunity to acquire some land and build a house next door to my in laws. We texted each other “hello” here and there but never hung out or anything. I’m not a really clingy person so it doesn’t really bother me to have acquaintances whom I just say Hey to every so often. We haven’t really spoken more than that though.  We were on good terms and I looked forward to being neighbors. \n\nAfter a good 18 months the house is finally finished and we moved in. WITHIN A MONTH she is getting ahold of me wanting to know if I would pick up her daughter from school one day. Our youngest both attend the same elementary school. I figure sure I’m already there picking up my son I don’t see why not. Then a few weeks later she was going out of town and wanted to know if I would go feed her dogs and take them out while she’s gone. I guess since I’m right across the street and not really busy with anything, sure. Then a few weeks ago, (during a major snow storm)she and her kids were going out of town again for the weekend. Again, she wanted to know if I would feed and take the dogs out and this time also feed the cats and clean their litter box.. kind of a pain in the ass but not too much of an issue. I wouldn’t the animals to suffer or anything. \nNow, I’ve been in my new home for a total of 4 months. Other than her asking for these favors we haven’t talked much. Today, she calls me up and says, “hey I’ve got news for you” and I’m like “oh boy ok what is it?” She then says “I got a full time job.” And starts to talk about how she’s nervous and scared etc. since she’s been a stay at home mom mostly for 14 years. \nNext thing I know, WITHOUT EVEN ACTUALLY ASKING ME, she proceeds to quiz me and assume I will start picking up her daughter everyday from school and dropping her off across the street with her teenage sister. I didn’t really catch on at first and said “so are you going to put C in the after school program?” And she says “well I don’t know, you are there everyday picking up S aren’t you?” \nI start to get like zoned out at how upset I am that she just expects me to offer and take on this responsibility and commitment of caring for her child every day. I am seeing a very obvious pattern of favors and one sided relationships and quite frankly I just don’t want to commit to picking her kid up everyday. \n\nSo here’s the question: AITA if I say no to picking up her kid from school everyday and dropping her off at home? I have no excuse, I’m already at the school and I live next door but the fact that she didn’t even ask me and assumed I would take on this responsibility for her among other requests is just so outrageous to me. It’s not like we are close friends, that would be different. We barely speak on a regular basis. \n\nTLDR;  new neighbor assumed I would take responsibility for her child and pick her up from school everyday while picking up my own child. Keeps asking favors and taking advantage of me since I live next door. AITA for putting my foot down and saying no?\n\n",

      "description": "A little background story: My buddy is a known serial cheater (we'll call him greg). Every relationship he's had has ended with them breaking up because he got caught cheating. So he started dating a new girl about 4-5 months ago. They were in the honeymoon phase meaning they were inseparable. So about 4 weeks ago me and another buddy were at our local watering hole and saw Greg walk into the bar with another chick that wasn't his girlfriend. When Greg saw us you could tell he was not expecting us to be there. He said hi to us had a couple drinks and then him and the girl he was with left. Me and the guy I was with didnt say anything because of \"bro code\" and just left it at that. Now fast forward to this last Saturday we were at a birthday party and Greg showed up to the party with just him and his daughter. I didnt ask why he wasn't with his girlfriend because she just started a new job and just thought maybe she was working or something. Now we're all friends on fb so the next day I messaged his girl and asked where she was and why we didnt see her last night. She said they broke up about 2 weeks ago because she caught him cheating. Now I admit this is where I fucked up and should have just left it at that but I asked her if he got caught with the girl that we saw him with at the bar 4 weeks prior. She had no clue who this other chick was and caught him with a totally different girl. I knew she would ask him about this other girl and shit went downhill from there. Me and Greg talked for a little bit yesterday and basically said I cant be trusted and he doesnt want to be friends anymore. We've been friends for 20 years so it kinda sucks that its come down to this and I do genuinely feel bad about \"snitching\" on him. I didnt know that they had broken up but apparently they were in the process of making up but after that revelation that I told his new girl he's been dating she broke it off for good. He's put a lot of our friends in these situations before where we see him cheating but we dont say anything. So AITA for \"snitching\" on him?",

It is a big part of our life we go out and practice several times a week and do a lot of competitions on the weekend. It has been a huge bonding experience for the both of us and with our success in these various competitions we have made our hobby mostly free which is a nice added bonus.\n\nWith all that we have our different trophies hanging all over the house. Well this has become a huge problem for my MIL who HATES guns. So she has asked my wife if she would take the trophies down when she comes to visit so she doesn't have to \"see constant reminders that she is in a very dangerous house\". \n\nMy wife asked me about my thoughts on the request and I told her absolutely not. I told her that shooting is an important part of our life and that her irrational fear of it is her problem and that she has no say of what goes on our walls. And that if she doesn't like it she doesn't have to come over.\n\nMy wife is trying to convince me that it isn't worth the headache and to just do it for a couple days but I refuse to let someone force us to take down one of the most important aspects of our family for her own sake.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not just giving in and appeasing my MIL?",

We cut that out because of work, stress, and also because we both weren’t ready to be committed. We are NOT mutually exclusive. We remained “friends” at least untill this happened.\n\nSo me, her, and several visiting friends at our school went to a club sponsored party. This girl was one of the execs and was supposedly busy and bartending according to her words. When I first arrived, I said hi to her and chatted a little bit. Then I went inside the house and help introduce my friends to others there. About 20 minutes later, I walk over to check up on her but she was bartending so I went away. About another 20 minutes later, I went to talk to her again but she was taking to one of my other friends so I went on ahead and onto the dance floor. After dancing there I left to go get some beer and I asked her if she had any beer left. She looked at me with the most pissed off expression on her face and stormed off. I didn’t see her the rest of the night and the next day, I decided to ask her about last night. Although I was very drunk, I knew for a fact that I did not do anything even remotely sexual with her or anyone period. \n\nThis was her response:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1p7Y1DU\n\n\nAfter this, I ghosted her and now will try to avoid any contact with her. I am livid because a) I’m not your boyfriend b) I did attempt to talk to you and you know that c) I was trying to have fun with friends I haven’t seen in weeks/months d) what kind of friend asks for “more attention”.

      "description": "  \n\nThis is my first time posting here, so I apologize for anything that’s wrong. \n\nI’m sorry this is so long, I’ll place a tl;dr at the end\n\nIn year 12 I was apart of a friendship group that was made up of 12 girls. (Haha 12 girls for year 12). We weren’t all that close as we friendship groups that kind of joined together after a lot of people left my high school. In that group, I had 2 girls who I considered my best friends since we were good friends since year 7. At the beginning of year 12 we all got along swimmingly but as we got into the exam period it got more and tenser and a lot of people’s true colors showed up (mine included).\n\nSo, it all started with a girl I’ll call TL. She was quite pretty and had long gorgeous hair. It was her pride and joy. Me and TL had a weird history of being friends and not being friends. We never quite clicked (despite the both of us going to the same primary school together) and it was the case of when we good we were very, very good and when we were bad we were horrid. And in year 12 we were horrid.\n\nI’m not quite sure what had gotten me so heated with TL that day, but we were throwing underhand jabs at each other in legal studies which carried out into recess. At one-point, TL stated that she wanted to be a model, specifically a hair shampoo model which I had bluntly replied: “Don’t you have to be pretty to be a shampoo model?” (I know, that was unnecessary and cruel but I was angry and I saw an opening and took it). A few girls giggled and I threw her a superficial apology and forgot all about it. \n\nTL did not. My offhanded jab at her lead her to create a separate messenger group which was dedicated to her listing all my flaws such as that I was fat, my hair was too thin, my skirt was too short, and that people liked me so I could give them notes for the classes I was in (ouch but true). This side messenger group included my two best friends as well. They created events which they didn’t invite me to, and only told me after it was over with excuses like ‘oh we didn’t think you’ll like it.’ I’m sure TL had great pleasure in seeing me attempt to cover up my frustrations about being left out but I never really said much about it. After a few of these exclusions, I spent a lot of time in the library, studying or chatting with the librarians who took me under their wing and helped me find textbooks for my classes. \n\nBy the end of term 3 and with HSC looming overhead I thought TL had forgotten the whole ordeal but, alas, she had not. She created formal get together for the girls to buy dresses and hired a limo for the girls to go in for formal. All these small things hurt but it didn’t really hurt as my two best friends going along with it and then later pulling me aside one day and unloading everything on me all at once. They showed me screenshots of the secret group chat and the circle jerks of TL and her close friends talking about me. It was a cold and hard reality check. \n\nSo high school comes and goes, and I get into the university of my dreams and I make a wonderful new group of friends. As time passed, I look back critically at my high school experience and realize I am not faultless (with my mouth I definitely unconsciously ruffled a few feathers)  in my exclusion from the group but my best friends, as well as the other girls who were neutral, were not faultless either. \n\nI unfriended everyone in that group including my best friends and put my best foot forward. And for a time, I was content with my decision. But then one day a girl who I’ll call FH, used to go to my old high school and I befriended bought up my ex-friends. She told me they told her that they were hurt by my sudden decision to cut them off and that they believed I was taking out my inability to get over high school drama out on them. I told her that I wanted a fresh start. My ex best friends and the other girls were still friends with TL. They still went on outings and had meet-ups with her and her friends. I didn’t want anything to do with that anymore. This back and forth went on for a while before FH told me that all my friends thought I was a bitch who couldn’t get over some petty high school drama. To tell you guys the truth, this drama really fucked me up. I went to therapy for some time and even now with my close uni friends, I struggle to trust everything they say to face value. I’m just waiting for the bomb to drop that they never like me and they befriended me because they felt sorry for me.\n\nI was content with my decision to cut them off before but now I’m not sure. I feel like I should have said something or done something else.\n\nTL;DR I cut off old high school friends who are still friends with a group of girls who excluded me and talked behind my back for a year.\n\nAm I the asshole? Because I’m beginning to feel like one. ",

He sees his kids for an hour a week, but he has missed this numerous times, once because he didn't set his alarm, another time because he was hungover and most recently he just forgot. He has given her £200 in child support since he left. \n\nYesterday, he (ex) texted my sister (J) saying that he wants to take their oldest son (Ja who is six) on holiday:\n\nEx: I've booked 6 nights in (holiday park) in April and i want to take Ja. I've already booked it.\n\nJ: You should talk to me regarding taking him anywhere before booking really ex. Just let me check his holiday dates. Do you think for the first time taking him away, four days might not be a bit much for him?\n\nEx:If you cant be reasonable then i'm gonna go down another route to get what i want because i'm his dad i'm allowed to have joint responsibility.\n\nJ: I've told you i'll check his dates. You know you can see the boys whenever you want, and i've said you can have them overnight at your place, and i even asked you the other night if you could call more regularly so he can speak to you.\n\nEx: That message sounds like you think you're doing me a favour.

I pay you enough i deserve to take them where i want.\n\nMy sister asked Ja how he'd feel about going on holiday just with daddy and he seemed ok with it as long as he can call his mom every day. So fine, but then this happens:\n\nEx: I wanna tell you that i'm with someone now and we live together. Were buying a house together next year. I thought you should know before the boys meet her.\n\nJ: Ok, is she going on holiday with you?\n\nEx: Yeah\n\nJ: Ask yourself how you would feel if i wanted to take our kids away on holiday with someone i've only known for a few months at most and you've never met. I'm not trying to argue, but i feel like we should talk about things like this. When i start dating again the boys wont be meeting who i'm with for a while, and i would introduce you to make sure you're ok with who i'm having around them, all i want is for you to show me the same respect.\n\nNow my sister is really anxious about what to do. She's never met this person before, neither have the kids, and because the holiday is booked for April there isn't much time for her to vet them and make sure they arent secretly Casey Anthony. He has agreed to let her meet this person one time but that's it. My sister is worried that if she says no he'll take her to court and paint her as an evil ex who doesn't want him to see the kids. But she's more worried about this stranger being around her child.\n\nWIBTA if she doesnt let her son go?\n\nTL'DR: Sisters ex wants to take 6 year old son on holiday with someone he's only known for a few months, and who my sister and her son has never met.",

      "description": "So I work in construction, at a small office that is family owned. There's my boss, his wife, and three other employees besides myself. We usually all eat lunch together, with either my coworker or myself running and grabbing food. I don't mind doing this, although I do enjoy lunch to myself from time to time. When we all eat together we normally sit there and talk about work, which I like to get away from for an hour a day. Before I started working here about 5 months ago, I would always go off by myself at lunchtime and decompress. When I realized that these people all like to eat together in the office I was initially bummed. I didn't want to be the asshole who always goes off and eats alone. So I've sucked it up and normally eat with my boss, his wife, and coworkers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday we decided to order food from a popular Mexican restaurant. I decided I would just add my boss's food to my order and he could pay me with cash. I had never ordered his food from this restaurant before, normally it's my coworker who adds his food onto her order. I decided to be nice and offer to. He told me what he wanted, with my coworker adding that he wants cheese on his tacos. I added his two shrimp tacos with a small queso to my order. It was about $14 in total. I go get the food, bring it back, and set it out for us to eat. My boss sits down and starts to unwrap his food and says \"Ugh, why is all this crap on my tacos?\" I look over and tell him he did not tell me anything specific that he did not want on his tacos, so I just made sure there was cheese. He then opens his queso and also complains about the guacamole in it. I just look at him and tell him that he should have told me specifically what he didn't want in his food and that I was sorry it was messed up. We continue to eat, and later I remind his that he owes me $14.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis fool looks at me and says \"but my food was messed up, I shouldn't have to pay you. I think this is a good lesson for you to learn to check your work.\" ARE YOU SERIOUS. He was the one who didn't make sure to tell me what he did and didn't want on his food! I offered to add his food to my order when I didn't have to AND went and picked it up. He NEVER goes and gets his own lunch, it's usually always me who does! I don't think the man even knows how to order for himself to be honest. I told him that his food being messed up and him refusing to pay me is an awful way for him to \"teach me a lesson\" as he put it, and that he should have made sure his food was correct if he was so damn worried about it. I told him that I won't be getting his food again unless he pays me first. He then told me that he gave me a good Christmas bonus and that I basically should not be complaining. This man is a millionaire. $15 to him is nothing, while to me it's half my internet bill. He really feels justified in this and it makes me realize how truly arrogant and condescending he is. He did give me a good Christmas bonus, which I appreciated and thanked him many times for, but what does that have to do with this situation? Nothing! I know I still have a lot to learn in this industry and that I do fuck up from time to time, but I didn't have to make sure he got food, like I do every damn day almost. I COULD be the bitch who refuses and goes off by herself, which there is NOTHING wrong with, but I still don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe then said \"I wonder how many people would take your side and how many would take mine?\" So Reddit, AITA for deciding to never again go get his ass lunch? Let him fend for himself for once so he can't bitch at me and not pay me when his food is wrong because he didn't TELL ME what he didn't want on it? I just can't believe that he was trying to turn it into some type of weird \"lesson\" about checking my work (which by the way, he's basing off the ONE time I didn't go back through and catch a mistake, which yes, was completely my fault.) I'm pissed and don't even want to be around him. Unfortunately I have to and can't figure out how to let this go.",

      "description": "Okay so a little backstory, I met this friend of mine when I was 14 years old (I am 17 now) and he would always say he is 7 years old, much younger than he actually was. He would keep on lying about his personal life like having 2 siblings when in reality he is an only child. I don't judge him for lying, he probably felt lonely and wanted to fit in with everyone else, but about a couple months later I found out that he has been taking inappropriate pictures of strangers at the park, train, toilets, and changing rooms. I honestly thought he was innocent due to the child-like vibe he had, it shattered me since he would always act like he knew nothing about sex and any adult \"stuff\". Well after I found out about that I kept some distance from him but just a couple months back we reconnected and I can tell he has matured. He is 18 now yet still mentions how he is \"going through childhood\" and I keep mentioning he is legally an adult and should not be keeping the mindset of a child, yet he likes to think he is not mature and he does not want to be an adult. I know he can be mature at times due to some situations where he got angry and handled situations like an adult, but he keeps avoiding personal conversations and just talks about childish stuff. If I don't spend a day playing a game with him he gets grumpy and holds a grudge against me until I make it up. When I decide to talk about my own personal problems he replies with dry responses then goes right back to what he was doing, and a majority of the time (which is always) his top priorities are his games. TBH it's not even fun games, he just rotates games from hour to hour and does not want to do anything else but play. He isn't sick in the head or anything, he just truly believes he is still in his childhood phase when we all know (including himself) that he is an adult. He is a really good friend and I love him but it has gotten to the point where it is boring to talk to him since he avoids me when he gets criticized for not acting his age. Once again, in no way am I implying him to stop doing what he loves, if that's watching cartoons or playing games, it is the fact that he really believes he is a child and it has gotten too much at this point.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking he needs to grow up?",

      "description": "I've been having an internal strife deciding whether or not I am being a cold-hearted asshole. So my sister is by no means an angel, but she is family. Her life has been becoming harder and harder these past few months (roughly starting 24 months ago). She broke up with her boyfriend of 8 years, because of her hooking up with a student (high school teacher at the time). She is now dating this student that is 6 years her junior. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince this change has happened, she started blaming her ex for her compulsively buying clothes, and wasting money on fast food and subsequently gaining a lot of weight. This has racked up quite a few bills, as most of these purchases were on credit despite teachers in our country making a really good living. She quit her job at teaching by not showing up. She was fired and blamed it on her ex because he 'forced her into becoming a teacher'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe bought a brand new car when she started teaching, these payments were easy to make when she was teaching. Now she expects my father to pay for it, as well as help her with gas money and paying off her debt. My dad is a big softie and is paying for this, slowly but surely. This has my mother pretty upset, however my father told me that he cannot say no to his kids. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has recently gotten pregnant with her new boyfriend, the student, and is deciding on keeping the child. Her boyfriend is jobless, and has no drive to get a job. She is basically a single mother in this, and expects my mother to babysit and raise her kid when she goes off to work. This has my mom upset, but she agreed that there is no real option outside of it. The bills for the checkups are all coming from my father's pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, why I don't feel bad is because she has sexually assaulted me when I was a kid (This has made it near impossible to interact with any girl lmao), her ex boyfriend really loved her and worked really damn hard to procure them a great future, and she has been lying and leeching from my parents because of her bad decisions.

      "title": "AITA for critiquing my mother's parenting style in front of her kids",
      "description": "So, some context. This happened a few days ago. I moved out of my parent's house when I was sixteen. It was a toxic environment, and while I was certainly contributing to that, it was taking its toll on my mental health. My mom and I had regular arguments that always went too far, and my dad and I would get into physical altercations that often left me injured. I tried to kill myself twice and ran away once by the age of fifteen. As a result, I had a very strained relationship with both of my parents.\n\nMany years have passed, and I've been able to forgive my dad, which was the hardest step for me to take. He and I have matured a great deal since then, and we get along quite well now. But my mom and I lost touch. I rarely see her, and when I do it's always in a bad situation. The last time I saw her, I cracked.\n\nI walked into the house to drop off my old violin for my sister, who has been struggling with self-harming and needed a healthy outlet/hobby. Upon arriving, I found my mom yelling at this sister for not eating her dinner - which happens on rare occasion. My mom started saying that if my sister didn't eat, she was going to get more depressed and kill herself. Keep the self-harming tendencies of this kid in mind. She then started yelling at another one of my sisters for eating too much. She said that this would result in the second sister getting \"fat and ugly like [my mom]\". Her words. This second sister has diabetes and seriously struggles with her body image and sense of self-worth. Finally, my mom started yelling at one of my younger brothers (eight or so years old) who had mistakenly dialed 911 on what he believed to be an old phone with no service. She told him that he wasted the police's time, and, as a result, if someone was having a heart-attack called 911 that they would die and it would be his fault.\n\nI understood in each of these cases where my mom was coming from, to a degree. But I felt she took things way too far. And it reminded me of the stress that similar drama has caused me as a kid. So I started yelling at my mom. I told her it was abusive to try and teach her kids through trauma and dramatization. I feel it was wrong of me to tell her that by yelling, and more wrong to do it in front of the kids. But was it? I honestly don't know how to make that house healthier, or if I am even responsible for making it better. When there are no good options, would it have been better to have done nothing or to have confronted her like I did?",

      "description": "This girl and I dated for around a month, and we became quite close very quickly. We broke up amicably (we both are dealing with mental health issues and just couldn’t do it) and while it hurt, I wasn’t upset at her or anything. \n\nThat was around 2 weeks ago. We agreed that it would be busy to be friends but we haven’t spoken since we broke up. Earlier today she sent me a text saying that she didn’t appreciate me inviting her friends to smoke and drink with me, and that it hurts inviting her two close friends to do that. \n\nLast week, I invited one of our mutual friends, and then another (knowing they didn’t smoke or drink) and of course was not going to force anyone to do anything. That is something I am very cognizant of, as the last thing I would want is to have someone feel pressured into doing something.\n\nI called her explaining that\n\n 1. I wasn’t responsible for their actions but I respect how she is feeling and won’t in the future,\n and \n2. It’s feels kinda shitty that we don’t talk at all and she just sends this to me out of the blue \n\nI asked her if she was mad at me and she said “No, I just don’t have anything to say to you right now”\n\nI hung up, but I feel really angry because I believe that when you value your relationship with someone, you fuckin solve shit that comes up. So when she sends this to me out of the blue, I call her and let her know that this feels kind of unfair and she responds by shutting down the conversation saying “I don’t have anything else to say right now”,  she is not only holding me accountable for actions that aren’t my own, but won’t even talk to me about it. \n\nAm I justified feeling angry at this? \n",

      "description": "Up until around January this year I would commute via train, but have recently started driving instead because it actually works out cheaper for me per month. If you're wondering how that's possible, the car is my girlfriend's mum's old car that she gave to me for free when she got a new one. My girlfriend and I (who currently live separately) split the tax and insurance cost and, since she cant drive, I keep the car at my place but give her lifts whenever she needs them.\n\nIf you're wondering why the train is so expensive, the answer is... Northern Rail. Brits will understand.\n\nBack when I commuted via train, I would often see my Dad on the other platform as my train passed through. We'd wave and text each other good morning, but of course that stopped when I started driving.\n\nNow, it's important to note that my Dad is a hardcore environmentalist. The sort who keeps a graph of how much power his solar panels are generating, and has this uncanny sixth-sense that tingles whenever someone touches the thermostat. He also tries to drive as little as possible, and cycles to work most of the time.\n\nAnyway, we were talking on the phone a while back and he asks me why he hardly ever sees me on the train anymore. I tell him that, since a monthly season ticket costs me nearly £140, I'm saving about £50 a month driving instead. He then goes off on a Dad-rant about me killing the planet, killing polar bears, melting the ocean caps, etc... which made me feel bad because I do genuinely care about the environment. It's just that money is a LOT tighter for me than it is for him, and that £50 a month really makes a difference. I tell him that I'm paycheck to paycheck and don't have an emergency fund, or any savings for that matter. He tells me that if I ever find myself in financial trouble, I can always count on him and Mum for support. I say I appreciate it but would much rather be financially independent. He grudgingly concedes, but now every time we speak he (jokingly) drops names like polar bear killer and, worst of all (in his eyes), Clarkson.\n\nI know he's not being malicious or anything... just gently pressuring me to use the train again. But it's been going on long enough that I'm starting to feel genuinely bad for the effect my commute has on the atmosphere, especially when a cleaner option is right there... albeit a more expensive one.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So a little backstory: I know it’s really weird, so please don’t judge me, it’s not something I can control. But hearing and seeing people blow their nose makes me sick. Like physically vomit. I have no clue why. For reference, I can’t blow my nose since I got my tonsils out at 5 years old. \n\nSo I was at a university lecture and the girl in front of me started blowing her nose. No big deal, usually for me I just ignore, take a drink of water and I’m fine. But she blew her nose for like 30 seconds. Then she blew it again. For another 30 seconds. My friend told me that my face was green and asked if I was ok. I said i was fine but then the girl started blowing her nose again and as I was on the verge of throwing up in the middle of a lecture in the middle of a full row with a room of 100 people so I politely tapped the girl on the shoulder and asked if she could stop blowing her nose. She did without saying anything but did it very huffy puffy like. She rolled her eyes and whispered something in her friends ear and then they both kind of did that judgey thing where they both turn around and stare at u like ‘how dare you be an asshole’\n\nSo AITA?

      "description": "My little brother is in his mid 20’s and still lives at home. He is in non traditional school, which requires about $300/month in dues. If my calculations are correct, he is making a little under $2,000/mo after paying his dues. My mother doesn’t charge him any rent or bills, and she sometimes brings him home food. He has fully paid his vehicle off because of his lack of bills and income ratio. He is honestly a great person, I just believe he has zero idea about the real world because he chooses to live under my mothers thumb. He discussed once with me that his friend offered him and room and he said “he wanted to change me $300 a month! Ha! Can you believe that!!!!” He was complaining that the price of the 4 bedroom house split 2 ways was insane. I told him I was paying $900 for my studio in the city and he was shocked. He has almost no concept of paying bills aside from his car payment. I will give him credit that he has an almost perfect credit score, and is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met. \n\nMoving on...\n\nAs I said, he is fantastic, wonderful, sweet, and caring. He is also very handsome when he puts effort into his appearance. But usually he just wears the same clothes from high school and only cuts his hair twice a year. Sometimes he will shave his own head. It makes me sad because he has low self confidence when in reality he is an amazing person. :(\n\nI asked him to make me a Christmas wishlist, and it’s a bunch of “Manga” ? and Japanese video games. I feel as if I buy him these things this will encourage his “nerdy” behavior. I know this type of stuff makes him happy, but I think if he stays at home and just plays video games he will continue to be depressed. I want to buy him something that will encourage him to get out of the house. I want to buy him new clothes and maybe some tickets to an event so he can invite some friends out. My mom calls me upset all the time about how sad he is and how he never does anything. Why should I purchase these items and encourage his behavior which might be adding to his depression? Not to mention I think what he is asking for is for kids, and he is in his mid 20’s. I get men will never outgrow video games, but that’s literally the only thing on his list aside from “manga.” Maybe I just don’t understand? \n\nAITA for not buying my brother what he wants for Christmas because I think he should grow up and shift his interests into more adult things, and focus on moving out from my mothers house?

      "description": "Let me preface this by saying that I usually hate lending people money and I've said no numerous times but since my friend was stuck in a hard place, I decided to help her out.\n\nMy friend, let's call her Ana, found out that she had 30 days to move out of her current living situation since her landlord was no longer going to be renting. Due to that and a few unforeseen expenses with her car/family, she ended up being short on money for the month of her move out.\n\nLike I said, typically I wouldn't let anyone borrow money but she needed it (or so I thought) so I decided to lend a hand. Obviously, I told her that I am really good on money at the moment and she can take her time paying me back since I know she's got going on. She was super thankful and told me a million times that she was beyond grateful. That was about 3 weeks ago.\n\nFast forward to today, I've seen her a few times in between and we've had lunch or gotten coffee but I haven't pressed the issue because once again, I told her no rush. What is bothering me though is that over the last few weeks, she has had the money to get her nails done, go to an amusement park, go out a few times and yet she hasn't mentioned returning the money at all. I honestly don't need it at the moment but I guess to me it is just the principle. \n\nShe still hasn't found a place to live and she is having some car issues, would I be the asshole to ask her at some point to return the money? If not, how long do I wait to bring it up? If it matters, the amount was over 300 American dollars.\n\nTL;DR - Lent a friend over 300 dollars and she hasn't paid me back or brought it up since. She is in a tight spot with her living situation and car but she has had money to do pretty expensive things over the last few weeks.",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to give up a seat to the latecomer who had saved it?",
      "description": "This was years ago, but I’ve always wondered about it. Tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nIn college I had a class that met in a conference room that was way too small. There was a large conference table that could seat the professor and about a third of the students and and row of seats along the back wall that could seat another third. Everybody else had to sit on the floor between the table and the back wall. The floor was very crowded, uncomfortable, and meant you couldn’t see the professor or the board.\n\nCompetition for chairs was fierce, so it was common to throw your bag in a chair first if you needed to pee or use the water fountain before class. Further complicating matters the classroom had two doors and the class before mine always had a line of students wanting to talk to that professor after their class, so in the bustle between classes it was hard to tell who was coming, who was going, and whether the bag in a chair belonged to someone in my class who was in the bathroom or someone in the last class who was waiting to talk to their professor.\n\nOn the day in question by the time I got to the classroom all the chairs were taken save one that had a backpack in it. There was still a line of people waiting to talk to the professor of the class before mine, so I stood by the chair waiting to see if it was any of theirs. Once everyone from that class had cleared the room and the bag was still there I asked around to see if anyone knew whose it was. Somebody said they thought they’d seen a girl leave it there but didn’t know if she was in our class or coming back or what. Eventually everyone was settled, the doors to the classroom were closed, and the professor began the lecture. The bag owner was still nowhere to be found, so I moved the bag to the floor and took the seat.\n\n**Half an hour** later the bag owner finally showed up and told me to get out of her seat. There were a dozen people on the floor she would have had to climb over to get from the door to the chair. I said no, I’m sitting here. She said she had just gone to the dining hall “real quick,” and demanded I give her the seat. I said “There were no seats left and you weren’t here.” She said “I left my bag there. It’s my seat.” At this point we were already disrupting half the class with our stage whispering, so I said “You weren’t here” and turned my attention back to the lecture. She begrudgingly sat on the floor by the door for the rest of class.\n\nIf it’d been a bathroom trip gone awry or she’d been 10 minutes late I probably would have moved, but the dining hall was easily a 10-minute walk from the classroom and always crowded at that time of day.\n\nFrom her point of view I had moved her stuff, ignored the universal sign for “this chair is saved” by taking the chair, and refused to move when the rightful owner returned.\n\nFrom my point of view she took a chair knowing she’d be at least 30 minutes late to class, knowing she’d be depriving a classmate who was there the whole time of a seat, and knowing she’d have to climb over a dozen people when she made it back to class.\n\nTl;dr: There were no seats left when class started, so I moved a bag and took the last seat. Bag owner arrived half an hour late to class and demanded I vacate the chair. AITA for refusing?",

      "description": "I have a friend who's always been a bit needy and clingy, which is fine and even endearing sometimes, but lately she's been texting me all day, every day. It doesn't bother me that much during the day, it's nice to have the company and whatnot.... but when I get home from work and I'm winding down I kinda just want to chill and watch a movie or play a video game and not worry about responding to texts.\n\nI started just trying to let the conversation die in the evening, but if I dont respond she will just send me another text saying something else or trying to strike up a new conversation and it's progressively gotten worse and more aggressive to the point where she started calling me out for ignoring her or taking too long to respond.\n\nA couple nights ago I admittedly got frustrated when she called me out for not responding, and told her that I want \"me\" time in the evenings and that I didn't want to carry on casual small talk conversations all night. I told her not to text me after 8pm unless it was an emergency. \n\nThis upset her a ton and she accused me of only being her friend out of pity, and that real friends can talk to each other whenever they want, and that I was incredibly rude. She told me that she didn't want me as a friend if she had to worry about what time of day she was talking to me.

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother and I have had a tense relationship since we were little. I was a typical snitch and he was a typical bully. As we got older our relationship became more faceted and I think his hatred for me grew deeper. I can only assume he hates me based off of what he's said to me, and I can't really blame him. I was the nightmare little sister, his parents were divorcing as he was in the womb and he was only about a year and a half old when his dad remarried to his step mom and had me. I know it must've been hard and with two parents bidding for his love with video games, and tech, and toys rather than love it would've hurt.\n\nI always knew he hated me, ever since I was little I could play with him, and I can still interact with him, it's just I know he hates me, it's always been a part of our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day my dad announced we were going to the beach and I had an anxiety attack, it was the first time I'd ever had one which made it scarier and it was because of something that had happened the last time I was at that lake. We called the trip off, I didn't intend for this to happen I just knew I'd never go back to that lake again. After this was decided my brother walked into a room I was in and proceeded to tell me that I was ruining the family and was the reason our dad had depression. He told me he knew I would just go crying to our mom and that I shouldn't tell her what he said, I didn't for a long, long time.\n\nMy brother came into me and my cousin's at the time room to tell me that he was such a good person, because he had so much dirt on people he could ruin anyone's reputation at any time and he didn't. I mentioned to my cousin after he left the room that what he said was something a sociopath would say (I know that's mean spirited but at the time I was just in a bad mood and wanted nothing to do with him.) He came back into the room to tell me that he was so empathetic he knew exactly what people wanted to hear and he knew how to destroy people as well. He told me I was extremely unempathetic and it showed, I'm someone who prides myself on compassion, so hearing that hurt and I'm still afraid to this day that he was speaking truth.\n\nMy brother came home from his mom's one day and gave me a hug telling me he learned that he should appreciate family, but the hug felt empty, it was like it was just there for show and I'm still not sure if I'm just paranoid or not, I just know I can still feel his contempt for me. (P.S I can't remember if the 2nd paragraph incident occurred before or after his supposed revelation about family.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry this was so long\n\nI've vented to my friends about his issues before, speculating that the trauma combined with his behavior, and the fact that our dad has NPD might be a sign of a personality disorder, I have a therapist I just sometimes can't hold it in, and that's my fault.\n\nSo AITA for speculating that my brother might have a personality disorder?",

      "description": "Here is some background:\n\nMy (18f) best friend (18f) was born in Korea but was adopted by white parents as an infant. She does not speak Korean or know anything about the culture/traditions. (I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that or that it makes her any less Korean.) She makes an obvious effort to separate herself from other Asian people in our school and constantly makes fun of stereotypically Asian things (eg. anime, k-pop, eating rice, getting good grades, etc.). If anyone calls her out on this she gets defensive and says she \"can't be racist towards her own race\". HOWEVER, her \"jokes\" are never about/toward herself (self-deprecating) but instead aimed at others (borderline bullying). She acts like she is above other Asian people because she has white parents.\n\nI want to make it clear that I do not think my friend is truly racist or a bad person. I have always chalked this behavior up as her being deeply insecure about her race/adoption. I have never confronted her about this (maybe I should, but I feel as though she would just get defensive), but whenever she makes rude comments I try to counteract them without being belligerent (eg. \"Her eyes are so squinty\" \"I think her eyes are really pretty\").\n\nNow, onto the topic in the title. My friend recently told me that she applied for scholarship/grant money intended for students from Asian backgrounds. I feel like it's shitty to reject and ridicule a culture only to later use it for your benefit--even if that culture happens to be your own. I tried expressing this to her in the nicest way possible, but she called me racist and said that I had no right to tell her what she could or could not do in regards to her race. Is she right? Was it even my place to say anything? AITA?",

      "description": " hey everyone!\n\nSo a week ago I stopped talking and with four of my long time buddys. We have known each other for around ten years now but I moved to a different country so we only keep in touch via gaming.\nIn the last few years we were gaming together almost every day and a bit of mocking here and there was pretty much normal but it suddenly got way worse towards me. \n\nI don't really have a lot of money and I don't learn anything because I'm taking care of my father who has cancer. When I finished school, I never looked for a job but helped in the house and  with my little sister. My father is much better now and I've been searching for work for a year now but it's really hard with such a big gap in the history. My Friends know this!\n\nBecause of that of course I'm not able to afford any new games or any new hardware which leaves me left out a lot. This wouldn't be a problem for me if my friends wouldn't constantly mock me because of it. It started off as a bit of fun but with the time it got a lot worse. Because I sometimes had lag or couldn't afford a newer game or pc they mocked me To a point where they refused to play any games with me and just started all rounds alone (with me listening to it in voice chat).. and they started insulting me calling me a poor shit and making jokes how i will soon sleep on the street and eat junk.. that wasn't even the worst thing they told me too.\nI told them to stop multiple times but they just called me a crybaby\n\nAfter that has been going on for a few months I decided to just delete them and never talk to them again. This was not an easy decision scince they were pretty much my closest friends  but I couldn't take it anymore. \n\nTwo of them have been messaging me on phone and asking what's wrong and if I wouldn't have money for the power bill or what.. I now blocked their numbers as well\n\nNow im kind of sitting here alone and have no one to play with and I'm asking myself if I overreacted and if im acting like an Asshole. Thoughts? \n\nI'm sorry for spelling mistakes English is not my main language \n\nTLDR\n\nMy friends constantly mocked and insulted me for not being able to afford new games or Hardware despesite knowing my situation -i deleted and blocked them. AITA? \n",

I had come over for a holiday with my family and staying with my uncle.\n\nSo, one fine evening, I decided to take my uncle's bike(bicycle) and just ride around the neighborhood. I remember my uncle telling me the ride on the sidewalk and not to go on to the road.\n\nI am riding on the sidewalk, when a group of 3 people,with their dogs,are standing right in the middle of the sidewalk talking to each other. I yelled\"On your left!!\" to them to let them know I'm coming. They don't seem to hear me. So, I get off my bike and wheel the bike around them.\n\nJust as I was doing that, the dog's leash got tangled in my bike's wheel and I'm stuck. The guy looks at me surprised and just completely freaks out. He just starts yelling at me about how he could \" crush kids with his bare hands\" and that my bike intercepted his dog( I don't even know what that means). \n\nHe continues yelling at me, while the rest of the group just looks at me with pity. I did not say a word because ,to be honest, I was scared because I was not even in my own country. Anyways,after about 5 mins of this, he stops, I apologise, and we go our own different ways.\n\nSo,am I the asshole, or is there even an asshole in this situation??",

We're about 4 months in, and it's held in someone's home and has about 20 people, so intimate environment (it's in the living room). There's a couch, some chairs, and folding chairs. Every day that the training is over, people take their stuff with them, and the next day, some people take 'usual' seats, and some people change seats. It's been this way every time as far as I know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne Friday, I had the middle couch seat during training. The next day, I took the end couch seat. There was a standard manual there, and I moved it. So beginning Saturday, we begin training, and 30 minutes, the person walks in late, who had my seat the previous day. She starts whisper/talking over the instructor to me that I took her seat, explains how she had her stuff there, and she's had that seat since the training ever started (I don't think this is true), and can we change seats. At this point I'm a bit annoyed that she's disrupting the class and ask to speak to her later (signaling to the talking instructor). She gets exasperated and says she feels uncomfortable that someone took her seat. The class then goes outside for a field exercise, and I get up to go out, and she stops me to talk. I tell her that I'm sorry she feels this way but I've had my stuff moved before and I want to go join the class. Instead of joining the class, she says she's staying in. Ok, whatever, I go with the rest of class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we rejoin, we break for lunch and she is really mad now. She accuses me at this point that I knew that my moving her stuff would make her feel violated but I did it anyway. I'm really taken aback. Then she says that she knew I didn't like her from the beginning (even more taken aback; I don't give her much thought, I tried to connect socially with her before). She pretty much lashes into me, says she knew what I'm doing, and then says she can't stay to talk about it because she has errands to do. I tell her I feel threatened by her and worse, she's not even willing to talk about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNB: We are all grown ass adults. I've been feeling a range of feelings from anger (wtf is up with her) to anxiety (did I genuinely do something wrong). From what I know since this event, this woman rarely practices with the class with the field exercise, so maybe she's known to be a little uptight.",

      "description": "I live in a suburban apartment complex where there's not a lot of green space. There's about 10 feet in between the buildings, but even that's just dirt and rocks and dog poop that no one picks up. Mostly it's a lot of parking lot and a few dumpsters. \n\nThere is a woman who lives in the building next to me who has 3 - 5 small children under the age of 10 (I don't know how many exactly, because I feel like one or two of them might just be the kids' friends).\n\nPretty much every minute that these kids are not in school - afternoons until dark and all day weekends - they are outside. Digging in the dirt, beating on the fence with sticks, bouncing basketballs in the parking lot, screaming (they're kids, idk they just stand there and scream sometimes), chasing each other, etc. In the summer they're out there all day, and judging by the way they beat on the door asking to be let in, I think they're locked out. \n\nIt drives me absolutely nuts. I work from home and I'm on the phone all the time, and I can hear them constantly while I'm working, through the windows and walls of my apartment (on the upper floor!) and I've even had clients over the phone comment on it and ask about \"my\" kids. \n\nOn the one hand, I understand that they're kids and have a lot of energy, and don't want to be cooped up in what is at most a 2-bedroom apartment all day. I remember running around a lot as a kid, but I had a big, fenced-in back yard, a front yard, a wide street, and lots of space in between houses (not to mention thicker walls). \n\nBut I also feel that in a living situation like this, it's inconsiderate to everyone around them to make so much noise all the time. There's also a safety issue - like I said, it's mostly just a poorly-lit parking lot and dumpsters. I can't imagine how much broken glass there is where they're playing, or how many times they've almost been hit by cars pulling out or turning the corner.\n\nIt's not the kind of friendly neighborhood where you know your neighbors, it's more the kind where you occasionally have to call the cops on your neighbors for domestic violence, so I'm not about to tell this woman how to raise her kids. I just want to know if I'm the asshole.",

      "description": "Ok, so I hope to God my boyfriend never sees this; this was so long ago but I still wonder if I was a bitch in this situation. So about a year ago my bf and I were at a store. Guy comes in, runs to the cigarettes counter, and takes off into the parking lot. The man pushed a lot of people to get through, so it was a major scene. Immediately, a group of men, my bf included, took off after him. The whole thing happened so fast, and after about five minutes, all of the men came back into the store, except my bf. So I waited. I went out of the store, couldn't find him, couldn't see him. I didn't know what to do, I was just there for about 20 minutes waiting in the cold. I tried calling him, and after a while he finally answered and said he had jumped into a car with this lady trying to follow the guy, so basically he was chasing the guy down. I really didn't know what to say, I just told him, \"Well, what do I do?\" He said he didn't know, he was coming back at some point, but he was on the hunt for this guy, so he wasn't going to answer my calls after he hung up. So I continued waiting, I'll say another 20 minutes passed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, he came back in a cop car. They never tracked the guy down, but in the process of my bf chasing him, the guy turned around and pepper sprayed him, so when he got out the car, the cops had to help him out because he still couldn't see. He immediately told me what happened, and I said something on the lines of, \"I just can't believe you left me here.\" AS SOON AS I SAID IT, I knew it was a really mean thing to say, and my bf just said, \"Really?\" After that he got patched up by EMS (just some drops in his eyes), and we called his parents and his sister.All of us were really upset with him for being so stupid, the guy could've had a gun! The situation could've been a lot worse! But in the back of my mind, I was upset that he left me there, that he wasn't thinking about me, what I was going to do if he never came back. AITA for even thinking that?",

They told me I need to live a little. \n\nI kinda snapped at them. They know that I don't smoke weed because I worry about the smell. (I've gotten high once though) I told them that I was tense in that other situation because my parents are strict and I would get in trouble if I came home too late.

      "description": "Me(Male) and my best friend(Female) are very close. About a month ago she had met with some guy on Tinder, I will call him Jacob, and they really clicked. She would often mention how great Jacob is and all. I have met him once and he was actually a great guy from a first look. Two weeks forward, they start dating. Everything seems to be going perfectly. Although, few days ago she starts jokingly telling me that she can't find a reason why would she need a boyfriend. So, she broke up with Jacob yesterday, because she felt it was wrong thing to do dating him, felt that she made the wrong decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little bit of context. She had been once in serious 2 year relationship, and broke it up about a year ago. I will call him Mark. I've heard numerous stories from her, that at the end of the relationship there was a week that she had cried through everyday(On the other hand, first year of relationship went super well). Because of Mark, as he was hurting her emotionally. The further it went, the worse it got, it was the lowest point of her life at that point. Then she realized she must let him go. Her life had turned to better. Besides that, they were still meeting as friends sometimes. She still cared for him, but didn't want any kind of relationship for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround the same time she started doubting her recent relationship, she met with Mark's best friend for some reason. They talked about Mark, how's he holding now and all that. The thing is, Mark himself told her that he was holding well and has recovered from the breakup. His best friend told otherwise: that Mark is still thinking about her; how much is he regretting his own decisions on how he treated her; how he made a huge mistake. While she was telling me this exact story, I saw a spark in her face, although, didn't take that much too seriously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, the day when my best friend and Jacob break up, he texts me, as he knows we are best friends. He texts me with concerns about her, if I didn't notice something weird about her. Well, I am a fairly nice guy and I know how he feels, so I reply. Especially when one of the break up reasons is Mark(very likely). We text for a bit about her. He asked me several questions about her, I answered as much as I could(I didn't know all the things). She was acting weirdly for the past week and we haven't(me and my best friend) discussed any topics on things about her. To be honest I wrote a few hyperbolic things on her to Jacob and agreed to few of his assumptions. For example, he assumed that she was on a date with Mark, because she was offline for 7 hours at evening(she was actually napping). I slightly agreed on his assumptions, as it seemed like the best thing to do. It wasn't an easy breakup for him. Jacob told me that he was still in love with her even after that. I was sympathetic towards him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, today she texts me angrily about exactly that. This happened after she read our convo on Jacob's phone, when they had met, and when Jacob went to toilet and left the phone. She seemed to take it pretty hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for talking behind my best friend's back with her recent ex? What are your opinions?",

      "description": "I love to go to raves and edm shows, I love the culture, and the openess at these events.  I will not lie or try to humble brag, but I love my body, I work out and lift 5 days a week, and I feel blessed for having some of the features I have. I get lots of compliments on my body, I love showing it off and wearing cute sexy costumes to these events.  Normally I'll wear pasties with a mesh shirt and very showy booty shorts, or cute lingere, so I am definantly one of the most underdressed ladies at these events. In the past when I had a different group Ithey had no issues with what I was wearing. Now I am in another group, and most of the guys in the group have girlfriends, which is cool. Im not a flirty person nor do I want to deal with someone trying to sleep with me when Im just trying to party and enjoy the show. I am pretty strict with how I interact with guys in relationships, and Id never dream of so much as flirting with a guy who I know is taken. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue is with this new group is one of the girlfriends (T) of a guy (L) in the group saw a group picture of us. According to L , T pointed out the way I was dressed was innapropriate for her boyfriend to be in close contact with, and how she doesnt feel comfortable with her boyfriend being around a girl who is basically naked and single, while being inhebriated. Her boyfriend does stare once and awhile at me and the other girls at the venue but that is none of my concern. Last week T asked me if I could dress more modestly at the next show, she said that while I look amazing she doesnt feel comfortable with L hanging out in group with a girl who is basically topless. I let T know I'd think about it but it is not my responsibility to keep her boyfriends eyes in check nor should I change for how she feels.  T told me that she just wants to be the prettiest girl in her boyfriend's eyes and its hard when she sees him looking at girls who look better then her. I feel bad how the way I dress is hurting T but I also feel like it isnt my responsibility to accomidate her and buy new clothes. T also argued that dressing in lingerie and pasties is indirectly flirting because the clothes are meant to entice, not for utility.  My group is mixed on what to do but they are very annoyed by T, and they also know I'd never flirt muchless fuck a guy in a relationship. But they seem to want the issue resolved so T stops feeling bad. \n\nTL;DR: Taken girl in my rave group is insecure and wants me to stop wearing sexy clothes to raves. ",

      "description": "The four of us were on a road trip to a nearby city and on the way, the three of them decided to smoke a cigarette. My two of my friends are smokers and the third is usually not. I hate cigarettes. I hate the smell, and just being around them. Both of my grandparents are dying because they smoked their entire lives. I’m ok with being around them while they’re smoking outside, but I was stuck in the car with that and had no ability to get out. I’m sitting there breathing through my hoodie when my one friend (the one who barely smokes) turned around and blew his smoke at me. At first I was saying “fuck you” in a jokingly matter, but I got serious and snapped when he didn’t stop and starting flicking the cigarette towards me. I was yelling a little bit and said “You know that shit bothers me”. Later I apologized for yelling at him but he didn’t apologize for taunting me. My one friend said that it was fucked up for him to do that but the other said I need to respect that they smoke (when they all have vapes too, so there’s no excuse for having to smoke around me) and that I should make other plans for spring break. All I’m asking is that they’re respectful and not smoke around me. AITA?",

      "description": "Ohh boy this whole thing has been a rollercoaster. Where to begin...\n\nI live with 4 people. One of my roommates and I do not get along. At all. Despite this, we have a lot of mutual friends, so we often end up hanging out together. \n\nA couple nights ago, my friends and I all go out  She's there too. We go out to a local restaurant/bar and just generally have a good time. Recently, my ex and I broke up. While we were eating, me and the girl (let's just call her Sarah) got into a disagreement. I'll spare the details, but it essentially lead her to say: \"Wow, no wonder your ex broke up with you.\" That got some looks from the group, but I decided to keep quiet about it. The night carried on. I was pissed.\n\nWe decide to head back home. The way our carpooling worked, it was just me and her in her car, with her as the driver. She had a couple drinks at the restaurant... this will be relevant soon.\n\nWhile we were in the car, I did not say a damn thing to her. As we were driving home, I saw blue lights flashing behind us. I could not keep from laughing a bit. When we stopped, the police officer came up to us he and Sarah were talking. Then a great idea came to mind:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \"Excuse me officer... I feel obligated to tell you that my friend was drinking earlier. I do not feel safe.\" In reality, she was probably going about 7 or 8 over the limit. Her driving was fine. But I just about had it with her.\n\nsarah gave me the dirtiest look, then the cop told her to step outside. Sobriety test was okay, but we live in a state where she needs to take a breathalyzer if asked... and she did. She blew barely over the legal limit. Cue the arrest and me calling an uber.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo am I the asshole here? My friends don't know the full story yet- basically that I snitched on her. She is facing a world of trouble right now.",

      "description": "TLDR: My ex shows almost 0 interest in his 4year old son despite me and my SO strongly encouraging him to be more active in the kid's life (at least more than 4 nights a month!). Every time my son comes back from his father's, he's a right \"C. U. N.ext. T.uesday\" for at least a week, and it's wrecking havoc on our lives. I want to tell my ex that he needs to be more involved or get the F\\*\\*\\* out, Would doing so make me an asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory:\n\nMy ex, J, and I had only been dating for 3 months when we moved in together, and living together for 3 weeks before I fell pregnant. It was a big surprise for us as I had been informed I was infertile due to a medical issue. I told J there was absolutely no way I would be getting an abortion as I had always wanted to be a mother, and he was VERY displeased. He barely spoke to me for the next few days, but after that proceeded to support me through the pregnancy as would be expected. By the time our son had come along, I was devoted to J and thought he felt the same about me, but I was very wrong. Our relationship was very strained and we fought a lot. I had very bad post natal depression but did the best I could - J showed no interest. When our son was 3 months old, J was at work and asked me to email him something from his account, so I went to do so. Our son was teething (Very early!) and was quite upset so I had to hold him to keep him calm. As I went to click \"Compose\" in J's inbox, our son kicked my arm and sent the mouse flying across the screen to click \"sent\".\n\nTo say I was 'enlightened' was an understatement.\n\nHis Sent mail was filled with conversations with other women, nudes, details of hook ups, etc, as well as several emails from at least 3 different dating sites. I literally threw up when I saw that one email was from a dating site confirming his new advertisement - listed the day I was in labor with our son.\n\nOur relationship proceeded to crash even further down hill, but I thought I loved this man so I was determined to make it work. He promised he would never cheat on me again, and I stupidly believed him. This continued at least 8 times over the next year, with me being a complete dumbass and believing him every single time. He still showed little to no interest in his son, aside from what he felt he was obligated to do. If I asked for him to watch his son one day a week so I could have some time to myself, he threw a massive fit saying he needs his own time too etc etc (Granted, I was a stay at home mum and spent literally every moment caring for our child).\n\nAfter a while I decided to make an account on the dating sites he was a member of, and check out his profile. Every single one listed him as single with no children, and I was shocked. There is some more info I could go into here about one of the girls messaging me but I wont go that far off topic.\n\nAnyway, after another few months I finally got sick of it. I had been offering him an open relationship the whole time and he had refused every time. I was not upset about him having sexual relationships with other people, if he wanted that I would have been fine with it - it was the constant lying to my face I couldn't stand. I finally got my shit together and decided this was a terrible environment for me to raise our child in (as we were fighting almost constantly), so I told him that he had to choose between them or us, and he chose them.\n\nSo my son and I moved into my mother's place that same day, and had a place of our own by the following week. My son was one and a half years old at this point. It took several weeks of talking with my ex to sort out custody, as he wanted to have no more than every second weekend. I thought that he should have his son every weekend, as a child that age grows quickly and a week is a really long time to be without a parent when you're a toddler. He refused, saying he needed time to hang out with his friends and doctors appointments etc.\n\nMind you, he could go before or after work, or just you know... take his son. But that was unacceptable (Even though I had to do the same every single day!!).\n\nMy son's first sentence was \"I miss daddy.\"\n\nFast forward a few years and I'm in a new relationship with a wonderful man, and pregnant with his child. We decide to move in together, and the most cost-effective place near my SO's work just so happened to be in the same housing complex as my ex. It was awkward, but I stupidly thought this might give J more time with his son, as I was previously living half an hour away by drive and neither of us had a car.\n\nWell, I was wrong. Very wrong.\n\nThe apartment my SO and I ended up getting was literally two streets away from J, and he had to walk past our house to and from the train station for work every single day. I encouraged J to come over, or to stop in and see his son for a few minutes after work, or hell, even wave to him in the window as he walked past every now and then, but he refused. By this point our son was 3, and utterly adored his dad. Every time he came back from his 2 nights at his dads, he was a right little asshole. He would be aggressive, throw things, scream, and proceed to beg to see his dad every ten minutes, non stop. It broke my heart and has made things incredibly difficult. I told J this, he did not respond. Any time I communicate with J about our son, maybe about 5% of the time he will actually ever respond. He will read it, and if I ask him about it in person he will give me a half arsed reply along the lines of \"oh yeah I saw that\" but still never actually respond. Despite this, I still never talked shit about J anywhere there was a chance my son could hear. If I wanted to say something, I would type it, as my son was not yet able to read. My son loves his dad, and I wanted to give him the chance to make up his own mind about who he is as a person.\n\nAfter a few more months of this I got pissed. Maybe it was the pregnancy hormones or maybe I'm just a bitch, but I sent a major rant to J. I told him it was freeking ridiculous that he lived so close and continued to ignore his child, even so much as walking past us without saying hi when we were swimming in the communal pool or at the local shopping centre. I told him that what he was doing was not only causing us a hell of a lot of stress, but was breaking our son's heart, because every single time he said he wanted to see daddy I had to say no, and because I wasn't going to talk shit about him, I couldn't exactly give him a reason except \"Daddy is busy\". As per usual, J never replied. I didn't get to ask him about it in person that custody time as I was having a tough time with the pregnancy, but 3 weeks later he still had not made any effort to reply to the messages I had sent, so I sent another slightly more politely worded saying that I understand that I came across as aggressive but I just want the best for our son.\n\nAnother week later, he still hadn't replied. So I asked him about it in person.\n\n\"Oh, yeah, I saw that.\" He replied nervously, and then walked off before I had a chance to continue the conversation.\n\nAfter even more probing he finally replied with saying that he would try to find some time around work to do that.\n\nKeep in mind, I wasn't asking him to come over and spend hours with his son - all I wanted was a simple 5 minute phone call, once a week. Or a hug or hi five with his son on the way home from work occasionally. I let it go, and more months passed with absolutely nothing changing. I brought it up one more time and after a couple of weeks he replied saying \"sorry work is hectic\".\n\nI get that some people work hard, but he's a programmer, has two girlfriends, and lives literally a minute walk away from us. I really don't see how he could have been too busy to spend 5 minutes with his son.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrent:\n\nJ has just moved away to the city, over an hour train ride away (Mind you, we've been looking at new places too but were trying to stay CLOSE for custody, but whatever). He still only sees his son every two weeks. Our son is 4 and a half now, and his aggression when coming home from his dads have gotten even worse. He now also throws things, breaks toys and objects, and hits his 1 year old baby sister, as well as biting other kids at school and a whole range of other major emotional outbursts. I've tried talking to him, getting him to express his emotions in other ways, etc, but it never works. It makes me feel like one hell of a shitty parent because during this time my son is a right asshat. After about a week or so though he calms back down and is a real dang sweetheart of a kid... for the next few days until he goes to his dads again. It's really exhausting. It's bad for our family and it's bad for the baby.\n\nJ just doesn't seem to understand, and by this point, I've really had enough. I want to tell him that he needs to call our son at LEAST once a week, or I am going to take full custody, because if he's not going to shape up then he can ship out, as I can't handle the strain this is putting on my life and my household. It really is making me feel like I Either need full custody or no custody, and I really don't want to lose my son (and I know my ex would never take him in full time anyway, he's too 'busy').\n\nSo, Would I Be the Asshole for demanding he contact our son at least once a week, and then taking full custody when he fails to do so?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I have already offered taking full custody multiple times but he has refused, though he has not given any reason. I believe he may simply feel 'obligated' about it despite me being very casual about it and saying full custody is what I want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: UPDATE**\n\n**(TLDR Version: I spoke to him, it went well, and he plans to video call several times a week).**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Longer Version:**\n\nI spoke",

      "description": "My mother’s health is not the best. She deals with high blood pressure from alcoholism, no exercise (she gets out of breath just standing up), and poor diet consisting of fast food, soda, and sweets one would find in the snack aisles. \n\nYet she always insists on coming with my father and me to stuff that requires physical exertion, such as a festival, the beach, museum, or a company picnic. Every time we take her to those places, she is dead weight. Always complaining about it being hot, her being hungry, or having to walk. We always end up leaving early and just going back home. \n\nTo me, it doesn’t make sense for her to go if all she will ever do is complain and force us to cancel or leave early. This weekend is a company picnic, and she insists on going. I told her she can’t go if she doesn’t start caring about her health. Stop buying soda by the gallons. Stop drinking wine every night. Go to the mail box a few times a day. Instead of eating one meal a day made up of crappy junk food, eat three meals with healthy food. Of course I get the “I’m the parent you’re the child” argument. But if she truly wants to start doing stuff with my dad and me, she needs to start working on a healthier lifestyle. We’re done with her coming along only to drag us down. ",

      "description": "I, 29F have been talking online for over a year to a 36F Korean in the USA and he has in the past admitted to holding racist views towards black people. We talked and he agreed that he was wrong but that he was really hurt from all the bad experiences he had with black people and that he had never met a black person who didn’t do something bad either to him or another person. I said this was very unfortunate but those were bad people and there is no way to defend his statement that a whole community or race were bad. He agreed that he would educate himself, that he would start to try and see humans as individuals and work on becoming a better person. I asked him to never speak to me about these things again. It could take a while before he could change his views, I didn’t really want to be subjected to those views. Tonight we were having one of our late night conversations on the phone,i was quiet and sleepy,so he was reading some jokes online, and they were only jokes about black people. At one point i got a little creeped out and said have you literally just googled black jokes because thats weird. He then said that the world was very comfortable making fun of and “walking all over” asians, yet no one calls out black people for “their shit”. Then, he said and i quote:\n\n“Well, its gonna happen soon, asians are gonna deal with these blacks, we’re gonna be the Nazis all over again, they’ll see.”\n\nAt this point I said wait a second, take a step back and think about what you just said. I was horrified, shocked, sad and ANGRY but i tried to stay very calm, I felt like I had to show this person that their views were terrifying and wrong. I asked to revisit what he said,asked if he could explain what he meant and what he knew about “Nazis”. He started losing his temper and accused me of trying to make him look bad.\nI said that he really crossed the line with basically saying that he wished for a genocide. He said everyone wanted that and i was lying about not sharing his views! He was shouting so I hung up the call. He then continued the conversation via text and said:\n\n“U really have ur way of literally pushing my buttons I've never ever met anyone that made me so angry as much as you I'll be very honest You truly are somethin, I could literally say something And throw u off and u disregard the whole history of my existence, Fake as fuck Think what u want it's really pathetic U make me feel so low, Make me feel like a criminal a monster U would point fingers at me when the world does too U don't see why I said that and just going off of what I said As someone special to you I would think why he said that U must think I'm a murderous person just by saying that make me feel disgusted and point fingers at me I'd still defend u saying you're not this person that they got it all wrong but you're different”\n\nAm I an asshole for taking his comment so seriously? To be clear, he hasn’t denied meaning it literally nor has he attempted to explain it or clarify.",

He hasn’t stopped saying that they need to get me one even though I’ve kept telling him that I’m fine, I don’t want a girlfriend anymore. He gets mad when I say this saying that I’m only saying this because I don’t want to date someone who’s been with a lot of dudes (more than like 6-7) and tells me to grow up. So am I the asshole for telling him that it doesn’t matter why I don’t want to date anymore and he should fuck off? Honestly I’m so tired of people telling me I should date or that I won’t care about numbers when I meet he right girl. I’ve stopped wanting to date because everyone I’ve met has derided me over how I feel or has been with like 10+ partners and I’m not down for that. So AITA?",

      "description": "Right now, I'm currently attending a dance show in which my sister is participating. The rest of the family bought tickets and we got a few seats in the front row, next to the stage.\n\nApparently, the front row was used to easily get from one end of the room to the other, as the other alternative was a few seconds longer, and hey everybody was doing it so it was fine right? Even when the show started, people kept going through that row, blocking the entire view. Some even stopped and just stood there.\n\nI wouldn't have gotten mad if ir weren't for the fact that dozens of people kept going through that row and blocking my view. I decided to protest by putting my legs up front, using my intended leg room to the fullest. Now people had to \"jump over\", as in make a bigger step than usual. Some people even stood right there waiting to move my legs.\n\nOne woman commented that I should put my legs back and let people go. When I told her that, in a civilized society, people would just take a different route as to not disturb other attendees, she said that no one would take the longer one.\n\nI feel pretty pissed, to say the least.",

So when he added me on facebook, I checked his profile. \n\nThere I discovered that he mainly post about anti-immigration, anti-lgbt, anti-muslim, and typical extreme right wing stuff. Although, he doesn't spout the hateful stuff that typically comes with these kind of posts; it is more of reposts of articles, text images, memes, and other facebook group posts. For context, I am an immigrant, and I'm also gay.\n\nOne day, my friend from choir and I were talking, and he brought him up because he was affecting my friend in terms of singing as he's not doing that well and it is distracting my friend. I brought up his facebook, and the news spread through my circle of friends after that: of why we shouldn't like him.\n\nI've been very cold but cordial interacting with him ever since. There were also instances where I shared his views to two other friends whom I'm close to but are outside of my circle. They both knew of him, and both told me that he seemed sweet and harmless. He still is. He is still friendly towards me, so AITA for badmouthing him for his views even when  he had done nothing but be friendly with me?",

      "description": "okay, i’ve been thinking about posting this on here for a while now, but i’ve been kinda nervous. i feel like a huge bitch for being upset about this, but at the same time i feel like it’s partially justified. i just need to hear an objective opinion.\n\n\nanyway, lets get into it. my boyfriend and i have been together for a bit over two years and we’ve lived together for 8-9 months. i love him a lot, which is why i feel so guilty about being upset about this.\n\nmy boyfriend didn’t have a working phone until right after we moved in together (he had an iphone that he could text with if he had wifi, but he didnt have service or anything). we haven’t really texted much in our relationship because we would mostly just skype or facetime and talked there.\n\na running joke in our friend group is if you have to reach him, text me, because he never answers. i know his reasoning for not answering, and so do our closest friends, and those reasons do not apply to me or our closest friends.\n\nsometimes i’ll text him if i need to say something while we’re in a public situation (it could vary from me just asking him if he’s okay if i notice he seems upset, to me asking if he wants to hang out with friends later). there are other times i text him, obviously, but in these situations i can actually see why he never replies to my texts. he’ll be on his phone, playing a game or scrolling instagram, and he either swipes up the text or just waits until the notification goes away on its own. even in times where i’ve texted him telling him i’m not feeling well and need his support (anxiety, y’all) and he still swipes them up. maybe he doesn’t read what it says before he swipes them up, because he is a huge sweetheart usually and i cant see him purposely ignoring something like that ? sometimes i ask him to check his texts if he ignores my text, and he always seems a little upset when i ask him to.\n\na couple people i’ve asked told me to talk to him about it, and i did, but he thought i was trying to start conflict. i explained that i wasn’t, but he said it was the way i worded it that made it seem that way. i thought over it, but i don’t understand how, because i tried to be really sweet and i reassured him that i wasn’t angry or anything like that, i just wanted to ask about why he is ignoring them and to tell him how it made me feel. im nervous to talk to him about it again, because i dont want to upset him or make him feel bad about it. \n\nAITA for being really hurt about this? maybe i’m being childish, i don’t know. should i ignore it and get over it, or try to talk to him about it again?\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend ignores my texts. AITA for feeling hurt about it?\n\n(i’ll probably delete this after the discussion dies, bc i dont want my boyfriend to find this and get hurt. i really dont want to make him feel bad)",

      "description": "Some context...\n\nI've been dealing with security issues with my boyfriend for a while now. We've known each other for about 10 years, and we've been dating, with a little break in the middle, for 3 years. He finally gave me exclusivity a little more than 2 years ago, but I found out in June that this wasn't entirely truthful and he's been on Grindr and craigslist looking for hookups pretty consistently. He succeeded a few times. After I caught him, he was transparent and admitted everything and did the whole, \"it was stupid, it didn't mean anything, you're the only one for me\" bit. I told him that, in order for us to continue, he has to work to help improve my security with him. That and time are the only way the only way I can really ever regain trust, I told him.\n\nImmediately after, we saw a counselor for a couple sessions and  I saw some improvement. But then, we were unable to continue due to scheduling issues. We've had several issues that become bigger fights, because, how I see it... When he does something that makes me question his consideration of me, I bring it up in the least inflammatory way I can, \"when you do this, it makes me feel this,\" and the usual responses I get are: \"you're being too sensitive\" or \"you shouldn't feel that way because &lt;reasons&gt;\".  In these situations I communicate that all I want is consideration here, and that I want to know is that his intentions aren't to hurt or at the very least, an apology. He says, \"I thought you knew me better, you should just know that I'm not here to hurt you.\"\n\nLately, it's gotten to the point that when I express that I didn't enjoy something that he's done, he says \"I'm tired of this, I feel beaten down, I've given all I can give.\" His only major contribution when I question what he's done for me is \"I came out \\[of the closet\\] for you\". It feels unfair because I've been out of the closet the whole time for him, as well as I don't think it's right to make someone feel indebted to you for an action that should really be about benefiting the person who's doing it. \n\nThe latest issue that I'm really asking the AITA about is a fairly simple one. Last year I stayed at his place for the Super Bowl and I wanted to spend the whole game with him. In order to do this, I had to take off of work the following day, because I wanted to enjoy that experience with him and we live 3.5 hours away from each other. Fast forward to now and he's visiting me for the super bowl weekend. After avoiding the question about whether he's staying for the super bowl several times, he says point-blank \"I'm going to leave early from your place so I can make the super bowl from home\". Now, I didn't anticipate him jumping to taking off of work the following day to stay with me like I had done. Also, I understand he enjoys football much more than I do - but I definitely enjoy the social aspect of the super bowl and I've always spent it with significant others. I express \"considering it's possible for you to spend the super bowl with me, it makes me feel like you don't want to be with me when you make it seem as though you're in a rush to get out of here\". He used to wake up all of last year at 4am from Savannah, GA to make it home to Charlotte, NC on Monday mornings, so I knew it was something he was somewhat used to. He argues and gets mad, claiming \"it's never about what I want, and I want to go home and watch the super bowl from home.\" \n\nI concluded the argument by saying, \"if you really want to do that, I need you to recognize that that disappoints me because it conflicts with what I wanted. I need to know that you attempted to consider options where you met both of our wants and needs... That's just being considerate.\" I never demanded that he not watch the super bowl, and I communicated several times that I don't want that option to be considered. I just wanted him to put effort in to try and watch it with me, and, at the very least, be sweet/considerate if he's going to watch it somewhere else. He told me that was \"unreasonable\" and \"you're asking for too much\" because it's what he wants to do.  \n\nAITA for expecting this treatment? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "A few days ago I was walking home in my neighborhood with my sister and we heard animals fighting, and when I turned around to look it was a pair of stray dogs that were attacking a feral cat. This cat is one that my sister considers to belong to her (she feeds it sometimes but it won't come within 20 feet of any people so I think it's not really \"her cat\" but she says it is). She kept screaming at me to do something and stop them but I just froze and honestly I didn't care enough about it to fight some stray dogs. When we got home my sister wouldn't stop crying and told my parents what happened and now mom wants me to go to therapy so I can \"get help with my obvious empathy problems before I hurt someone\". My dad told me privately later that he doesn't think I should have fought the dogs but he won't object to however my mom wants to handle it.\n\nIs something really wrong with me? Like I feel bad, but more I feel bad about not feeling bad than actually feel bad about the cat dying, like I know my sister wouldn't care if it was a raccoon or squirrel or something that died instead of a cat. My sister told me she hopes that I get jumped by a gang so she can watch me die and she hasn't said anything else to me since it happened (3 days ago). For context I am 16 and not really that athletic so I don't even really know if I could fight 2 dogs, I would probably try to if they were biting a person but I don't think I would for an animal unless it was my pet.\n\ntldr I was afraid to fight dogs that were killing a cat and now my mom and sister are mad at me.

      "description": "So I was supposed to go to this birthday party next week however, its on the same day as a soccer game I am supposed to go too. I am already missing an important soccer game for my best friends birthday and my dad who is the soccer fanatic let me go but made a big deal about it. He said that I cannot miss next game at all costs no matter what. \n\nNow, my parents didn't know about the party until I announced it to them a week before the party because I only found out about it then, and they said that It's a no go because the whole family is going to this one specific game. However, the people at school are not happy about this because apparently the person who is hosting the party is going to be \"heart broken\" and that I am a huge asshole for not being able to go. The thing is they don't understand that I have no control over my family activities since we are from a European background and whenever you disagree with you're father on something he is going to bring the belt out. However, the people at school have been giving me negative vibes that make me feel unwelcome because of something that I do not have any control over The thing is, it's not like I am intentionally trying to get out of the party. I really want to go especially since I rarely get invited to places. But they just can't grasp the idea that I do not have any control over the situation. \n\nbtw i'm 17 years old",

      "description": "Hey fellow assholes! Alt account; my friend might see this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout two years ago, my best friend told me his longtime girlfriend had confessed to cheating on him several times with a guy at work. I didn't ask too much about this other guy, but later found out from a mutual friend that the Other Man is married and the cursory Facebook sleuthing I had done to identify the guy was accurate. My BFF and his girl tried to work through it but eventually broke up, and nobody ever told the Other Man's wife about the dalliance. My BFF doesn't want to get involved and is just over the whole thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Based solely on social media, admittedly,) This guy's wife appears to be a TOTAL GODDAMN SWEETHEART. She has posted (not constantly/braggingly or annoyingly) some photos with her husband and seems 100% gaga over him. She is endlessly positive and adores her husband, who she's been with for over a decade. I don't know this woman and I don't have any particular emotional attachment to her end of the situation (I'm female, married, never been cheated on to my knowledge), but my heart breaks for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: WIBTA for sending her an anonymous message advising her of her husband's long-ago affair? Asshole because I suspect it might be to absolve myself of guilt for knowing about it all this time. Asshole because maybe he just did it with this one person to get it out of his system (I suspect he &amp; wife were high school sweethearts or something), and I don't want to potentially blow up their lives just to make myself feel better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHANKS!",

      "description": "I (20/M) am studying abroad in Lodz, Poland, through europe's Erasmus program. My girlfriend (20/F) of 7 months is coming to visit me from our home country for one week in April. \n\nShe wants me to take her to Auschwitz because it is one of her dreams to visit the camp. We both agreed that it is dangerous for her to go alone, both for security reasons and because she doesn't know how to use public transports to get where she needs to be (I am already used to it so I know how to do it). I do not want to go to the concentration camp with her because I have already visited it last weekend in a group trip prepared for some erasmus students and I paid around 100€ for that weekend. It seems unwise for me to go again 1 month later considering that: I will be busy with work assignments; all the costs to get there; the money that I will spend that could be used for me to visit other places like I have already semi planned.\n\n\n\nImportant things to consider: \n\n- Right now I have very little money to live off of for the remainder of the semester (around 600€ for 3 and a half months, not considering rent which is 150€/month). I got most of the scholarship's money at the beginning of the semester and I will receive the other part after the semester ends, but that money is already destined for other stuff (I have some physical problems and I will use the money to pay for doctors appointments and whatever is needed to fix me. Also, I need to buy a new laptop because mine is getting pretty old, although still functional).\n\n- I always knew it was her dream to visit the camp and I would like her to fulfil her dream. However, because of money problems from her side, we were never sure if she could actually come visit me, so I never really kept in mind that I needed to save some money to go with her or that I should not have gone on that weekend trip just so that I could go with her later.\n\n- She has the possibility to go with some family members that are also coming for a visit but she doesn't want to go with them. She wants to go with me for 2 reasons: -She doesn't want to spend 1 day of that week far from me because we have already been apart for 3 months. In my opinion this isn't a good reason because 1. I will be going home for one week after she is here and 2. because we will have time in the future to be together but she probably won't have the opportunity to visit Auschwitz in the future. -She wants it to be an experience shared by both of us so that it will be remembered in the future.\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA here?",

      "description": "I’m  19, haven’t been to college yet (took a gap year that turned into a couple because I’m poor) working full time while I completely lose myself to my mental illnesses and addictions. I don’t have the money time or effort to take care of myself. I’m battling my own demons that are the worst they’ve ever been and at the same time am expected to handle the problems of my 56 year old mother. \n\nShe is on disability for her illnesses, she’s blind in one eye and has limited vision in the other. She was diagnosed with Dependent Personality Disorder in the psychiatric unit. The psychiatrist indicated that she was dependent on me and she completely refused the idea. She refuses to take care of herself and go to the doctors she needs to go to because of her extreme agoraphobia, refuses any sort of assistance I try to give her because it’s not the assistance she wants. All the while telling me I never try to help her and I’m a horrible child, not her son, a cow, loser, bitch, pig, whore, etc, the list is endless. \n\nI have been literally begging her to get an aide, but every time she replies “I don’t need an aide, I have a son” \n\nShe constantly takes advantage of me, opened a credit card under my name without my knowledge right when I turned 18 because she was homeless and destroyed my credit before I even built one with a $400 credit card bill. She forces me to give her my own money, has the utilities under my name because she owes the companies money herself. She still receives child support for me and I have to beg for $10 of it to see any. She’s the most manipulative, and emotionally abusive person I’ve ever met. \n\nShe has completely driven me away from her to the point where I barely speak to her which is extremely difficult in a 750 sqft apartment, to which I’m told i’m neglectful and abusive, I’m committing elder abuse by not helping her to all of her doctors appointments and going to walk and get her cigarettes at 10pm after a 7 hour shift, not finding her providers to help with her eye, everything that should be being helped with by a caretaker as I literally have not had 5 minutes to start my life and I’m 19 years old. I don’t even have my GED yet because I’ve been so busy running away from home, being homeless and trying to evade the stress by partying and doing drugs. I desperately want to get my GED and go to college to get a degree in Psychology. \n\nI’m almost financially stable enough to move out with my boyfriend, but I’m having such a hard time surviving while I’m here because of the way she treats me. I’m stuck with this guilt that tears me to pieces because I know somewhere inside me I should have empathy for her and WANT to help her, so I do believe her when she manipulates me into thinking it’s all my fault.\n\nShe even makes facebook posts about me all the time complaining about the way I apparently mistreat her when I’m really just trying to start my life. \n\nDoes it make me an asshole to want to leave and never look back?

      "description": "Context: My town has low, low tolerance for slurs of any kind and more. This is partly because a couple of years ago, a closeted gay student killed himself due to bullying that included repetition of the f-slur and more. \n\nLast year, my school even received multiple bomb threats because the school administration didn’t punish a white student who called another student the hard n-slur. So yeah.\n\n\nA couple of nights ago me and my friends were out eating ice cream after a movie. At this point it’s 11PM and we’re all pretty tired (and emotionally devastated), so we just want somewhere quiet and nice to hang out. \n\nAll of a sudden, a group of middle school boys (one of them was wearing their ID on a lanyard lol) come in and instantly start surrounding the three of us that are girls. Immediately all of them all start talking at once and making comments about our hair or our clothing, and one of them starts calling me a black girl (I’m very clearly Asian) and refers to me as “my n——a”.\n\nIt was funny at first, given that we’re all high school seniors and just assumed these kids were trying to act cool, but they start throwing out even more slurs and joking around about trans, LGBTQ people and the like. \n\nAt some point, it just gets outright annoying. I take out my phone to check the time and all of a sudden they start trying to grab it from me, so we all just stand up and leave. \n\nWhen I got home, I told my other friends the story, but a lot of them started getting really mad at me and calling me an asshole for not telling them off, or telling them that “they shouldn’t be throwing around that kind of language” since by doing nothing, we may have just “encouraged a group of middle school boys to grow up thinking they can get away with anything”. \n\nIn that kind of situation I didn’t think it was  appropriate for me to all of a sudden start lecturing them, especially considering the fact that I’m not much older. But because of the negative background our town has with this kind of stuff, I can still see where they’re coming from. \n\nAITA for not telling off offensive middle schoolers to act better for their age? Should I have tried to correct their behavior? ",

      "description": " Okay so a bit of backstory is necessary for this story. A few months ago (summer of 2018) two of my best friends(I had been friends with them for over 5 years) that didn't know each other at the time decided to enroll into colleges into a another country. At first i didn't know that they were gonna stay at the same town until they were looking for a place to live. They were having a hard time finding a place for one, so i told each girl that the other one is looking for a place to live at the same time, so they contacted each other and found a place to live together the same day. \n\nFast forward a couple of months forward and turns out one of them, let's call her Jane, is a terrible roommate. She was a bitch to the other friend, who i'll call Suzy, and overall a terrible roommate. They got into a lot of fights and i got a lot of rants. This was news to me because i saw Jane as nothing less than a best friend. Then Suzy told me something about Jane that involved me as well. The first time Jane came back to our home town after she had left for college, she hadn’t contacted me. When i found out i was devastated because i didn't get to see her. I confronted her about it, and she apologized and told me she was getting documents ready for dropping out and was a mess because of that. Of course i was okay with this, so we made amends, and all was fine until Suzy told me she was done with Jane's shit and didn't wanna hide something from me. As we were talking she goes: \"You do know that Jane forgot about you that time she came back right?\". This struck me as quite a surprise and i asked to explain to me what she had meant. \"Well when she got back, i was asking her how her trip went and she started complaining about how no one wanted to go out with her. At this point i asked her about you. She just stopped, laughed and said she forgot about you.\" This of course hurt me, and i told Suzy i support her all the way with the fights and everything. I wanted to confront Jane and figure everything out, but that would put Suzy in a bad spot. After that i was acting very cold towards Jane, but i still didn't cut her out completely out of my life. Well yesterday night i was talking to Suzy, and she sent me a message saying she needed to tell me something important but would like to do it in person(she is not coming back for a month or so). I begged her to tell me what was up, and she told me she had a problem with me because i was still talking to Jane. She said i had to pick between her and Jane. She got all defensive, saying that Jane was toxic and i NEED to cut her out or she would stop being friends with me. Again i get her side, but i'm not the type of person to just cut out people. I told her i needed time to think through everything and I understand the part about Jane being toxic, but I don’t want to cut her off just because Suzy conditioned me to do that.",

      "title": "AITA for helping my friend ask someone he likes to prom, even if it’s in spite of someone else",
      "description": "Throwaway account.\n\nSo the title may not seem so saucy, but this has recently happened and me and my two friends have been painted as villains and I wanted some outside perspectives. \n\nIt’s gonna be a long one.\n\nSo I have to explain some stuff here. I have two friends, they are my best friends, A and B. We form this trio, sort of. We’re seniors. We have these two friends, C and D. C is a girl, and she really likes D, like a lot. D is a guy, and he likes her on some level, isn’t ready for a relationship/doesn’t know if he wants one/etc, but he definitely wanted to ask her to prom. Problem is, we have one more friend, E, who wanted D to take her to prom.\n\nSo recently we were on a very high floor of a skyscraper in Chicago, and we were able to see all of the city at night, the lights, it was beautiful.  D and C have been subtly flirting (atleast they think it’s subtle, A, B, and I are all older than them by a year and know when we see it) D has expressed to A, B, and I that he wanted to ask her to prom (we had been trying to convince him to do so since we know they like eachother but they just needed that little push) Only problem was, E was under the impression D was going to ask her, because she told him she wanted him to and he didn’t say no. She doesn’t have any other prom date other than him. \n\nThis is why we thought he should ask C and not E.\n\nC really likes him, like genuinely has a crush on him, enjoys his presence, his personality. They’ve been flirting for a while, it’s been a long time coming. \n\nE has admitted that her primary reason for wanting to bring D to prom was to have someone to look good for an instagram picture. \n\nWe thought it was blatantly selfish of E to want him to take her to prom just so she could have an instagram picture, but that was besides the point. \n\nWe had a cute idea where he would fog up the window looking out towards the city, and write “Prom?” on it. He was scared and didn’t think it was good enough, he went to the window and had us distract her so he could write “Prom?” eight different times in eight different ways until he found the right one. He actually did it, they kissed, it was cute, we were happy for them, they seemed super happy.\n\nIncome the texts from E to A, B, and I.\n\nShe’s telling us that it was a shitty thing to do and that we didn’t consider her and that now she’s alone, etc.\n\nMy argument is that if D wanted to ask E he would have, but he wanted to ask C, so he did. Also, I didn’t ask C to prom, I didn’t do anything, A, B, and I merely helped out our friend who needed help doing something and we got dinged for doing so. Throughout this whole thing E’s never really considered what D wanted and who he wanted to ask, she’s only been focused on what she lost and what she wanted.\n\nAITA? (This refers to A, B, and I, we are essentially one party in this)",

      "description": "We’ve been dating 3 years living together for 1. She’s Filipino and and I’m White and we try and do a date night either Friday or Saturday every week. \n\nToday I get home and she wants to go out to eat tonight.  She said she wants to eat at this Filipino restaurant however I’m not a huge fan of the cuisine so I counter with some other cuisines (Japanese, thai, Italian, Mexican...) .  She says no to all of them and insists we go to the one Filipino place she wants.  I try to compromise with her to give me any other suggestions, but she’s stubborn and won’t change her mind and then gets mad at me for not wanting to eat it with her.  I’ve gotten Filipino food with her before maybe once a month but today I wasn’t really in the mood for it which is why I was suggesting other things.\n\nI counter with the fact that I love Indian food but she dislikes it so we never eat it together but that I’ll get it for myself which is totally fine.  She  then points out that it’s not the same since Filipino is her cultural cuisine and Indian is not mine.  She also says that I never cook Filipino and so she craves it and so I owe her to take her out.\n\nAgain I counter with I try to cook food both of us enjoy and if she doesn’t like my cooking then she can cook the food she likes and I can either eat it or make myself something else.  For added information we both work full time jobs so we don’t have too much time to cook during the week so it’s mainly leftovers or whatever’s quick. \n\nThis makes her angrier still and after more arguing I finally give in and tell her we can go to the Filipino restaurant.  Unfortunately she’s too upset with me so she no longer wants to go and cancels date night.\n\nSo AITA for arguing with her or am I justified?\n",

      "title": "AITA for keeping the baby?",
      "description": "So, my boyfriend, or ex boyfriend, or whatever he is at this point, met in Spain, when I lived alternatively with my son. I'll just call him bf from now on. It was hot love at first, but at some point we had an on and off relationship, mainly due to the fact that he doesn't like kids, and I had one. He loves to travel so there were many times we didn't see each other, regardless of when we were together romantically or not. \n\nIn one of our off times he went to Egypt, and was planning to stay away for a long time, to reevaluate his life. In that time, my son got taken off me by the Spanish child protection services. I could only get him back if I had a better living situation. When I told bf, he basically rushed over to support me. After less than 2 months of him being back, he forgot to pull out during my fertile days and I got pregnant.\n\nBf told me to get rid of it, but I really didn't feel good about that. I am basically pro choice but I was torn as for me, personally, it feels wrong. Bf was right about a lot of things, of course, it being maybe the worst time for us to have a baby. At some point he said \"it's your body,\" I think in an attempt to convince me to have an abortion. It did quite the opposite. I thought, yes, it is my body and if having an abortion doesn't feel right for me, then I have the right to keep it. I already had a kid, and I knew that once I had my living situation sorted out, I could definitely take care of this baby. \n\nBf was not happy. We still loved each other a lot but he says he cannot forgive me for the decision I've made. At one point he said he resented me for it. I told him it would've been a small decision on his end, to just have used a condom, or not to have had slept with me at all. It was a big decision on my end. The only thing I think I might've done wrong is not making it more clear beforehand that I would not want to have an abortion. Then maybe he would've been more careful. \n\nFast forward a while and I have my son back, I'm living in the Netherlands with my dad for the moment, and I've given birth to a beautiful daughter. Bf was at the birth and in the first weeks he was doing amazingly. He fell in love with his daughter and even changed her nappy sometimes, something he said he wouldn't do. I had no expectations, because I knew it was my decision and didn't want to force him to be there or anything. So needless to say, I was positively surprised.\n\nAfter a while, he went to England, which he was already planning to do. When he left we were actually still doing well together, and he loves his daughter a lot, despite it being a really big deal for him. But now we're off again and he says he doesn't trust me, he's afraid I'll do something to ruin his life, and he still can't forgive me for keeping the baby. Which leads me to ask the question: Am I the asshole for keeping the baby? \n\nIf you need any additional information, just ask. ",

      "description": "Firstly I'm on mobile so sorry for the format and secondly they will probably be some spelling errors sorry.\n\nEvery year I get around 5-6 night outs a year so I tend use them sparingly. \nLast night 3 of my friends (we'll call them F, K and JD) were hosting a party half way across the country from me so traveling was already a long process especially with British trains. \nI get there and it's going well till one of my friends  ( J) messages me, a few weeks ago her and another friend (E) had broken up but still lived together and E had taken Js sleeping bag that morning so she wouldnt come, bit of a dick move but ok we have spare blankets. \n\nThen they arrive and all night E was glaring at J, she couldn't sit next to someone without an issue. The mood was ruined completely around 10 when E just stared verbally ripping into J making her run into a different room. \n\nE explained her reason for it ( mainly it had been 3 weeks since they broke up, how dare J be 'cuddling' others in front of her, J wasn't of meant to come that night anyway, and Js aplogise for growing apart wasn't good enough) it was pretty tense and that's when someone from the other room (kat) came to get J a drink. And E forbid it! Saying J should only have coke becasue E didn't want her drinking. \n\nI left the room and headed to the other, stressed as hell. I explain to K and F that E won't let Kat bring J some rum, J gets mad and tries to go sort it out. We stop her and then Kat comes in and passes just the coke then goes to get E some crisp  BUT then J butts in to say E shouldnt be eatting if she's upset. \n\nIt was a shit show. Everyone was done\n\nLater Kat threw up, K and JD had to clean it up. F was staring off into space. E was still going on about J and J was staying away. \nWe got Kat home and tried to calm everyone down. At around 3 I left K and F to sleep and headed for the couch where I found E, JD and JDs girlfriend still going on about the drama. I had to be up at 10 for a train. JD and her girlfriend have their own room. Only E is sleeping in the living room with me. I told them calmly I need to sleep, I had a train but they just kept going on and on.\n\nAt least use the hall way. JD went to bed at 4am, now pissed off because her girlfriend was more interested in E than helping her get J on the floor so she could get into her bed. J slept on the floor. \n\nJDs girlfriend finally went to bed at 5am and I was livid. I turned off the light went to sleep and.... was woken up every hour by E sleep talking/crying. \n\nMorning comes and I go to get dressed but the room my bags in is locked because K had a lecture. Ok. He'll be back in an hour to open the door I can just catch the next train I think. \n\nF wakes up and opens it instead and the guy looks like hell. He didn't sleep well thanks to the stress.\nI get dressed and decide I'll get the 1:41 train.. that doesn't happen \n\nF gets dressed, K gets home. JD wakes up and E has been walking around for an hour. \n\nMe, F, and K clean while E does jack shit. J gets up and also doesnt help. I need to leave now to catch my train but neither K or F can help me get to the train station till everyone is ready to go and time is ticking on. \n\nI say at least 10 times that I need to leave. K and F also say the same but apparently YouTube is more important. \n\nFinally F decides I should get a taxi to the station and say my good byes. Still pretty pissed off I bring up that I would of preferred no drama and a good amount of sleep and E and J go \" dont look at use like that.\" In pure defence like I'm the one in the wrong so I tell them again that I very rarely have the time to go out which really upsets them and the others. I didn't say it in a cruel way all i said was \"I came here to relax and hang out not deal with more unneeded stress. I also really need to leave\"\n\nI got on the train at almost 4. I won't get home till 7. My mother is end stage COPD and needs me there. I promised id get home early. They all know this. \n\nI rang someone who couldn't make it to the party and told them why i angry and they said I should look at it from Es point of view more. \nWhen I told them it looked like it could of turned violent and I was worried for Js safety  I was told I shouldn't say that and I sound like a dick. \n\nAnd then on the train I messaged K and asked if anyone was upset with what I said, he told me yes and \n\"I think everyone was annoyed and just doesn't really want to talk about it maybe?\"  \n\nNow i feel like the asshole for being upset over everything. \n\nMaybe I really should of took E perspective into account more?

      "description": "I have  a few posts in r/raisedbynarcissists if you want a little more background. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*A few reasons why*: I'm on a band at my school and I felt like I was going to vomit because of how nervous I was. I opted to play 1/3 songs and she found out and yelled at me for being a disgrace to the family, saying anxiety wasn't an excuse. \n\nRecently, I was almost kicked out of the house because of how sick of me she was. No, I'm not old enough to live on my own. She was going to make me live with my dad who she knows cannot take care of me properly. My stepdad stopped her and didn't get any more involved. \n\nI have been in therapy for almost a year now and she nags me over it very often. She'll constantly switch between lightly congratulating me that I made progress and then flips around and lectures me.\n\nI was told to go back to my doctor to talk about medication options because my questionnaire choices were concerning to her. She never took me back. I know it's not necessary, but I really feel like it's something to consider, looking at the fact that I actually have made lots of progress (word from my therapist) but I still feel almost the same way.\n\nShe insults me a lot, occasionally threatening to beat me. I'm not sure if she would, but, eh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't trust her. People tell me a lot that she really is a great person but I honestly can't see that from my point of view. Yes, I admit there were times when I argued back with her in ways that weren't necessary. But is this behavior her fault, or do I deserve this? \n\nShe tries to ask me how I feel but at this point I refuse to tell her anything in detail, if anything at all. Is this wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This year Jessica has a car but both of us don't have time in the morning to shovel. When Jessica found out that the neighbor beat her to shoveling the driveway (it was now 11pm) she got angry and stormed off.\n\nSo I went and purchased a $25 gift card to the liquor store for Daniel on behalf of the both of us to say thank you because I was convinced Jessica wasn't going to thank him out of annoyance/frustration. \n\nWhen Jessica found out I bought the gift card with the intention of giving it to Daniel she got angry that I did it without asking. One of the reasons she used was that it's \"her neighbor\" but I told Jessica that for the time I'm staying here Daniel is equally my neighbor. Jessica further expressed that when I do things like that without asking it makes her feel insignificant. \n\nI don't want to use it as a justification for everything but she's been in Canada for 2 years now and I think isn't entirely use to people being \"neighborly\".\n\nAm I an asshole for buying the gift card without consulting Jessica?",

      "description": "So my father and I get in a lot of political or opinions based discussion, which sometimes escalates to arguments but we never really hold any grudges. We understand we have different opinions and are both willing to admit when the other is wrong (usually me because he is much more educated). Sometimes my mother gets involved in these discussions, and I disagree with her a lot, mostly due to religious and political standpoints. The issue is when I disagree with her and make a counterpoint, to which she responds with something along the lines of \"I have 30 more years of life experience than you, sometimes you have to just admit I'm right\". This usually confuses and angers me since she is unable to admit her fault or continue a civil discussion by making another point for her opinion and makes it seem like I'm disagreeing just to make her angry. \n\nA recent example of this was our discussion concerning the legalization of marijuana. I believe it should be available both medically and recreationally, while she believes it should be totally illegal. I brought up a point centered around the health detriments of weed versus alcohol, to which she said the before mentioned statement using her age as some sort of form of validity. I got especially annoyed with this and said something along the lines of \"Well you obviously didn't use those 30 extra years to learn how to not be so stubborn.\" This put her into a rant about how I argue with her just to make her mad, and everything I disagree with her on is purely out of spite. Admittedly, sometimes I may come off as somewhat snarky when I know I \"got her\" or have a very good counterpoint to which I know she will not be able to respond. Friends tell me she is somewhat narcissistic because of this, but my dad tends to defend her.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Every year my school holds an art contest. There's this girl that enters every single year (lets call her V). V is sort of an artsy student  but struggles with having confidence in her art. When the art contest comes around, V enters. The art V submits is absolutely amazing, \\*too amazing\\*. It was clearly drawn by someone else. It didn't even look like it was her art style. She ended up winning 1st place and my art that I had spent DAYS on, came in 3rd place. She bragged a whole damn lot about the art that wasn't hers. Words can explain how frustrated I was.\n\nFast forward 1 year and the art contest comes around again. I wasn't going to let V win again. So I made a plan. First I got one of the people in my friend group to talk to V and get her to admit that it wasn't her art (just to make sure). Then when she submitted it, I would sneak V's submission out of the pile and destroy it. V ended up confessing that it was her older sister's art.\n\nThe due date comes and as a crowd of people are submitting their art, I take V's submission and put mine in the pile. I quickly slipped V's submission into my bag and destroy it when I get home. I ended up winning. Later V asks the teacher leading the art contest why her submission wasn't there. Long story short the word comes around that V couldn't enter the art contest because her submission was gone. Immediately V starts blaming the friend that I asked to get V to confess. Now my innocent friend is getting blamed for what I did out of spite.\n\nI feel terrible, I'm not sure whether I'm the asshole or not. Reddit, I need your judgement.   ",

The divorce finally got settled about 2 months ago. \nThey do have a beautiful 3 year old daughter, I understand that he will always be a part of our lives.\nBut.... I feel like if the conversation isn't about their daughter then there's no need for them to have a conversation. I understand that he is the father to her daughter but besides that he is nothing to my gf. So why does she have to tell him where she going or who she with. I've voices my opinion to her on multiple occasions but she gets mad at me saying that I'm just being jealous. She has also told me that the reason that he asks her about where she is at and with who is because he is trying to show her that he still cares for her and hopefully get back together... So am I in the wrong for asking my gf to stop having daily conversation with her ex that have nothing to do about their daughter?",

She could do it by herself, but she has a history of anorexia and she’s currently underweight and weak. Her friends that live in town are weak and would probably be annoyed to help her this late or at all but I’m glad to help anytime. I told my dad earlier that I’d be helping her and he seemed fine with it. As I said, my sister is a procrastinator so it has been postponed from 6:30pm to 10:00pm. As a 16 year old I have school tomorrow and I’ll admit I have trouble getting to school on time but it’s only because I get away with it not because I can’t control it. I’m fine with going into school an hour late if there are no consequences besides detention. Anyways, I just told my dad that I’d be helping her at 10pm and he immediately got very angry saying that I need to go to bed and that he’ll help her. That would be fine but my sister hates being around my dad unless she’s in a good mood because he pisses her off easily. My dad should know this by now but still might not have realized it. Also my sister has a cat that he can’t find out about and her roommate wouldn’t want him there. He’s not letting me go and I might go anyways because I don’t want my underweight sister to lift things she’s barely capable of lifting and go through that bullshit. Am I the asshole? ",

One of our bosses is very arrogant and not involved in anything he deems below him. It can take a toll on the work dynamic. Couple days ago he was on his way to the other store and I asked politely if he could bring with him 2 very small boxes of product that had come to the wrong store. He rolled his eyes at me so I possibly too quickly remarked “Oh unless they’re too heavy for you” (the boxes are tiny, not much bigger than a rubix cube).  He didn’t react other than taking the boxes with him when he went to the other store. I shouldn’t have been sarcastic with him it’s against my own code of professionalism but I don’t actually regret it. I should add most staff make the effort to check if the other store needs anything or if there’s deliveries to go down before waltzing out of the store. ",

I tend to be dominant in my relationships, and when i need to make a point i do no hesitate to express myself. That does not mean im 'allowed' to be  rude to other people, im just direct and objective.\n\nNow, every time i get into an argument with my gf (F22)  for any kind of topic (big or little) she does not EVER take the blame for a mistake or ill mannered attitude. When i clearly point that the action/words/carelessness of her affected me , in a logical point of view, she gets annoyed and tell me that \"i'm just exaggerating' or simply that im crazy for taking everything so serious. This makes little problems very BIG problems, because i get so distressed and angry when she tries to invalidate everything i say by telling me that i'm crazy, and become a self fulfilling prophecy. At this point she says: 'see? you are exaggerating, you are all spiked up, i won't talk to you if you are angry'\n\nThis annoys me to incredible levels, and i feel like she does this on purpose to avoid taking responsibility for any mistake. I try to explain why that action/word made me sad/angry/uncomfortable in a objective, calmly way, and she just 'belittle' my claims. \n\nFor example, (and this just happened 15 minutes ago):\n\nShe let the door open and our dog destroyed the trash bin, eating everything he could. Evidently i call on her and tell her that this is not the first time and she needs to stop putting a skateboard and a plastic lid as a \"fort\" to not allow the dog to be outside, instead of closing the door. This was probably the 3rd time this happened. She started using that damn condescending tone to me, and everything went to shit.

Unfortunately we have to live together until May because we couldn't find someone to take my spot in the lease. \n\nShe also made these set of rules when we realized our friend couldn't take the lease from me. The rules were no hugging, no cuddling, no kissing and no communication unless it's about the apartment. \n\nMy Ex messages me yesterday telling me that she's throwing a birthday party at our apartment without my permission and she also wants me to leave the apartment or stay in my room for the entirety of the party. She's inviting most of my friends to the party as well. I feel as if she's done nothing to garner any kind of favor like that from me. She's been nothing but a terrible person to me. She's even been making fun of my depression on Twitter. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I’m a senior in college, 22 years old. First you need a little back story about how this guy (we’ll call him Ted) came to be sort-of exes. \n\nMy freshman year, the first week of school I met this guy—who was a junior at the time. I hit on him, he told me he had a girlfriend of a few years, but he thought I was funny and wanted to be friends. We were cool for a few weeks, and then he started having girlfriend troubles and making moves on me. I know it was shitty on his part, and also mine because I reciprocated but at 18 I didn’t really give a shit. He ended up dumping her, we had sex two or three times MAX, decided we would be better off as friends and moved onto future relationships. \n\nSince my freshman year we had gotten very close. We would tell each other basically everything, just like I would with my close girl friends. Throughout his relationships over the years he would come to me for girl advice, to cry to, and for me to be an occasional wingwoman. I went to him with guy problems, and after I met my boyfriend sophomore year, I went to Ted for relationship advice, life advice, and when I really needed someone to tell me what I needed not what I wanted to hear. He and my boyfriend were fine with each other, and my boyfriend was fine with how close we were. It’s just how we had been since I first met Ted.  He was a very good friend and a good voice of reason to me from the beginning. \n\nLet me be clear, there was definitely still some sexual tension. Never anything that either of us acted on, but it was inevitably there. Bug again, neither of us ever acted on these desires. \n\n\nAbout a year ago, he started dating a new girl. I’ll call her Tessa. \n\nTheir relationship began in flames from the beginning. She was manipulative towards him, controlling and over protective, and verbally and mentally abusive to him. I’m a psychology major, hopeful to go into counseling someday; so when I saw signs of a toxic and emotionally damaging relationship, I was very upset. \n\nTed is one of the most caring people I’ve known in my life. Puts others first, especially his friends and family, sees the best in people, would do anything for the people he cares about, etc. So, when he would call me time and time again crying because Tessa called him names, told him she hated him (“everything about him” to be exact), would break up with him again and again over the most trivial things.. I couldn’t stand to see him treated like that. Every time they broke up (within the first six months I believe it was 7 or 8 times at least) she would come back, begging and pleading, saying she would never say or do things like that again, saying she would change and stop drinking (she gets really awful when she’s drunk), and then they’d get back together and be happy for another few weeks and then break up again. Classic abusive circle of events. Ted is a delicate guy. He takes most things very personally, especially criticisms from those he highly regards. \n\nNow a month or so ago he just stopped replying to my texts. Deleted me off of Snapchat, blocked my number, unfollowed me on Twitter, etc. no pretense as to why or what happened, no contact, no information.. even though he has always regarded me as one of his closest friends.\n\nA week or so later, I asked one of his friends why he did it and they explained that Tessa was jealous/uncomfortable/unapproving of  Ted and I’s friendship. So apparently told him that if he kept in contact with me, their relationship would be over (again). \n\nSo being the friend that I am, i have still been trying to contact him. I feel like I’m being psycho, but we have always been so close that I am \n1. Scared for his mental and emotion health as this relationship persists \n2. Angry that he couldn’t even talk to me about the situation when I most definitely can understand why Tessa would be uncomfortable\n3. Sad that one of my closest friends for years has cut me so easily out of his life, as if I haven’t been through some of his hardest times with him and vice versa\n\nAITA for continuing to contact him? \n\n\n\nTL;DR A few years ago I hooked up with a guy, who i since then have become extremely close friends with. He got into an emotionally abusive relationship, and the girl has now ordered him to stop being friends with me. AITA for still trying to contact him?",

Last night we talked about taking it slow.\n\nBy the end of the night, we were making out on my couch. He asked if I make out with guys on my couch often.. I have once recently. So, I said I had. I'm an honest person. It was pretty uncomfortable. He got really quiet and basically said he can't handle it. We talked a bit and he left.\n\nWe texted a bit and he asked what my plan was. I honestly don't have one, this is my first fourth date since my ex and I've been single for almost two years. I've gone on three dates with someone else and two first dates recently. I thought it was okay since I'm single and I'm not sleeping with anyone. I've always dated one guy at a time but it makes me put all my eggs in one basket. It wasn't working for me.\n\nAlso, the reason I'm not committing yet has nothing to do with the other people I've gone on dates with, I just don't know this guy well enough. I've been hurt from jumping into relationships. I'm in my late 20s and I'm trying to be smart this time.\n\nAnyway, he ended up apologizing and asking me out again. But I've been wondering, am I an asshole for dating multiple people? Should I stop and go back to one person at a time? I feel like a jerk.",

      "title": "AITA for singling out my Ex in group get-togethers?",
      "description": "   I didn't really intentionally single her out, but I needed time away at the time. She broke up with me about half a year ago. Well, we actually broke up twice.\n\n   First time, she broke up with me and told me she doesn't know why it isn't working, she just can't continue on the relationship if she doesn't feel anything. Which I respect, of course at the time though I was angry and depressed. Emotions took over me and I just couldn't really look at her or speak to her. I went to my group of friends (which were hers too) who consoled me and took my side on the matter, saying that I was too good for her. That same night, she calls me and asks if we should get back together because she was crying and felt that maybe there was something there. I said no, I was furious because she put me through those just to get back with me anyways. Fourth day after that break-up she calls me again saying she missed me and would like to get back together again. I will admit, the previous three days, I was going through a bunch of emotions, I went from not wanting to see her, to wanting to get back together with her and try again, then to finally just being friends. Back to her asking me to get back together: I stupidly said yes. Without thinking about the possible reasons besides \"she missed me\".\n\n   Second time, we broke up 2 weeks later. During those two weeks, I ended up explaining to my friends that me and my Ex we're trying thing out again, which they were not very supportive of, but they acted like it and hoped it would go well. My Ex ended up making a new friend and brought him into our friend group, who she ended up being suspiciously over-friendly with, but I tried to ignore it. Nothing changed in the relationship between me and her. It was just like before and she wasn't trying to better things between us no matter how hard I tried. So I confronted her, I asked if she really wanted stay together. Silence then \"I don't know\". To which I replied \"If you really can't give me an answer, then that's a no.\" And we broke up there.\n\n   Now this is where it all happens. I didn't feel much after the second break-up because I've come to terms that it wasn't going to work. My Ex wanted to give me privacy with our group of friends (which were my group of friends first, I introduced her to them), so she didn't hang out with us for a while, which I didn't really want her to, and honestly neither did my friends. I started thinking about more of the reason WHY she broke up with me then got back together with me. Which I with my friends, concluded that it seems that she only wanted to get back together because she missed our group, not me. That really pissed me off. This was about a week after our break up. My friends start feeding me rumors and gossip about my Ex and her new friend (the one I mentioned in the last paragraph) were looking kind of being too close. Which I shouldn't feel that mad about, because we weren't together and she had every right. I did end up talking shit behind her back with my friends, which I kinda feel bad about. My friends told me about all the weird and selfish things she has done, without me around, along with all the times she kinda flirted with other guys while we were together. All of those gossips and thoughts infuriated me to the point where I completely ignored her. I couldn't see her at all without getting mad, she really wanted to be friends with me again, but I was suspicious because I believe she was just trying to get back into MY group of friends.\n\n   She finally confronted me directly after weeks of me ignoring her and not wanting to see her. She convinced me to talk. Not really talk, it was more of an argument. I confronted her about her new friend and the reason of her wanting to be my friend so that she could get back into my group. She denied both saying it wasn't true and that the new friend was just that, a friend. I didn't believe her. She told me how I was a jerk for ignoring her and not confront her about these things sooner, the reason for that was because I couldn't even talk to her without getting pissed. Afterwards, I leave and end up regretting not making things better between us. I hate holding a grudge. I end up getting one of my friends to be a mediator and we talked a second time. We agreed to be friends and hugged on it.\n\n  It's been about five months since then, we talk every once in a while. She ended up getting together with her new friend, which I wasn't surprised about at all. But she never went to our get-togethers out of fear of it being awkward and not the same after the break-up aftermath, which it wouldn't be. My friends and I didn't really try to invite my Ex to anything. My friends didn't have a high opinion of her, they thought she was selfish and was using me, mind you I did a lot of things for her and rarely got anything in return. She talked to one of my friends (who was a girl and was the closest to her) about how she missed everyone, that she didn't regret the break-up but she regrets how it all went down. Which my friend said that it was weird. I do feel bad and didn't mean to exclude her, I just didn't try to include her. But that's how it went, and I'm not really doing anything to change it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; My Ex and I broke up twice. She wanted to be my friend again, which we ended up doing, however I had a suspicion that she only wanted to be my friend to get back into our group. My friends didn't really like her anyways. I feel bad for unintentionally excluding her from any group activities. She's a nice enough girl but she is pretty selfish.",

I got jealous that he was letting another girl sit on his lap, but after a conversation I realized he had no ill intentions and was just being super friendly.\nThen it got worse when he told me he was considering giving a girl $300 because she was “going through it with her boyfriend,” like that’s his responsibility.\nHe also told me he hugs other girls when he misses me? I don’t fucking know.\nAm I an asshole for wishing he wasn’t so close and nice to everyone? ",

I just kept answering what she asked and tried to be give my point out. She kept talking about how sweet he is and how she thinks he’s perfect for her. Good for her I thought she’s moving on no hard feelings. But then last night she texted me saying she hates me and claimed that I was a asshole for not staying loyal. \nHer: “your not going to tell me about that girl your talking too at rugby practice?!” \nMe”is their a problem?

I said no, since I felt we were making already a good deed in helping pay for the funeral. At the end she took the 2K.\n\nTo this day I still feel guilty for denying the higher amount.

      "title": "AITA for sleeping with a friend even though I’m (22F) not interested in dating them?",
      "description": "Hi reddit! First time posting but I’d appreciate any advice you can give.\n\nThroughout college I guess I’ve gotten used to the “hook up culture” where to some people it’s common practice to sleep with someone without any commitment. Personally for me a lot of these encounters have been with people I’ve been friends with/still remain friends with. A lot of times it was more of an unspoken agreement.\n\nNow that I’m out of school there’s been a couple occurrences where I feel like the other person doesn’t have/may not have the same mind set as me and part of me feels like a jerk if someone thinks I slept with them because I like them just for me to tell them that I’m not interested in pursuing anything and end up hurting their feelings.\n\nThe most recent example is that I just reconnected with someone I was friends with in high school. We were never super close and it’s been years since we’ve spoken but we’ve hung out a couple times the last two weekends. This past weekend we got dinner and had a few drinks. Because he was trying to avoid sleeping at his parents’ for the weekend since he just saw them last week (he’s in another city for school) he was talking about getting a hotel and as I have my own place I offered to let him crash at mine to save some money. One thing led to another so now here we are.\n\nSince then I do get the vibe that he’s more interested so I’m planning to let him know where I stand today. I enjoy spending time with him and wouldn’t avoid him if he tells me he was interested (but I’d definitely take a step back on the physical boundaries), but if he takes it badly and wouldn’t want to spend time with me I’d understand.\n\nI guess my main question/concern is that it takes “two to tango” so on one hand is it right to say they shouldn’t assume my feelings? But on the other if I know I’m not interested in further commitment should I make that clear before anything even happens or is that jumping the gun? I feel like in the “traditional” sense IBTA but I’m just trying to evaluate my life decisions lol.\n\n",

      "description": "So my bestfriend, G, invited me to her 21st at her place for which I caught a plane to travel to get there. About a month prior to the party she sent me a Snapchat to say that her bestfriend, V, would be keen to get down and dirty if I was at the party, of course I said I was keen.\n\nLeading up to this myself and V chatted and sexted for leading up to this. About a week out we hadn’t figured out how exactly we were going to do the deed. G very graciously suggested that we could use a bed which was incidentally her and her bfs bed. We thought this was a great idea and thanked her for the permission. The night came, we all got drunk, and we eventually made our way there.\n\nBecause the door didn’t have a lock, V texted G to say something along the lines of ‘don’t come to your bedroom’, about 3 minutes after that, when clothes were off and things were getting heated we hear footsteps coming down the stairs and G opens the door and tells us to get dressed and head back up because her bf was pissed off at the idea of us using their bed.\nWe somewhat begrudgingly agreed, rolled off one another, G left, and we looked at one another and started again.\nAround 10 minutes later G returned, told us we needed to get out, her and V conversed for a few seconds about how she told us we could use it, and why was it a big deal. I don’t think there was much clarity in her answer other than just to finish up and leave.\nAgain, we were still quite into what was happening and didn’t really attempt to leave the bedroom.\n5 minutes later a guy we had both met that night and had hit it off with, J, opened the door, affirmatively told us we NEEDED to get out because G’s boyfriend was super pissed at V and turns out that G and her bf hadn’t actually ‘christened’ the bed. V and I looked at each other, stated ‘what the fuck’ simultaneously and contested that G told us we could use the bed; J clarified that it sounded like there’s probably been a lack of communication between G and her Bf (a known issue to everyone that communication isn’t always a strong point between them) and that he was NOT leaving until we got dressed. \n(Left the door open but turned his back) and I got dressed, made sure V had her stuff and I walked out to let her get changed. I, not being from the area didn’t really know anyone else and didn’t really want to walk up stairs to walk past G’s parents and risk running into G’s bf. So I sat and chatted with J about work etc as we both share similar career fields until he got a text from V that she wanted us to leave. We did, and I stuck talking to him so that I didn’t have to interact with anyone else at the party. G’s bf ended up storming past and J left and went to talk to him. I not long after this got an Uber, and left after saying bye to G.\n\nI texted V to make sure she was alright and that we’d talk tomorrow to basically debrief about it all.\nG later messaged me to say that her bf refused to sleep in the bed and slept on the floor next to her that night.\n",

      "description": "My sister gets married in a few months. I will be a bridesmaid. A number of weeks ago, she came to me saying she was calling off the wedding, she confessed he was abusive and controlling - for context she listed behaviours such as him mocking her young child, mocking her body, dictating how long she could be away from him for. All the classic symptoms of gaslighting and abuse. She was, mentally, a mess. \n\nI myself escaped a very abusive relationship in the not-too-distant past. I validated all of her suspicions about her own relationship, knowing she was obviously going to have trouble trusting her gut/her version of reality, but I was very careful not to put words into her mouth. She labelled him, not me. I comforted her, offered her and her son a bed in my home, gave them an escape plan and supported her as best I could. \n\nFast forward a week, the wedding is back on. I understand she is a victim, so I was keen not to get angry or disappointed at her going back to him. I've been there, I get it. I expressed that I couldn't unhear what she had said, that I loved and supported her, that I respected her right to make her own decisions - but I could no longer tolerate the man. I explained I would attend her wedding if she wanted me to, I wouldn't ever act untoward or ask her to choose, but that I simply wasn't capable of being anything beyond civil for her benefit. She understood why, given my past. I maintained I would always be there for her. I felt like I was willing to swallow my objections for her benefit so long as she undstood me. \n\nI tried to be neutral. It became apparent there was still friction on her side. It came to a head when she stated the issue was mine, I was wrong for not wanting to speak to him, I needed to accept him, and insinuated I was exaggerating my own history. Astonishingly, she claimed I shouldn't have believed a one-sided story, even if it was hers... She got very angry at me, we are currently not speaking, and I'm told we won't unless I accept him. I fear I can't but I'm reluctant to address my attendance at the wedding as it seems so very final. \n\nAm I the asshole for holding onto this?\n",

      "description": "My friend for over a decade doesn’t like doctors and won’t implement whatever advice or medication he is given. I’ve worried that for a while now he only keeps up the friendship on his end for occasional medical advice. \n\nOn New Years Eve, he came into the bathroom as I was washing up and he cornered me and pleaded that I look at his butthole and determine if he has a hemorrhoid. He handed me a big yellow kitchen glove and starting unbuckling his pants before I could tell him that I wasn’t comfortable doing this and he should go see a different doctor at an actual clinic, not a friend’s bathroom. I had to physically push him away to leave the bathroom. A few minutes later, he texted me a picture of his butthole, but it was mostly ballsack. I lost it when he came out of the bathroom and told him loud enough for our friends to hear not to send me dick pics or try to show me his butthole again. He left the party cherry red. \n\nWhen I came into work on the 2nd, there was a google alert waiting for me with a scathing review from a “patient” of mine, claiming I inserted a finger into them without their consent. Currently trying to get it taken down and fielding investigation questions from two different advisory boards. I texted my best friend that I’m completely done and I don’t want to see or speak to him again unless it’s in a court of law. I also sent a brief group text to our friend group explaining he has slighted me professionally and I will no longer be in contact with him. Then I removed myself from the group text. Two separate friends have reached out to me and told me I wildly overreacted and my best friend is hurt and depressed. Did I overreact? AITA? ",

      "description": "First post on Reddit, I'm on mobile so format may suck. Wall of text incoming.\n\nThe wife and I were trying to sell our townhome, and it was not happening. Been on the market for months. When we decided to sell it we decided to take my parents up on their offer to stay with them, as we have three young kids and trying to clean up after them for showings would be a nightmare. This has left our place empty for months. \n\nWife has a friend who started a go fund me page as she just got a job across the country, but doesn't start for months and their lease ends now essentially, leaving her family with no income and no place to stay potentially. Wife floats the idea of renting our empty place to them for a few months by me, and I reluctantly agree.\n\nWe start to talk details, payment amounts, move in dates, etc. Turns out they can't afford to even cover our mortgage. Not a huge deal. We're offering as a way to help her, and her husband and kids. Besides anything is better than the nothing we're getting now. \n\nThrough the conversations it's made clear on both sides that our place is still on the market, and could sell at any time. The friend is totally supportive and even goes so far as to tell us we can keep it listed while they're living there. I'm not having that and we schedule a date a few weeks away, and about a week before anticipated move in date for our friends for our listing to end. Realtor understands and schedules the end date of our property.\n\nAnyway, predictably in this situation, we got an amazing offer on our place. Actually two competing offers on the same day. (New year, apparently the market heated up quicker than I expected). We deliberate for a few hours, but all things considered we decide we really have to accept. We are not wealthy, but we agree that we'll sell and try to scrounge together the money to at least finalize funding on our friend's go fund me as we really do still want to help. \n\nWe accept the offer, contact our friend and she is super great about it. We didn't mention giving her money, as that part wasn't fully fleshed out about how much we could truly afford. I'm feeling pretty good about it, a little guilty, but we were upfront about the whole thing, so I don't feel too bad.\n\nI get home from work, and my wife let's me know she got an angry message from her friend's husband, who neither of us know very well talking about how awful we are and how we're going to make them homeless. She didn't respond and deleted the message. \n\nI'm furious at the guy for blaming their problems on us, but it got me thinking. Maybe the false hope we gave them was worse? At the very least I could have handled the whole thing better I'm sure, but AITA here for starting to make these plans to rent it to them, then selling? We hadn't even gotten the contract finalized, let alone signed yet. In my mind it was far from a done deal, but maybe they saw it differently.\n\nTl;Dr - Agreed to rent our vacant townhome to a friend needing a place for a few months, the townhome sold before the deal was worked out fully. Friend's husband is blaming is for them having no place to go now.",

      "description": "I'll try to summarize this as much as possible. My fiancee is amazing and I love her to bits. But when she drinks she can't stop. She will eventually drink until she passes out and makes an ass of herself. She also doesn't seem to care about personal boundaries, touching other men's faces and legs and the like. I've told her I hate it and it makes me extremely uncomfortable but she still does it\n\nWell tonight she went to a christmas party for her work while I went to a friends house to play cards. She said she wouldn't drink as she had to drive the 30 minutes back home, ok no big deal. Well at my buddy's house we hear a knock on the door and it's my fiancee. She is clearly drunk already slurring and I go into panic mode. \n\nNow my friends have never seen her drunk like that and for good reason. Her new meds have really screwed up her drinking even worse so she tried to lay back. Anyway long story short she refused to leave, started doing shots and chugging beers one after the other. \n\nI left her there because she wouldn't even talk to me (our best friends were both there to watch her). I went home and texted her to call me if she needs a ride. As I wasn't drunk whatsoever. The second she showed up I stopped drinking out of embarrassment. She couldn't read the cards, was touching all over another man there, we were at his house and he spilled beer and she was \"helping wipe it up\". Well she never texted back but our friend texted me saying she was drinking way too much and they cut her off. She then informed me an hour later my fiancee threw up and fell asleep on the couch.\n\nHer engagement ring was at home because she simply forgets it or won't wear it because her job is hands on. So I found it and hid it in the house. Told her when she respects us as a couple and wants to stop acting like we don't matter. That she can have it back.\n\nShe was also saying stuff like, \"does he look like the kind of person who wants to marry me?\" In front of everyone. And she has drunkenly told me to break up with her several times.\n\nSo am I the asshole? Or is it justified. Because I'm so hurt and disappointed idk what to do.",

      "description": "My step-sister (15) lives with her mom about 30 minutes away. I (17) live with my mom and stepdad. I just found out that my stepdad hadn't told my mom about her choir trip that she wants to go on. Its $900 total, so my stepdad has to pay $450. My brother, mom, and I were going to go see my grandma in Colorado for spring break, but now we won't be able to afford it apparently.\n\nI messaged my sister to ask where they were going for the trip. She said they were going to Nashville for a music festival and would be staying in a nice hotel and getting singing lessons from professionals and that's why it's so expensive. She said that she thinks it's a good opportunity so I said that it's easy to say that when she isn't the one paying for it. She got mad and said that she never asks for anything and that it's not that big of a deal and how much it costs is between her and her dad. I said it does matter and that $450 is a lot of money to be asking for. She answered with saying that it's not when she doesn't ask for much anyway, and said that she never did sports because \"no one over here ever wants to pay for anything\" (which is what child support is for imo). I told her I don't ask for anything either and that I'm getting no help in paying for college and that I pay for any trips I want to take. I also mentioned that any sports I play, all the equipment is either Christmas/birthday presents or I pay for it. \n\nShe sent a message of \"Have a good birthday. Hope you get everything you want.\" So I responded with \"Have a good trip. Hope you realize someday that the world doesn't revolve around you.\" Her response was \"I never said I thought it did. And to think I llooked up to you.\"\n\nI have since apologized for the last comment I made. She apologized back, but I can't help but wonder if I was being an asshole or if I'm rightly justified in being upset about this.",

I’ve been told multiple times that I have more responsibilities because I am more experienced suggesting I am an asset to the team.\nWHAT HAPPENED:\nSo we have a fairly common rule that we must ask for days off 2 weeks ahead of time. As me and my girlfriends 3 year anniversary is this weekend (dec 21) I booked it off Dec 6. I however never got a response from my employers to the email. Time went on and Dec 16 I got my schedule for the week saying I was booked during the weekend. I stupidly did not even check if I worked and I just assumed that I got the days off. Yesterday afternoon (dec 20) I see that I work and I ask every single employee to switch shifts with me but no one could.\nI told the owner that I booked it off and her response was “you never got a confirmation saying that you’ll get it off for sure”\nConclusion \nI’ve decided to just skip my shift tonight (dec 21) because my anniversary meant more to me. I was warned this morning that if I do not show up to this shift I will be terminated. Although I’m upset I still think I made the right decision.\n",

      "description": "So for context, I am a white female, my boyfriend is a black male. Whenever I say something he thinks is silly or doesn’t make sense to him, he says “Ni**a what?!” to me. Almost every time, I say please don’t call me that. It seems condescending when he says it in that tone. It’s hard to explain his tone online, but to me, it seems like he’s talking down to me. The way he says it sounds like he is talking to a crazy person or a child. Today, we were having a conversation about something serious, and he said it. It was over something I had said that he disagreed with, he responded with  “N***a what?”I told him not to call me that anymore, because I’m his girlfriend and I don’t like it. He said it’s his vocabulary and he’s not changing it, and I’m just on my period. I told him that I’m being rational, that I’m his girlfriend and he can call me something else. He said only white people think of the word as a negative thing, and I said no, it’s not about race it’s about the way you say it. To me it has nothing to do with the actual word, it’s just the tone of voice he has when he says it. I feel like he’s talking to me like a child. Am I being too sensitive? I got angry at him because he said I was just on my period. He refuses to stop calling me that, he says it’s just part of how he talks. \n\nDoes that make sense to anyone else? Or am I the asshole?",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I are super close. We are deeply in love, and talk about getting married, having kids, the whole works. For the most part, we agree about a lot of things. But this is a relationship, so we obviously have things we agree/ disagree on. We mostly always find a compromise.\n\nWe are not planning on having kids anytime soon. Were both college students, and it’s way too early for that. We just like discussing our future, and seeing what we agree on.\n\nWe’ve had this discussion before, but we kind of just let it go. Neither of us are religious at all Both of our parents are Christian, but neither are super religious, more casual. My parents know that I’m agnostic, and for the most part they accepted it, and don’t see me any differently. Her parents do not know that she does not believe, and she doesn’t want to tell them. Which is fine, I have no issue with that. We both live in Texas, so there’s a lot of religious people around who are very judgmental. I’ve gotten used to pretending or just not telling anyone. I actually compromised to have a religious wedding to “put on a show”. Again, I don’t mind.\n\nShe is scared that her parents will think very negatively about her not believing, and “disown” her. Her parents aren’t mean by any means, (they’re very sweet actually) but they are old fashioned.\n\nShe has always talked about raising our kids religious, and them letting them decide whether they want to believe or not when they become of age. She believes Christianity would teach them morals and basic values and her parents wouldn’t look down her us for it,\n\nI personally believe this doesn’t make any sense, and that religion has nothing to do with morals or basic values.I was never religious growing up, and Im fine. I believe there is a way to raise a kid to have strong values and morals without reverting to something we don’t believe in.\n\nI cannot wrap my head around why it’s so important to her. I have tried to compromise with her, and suggest that we teach them about religion as a whole, and introduce values that way. So we aren’t forcing a certain religion upon them. She is persistent that it has to be Christianity.\n\nI understand that is important to her, and that she has a reasoning behind it. She doesn’t want her parents to be upset, and she thinks this is best for the kids. I love her, and I would love to compromise with her, but she doesn’t want to budge. I don’t feel like I should give up what I believe in, just because she doesn’t want to upset her parents. The whole fact of raising our kids a religion that we aren’t just seems very silly to me.\n\nAITA for doing this? Am I overthinking the whole situation?",

      "description": "Hi Reddit, \n\nPlease impart your wisdom on me.\n\nSome background: My family comes from a South Asian background. In my culture, it’s gravely disrespectful to make a guest feel unwelcome at any moment while they are within your home or visiting you. You are expected to bend over backwards to be hospitable, which is usually fine by me, except I was raised in Canada and am much more opinionated than the average woman from the home country. \n\nRecently, my aunt and her two children (a female cousin and a male cousin) visited Canada and therefore my family for the first time.  I had never met my cousins before because their family took refuge in a different western country when our families immigrated out of the home country a couple decades ago. None of our families had money to travel until recently. \n\nThe cousins are in their early twenties, as am I. I didn’t really jive with my female cousin so much, and I especially didn’t like her tendency to gossip behind closed doors. I still gave her a chance though, kept it all pretty civil and polite (and most importantly hospitable) until one evening.\n\nWe were all at my home. She and my father were gossiping about and making fun of one of our relatives who is an outspoken feminist. They obviously didn’t agree with some of this relatives views but rather than having healthy debate about it, they were mocking her behind her back and having a laugh at her expense. This relative happens to be one of my favourite family members, and someone whom I look up to and admire a lot. She really didn’t deserve this. She’s done a lot for the female members of our community and should be commended for demanding equal treatment of women in a culture that is known for sometimes oppressing women’s rights.\n\nI walked right up to them and said they were completely out of line for speaking this way about my relative. If they didn’t like her views, they could take it up with her in person instead of mocking her behind her back. I said I wouldn’t stand to have people disrespect her in such a cowardly way without her present to defend herself, and told them to cut it out. \n\nMy father thought that I was being out of line by trying to ‘censor’ their speech. He later told me in private that I had no right to make my cousin feel uncomfortable in our home, and that I should apologize to her. I told him she had no right to be a disrespectful house guest, and refused to apologize. I was also disappointed with him for participating in that discussion with her, but he didn’t think he did anything wrong because in his view, they were just talking about the relative’s views, not bashing them and mocking them. \n\nMy female cousin never brought this encounter up to me again, but I could tell that she was a little less happy during the rest of her trip. She continued to gossip and talk badly about some family members. When she left, I was relieved. \n\nWas I the asshole? ",

      "description": "This is going to be a long story, I'll put a TL;DR at the end\n\nInformation needed to paint the full picture:\nI have pretty bad separation anxiety when it comes to a few select people, I cant cut them out of my life no matter how hard I try, so I'll do what ever it takes to keep them around. \n\n\nThis starts about 3 years ago, I started dating this guy and despite him treating me kinda like a second fiddle I still became overly attached to him. There was me, Joel, and Eliza. Eliza and joel were friends for a few months before I knew joel, and i had known Eliza since kindergarten. \nSo Eliza became distant with me and began holding Joel's hand, hugging him, and genuinely demanding his attention despite me telling joel to knock it the fuck off. \nJoel ends up breaking up with me for 3 or 4 different reasons (all of which changed over the years) .\nHe said we would keep the relationship up in a few weeks, he just needed a break. So obviously we kept sexting and flirting and such, until one day he told me he had gotten into a relationship, with none other than Eliza. A month later I came back into contact with joel. \nWe remained friends for a few months until he told me he had to drop me due to Eliza being uncomfortable with us being friends. I ended up getting so pissed off at him I forced him to tell her that he sexted me despite being in a relationship, and they broke up. We lost contact. \n\n\nA few months later me and Joel started talking again, I kept things at a friendly manner and he turned things sexual, I of course having the brain power of a gold fish complied and went along with it. The next day he told me he was going to stop talking to me again, so I took it apon myself to tell Eliza what happened, they broke up again and we both stopped talking again. \n\n\nThen, about 5 months goes by and I had a friend contact him and asked if he'd speak to me. He messaged me and I asked to tie up loose ends and that was all. After about a week he brought up sexual things again and despite knowing what happened before I went with it. \nNow, it was around here he started treating me pretty shittly. If I began talking too much about certain topics he'd threaten to block me. I'd hear from him maybe 2 times a week. \nAs the months rolled passed my parent moved and obviously I accompanied them being only 17 at the time. The new house being only 2 streets away from joel. \nWhen no one was home he would sneak over and we would hang out. We would watch movies, play video games, cuddle, and even.. have sex. \nOne night my mother and I had a disagreement and I left the house not looking back, and I went to his house and he let me in. His guardians weren't home for the night so we just did what we always did. Eat, game, and fuck. Around about 4 am he fell asleep on me, I stayed up so I could leave before anyone came home. \nHe woke up, we cleaned up the area and I left and I went back to my moms. She knew damn well i didnt stay outside all night and after some prodding she found out I stayed with joel. \nShe was mad at first but eventually let it go and welcomed him into our home again despite him being in a relationship. This went on for 5 months. \nI wasent doing this to hurt Joel, nor Eliza. But I loved that man with all my heart and I let him use me to his content because I thought \n\" hey, if I'm around long enough he will see how much I love him, and at least hes in my life again\" \nHe kept saying things like how we might have a change to get back together in the future and how he still loves me. When ever I would see him with her he always looked miserable. \nNow after so long he got attached to me, he liked the pet names and everything I did for him. And when I tried cutting the sexual stuff out of our relationship he cried and told me he felt like he was losing his best friend. \nAbout a week later I found out he was flirting and touching 5 other women including me. \nAnd, I told his girlfriend. I told her everything he did to me, every picture I took, every gross aspect of that \"affair\". And she dumped him like hot trash. And after a few days I went to his work place ( a remote gas station that not one person went to) and I chewed him out for everything he did to me, and to his old friends. And recently he has contacted me again. \n\nAm I the asshole for being with someone who I knew that was in a relationship, and then ratting them out? \n\nTL;DR  I was letting someone cheat on. Their girlfriend with me and when shit went down I told her  everything that happened. Am I the asshole here? \n",

But I don't know what to think anymore and I don't really know whether I'm the asshole or not.\n\nThis all started a few of weeks ago when she told me she really wanted to go to this art museum. It looked cool and I was down. I was busy for next couple of weekends so I told her we'd go a couple weeks later when I was free.\n\nWell the friday before the weekend we are set to go rolls around and I get an email from an old friend I haven't seen in years. We used to be extremely close, very good friends. After he moved away it was hard to keep in touch. He tells me that he's visiting our hometown for the weekend and was wondering if I was still around. I was extremely excited for this but as I read on I realized that he was only free on the Saturday and was doing something else on the Sunday.\n\nUnfortunately Saturday was the day my gf and I were going out. I thought I'd be fine as we could simply go on the Sunday. But when I told her about this she got mad and told me I cared more for my friend than her.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I have a friend. Let’s call her M. She’s a college sophomore and I’m a junior. We weren’t close last semester but we hung out, and she’s like close to the end of her party thot phase.\n\nThis semester weve hung out a lot more, because our friend group kind of split, and we’ve become better friends. She hangs out a lot at my dorm which is like an apartment so there’s a kitchen and living room and it’s roomy. I love when she hangs out, she’s a wonderful person and is super sweet. And yet as the semester comes to a close, she says she’ll hang out and then ditches me and my roommates for whatever dumb hicks invite her over to drink with them. Like you barely know these idiots and are only there for the alcohol, and then the next day you’re like bragging to me that you got so wasted last night. DO I GIVE A SHIT? You ditched me for a bottle. \n\nAm I being ridiculous at being hurt? Like if someone made plans and then decided to get drunk and basically not care about you anymore, that would piss you off right?\n\nI hate alcoholics, I think they’re incredibly selfish; when they’re doing what they do best, they become everyone else’s problem. \nAnd seeing her slowly dive deeper and deeper into daily drunkenness as a coping mechanism for finals week breaks my heart. Can’t tell her anything because she’ll just get defensive and give the silent treatment. Tried that once last semester (texted her “I bet if I brought beer you’d come”) and that got me in some hot water. \n\nShe’s one of the sweetest people I know, and when she’s not tired or stressed she’s an angel. It just makes me sad that like half the time I see her nowadays she’s either drunk or hungover. So which one is the real M? If the person I loved spending time with is gone, then I’m out of here till everyone’s grown up a bit. I’m sorry if I’m hurt, but it’s just sad seeing someone slowly fade into someone else, who isn’t even real",

      "description": "I am going to a rough time right now, with an injury from an accident and a death in my fiancees extended family. The death was unexpected and I was there with my fiancees family the whole time, spending three days in a hospital. I am behind with work and I sleep at my in laws parents to support them, because they don't want to be alone and to help with planning the funeral. This may cloud my judgement. \n\nToday I went to visit my mother at the request of my fiancee who wanted to be somewhere more quiet and to talk to someone who is not so affected by the loss. I came, even though I actually had work to do to see my mother who I hadn't in a whole and for some rest.\n\nNow my car is on my mother's parking place for a while. I asked her this a while ago, because she doesn't have a car, can't drive. Storing a car there is free, as is it at my place. I just don't have a personal parking space and the kids in my neighbourhood blow stuff around new years. She said it was no problem.\n\nWhen I visited a while back the car was somewhere else in the street parked badly and unlocked. My brother had moved it because he needed the space to move something heavy. I told him that I would prefer if he would tell me he moved it (not ask for permission, just a text with hey I moved your car). Also lock the door and park a bit more social next time. I could park the car more social because of the accident I can't drive right now.\n\nWhen we visited my mother today the car was gone. I was really scared it was stolen. I came into the house and my grandfather was there and told us that my mother was gone with my grandmother in my car for some errands. I didn't like this because she again didn't tell me (I only want a text) and my grandmother was there in her own car. They just took it because mine is smaller and my grandmother doesn't like driving in big cars.\n\nWhen they came back, I didn't say anything, because I'm tired and stressed and I don't want to have a fight. Then myother told me she gave the keys to a neighbour I don't know yesterday because the neighbour asked if it could be parked better. I blew up at this. I have asked so many times to just tell me. If the car could be there anymore fine, I'll try and get somebody to pick it up. My fiancee would move it today. But I have said again and again just please tell me. Be a bit respectful of my (for me expensive) stuff.\n\nI shouldn't have gotten so angry, but am I the asshole for getting upset for something I asked them again and again. This happens with other things as well. (ask me if I have time to do an errand for you if I'm in the next room, don't wake me up to pick up my brother when he went partying after 1 in the morning when I have to work the next day). They always yes of course and then never do. \n\nAITA for expecting these in my eyes really easy things after I ask repeatedly?",

      "description": "this happened about an hour ago and currently it has caused a looming shit-storm in the house.  \n\nso small backstory to pretext to why I got upset in todays events... a year and a half ago my mum passed away. at the time of her passing I myself had just begun to get really sick and had moved in with my parents (I am 33 right now).  but before that my mum was always the 'carer' of my two parents.  she was the one to ask me if I was okay, to go to my doctor appointments with me, to know what meds I was on, to know what diseases I had, and to just... well, \\*care\\*.  my dad wasn't.  after mum passed away, it was hard.  I had to do things on my own.  even though I continued to stay with my dad (beneficial to both of us as I couldn't work and he needed help around the house), I had to go to my doctor appointments alone, and deal with that stuff.  the odd time, however, he'll try and 'care' in the most inconvenient ways when I don't want him to... and don't \\*need\\* him too.  he's not good at it, and it's not his job; it was mum's. (he's even said this before).  hell, I had brain surgery a few months ago, and aside from my brother dropping me off, and then getting picked up on the day I was released, I did it alone.\n\nanyways, to today... I woke up with an infected eye.  not too bad, just swollen and whatnot.  but with my medical history I decided I should go to the ER to get it checked out.  dad was out at my brothers, and I messaged him saying I was quickly running into town to get the eye checked. the  wait was a while at the hospital, and after a bit he messaged me asking me if I was still there.  I messaged back yes, apologizing, saying he'd have to start supper.  a few minutes later, sure as shit, he shows up in the hospital in the middle of the waiting room looking for me in another one of his awkward attempts to care.  I got angry (silently, not a big scene angry), and just got up and left.  he chases me down and I honestly don't know what he was saying, I just got into my car and left.  when I got home I went up to my room, and he comes up a few moments later and yells 'do you want to tell me why you're being such a fucking asshole?!'... which brings me to here... am I?",

      "description": "I know this is a cliche and petty sounding basis of a story which, taken at face value, may have an obvious answer but I think you need to hear me out. The context is imperative to account for in this scenario.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this girl and I  were in the same friends group for about 3 years. We'd hang out every break and lunch and whatever lessons we had in common as I did with everyone in that group. Eventually we graduated secondary school and I went to a different sixth form (another friend, let's call him \"Ricky\",  also went to a different sixth form in an entirely different city). We didn't speak for just under a year but I spoke with a lot of mutual friends in that same friendship group. Because of said mutual friends, I heard about a group chat she created and it transpired she was hosting a party I was unaware of. I subsequently brought it up in a conversation with friends and the people I brought it up to expected me to going but I never was. I was under the assumption that this was a reunion (with a lot of reason to believe so, don't question how I was so sure, there's a lot to it) that had literally every person in our circle of friends going excluding me, even Ricky went! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never received any direct contact from her explaining her decision, despite the fact the she obviously knew I would find out (again, don't question me on that bit, just gotta trust me on it). I would have expected at least a notification of the gathering out of respect or just a little something to make it not seem like such an obvious direct insult. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI messaged her about it in passing (we were having a rare unrelated conversation and I brought it up)  and she was very unapologetic about the whole situation. She did however clarify that it was for her birthday party and not a reunion and after a ridiculously long conversation, we just stopped speaking (I literally said \"goodbye forever and good luck in the future\"). She occasionally messaged me on special occasions like after my interview at Cambridge, birthday and A-Level results. I think they were out of regret of her past mistakes. We've not had a proper conversation since and it's now 2 years after the incident.",

      "description": "A while ago, their semester ended, and there was a talk about an overseas vacation, coincidentally to where my girlfriend is from (the country in general, not the exact place. Gf has not been there either). From the first time I heard of this, I told her that while I obviously couldn't stop her from going, I wasn't really comfortable with that notion. It didn't matter though, I said, that based on my experiences in the past, these kind of trips are mostly just talk. We're from a place and at an age where most students (17-19yo) either won't have the money, didn't have the permission, or ultimately no one would take the initiative to plan it and thus trips such as these almost always didn't happen. (The culture where I'm from is like that.)\n\nWell, with what seemed to be an act to prove me wrong, my girlfriend took it upon herself to plan, buys the tickets, etc. This, coupled with the fact that she is from the place, effectively made her the one in charge of the trip in everyone's eyes. This obviously also made me feel terrible, because she spends no where near the amount of effort planning time between us.\n\nNow, few days before the trip, she starts to become overwhelmed by everyone else's lack of involvement in said planning. She starts to complain to me about how everyone is treating her as the tour guide and how she has to do everything and how she regrets agreeing to go with them. I force a smile and try my damnedest not to tell her I told her so. Couldn't do it. I mean, from my point of view, she forced a trip that in my opinion wouldn't have happened otherwise, in an effort to prove me wrong, to somewhere they have never been before, to a relatively more dangerous country in terms of crime rate as a small group of teenagers unsupervised. This is my biased opinion. I'm a pretty anxious person, so if she was going to go regardless, the least I felt she could do was to not constantly reminding me of it when we are spending time together.\n\nTldr: Should I have been more supportive of the situation she's in? Am I the asshole who is just jealous that she's spending more time with her friends?",

      "description": "I’m a guy, I live with two women, we’re all in our mid-late 20s. The overall theme of the decor is mid-century modern.\n\nOne of my roommates, let’s call her Zee, is a **very** proud furry. I have nothing against furries. I find the whole concept strange but ultimately it harms no one, and as a gay man, who am I to judge for someone being different? I’m glad she’s not ashamed of herself.\n\nWhen I moved in, there was very little artwork or an overall design theme. In the half year since, it now looks mid-century modern. Both of my roommates love how it looks, and i do too. Zee decorated the bathroom. She chose a Disney theme, it actually looks pretty nice (it’s not cartoonish or childish and it flows together nicely).\n\nAnyway, Zee said she wants to put up some art of her own. That’s fine. Then I saw what she wanted to put up. It’s furry art. It isn’t pornographic, but the art looks...you ever come across fan art on DeviantArt? Yeah. It looks like that. Imagine the Sonic “nothing personell” art style. I’m not exaggerating, it’s really that bad looking.\n\nI’m throwing a big birthday party in a couple weeks and I’m mortified that the only thing people will talk about is the shitty furry art. I 100% guarantee if I ask her not to put the artwork up she’ll accuse me of being bigoted and that I’m attacking her, she’s very sensitive and dislikes being criticized in anyway. Being a furry is like, **the** most important thing to her identity, so she’d feel like I’m attacking her character.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting furry artwork on the living room walls? I have a bunch of pride stuff that I only hang in my room because that’s my private room, so it’s not like I’m asking her to not do something that I am doing myself.",

      "description": "This is kind of a long story. My ex and I split up at the beginning of the year on not great terms. At the time we had been living together for about six months and in the time we lived together problems in our respective personal lives had caused our relationship to break down pretty badly. We were both struggling with our mental health but they were a lot less receptive to communication than I felt I was, and we had a couple of near splits before finally calling it, partly because his feelings had obviously changed and I (somewhat unfairly? at the time) suspected they might be cheating. In that time they had gotten close with someone new, who made me feel uneasy but I wanted to be supportive so I encouraged their friendship thinking it might be nice for them to have a support system outside of our very much shared friend group. At the time most of our friends were supportive of us individually but agreed our relationship had become toxic and wasn't good for either of us to stay together. While I am closer with most of our friends in terms of regular contact and hanging out, he has a longer history with two of them, and those two tend to hold the sway in terms of the group mindset.   \n\n\nWhen we split up it was agreed that I would move out of our (shared with a roommate) apartment at least for a month, with the option to come back  if I struggled to find a place to rent that I could afford within the month. I temporarily moved in with a friend until I could find a new place to live, but at the same time that my ex had immediately moved on with the new \"friend\" that had made me feel uncomfortable. I was pissed, especially when I asked him about it and he lied to my face several times, but I forgave him because I knew he was still going through a lot. The utilities for our apartment were in my name and so we had to stay in some level of contact to deal with that, as well as the fact that I didn't move all of my stuff out since he had said I could always move back in for a bit if I couldn't a place right away. I ended up ruling that out because of the new relationship, but because I was living on a couch at the time I didn't bother changing the utilities or moving out the other stuff. By the time I'd found a new place (about four months after our break up) both him and our roommate started making their utilities payments late, and I ended up having to cancel the cable, internet and phone (something that wasn't a big deal at the time) and then deal with moving my stuff out. Because we'd bought furniture together but my new place was pre-furnished we agreed that my ex would just pay me back for the furniture I had paid for, and that they'd give me my security deposit back now that all my stuff was out, something I thought was reasonable at the time.   \n\n\nThis is where it gets tricky because right as I moved into my new place and they agreed to pay me what we both thought was fair from what I'd spent on our old apartment, he went on medical leave for a workplace injury. I felt guilty asking for my money all at once and suggested he pay me back gradually so as not to overstretch himself when he couldn't work. We didn't have great communication at the time, but I felt like we had a healthy enough respect for one another that I didn't want to risk damaging a future relationship. Things have pretty much gone downhill now though, because he split up the person he functionally broke up with me for and ended up moving an hour away to take a new job. I also found out that my suspicions of cheating were in fact correct and that he cheated on me with one of our good, shared friends, something I had to find out from her over a year after the fact. I got upset and called him out on taking advantage of me and haven't talked to him since (about two months ago). But now that he's back at work, I decided to ask about what the plan was to pay me back. That was when he cut off all contact, stopped responding and blocked me on Facebook. I have no way other than email to get ahold of him, and no current address because I found out he moved while we weren't speaking (and sold the furniture we bought together)   \n\n\ntl;dr my ex and I have had a rocky relationship over the last year. He had a serious health problem and I didn't press him for money but it's been ten months since I moved out and he owes me money for a security deposit and furniture we bought together. I have no way to get ahold of him because he blocked me when I started asking about the money. My friends say I should just let it go because he's had a hard time, and they're all still friends with him, and hang out with him without me (this was originally a mutual decision). They accused me of just being angry since I recently found out he had cheated on me with one of our friends (which I am but like.... duh). He still owes me around $1000. Am I the asshole for considering suing so I can get my money back? ",

      "description": " \n\nAITA\n\nFirst off obligatory, I'm a lurker on Reddit, not really a poster so I hope I'm following all the rules.\n\nSecond, I got the nerve to write this after seeing all the posts lamenting posts seeking validation on here.\n\nThis story likely has two assholes me (27), him (29) but maybe it's just me, where I'm mostly concerned and wondering if I am, in fact, the asshole is with the very last step: Where I cut my friend off and stopped trying. I'll tell it as simply as I can.\n\nThis summer I fell into a very deep depression after a bad breakup, which led to a quickly deteriorating relationship with my parents (they liked her more than me and me more when I was with her), and this put a huge strain on me and my job suffered. I hadn't had a roommate in the better part of a decade but I was doing so poorly on my own that I knew I was only looking for one more excuse to commit suicide. Depression has been a part of my life since I was 12 but I'd always been able to cope, up until this summer. I was high most days/nights and developed an issue with painkillers and alcohol. My friend of about 6 months had quickly become one of my best friends and always found an excuse to ask me to move in with him long before all this went down - his motivation was self-admitted as saving on rent money and the fact that this was his first time living alone and didn't like it, also friendship. Me (introvert), him (extrovert).\n\nI took him up on the offer one day, explained to him my reason why was that I was afraid to be alone and my lease was up in 3 months anyway. His landlord didn't give a rip about leases and signing papers (another conversation for another day) and that meant everyone was fine with me living there for as long as I needed/wanted. Where things get complicated is with my buddies arrangement he said clearly I would owe no rent on the months I was still paying my old rent. I'd cover all the utilities for those months and generally, he'd just be a good dude. For my old apartment, I was still on the hook for 3 months rent, unless someone started a new lease with them. It would be a per diem kind of thing...1,000/m is $33/day so if someone took over on the 15th of the last month, that would be $500 back to me. Someone did take over on the 23rd of the second month ($231 back to me). I paid rent full rent to my friend on the 3rd month. I did not give him the $231 as I probably should have, reason being was my suffering career which was 100% commission (tag [r/choosingbeggers](https://www.reddit.com/r/choosingbeggers)) and I did cover all the utilities for the first two months, we went 50/50 on everything after that.\n\nTwo months go by. I'm stoned and drunk most nights, I'm making just enough money to pay my bills, eat ramen, and go to therapy for the first time. Never been this kind of broke. I'm not at all better and wouldn't be for several months. My priest, friend, and trusty counsel-giver suggests education and seminary. Says he doesn't care if I become a religious or not and suggests I use this as a way to get a free education, find a new lease on life, and pursue a living that actually means something to me. After a month of deliberation, I took him up on it. I actually get excited again, like really excited, like watched a sunrise and smiled while sipping coffee kind of excited.\n\nI tell my roommate, and first words out of his mouth is \"moocher\" he immediately says I won't make it and shouldn't do it. I was shocked. I explained that I was open to the religious life but also not expecting it and the diocese knew that, they were just willing to take a chance on me and so I would take a chance on them. I explained that if this didn't work out, the education would still afford me a better, more fulfilling life than I had been living before and I saw this as a way out of my depression and into better living. At this point, he demanded the full second month's rent, which I did not pay and was already 2 months ago, and began wanting rent on a weekly basis. I did pay the rent weekly but told him no on the second months rent as that was already long since spent and couldn't do back payments like that.\n\nEvery single day he tells me I won't make it in school. Every day I tell him I don't care, I'm trying. I begin to cut him out as just one more negative voice in my head.\n\nSome time goes by, he wants all new tires for his truck. He was going to trade labor to the guy for about a quarter of the cost. Me, being the genius that I am just got a new credit card with an introductory $150 bonus if I spent $500 or more in three months, my 400 IQ continues to kick in and I tell him to put it on my card and I'll give him $50 of it. $840 goes onto the credit card. He pays back $400. I go to school. He gives me two post-dated checks for the remaining $480 spread out over one month. I had no problem with this.\n\nHe cancels both checks a week after I leave and says he'll Venmo me the money when he's ready. I text him once a week for two months, he always says he'll send it next week or next pay period. After 8 weeks of this I give up. This whole time he's been making about 3X as much as me with similar bills. I apply the $150 to the bill and donate plasma to pay off the rest. 18 credits and 15hrs/week of service work, an actual job wasn't practical, wise, or actually allowed.\n\nHe continues to text me periodically, condescending remarks like \"making lots of friends?\" \"Did you remember your lunch?\". If this doesn't sound condescending, just trust that I know his humor.\n\nEven when the texts got nicer, I stopped responding and the friendship is over with me feeling like he stuck me with a credit card debt I had no good way of repaying and a whole lot of negative feedback from a friend who was supposed to have my back.\n\nTL;DR: Friend helped me out with a place to stay as I recovered from depression. Education was offered to me as a means to a new lease on life and I accepted the offer. The friend gave me daily negative feedback on my decision to the point that I had already begun to shut him out before leaving. He left me with credit card debt and negativity and so I cut him out.",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my project partner to do his part, even if he has other work to do?",
      "description": "To give some context: Me and my project partner are part of the same computer science class. We had a project given out and decided to partner up for it. The project was simply, create a game with the criteria provided in a document attached to said project. So we spent multiple class days together working on the project until today. Prior to today, we both equally contributed to the projects design and structure.\n\nThe actual story: It’s the last day before the project is due and he texts me stating that the project is due tomorrow. Fully expecting that he will contribute as well like he had done during class periods, I text him back saying that I can work on it and begin to combine both of the material we have ( he doesn’t have to help with this as the material we made is on a website). This alone takes up to an hour. Once again keep in mind that he hasn’t let me know at all the he won’t work on the project when I’m doing this. \n\nAfter, I update him on the project, letting him know what’s been done so far. Aside from the one word answers he gives me, he gives me no indication of what his workload is until I outline what needs to be done, which would’ve taken at most the same amount of time that I had spent thus far on combining our material that we already had. He then lets me know, after I’ve done at least half the remaining work already, that he “doesn’t know if he has time to do any.” Understanding that having a lot of work sucks, I text him, giving him a compromise and doing even more work on the project. \n\nFast forward another 30-45 mins, and another portion of the project. I texted him, simply asking that he finish his last 30 min portion of the project. My only text back was “no still studying,” despite it being multiple hours since he first started. Since then, I’ve received no texts at all. At this point, I’m resigned to the fact that I’m gonna have to do the entire, vast majority of the project that was supposed to be done equally by myself. But hey, maybe he had to do some work and didn’t have time.\n\nSo, AITA for wanting my project partner to do his part even if he has his own workload to do as well?",

      "description": "Recently, I (20M) got into an argument with my sister (18F). The actual topic of the argument isn't overly necessary, as the important part was a miscommunication between her and my father.\n\nNecessary context, My sister has a history of anxiety and depression (who doesn't) and frequently has issues with communicating with my mother, perceiving slight clues here and there as massive signposts. this had gotten to the point where my mother had a minor breakdown as my mother had little to no time of her own as she had to spend all her time with my sister, for fear of having to have an emotional conversation about how my sister doesn't feel loved. Additionally, The following situation i'm about to describe is not the first occurrence of something like this.\n\nDinner was just being served as the argument began, My Sister and My father were already talking and it was clear there was a misunderstanding. I initially took her side as from the outset it was a fair question, but almost immediately, i took my father's side as i realised that (to my perspective) my sister's question was flawed. I later learned my sister had sorely miscommunicated her true question and the actual question posed had been answered, but held little bearing on her true question. My sister repeated the same question again, received the same answer, then proceeded to ask the same question. this happened a few times until she disregarded my second or third attempt to help her understand, acting dismissive of my attempt while i perceived her to be demanding an answer.\n\nMy father and I got agitated, as this was neither the first time this had happened, nor would it be the last if i history dictates anything, every time something similar had occurred, little to no perceivable change resulted, fearing this, just after i had tried to get my point across, My sister moved her head in such a way that it would be fair to assume she had dismissed my statement entirely. I pointed to her angrily and said \"That, That look right there tells me that you weren't listening\".\n\nMy sister begins getting emotional (Again, not the first time this has happened). She begins talking about how we don't understand, My mother, bless her heart, figures out the misunderstanding and begins to try to explain it, slowly pivoting towards the emotional aspects. I'm fuming at this point, and decide that instead of yelling at my sister, i would take a walk. i get back to the house 10-15 minutes later, they are still discussing, i walk past them all, grab my food, and when pulled up, explain that i'm holding myself back from talking as i lack context at this stage.\n\nI'm later approached by my Mother, explaining the situation and asking me to apologise to my sister. Based on the number of times this has happened before, i already knew my sister had felt a mixture of feeling attacked, feeling like i didn't belong in the conversation between her and my father, feeling unloved as it was myself and my father against her, feeling just generally shit about the situation as a whole and a myriad of other, smaller things. Before my mother had even tried to explain my sister's side, i already knew the situation and recited them to her, to which she agreed. Also, based on the number of times this has happened before, i expect almost no change in day-to-day interactions, almost as if the argument as a whole was disregarded.\n\nI begin my response to my mother saying that i would not be apologising to my sister for being confrontational unless my sister came to me, as i felt that i was justified at being angry at her demanding and dismissive attitude. By the end of the conversation i was certain this would never happen. I eventually concede that i would apologise to my sister IF, the next time this happens, my sister stops, takes a step back and considers another's perspective (which is not easy to do). If after explaining my perspective and opinions on my sister simultaneously putting forth a demanding and dismissive attitude, her answer does not indicate to me that she's taken my words to heart, i would not be apologising the next time this happens.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n",

      "description": "Backstory: When I got married a few years ago I did the whole thing homemade. I made candles from scratch for favors. I made a really fun &amp; creative guest signature book with a fujifilm instant camera and a handwritten chalkboard sign asking people to put a silly selfie next to their signatures. (This was an original idea that I came up with on my own because I used to scrap book a lot &amp; was not fond of the idea of a book of just signatures.) I also created my own (original) mad libs instead of advice for the couple/seating placement cards. I really wanted something to look back on and laugh, not just the cliche \"dont go to bed angry\" advice. \n\nI really poured my heart and soul into making my wedding unique, original and \"handmade with love\". It took me a full year to make everything and bring my creative ideas to life. These are things I now truly cherish because they are my own; my own memories, my own ideas and my own hard work. \n\nMy friend is getting married and I showed her my wedding pictures (because she originally just wanted to use the vases I used). Well then she saw my guest book table in the pictures &amp; is copying it to a T. Same exact words on the chalkboard and everything. Same type of camera, even asked how I homemade the book so the pictures would fit. I was trying to be a good sport and see her behavior as complimentary. So I gave her advice &amp; helped her along. I'm trying to be supportive but, now she is doing my mad lib place settings too. \n\nAll the little things I created and worked so hard on mean a lot to me. They're special. It's not like I just found this stuff on etsy it was whole set ups and projects that I thought up myself from nothing. Can't she plan her OWN wedding with things SHE likes? \n\nI was happy to help her think of what she would like to do at her wedding but I didnt know that meant she was going to have MY wedding car on copied. I mean I feel like she might as well ask for my dress and vows at this point too. \n\nAITA for being upset/uncomfortable with her taking every single one of my creative ideas? It didn't bother me when it was one or two things but it's become a bit much for me now. She asked if it was okay for her to copy one thing first and I said sure (because let's be honest, what else was I going to say unless I wanted to cause a fight/awkwardness), but then she just started outright saying \"yup, I'm stealing that idea too!\" and it's really rubbed me the wrong way.

      "description": "Okay, so the situaiton is a little weird here. To summarize, I somewhat recently entered a relationship, and it's going well all things considered. We're pretty good with communicating, are willing to indulge the other's interests (even though we didn't have a significant amount of the same interests at the start), and have very compatible opinions and lifestyles. All things considered, it's good. The issue that has arisen, has to do with the fact that she smokes. As it happens, I have a kink that involves women smoking, but I didn't start dating her for that reason (in fact, when we started dating, I was under the impression she had quit, which later turned out not to be true). I brought it up because we were talking about our sexual preferences, and she was actually excited. She likes the fact that I have the kink, because so many guys reject girls who smoke out of hand. I did give it some thought, but in the moment, I ultimately decided that it was not right or healthy to ask that of her. \n\nHer response to that was lukewarm. She didn't really talk much about it after, except mentioning offhand that she never wanted to quit. Despite my kink, that actually disappointed me. In dating her, I've come to value her more and more, and I'm already terrified of the idea that I'm going to have to see her die of cancer or emphysema in her forties, and live another 40 or 50 years without her (if we end up staying together that long, of course), and yet she seems to have made the choice to die early for the habit. I haven't brought it up since then, because I'm worried we'd get into a full blown fight if I pressed the issue, not to mention her general confusion because of said kink, and I'm wondering if I'd be in the wrong for encouraging her to quit.\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend smokes, I want her to quit despite having a kink for smoking, and I'm not sure if it's right for me to keep bringing it up.",

      "description": "My paternal grandmother died while my parents were out of country. We knew it was coming and they told me everything would be handled automatically just by calling the memory care facility she was at. \n\nThis was not accurate. \n\nThe morning she died I was peppered with questions about her wishes and told I needed to empty her apartment ASAP. My siblings are out of state and my parents told me they wouldn’t come home so I and a friend went through all of grandma’s stuff and took it to storage for my parents to go through or to Goodwill. I also had to pay for her cremation services but was promptly refunded by my parents. \n\nI was fine doing all of this. What I wasn’t fine with was my dad asking me to call his brother and one of her old caretakers to tell them that grandma was dead. I really didn’t feel like it was place to do it and told him that I was uncomfortable with his request. At the time he claimed that he couldn’t access a phone line to contact the various persons and that I had to do it.  I took that at face value and made all the calls except to grandma’s old caretaker. I was tired, both physically and emotionally, and didn’t make it a high priority. \n\nSeveral days later dad asks me if I made the call, I told him I hadn’t, so he tells me he’d take care of it. I press him on whether he could make calls from his location and he demurs. After much pushing he admits he could have called his brother and the others.\n\nI feel hurt and angry about this revelation. Dad, despite being able to make the calls, had me do it which was something I clearly told him I didn’t want to do. He’s telling me it’s my problem I’m upset and since he’s thanked me for what I’ve done up to this point he’s somehow off the hook and I’m being unreasonable for telling him I’m angry.\n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I live in NYC with my partner, and we are very happy together in all respects  except one. I have a very strong aversion to storing extra stuff (especially if it has no clear utility or can be easily replaced). I like to live in a relatively empty space. He is quite the opposite (for example, he never throws away boxes in case he wants to resell an item- even for things &lt;$30). He tends to think 'what if we need this?' and I tend to think 'when would we ever need this?'.  Since we live in NYC, we have very little space and this has been a recurring issue. It is manageable between the two of us, however it has become a major problem since his mom visited this year. She has the same attitude toward things as he does (hoarding, IMO). She buys ponderous amounts of home goods on all her visits. We accumulated heaps upon heaps of old kitchen supplies (that I cannot use) and fabrics (tablecloths? sheets? blankets?)  that I can't make heads or tails of. After going to a huge effort to organize her things such that they wouldn't get in the way (even throwing away a ton of my own stuff), I finally tossed her things in frustration. I figured: she only visits 2 weeks out of the year, if that. And I knew if I asked her permission, she wouldn't agree to throwing (literally) anything away or keeping it elsewhere- no matter how little it is used.  I saw no other solution. Unsurprisingly this has been a massive issue on her visit this year. I did not realize how particular she was- everything must be as it is at her home (with food especially. She is from India and has lived there her entire life). This is hard for me to understand, because if I visited India 2 weeks out of the year, I wouldn't need all of my stuff. I would eat Indian food. But apparently, this is not the view she takes of the issue. Beyond that, there seems to be a cultural difference in how she views 'my house' vs 'your house'. I see my house as mine, my parents as my parents, etc. In fact, my mom throws away my things regularly and I have just gotten used to the idea that if you keep your things in someone else's house, they can get rid of it. This idea is appalling/completely unbelievable to her.  She feels deeply hurt and insulted by my actions, and wants to leave our house because she does not feel welcome. Obviously I did not intend that. I was just trying to rid myself of the chains of excess clutter.  Am I the asshole here? My partner and his mom certainly think so. I admit that I have a problematic hatred of excess stuff, but I don't think that my behavior is entirely unwarranted. My partner actually asked me to post on this sub because I have 'trouble empathizing', so what do you guys think? ",

She is infatuated with me to a level that I cannot match. She thinks I’m the “one” for her. \n\nHere’s where it gets tricky. I haven’t been content with our relationship for awhile now and I have constantly been looking for a reason to end the relationship but we have zero fights. I know this is wrong but I felt it would be better to break each other’s hearts than me destroying hers.\n\nYesterday we had a normal talk which ultimately led me to tell her how I’ve been feeling and how I’m not happy. She couldn’t understand what she’s done wrong and tbh she hasn’t done anything wrong. \n\nShe’s absolutely destroyed right now and I’m feeling pretty awful about the situation myself. Honestly, through my experiences breaking up with a person who loves you unconditionally seems to be harder than being dumped. \n\nAm I an asshole for doing this?

She cannot grasp why I did this and I’m finding it hard to come up with an answer. \n\nTL;DR - broke up with “perfect” gf of 1 year bc I wasn’t happy and broke her heart. No fights caused this. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So I met this guy a couple of days ago. Not even after 24h of knowing each other, he already starts flirting and hitting on me.\n\n I didn't really react to that, mostly because no one hits on me because I'm really socially awkward, and I don't really know what to do when this happens. Later on he starts asking for nudes, shared a covered sausage picture.\n\nI was kind of angry because even if I'm close to 18 I'm still underaged. And he's 20. He seems like a nice person on the outside, he's an Administrator of a server and he's always been nice, but once he's out of that he's weird. I would have seriously given him a chance if it weren't for his behaviour. \n\nI told him \"Look, we can't have a relationship if we don't even know each other. If we don't have a foundation of friendship or acquaintance at the very least.\" He said (before I came up with the idea of being friends) he would love me no matter what anyway, and I was rather taken aback. After I told him what I want, he's been cold and distant, ignoring me most of the time. \n\nAITA for telling him that? AITA for expecting this result?

      "description": "Okay, so this is a long story. There will be a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI’m a teenager who really likes my room. Tonight, my mom straight up told me that I would have to give up my room for a whole week to my grandmother. I would either have to sleep in my brother’s room on his second twin bed, or sleep on an inflatable mattress downstairs. I would also like to add that the door to it leads directly into the loud living room. I asked if she could sleep on the inflatable bed, as my room is pretty much sacred to me, giving me a place to do homework and play games in peace and quiet. She said that she couldn’t because her toe was hurt a bit, and wanted her to have a good bed. We also have a brand new camper that is so fancy it has couch seat warmers and massagers and even a working fireplace. The bed in it is even bigger and more comfortable than mine. I asked if we could plug the camper into our house to give it running water and electricity, but she flat out said no.\n\nI said that I was didn’t want to give up my room, and there had to be a better benefiting compromise. I hate sleeping with my brother because he practically does gymnastics in his sleep, gets up way earlier than I do, watches YouTube in bed early in the morning, is very loud, and keeps me up because he won’t stop talking to me. If I slept downstairs, I wouldn’t be able to go to sleep because I would be able to hear the TV in the living room constantly. She says that I’ll still be able to use my room and computer because my grandmother won’t always be in there, but my grandmother will use the room a lot.\n\nI would be okay with this if it were another relative, but I don't like my grandmother. First, she hates electronics. She lets us play for maybe thirty minutes a day, and constantly went back on her word, because our parents weren’t there. My brother had a breakdown, as he couldn’t do anything he wanted. When she will be staying, there will be three days where my parents won’t be there, as they will be leaving and letting my grandmother supervise. Also, she isn’t an accepting person. I expressed that I am an atheist, and she said, “No, you’re not an atheist. You don’t have enough experience to make that opinion.” This really angered me. She basically said that I didn’t have enough experience with religion to make my own opinions on the matter, even though I have in fact done research into the subject multiple times, in order to confirm my beliefs.\n\nMy mother said that I was being extremely selfish, never thought of others, and couldn’t see past myself. I tried compromise, but she wasn’t open to it. AITA for not giving up my room for a week for my grandmother?\n\ntl;dr: Mom wants me to give up my room for a week to my mean grandmother. I oppose the idea, and she says I’m very selfish and can’t see past myself.\n\nIf YTA, what should I do differently?\n\nIf NTA, what can I do to help the situation?\n\n",

      "description": "Me and my wife have been married for two years. In the beginning of our relationship she had a very attractive hour glass shaped figure, which I enjoyed very much. She also worked out frequently, and ate healthy, and not just because I enjoyed it but because it made her feel happy (her words). She was a dancer while still maintaining a full, curvy shape. \n\nRecently, she has started to fall out of shape. It used to be less noticeable, like a more flabbier butt (I actually like big butts, but hers has recently been riddled with cellulite). Now shes gained a slight tummy on a previously completely flat stomach.\n\nWhen she wears her belly button ring that I once enjoyed I now feel very put off. Sex has started to feel bland and almost like a chore. \n\nI put a lot of time and effort into my body, performing routine exercises each morning, as well as using special lotions, bodywash, and frequently using facial masks to clear out my pores. I do this both for myself and for her enjoyment.\n\nI maintain a strict sugarless diet, in addition to working full time to provide for the house we both live in. She is unemployed and we have no kids. I raised no concerns about this, but i did insist that she take care of the house (which she does) while also keeping an attractive figure.\n\nAt dinner, I brought all my concerns to her about how I am basically unhappy with her appearance right now, as well as providing motivation for her exercise and eating healthier. i used many supporting and comforting words. I told her our sex would be much more enjoyable for both of us since I would actually enjoy it as well.\n\nShe is taken aback by all of this, gets defensive, then begins to cry . I told her that shes being silly, and that im not asking for much. She then says that I am hurting her feelings really badly, and that she feels very ugly now.\n\nI apologize as thats not what i meant, but she continues to cry and we are now on a loop. The worst part about this is now the conversation is derailed and she hasn't committed to any sort of exercise plan because shes upset at me.\n\nAITA For Asking my wife to exercise to be more sexually attractive, or is she in the wrong for letting herself go and not changing?",

      "title": "AITA for trying to have sex with my female friend?",
      "description": "A couple years ago, when I was 20, my female friend who was 2 years older than me invited me to come drink at her house. \nA little background. I was relatively new to drinking, having only had my first alcoholic beverage 4 months previous, and only having drunk a handful of times since then. I'd never been seriously drunk. She was an experienced drinker who drank several times a week (because college I guess) She asked me to bring a bottle of tequila, limes and salt, which I got from another friend.\nI'd also recently had a breakup, like 2 months previous, with a girl that I'd swore up and down was my soulmate, having dated for 2 years up to that point. the ex was the only person I'd had sex with at the time. My friend, we'll call her Sara, had helped me get through it. We'd been friends for (I think) 7 years. It's hard to remember exactly how long because I have terrible memory for a lot of my childhood/adolescence. We'd always had a lot of fun together- we made each other laugh more than anyone else I've spent time with, and she helped me with a lot of personal problems. (We'd never considered a romantic or sexual relationship up to this point, though)\n\n\nWhen I first got there, Sara's friend, we'll call her Amanda, was also there, but wasn't going to drink. Sara and I did a couple shots while shooting the shit, talking about dumb stuff that people make small talk about. When Sara invited me, she said said she'd make dinner but when I got there she just wanted to start drinking. Amanda left after about an hour and we started watching New Girl on her couch. She wanted to do shots, so I did more with her. In the course of just 4 episodes+the time that Amanda was there, I personally had done 7 shots. I think she did 5. I'm a 200 pound guy and she's a 160 pound girl, just to give an idea of how drunk we were.\nIt had been a really long day for me, so I kinda leaned on her while we watched NG, and at some point I fell asleep. We had always been pretty comfortable with consensual touching like hugs and light cuddling etc (but nothing sexual)  so I don't feel this was inappropriate of me. I guess she kept watching New Girl, but I woke with my head on her lap and her hand in my pants. Being very drunk, I took this as a sign that she wanted to get frisky. So I sat up and we sloppily made out. Since her hands were all up in my business, I assumed that reciprocating would be okay, and clumsily tried to start fingering her. She grabbed my hand and pulled it away, but kept making out with me. I thought she was teasing me, as she was still playing with my bits, so I tried to do it again a few minutes later. She pulled my hand away again and kept laughing at me. I'm really confused at this point. Does she want to have sex with me or not? So I kept kissing her, and she kept kissing me. I should mention she was biting and sucking my neck, which left EIGHTTEEN different hickeys (yes, I counted the next day. I was absolutely humiliated at work). After a while, she says \"I can't have sex with you Jared\", so I stop kissing her, stumble over to another room, and fall asleep on the floor.\nThe next day, everything seemed fine when I woke up except I had the worst hangover I'd had up to that point or ever since, so I woke her up. she kicked me out as soon as she woke up. \nWe didn't talk for a long time. We had one short conversation a year later over text where everything seemed fine. But whenever I've seen her around, she gives me a nasty look then ignores me. I regret this event deeply- it ruined a strong friendship that I'd had for a long time. It's also ruined friendships with mutual friends that we had, one of which thinks I tried to rape Sara and won't even listen to my side of the story.AM I the asshole for trying to have sex with Sara?",

      "description": "I invited my friend to my house for a chill time playing tabletop games. I asked him not to smoke weed in my apartment because my girlfriend's sister will be there, she's 15, and her mom doesn't want her around weed otherwise she won't let her come to my apartment alone. Neither my GF or I smoke weed at all. He said that since it's vape weed, he will just say it's a flavored e-cig.   \n\n\nI said \"It smells like weed, if ou could just step into the hallway or something.\"  \nHe said \"She won't know, it'll just be a flavored vape pen\"  \nMe: \"Is it really that important?\"  \nHim: \"Yes, for my comfort. It's not rampant constant use it's every once in a while. I could ask you the same question really. Is it that important? I am not going to offer \\[her sister\\] any.\"  \nMe: \"I just asked you not to vape weed in my apartment, I didn't think it was a big ask.\"  \nHim: \"Maybe I can do it in the bathroom, but what if I told you to eat your food in the bathroom because your food offends me? It quite literally doesn't affect you. But fine. I will not be relaxed or normal. Question, would you let me drink beer? And if so, what's the difference? Vape has no second hand.\"  \n\n\nThen I responded by dis-inviting him for being so disrespectful. We continued with a fight via text lasting over 2 hours beginning with:\n\nHim: \"If you want to cancel because you would like to have more control over my state of mind than me you are more than welcome.\"  \nMe: \"What, you can't walk 3 feet before lighting up? It's really that big of an ask?\"  \n\n\nI later informed him that THC is a proconvulsant, and he knows I have epilepsy. I feel like I was right here, as does my girlfriend, but he seems to think it's ridiculous that I ask him not to vape because I'm just being a control freak.",

      "description": "Before I start the story I need to give a little backstory. This is my first reddit post ever so if I do something stupid my bad. Anyway, I joined color guard my freshman year. Usually when you are returning for the second year it is way less expensive because you already bought all your uniforms and stuff. My now ex-stepdad paid for all my stuff in freshman year, but when my mom was arrested I lost everything. I had to move in with my cousins two states away until my mom got out of jail. Now this year (sophomore year) my mom has to pay for everything. She constantly uses this to belittle me all the time and make me do everything around the house. Meanwhile my sister who is 11 has been in dancing since she was 5 and is way more expensive in the long run. End of back story.\n\nMy moms latest boyfriend is allergic to cats. I made a joke about how maybe he wouldn’t be allergic to cats and we should get one of those as a JOKE. I know we can barely afford it when we can barely afford rent every month. We paid with my color guard stuff with income tax, but in general we are very poor. We never have food at the house. Any my mom ended up calling me a spoiled brat because apparently I always want things I know are too expensive when my sister doesn’t get anything. Then my moms boyfriend went on a huge tangent about how I always make things seem worse then they are and that I crave sympathy. We live in a two bedroom house and I share a room with my sister and my moms boyfriends daughter. We also have two roommates who don’t even pay rent that live in the living room. Anyway, my moms boyfriend complained to the guy that was living with us about me for like 30 minutes including the phrase “if her mom wasn’t there I would have beat the shit out of her”. And I was shocked because I never heard him say something like that before so I told my sister. She agreed with everything the adults said and justified it by saying “you can’t hide from the truth”.\n\nSo i told her if the truth wasn’t bad I should be able to text her friends every bad thing she ever said about them. But in reality, I never really did that. All I did was hide her phone charger so she couldn’t have her phone for 2 weeks as her and I are the only people in the house with the same charger and I don’t let her use mine. My mom heard that I threatened to tell my sisters friends “lies that can get her harmed” and she turned my data off and didn’t let me got to my next color guard competition which could have gotten me kicked of rifle line.\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "title": "AITA for not letting my (18F) little sister (16F) get a giant llama plushie?",
      "description": "My sister and I went to an arcade where all your tickets for prizes and gaming credits are loaded onto a card. The problem was that each new card that is created has a $5 activation fee and so my sister suggested that we share a card so we only have to pay one activation fee. That made sense since we were going to stick around each other anyways, so we got one card and loaded it with gaming credits and started to play games in the arcade. Most of the games my sister played were games that did not give tickets such as Dance Dance Revolution while I solely played games that gave tickets. Once all our gaming credits were gone we had 2000 tickets to spend on prizes. My sister and I couldn’t find a prize we both wanted so I said since she paid for half of the card and I paid for the other half, she can spend 1000 tickets while I spend the other 1000. I decided to get a rock salt lamp for 950 tickets but my sister wanted to spend 1,500 tickets on a giant llama plushie. She wanted to use some of my tickets and argued she wanted the llama plushie a lot more than I wanted the rock salt lamp, which is probably true since she made a big deal about how much she loved the llama while I just got the rock salt lamp cause I thought it was cool. That being said, that doesn’t mean I didn’t want the rock salt lamp. I told her no we’re not getting the llama and that we were going to split the tickets in half evenly. Plus, she could get a normal sized llama plushie for 700 tickets and still have some leftover for something else. She didn’t like that I said no so she then brought an employee over and asked them whether or not we should get her the giant llama (thank goodness the employee didn’t view it as a nuisance, he was very kind and just laughing at the whole situation). The employee asked for my side of the problem and I told him my sister and I should split the tickets in half evenly so it’s fair but my sister told the employee to think of the emotional aspect of it: a giant llama is going to make her a lot happier than rock salt lamp is going to make me. The employee then said he agreed with me and so I started walking to the cashier to redeem my prizes. My sister kept trying to block me from getting to the cashier and then said “You’d get me the giant llama if you loved me,” so I said “I guess I don’t love you then” ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ since I definitely was not getting her the giant llama. I budged past her and redeemed my prize and gave her the card to spend the rest of the tickets on anything else she wanted. But she just stomped away and said “I don’t want anything.” Later on she told my mom about what happened and how I didn’t let her get the giant llama plushie and my mom got mad at me and said as the older sibling I should’ve gotten it for my little sister. She gave a whole speech about how she’s my little sister and I should love her and do stuff for her to make her happy and that I am being selfish for getting the rock salt lamp. \n\nAITA for not getting a giant llama plushie for my little sister?

      "description": "Pretty simple. Had this debate earlier with a friend.\n\nUber tips didn’t hit my last city until awhile after I’d used the service, and I left soon after, so it wasn’t a phenomenon for more that a few months for me.\n\nThe only reason I ever took one was because, especially with a Visa discount, they’re extremely cheap in my city. Often an Uber across the city was 50 cents more than a bus ride.\n\nI tip a good to ridiculous amount at restaurants and cafes. I have always practiced the philosophy of “if you can’t afford to tip, you can’t afford to buy it.” That applies to haircuts, food, coffee, and any other service.\n\nI have to go ahead and admit, though, that it never seemed particularly necessary to tip an Uber POOL (to be clear) any more than I’d tip a bus driver.\n\nI have rarely if ever given fewer than five stars on a ride. I don’t even know what would make me do that. My own rating is 4.96 and has been there since I started using it. \n\nIn the event that I have a good conversation with a driver, I often do tip, but in my city that’s quite rare. It’s usually civil but silent.\n\nIn all, I’m floored by this argument and basically feel terrible. I’ve been using this service as essentially a bus line - civil, clean, paying a contractor through a service, gets me where I need to go and we both rate the other well.\n\nI can’t express enough how strongly I believe in tipping all service workers, and I want to know if I’m a complete idiot and asshole for not having thought of Uber drivers as the same.\n\nFor what it’s worth, the friends of mine who live in my city and use Uber to the same extent feel the same way, while the friend with whom I discussed this lives elsewhere. The local friends are also all generous tippers and kind people and very friendly to drivers who want to interact. It’s also true that the reason we use the service is that it’s very very cheap here - adding another $1 would negate the Uber/bus advantage. I don’t know if that matters.\n\nPlease do be honest - AITA? Very willing to change my ways.",

My best friend and I love to go to buffalo wild wings once and a while and we remembered it was boneless thursday so we had the idea to go to dinner. We immediately decided to bring 2 of our other friends with us. This was all last week. We asked our two other friends and made a group chat and figured out rides and times and unlimetly decided to have a sleepover at my best friends house after.\n\n So my friend has a close friend (let's call her A)  who she was talking to and A asked her if she had plans on thursday. She said yes and my best friend told A that she was going out to dinner with friends. A immediately asks if she can go as well. My best friend asks me if it is ok if she can go and I simply say no. \n\nWe made plans for the 4 of us to go to. Bwws and I'd rather not go with 5 people because then the group becomes cliquey and it's no longer everyone spending time togeather and this group of 2 and these two hanging out at the same place that they went to together. \n\nNow A is upset, this isnt the first time she has done this. If she isnt invited to something she gets upset and plays it like I'm the asshole\n\nSo am I the asshole for saying no to her coming to dinner?",

      "description": "My grandfather-in-law is mostly deaf but refuses to wear his hearing aids. We end up having to shout to be heard, but when we do this, he gets mad and insists he can hear just fine and we need to stop shouting. He gets especially mad when I raise my voice, because he’s a very sexist, traditional old Chinese man and think women should never raise their voice. \n\n\nI finally got tired of it all and decided to give him what he wants, and started talking to him in a soft, demure voice. He can’t hear me, of course, and every time he asks me to repeat what I said, I repeat it in the same volume while smiling sweetly and looking at him expectantly as if I’m expecting a reply. I also block my lips a lot so he can’t attempt to lip read. He’s too proud to admit he can’t hear me, and at first, he’d try to guess what I said and reply to that. But after I kept responding with confused looks and more questions, he eventually stopped talking to me completely which is awesome, because he’s the most unpleasant person to talk to. \n\nHe loves lecturing, and his favourite topics is why everyone of the wrong race/nationality/gender/employment are inferior. My husband and I refuse to take him out for dinner anymore despite all his hints, because he’s so damn rude to everyone. He’d lecture waiters on why they’re failures in life, talk loudly about how [insert race/nationality here] are inferior to make sure the entire restaurant can hear him, make negative comments about people seated next to us in a loud voice and just give them smug, condescending smirks when they shoot us dirty looks..you get the gist. \n\nI started pretending to ask him questions mid-insult, and I’ll admit that sometimes I just mouth gibberish while keeping my submissive wife smile on, and then look at him expectantly as if I expected him to reply. He would always end up flustered and, being to proud to admit he couldn’t hear me, eventually shut up. \n\nSince we’re the only relatives living close to him, we were initially expected to to have dinner at his place daily and be at his beck &amp; call for any errands. My husband and I hate him so much, we decided to terminate our lease early and move to a place that’s further away from him. We got a lot of shit from the family, of course. After my husband joined me in talking to him in a soft voice, he no longer insists on daily dinners or complains about our decision to move. \n\nApparently, some people think what we’re doing is cruel and messing with his mental health. Are we the assholes here? ",

A new-start kind of thing for me. I decide to send a fairly lengthy text saying I am not trying to continue any kind of communication, I just want to apologize for a lot of the things I've done in the past and send my final best wishes before moving.\n\nA couple hours later, I'm packing up the last of the storage room. I find a box of what looks to be every family photo she had. 3 albums and a ton of loose photos. \n\nIt's 6 am at this point, and I am going to be packing the truck up at 8, so I decide to call. No answer, so I figure I'll call a couple more times and maybe she will wake up. On the 4th call, I leave a voicemail explaining that I have her photos, to let me know where and I can drop them off. And if not I will figure something out before I leave.\n\nI check my phone at 7, and I have a text telling me not to harass her, that she doesn't read my texts, get over her and move on, to get it through my head she doesn't want to talk etc etc. Clearly didn't listen to my voicemail. \n\nI haven't called or texted until the other day, and I appear to be blocked now. I am not mad, just seemed strange, and I just didn't want to deal with it, nor do I know how to contact her now anyhow. \n\nShould I have figured out a way to get all of that stuff to her? \n",

      "description": "Sorry if this goes all of the place, I'm just trying to talk a little about how she is to show why the title is what it is. \nEver since I was little she has always talked about how she was going to move with me whenever I do move out. When I was little I didn't really put much thought or care into it and just said ok. But when I turned 17/18 (21 now) I started to realize how things were off by her wanting that. She's always been kinda controlling and would literally follow and continue an argument if you disagree with her. To the point she trapped me on my old loft bed once. With that in mind and how she tends to freak out and try to spam call me at a friend's house or at work while using the excuse of not remembering when I get off. Whenever I do have a chance to go to a friend's or anything because she tries to keep me with her. I don't want to live the rest of my life like that. \n\nEven though she uses claims of wanting away from my stepfather, I feel she has different intentions. Even if its part early onset empty nest syndrome. I love my mom and am grateful to her, but I feel like she's suffocating me. I am unable to do anything anyone else my age would be doing (excluding drinking and all). To the point where I have never been able to have much of any male friends let alone a boyfriend. Which I was ok with in high school...but now I'm not. Another thing is that she  will straight up walk into my room or the bathroom regardless of what I'm doing. To the point I've either had to hide behind my bed/dresser or slam the door because I was changing. I've never had privacy. \n\nI want privacy, quiet (constant arguing between mom&amp;stepdad) to do what I want with a room or home without pressure. Like most females I eventually want a child...but if she were living with me and if I do end up with someone...she'd prevent that. Honestly I'm terrified of what would happen if I let her move with me. Need some time to myself and to learn how to take care of myself instead of her automatically speaking for me as if I'm still a kid. Scared that she'd try to keep up her control over everything.  \n\nI know she gave birth to me and raised me, but would I be an ahole to not let her move with me? \n\n\n\n",

Things like “you’re missing CS” or “why didn’t you heal” just being very demanding and wanting me to play in a specific manner. He says it’s criticism and that whenever I get upset, he says “I don’t take criticism well”. I’ve played league since season 1 and only recently started taking ranked slightly seriously but not too obsessively. My boyfriend offered to help me climb up and at first, it was fun but now, it’s low key becoming like a chore.  We’ve had these type of talks about his behaviour throughout, and although he does acknowledge it, it’s kind of a repetitive “I’m sorry” thing. I feel kind of an asshole for not wanting to play because of this sole reason, since he expressed that he’s doing this for me and that he wants to see me improve. And also because he emphasized that he wants to play this game because he wants to be with me.\nSo reddit, am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR; boyfriend giving me “advice” on league, sounds too demanding, makes me want to not play with him.\nSorry for format, on mobile.",

      "description": "Ok, let me first point out that my sisters are under 14 years old, and I'm just a teenager. A few months ago they devised a plan to take a trip to Thailand for... well no reason specifically. They just like Asia. They put out dog-walking posters all around the neighborhood in hopes of getting some money to fund their trip. Unfortunately, they got no business whatsoever. The posters were out for maybe a month before they had to take them down due to the harsh rain. Now, a few months later, I asked my sisters to refund me the money I gave them for their trip because I knew they were obviously not going anymore. But my sisters snapped at me, saying they still were going to go. I told them they had only $20 toward their trip (including my donation of $10, the other $10 was given by my dad.)\n\nAnyway, they yelled at me that I was being \"greedy\" for wanting my money back. Their argument was that I gave them money willingly, and I should've accepted that I wasn't going to get my money back. I understood, but when I gave them the money it was *towards* their trip, and it's unfortunately not happening anymore so why should they keep my money? \n\nReddit, AITA?",

When they do bring up my flying to visit them, I bring up these issues and they say it will be fine, but that I really should stay 2+ weeks.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I told my parents I don't want to visit them until next year, when I am back in the states?

      "description": "So my SIL calls me during the day to put forward an idea for throwing In-Laws a wedding anniversary party and a general excuse to bring the whole family together. I think it's a great idea and dispite the fact my In-laws haven't treat me the best I do love party planning and the rest of my husband's family are so lovely. \n\nSo she tells me she wants it at a local venue that has a huge beautiful hall and good catering. I agree it's a good setting. She then tells me she will organise contacting everyone invited making calls ect. Devise a ruse and bring parents to the said venue. She will do everything so my husband and I don't have to worry about a thing. Could we just handle the venue? \n\nI say sure what would you like me to do? Get prices? Sort the menu options? Book a date? \n\nShe informs me she wants to pick the menu. But yes could I cover the costs. I'm like, wait up? What am I doing? She tells me I cover the venue she will sort out everything else. Ends the call. \n\nSo confused I relay back to my husband I'm unsure of what exactly she's putting into this? Also worth mentioning this particular venue and catering are about £1000 for the amount of guests possibly coming. \n\nHubby calls her up later to try and figure out what she means. Baisicly she wants to plan and organise the party but we have to pay for it. \n\nShe lives at home rent free and has no children or commitments at the age of 33. \n\nMy husband and I have a house. 2 kids and various bills and simply cannot spare this amount of cash on a party. She's insisting we are being awful people and that we don't care about or appreciate them. \n\nOh and can my aunt (a professional cake baker) do a free or heavily reduced cake. And that it's only fair because she did our wedding cake for free so? \n\nAm I really in the wrong here!? ",

I lived with it for 17 years, I know the signs when I see them.\n\nIn order to appease my cousin, my grandparents actively let her get away with everything because it’s easier than having her go off on a tantrum and breaking something. Tonight, she had one of her meltdowns because she didn’t get her way, and my grandparents gave into her demands. Once again, I tell them that they really aren’t doing her any favors and that she is doing everything my brother did. An argument ensues between my grandparents and myself, claiming that situations are totally different. I told my grandparents to grow a backbone and learn to tell that kid “no” once and a while and that she needs stronger psychological help than what she is currently getting.  That as her primary guardians, they can’t treat her like they would treat a normal grandchild. They say I’m overreacting. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for finding it annoying when my mother tries to contact my sister?",
      "description": "To give a bit of context - my mother and father have split up for quite a while now, about 8 years maybe, and they really don't like each other. My father is ex-special forces and is pretty 'uptight', but he used to be a solid bloke. I've already had a 'OffMyChest' type thing about him, but the long and short of it is he's a prick. My mother despises him, and uses every opportunity to bring up how horrible a person he is - I agree with her sometimes, but other times I'm uncertain if she's telling the whole truth. I haven't spoken to my dad in about 3-4 years now, and I doubt I'll ever speak to him again, so I can't ask him about any of this.\n\nHe kicked me out the house and disowned me (not legally, but might as well have) when I was 15-16 over me taking a fiver off the side (about 6-7 dollars?). There was a lot leading up to it, but I would have thought it was a slap on the wrist affair, not excommunication. I wasn't a difficult kid who stole stuff and drank and smoked crack round the back of Sainsbury's, I basically played board games and read books all my free time. It's also important to note that I lived with him full time for a year while my sisters did 50/50.\n\nMy youngest sister is 13, but has the mental age of someone a lot younger. However, I think she knows that people expect less of her because of this and uses it as an excuse to do whatever she wants. Nothing appalling, just making stuff really difficult or time-consuming when it shouldn't be. She was 50/50 between my mum and dad until about 3-4 months ago. The only time my dad contacted her was to write a Christmas card, which he got my other sister to take to her. He kicked her out the house because she was 15 minutes late leaving my mum's/getting to his and told her not to bother coming.\n\nMy older sister (15) lives with my dad full time for no apparent reason. She avoids my mother and doesn't talk to her. One day she never came back and never offered a reason why. My mother pandered to my sisters constantly, so I can't think of anything why. My dad will have said something (a year-ish ago) which made her stay or something.\n\nContext over.\n\n\nSo - my mum always tries to contact my sister (15) She would wait outside school, but my sister would run off. She would message her and receive no reply, if she saw her in the street or shops she would try and talk to her. My father is a lawyer (which I'm pretty certain he became in order to get away with something particular - but not important), and this culminated in my mother receiving a non-molestation order. Basically she can't talk to my sister, or try to, or anything like that. Obviously it doesn't sound very good though.\n\nBecause of this, my mum has been using me (my other sister isn't bright enough) as a go-between. If I meet up with my sister then she tells me to askt hear questions, to which my sister will says 'I don't know', and when I relay that back to my mother she'll tell me I should have said something different, which is just a rephrasing of what I said. My sister treats it like a game and doesn't take it very seriously, and generally avoids the topic. My mum always asks me what I think she's (sister) thinking and why I think she left, and it really pisses me off that I have to say 'how am I meant to know?' a dozen times.\n\nAbout me: I struggle emotionally. At the end of one of the questioning sessions my mum often says I have the emotional depth of a teaspoon, and she's tried to get me to go to therapy for it a couple of times. I wasn't too bothered when my dad kicked me out, and I'm not too bothered by not seeing my sister often either. My dad is a clinic psychopath, and I'm assuming I've inherited/learned those sorts of behaviours.\n\nAt Christmas I met up with my sister, and my mum had some presents to give her, which she gave to me to give. This wasn't a new phone or a couple of books or some clothes or whatever, but a sack full of presents, embroidered with Christmas-sy stuff. I have it too my sister, who avoided the questions about why she doesn't talk to mum and all that, and went back home, went through the questions from my mum and statements about how I did it wrong.\n\nFast forward to today: a copper came round to the house with this sack of presents, had a chat with my mum (not sure what about exactly), and left. My mum went through the sack, found all the presents had been unwrapped, and (probably correctly) guessed that my sister had unwrapped them and my dad had said \"give them back or go back\", the reasoning being my sister would have said 'don't want them', not unwrap them all and give them back. My dad does that often and plays it off as a 'loyalty' thing. \n\nNow (seeing as I've got a bit off topic here), am I the asshole for being annoyed with my mother for trying to contact my sister? Annoyed makes me sound petty, but I can't think of the right word. I think that she fails to see that what she's doing doesn't help her, and is culminating in some serious shit as of late. A few days ago she decided to wait out school again, breaking this order which expires in 3-ish weeks, and was surprised and outraged when the coppers called. I realise that she wants to see my sister and has every right just to sit down with her and ask her why, but I despise being the go-between, I don't like being asked questions I don't know the answer to, and I really hate it when my mum expects that me saying the same shit to my sister as last time will work. I've tried telling her that I don't want to have all these conversations about how my dad's a prick and it's all his fault and why does my sister do this and XYZ, but then my mum goes on a rant about how it's important and I don't care and stuff. I think she fails to recognise that I have my own stuff to sort out with university and similar.\n\nSo, AITA?",

I am definitely not ok with the situation and have been giving the cold shoulder since then. She also told me that he was only a friend, that he knew about me and nothing would ever happened between them. \n\nIt is not like I don’t believe in friendship with ex but them sleeping in the same bed bothers me.\n \nAITA for being mad at her for hosting her ex boyfriend?",

      "description": "My boyfriend (30M) and I (30F) recently moved in together. We've been dating just under 2 years &amp; we agreed to split rent and bills 50/50. We have similar income levels.\n\nSo, I get a food benefit in my job, where my company provides me with breakfast and lunch, coffee/drinks, snacks, etc. And for most of my weekday dinners and weekend meals, I either eat work leftovers (which I am happy to share with my bf) or very cheap groceries - canned black beans, oatmeal, etc. I spend about $25/week on groceries.\n\nMy boyfriend's job doesn't provide food, so he spends a lot more on groceries. He suggested that we should also be splitting the grocery bill 50/50. I disagree because I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick, and I am happy to just to cook and eat separately for the most part. \n\nI should say I think he views splitting food as having an emotional benefit primarily, with a secondary convenience factor. Groceries aren't a financial burden at our income levels. I don't think he cares about the financial part much. I care about the financial part because I have aggressive savings goals.\n\nWe had a recent conflict about this because I came in late from a flight one night, and our city is covered in exceptional amounts of snow right now so all the grocery stores and restaurants were closed down. I ate a small amount of his food that he offered me - a protein bar and some milk and cereal. The next morning he made coffee and breakfast and offered some to me while I was still in bed, I had about a cup of coffee and declined the food just because I wasn't feeling like that particular meal right then.\n\nAfter that we went to the grocery store together and he wanted us to split the bill from the groceries he bought himself. I was like, we talked about this and agreed not to split and just eat our own food, and he said \"oh so the food and coffee you had yesterday just fell out of the sky then?\" I said that I would be happy to pay him for that given the exceptional circumstances, and he said no, he just wishes we were combining our households more.",

It's all good, but it starts to get a little weird over time. We start to run into each other a lot, 'A' and 'B', and 'A' is like constantly being VERY friendly with me, adjusting my tie, rubbing me a lot, things I would consider to be a little flirty, especially if the person is married. She does this in front of 'B' and friends, and I can see it makes both of us uncomfortable, but I don't know what to do yet. \n  \nI thought it was just me at times, but mutual friends start to comment on how it's a bit weird, but I'm thinking, ehh, she's a few years older than me, and we were never like that. I'm in my early 20's. Well, she starts texting me about her relationship and how it's not what she thought. She's askin me for advice, but I tell her I have no experience being married, and there isn't anything I can help her with. The texts start to get a bit ... Weird, and I feel like it's crossing a line.  \n  \nI start to avoid her, and ignore her calls and texts. When she sees me I say hi, but try to avoid interacting with her. She said I am ignoring her now, in a half joking way, and I feel bad now, but the way she acts is kind odd I feel.",

He said we didnt even take it out of the box. They both gave us shit all night long, and told us she doesnt need to use it but at least sit/pretend. Thats how he (step father in law) had his kids potty trained at 18 months ect. \n\nI mean shes so young. I understand where they are coming from and thats how they wanted to parent their children. I understand its advice I may not agree with but now I think they expect us to have it out of the box when they come over next time.

He's gay, big deal. \n\nAnyways, I have nine contacts in my phone named \"Bobby\". For some reason I just know alot of people with that name.

Apparently he started going through my phone and got to my messages and saw a conversation with \"Buttfucker Bobby.\" It didn't take him long to put two and two together and realize that it was him. He got really upset and started accusing me of being homophobic. I thought he was joking at first since we've been friends for years and the insinuation of me being homophobic and staying friends with someone who I obviously knew was gay seemed ridiculous to me. He started grilling me on it and I offered him the exact same explanation that I gave above, even showing him the other nicknamed Bobbys in my phone. \n\nAnyways, this was two days ago and he is still angry at me and claiming that I'm a homophobe.

      "description": "I've been sick since the weekend and I was quarantining myself in my room to avoid getting my family sick. I thought I was doing a nice thing by doing that. Unfortunately my kitty cat took a turn for the worse and I had to put her down :(\n\nShe was an older cat, but still had a bit of spunk in her until the last week or so. I noticed before I got sick that she seemed to be more tired than usual, but nothing alarming.\n\nWell the other day I happened to be home sick and I went to get water and I came across my kitty cat. She was laying in a weird way and when I tried to get her up she was limp. \n\nI immediately rushed her into the vet and she sadly had to be put down. I am really sad and miss her dearly but in the shape she was in when I found her,  it was definitely her time. \n\nHowever, after all of this, I find out that my family knew she was in bad shape and did nothing! 3 days before this mess (when I started getting sick and went into quarantine), my kitty was not looking so great. I found this out because after I gave news to my mom about the kitty passing away, she immediately knew what I was talking about (which made me suspicious). I then probed for more information and she said \"Yea she's been like that for a  while\" WHAT?! \n\nSo they knew and did nothing!\n\nWhen I had taken my poor kitty in, I was told she had tumours in her tummy and was in liver failure (they checked her ears and they were yellow!). I can't imagine all of the pain and discomfort my poor kitty was in!\n\nI was so fed up that when I was talking with my mom today I lost it. I basically told her it was unacceptable that poor kitty had to be in this kind of pain. She responded \"Well your dad didn't want to spend the money\". So I basically said to her how much pain this poor cat would have been in to be in liver failure. And I was met with no sympathy at all, just \"Well I wanted to take her in but dad said no\". \n\nThey ended up having to pay to have her put down anyway, so WHY was it such a big deal? They left her to suffer and for that I am having a hard time coping. \n\nAn aside to this: The conversation got even more intense and I told them how I feel like I don't belong in the family (I am the black sheep) and how I am having a hard time being back home (I moved back home a few years ago, can't afford to move out sadly, though I contribute to the bills). \n\nMy family is sexist and my mom outright admitted to that and basically said I had to get over it. \n\nSo anyway, I'm left feeling really angry at my family, as if they don't care at all about my feelings or anyone else's (this issue with my kitty proves it to me!). It makes me so mad my poor baby had to suffer! I hope she wasn't suffering long!",

      "description": "They've been together for a year (as of 5 days ago), got engaged at 4 months together, moved in together at 3 months, and now she's pregnant. He just turned 23 and she's 22. Now, this normally isn't an issue with me but they just aren't set up financially to have a kid right now.\n\nNormally, I would be excited but they just don't have their shit together, plain and simple. She dropped out of school and quit her job back before Christmas &amp; my brother is apprenticing to be a mechanic so he's making $15/hr currently. She hasn't mentioned whether or not she's going to find a new job or not anytime soon. \n\nAs of right now, I'm not super excited because it's going to be tough on them to raise a kid and I believe that they just aren't in the place to raise a child right now. Our mom isn't too pleased either (she flat out told them), just because she knows that my brothers fiancee is flat out broke (they rent a condo from our moms boss and I guess her parents have been paying her side of the rent) and that they are going to be struggling.\n\nI told them congratulations and that I'm happy for them, but I'm just not as excited as I should be. Mostly because I'm worried for them. \n\nSo am I the asshole for not being super excited about being an aunt just because I'm worried about their financial situation and how they're going to deal with this?",

      "description": "Long story, any who, three years ago I met this girl on a dating app we started seeing each other. (Currently I’m M22 and her F21) Things were going superbly well and I fell for her. 3 months later I asked to become official, she said no but wanted to be friends. I was very hurt. \nEventually she just up and ghosted me. She blocked me on snap (our main conduit for conversation) and I let it be. For a few months I was quite sad, but moved on.\n\nWell, 8-9 months later she randomly unblocked from snap and I remember having a story up and she responded to my story like nothing ever happened. I was stunned, but acted calm and barely acknowledged it. So for a year we just snapped randomly. Maybe having a tiny conversation here and there. I didn’t mind it and really didn’t think anything about it. Well the end of summer ‘18 rolled around and for some reason we decided on meeting. I haven’t seen her irl for 2 years and so I was a bit nervous. We met up and the experience was great! We caught up, laughed, enjoyed each other’s company and overall it was just fantastic. After that we continued to snap each other. It got to the point where we were talking daily. We met up a few more times and each time was better than the last. Also I must mention she had a boyfriend of quite while at this time and I knew of this but didn’t really care. I was just appreciating having her in my life. Well after about 3 months of talking everyday I started to fall for her again and to my surprise she broke up her boyfriend around the time I realized my feelings, so I was absolutely astounded.\n\nWell some time went on and then a few weeks after their break up we had a chat over text about us. I wish it was in person but we weren’t both in town at the time. Any who it boiled down to me saying how much I cared about her, but since she just got out of a relationship I completely understood why she didn’t want to rush into anything. Plus we are graduating college soon and all that stuff. She agreed with this and thanked me for my understanding and she said that she thought I was a really great guy as well and she really didn’t want things to go down the same route as last time by her ghosting me and all that. I felt so relieved and overall it was a good conversation. \n\nWell, after that we hung out in person a few more times. Every time went great and we continued to talk everyday, but then all of sudden she stopped responding. She kept saying how busy she was and I understood. Any who she hasn’t talked to me in about a month and I’m just broken. I think about her all the time and it hurts to know someone led me on so hard and I cared so much for them. Like “fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me” right?\n\nAny who WIBTA if I sent her a screenshot of the text she sent me that night we talked about “us” on how she didn’t want to do that to me again? I know it’s probably petty, but I just want her to know...what do you guys think? ",

The remaining 1/3 is to be done by Wednesday. My partner has never stuck to this schedule. I usually do a large chunk of the report, and he doesnt even touch it until Wednesday. This was never too much of an issue until he went to start his share and couldnt figure it out. I ended up spending two hours trying to walk him through it and then just did it myself.

Our “rule” is that if we do things like a meal together, it’s out of the joint account, and if it’s something on our own we use our individual accounts. \n\nThis week we’re vacationing with his family, and his parents gave us a relatively large sum of money “for expenses on the trip.”  This went into our joint account and we’ve used it to pay for things like amusement park tickets and the extra costs of being away from home. \n\nToday we’re all visiting an art museum together, he and his family decide they’re tired and they’ve seen enough boring old paintings, and leave me and my daughter (not his own—we’re a blended family) at the museum while they go do their own thing for the afternoon. While they’re gone, he and his family go to lunch, and his parents pay for that lunch. \n\nMy daughter and I stay at the museum, eat lunch in the cafeteria there, and I pay for it out of the joint account. I figure that’s fair, because we were given the money specifically to pay for expenses on the trip. To me, it seems like his parents paid for his meal in person, and my meal by giving us the money to buy it ourselves. Same either way, right?\n\nBut now I’m being told that I’m greedy and selfish because I used *our* money to pay for *my* needs. \n\nYes, I violated our rule but this circumstance seems obviously different to me. Is there a side I’m not seeing? Am I a greedy, selfish asshole? ",

On my ph too so probaly doesn't help.\n\nI am currently on holiday with my mum, dad, brother and son. \n\nThis holiday has been good apart from my mum constantly being negative and aggressive, especially about money.\n\nBackground: my mum and dad split up 6 months ago. Which is after we had our tickets and accommodation booked and paid for.\n\nWe all had around 1000 each for spending money which for where we are is a great amount. The issue is my mum is harboring resentment towards my dad and can't hold it in. (My dad is quite easy going most of the time and the reason they aren't together is because she didn't want to be anymore which is her choice of course i have no issue with that).\n\nWe went to lunch and my brother offered to pay on his card and only asked for 20 from each of us. My mum gave her 20 then got agressive when my dad paid his 20. (Cause he has to pay more than anyone right?) She went on for ages about it and still hasnt dropped it. (She thinks my dad is ripping us off) \n\nToday she got aggressive over a refillable drink that was my dads but my brother wanted to pay to refill it. His money his choice right? Well nooooooo can't do that dads ripping us off.\n\nAlso today she had a conversatio with my dad about the events we were doing. \n\nMy dad says he said if you're not happy why don't you find something to do that you like?\n\nMy mum says she was told to f**k off and have her own holiday\n\nI was unaware of what my dad actually said and when she told me the f**k off part i said \" well im not surprised after the way you have treated him\"\n\nThat has now been turned into me telling her to f**k off and have her own holiday.\n\nShe is now crying saying how offended she is and telling us that she won't forget this\n\n\nAm I The Asshole for being honest woth her? \n",

They are pretty old bookmarks from like 4 years ago (I know, stupid on me to leave them) and I told her exactly that. She then asked whether i watch porn, and I said that while I haven't watched it in a while 'cause I'm super happy with our sexlife, I have watched it while we're in a relationship.\n\nThat's where her whole world fell apart, she started crying, said she is disgusted.. I said it doesn't mean anything at all, that she is my center of attention and the one who i desire over everything and that our sexlife is awesome, and that i did it because we're in a long distance relationship and it can get my imagination going etc. She said that makes it worse. She is disgusted and humiliated that i would masturbate to other women's bodies, and to see them cum, and that i lied when i told her a couple of days ago that she is the only one i want, she says that i don't suffice her. she says apparently the nudes she sends me aren't enough, and i said that i love them over everything and masturbate to them all the fucking time. i tried to explain and explain, that for me it isn't attached to feelings, just visual, but she didn't want to hear it, said to go fuck myself etc.. but to be honest i can also understand her, and told her that i would never watch porn again, and that it's reasonable to demand that, but she doesn't want that either.\n\ni'm in her country (europe) for the whole month, and to be honest, the last weeks weren't really easy either, she is quite insecure because of the distance and pretty emotional also.. i tried to console her the rest of the evening but it didn't work at all, she only said that she thought i wasn't like that, that something's broken.. she was inconsolable, and when it was kind of time to sleep, i asked her several times what position would help her the most so that i can cuddle her, and she said several times just sleep in your sleep position. i did that and then she said how i could really leave her to sleep like that.. i tried to console again and tbh became frustrated, and said i'm really trying to do everything to help you her and it's still not enough maybe that's where i am the asshole? i didn't really want to excuse either, and said that i didn't really do anything wrong, maybe also asshole? sorry for this blur, i'm emotional and clueless to and promised not to speak to friends about it..\n\nI don't know what to do, i feel on a communicative level we're not really compatible.. she cried so much and is so sad and broken on the inside, WIBTA for ending it when she comes back from work tonight?",

      "description": "Myself (20) and a coworker (50ish) share the responsibilities of delivery driver at the hardware store owned by my family. Although i'm not new to the store itself, i've only recently become the driver for 3 days a week whilst the other 2 are covered by him, as I work weekends as well. This arrangement was prompted by our 5 day a week driver moving on to another job. \n\nAbout a week into my start as delivery boy, my coworker mentioned that I needed to stop leaving empty water bottles in the truck (it's been hot so I buy cold water). It seemed mostly polite, but upon reflection, there was a serious undertone, and the way he jokingly grabbed the back of my neck may have been what prompted me to make it my mission to hide at least one water bottle a week somewhere in the truck. Petty, i know, but i'd be lying if I said it wasn't just a little satisfying. Fast forward a couple of months to late last week, another coworker notified me of a handwritten note sitting in the truck and when they opened the door they were showered by 9 or so of my water bottles, a booby trap intended for me, no doubt. This is the note, word for word minus our names -\n\n *\"\\*Accriat\\*, AFTER HAVING ASKED NICELY YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ME OR ANYONE ELSE*  *WHO USES THE TRUCK. CLEAN UP YOUR FUCKING MESS. THIS IS NOT A GARBAGE TIP I ALSO LEFT MOST OF THE RATCHET STRAPS* (Ties used to strap loads onto trucks) *ROLLED NEATLY FOR EASE OF USE. THANKS FOR THE 15 FUCKING MINUTES OF KNOTS YOU LEFT ME -\\**coworker not amused by my water bottle antics\\*\" \n\nFirstly, yes, the whole thing was written in caps. \n\nIn regards to the ratchet straps being tangled, our roles beyond delivering are a bit different, as in, he works 2 days a week and spends the whole time in the truck and away from the store itself. Because I also work in store, I have expectations in store. So whilst we do the same average amount of deliveries per day, i'm usually going back and fourth serving customers and contacting suppliers. He's right though, he often leaves the straps neatly rolled which is nice but not super necessary (rolling the straps takes almost as long as untangling) and is usually not high up on my list of priorities when I always work through morning tea break and cut my lunch breaks short. In his defence I did just dump the 3 straps I used on the passenger seat, and, not that he knew, but I did so because we had a few urgent deliveries called in that afternoon, so whilst I was paid until 4:30, i worked until 6:00, meaning I couldn't care less that I left straight after.\n\nAs silly as the water bottle thing is, I made sure not to leave any other rubbish besides water bottles so I wouldn't describe it as dirty. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I (22m) am a tattoo artist and my girlfriend (30f) is desperate for me to tattoo her in places we are told not to tattoo on people who are not heavily tattooed, and she wants me to do it for free.\n\nI work at a studio where we are told we cannot tattoo hands, necks or faces of people who are not heavily/decently tattooed already because a lot of the time they don't understand how much these tattoos can hinder them getting work. For example, my boss always tells us about the time one of our employees explained the risks of a hand tattoo to a woman but she insisted on it anyway, and when she was fired the week after for \"other reasons\" she blamed him for doing the tattoo (and that's when the ban was put in). \n\nSo. My girlfriend was a medium sized flower tattoo on her neck. She is currently not working, so she also wants it for free. I've explained the risks, she says she doesn't care and all her friends with tattoos have jobs (none of them have very visible tattoos, though) and she says that, because she is my girlfriend, the rules shouldn't apply to her. She also wants to not pay because she's out of work. \n\nI've told her no, but she keeps pestering and I don't know how to shut her down. She mentioned getting the same tattoo somewhere else, and I supported this until she said for free again. I'm not so stingy as to charge my girlfriend, but the size of the tattoo she wants would make it around £200, and our shop has a policy that we have to pay for any tattoos we give for free, which I can't afford to do. When I explained this to her, she said I should sneak it, but I don't want to risk my job for this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for telling my girlfriend no and not even trying to help her?

      "description": "This is a huge point of contention between me and my partner. Sorry for the long post and maybe bad formatting.\n\nSo me and my SO fight a lot. A LOT. Before you tell me to break up, the last ~6 mo of our relationship has been HEAVILY strained. Family issues, money issues, both of us struggle a lot with a variety of mental health issues and trauma. We don't fight if we are both having a good day and if we do it is resolved quickly and we used to get into screaming matches and worked past it. Getting better.\n\nFor me, being apologized to (and apologizing to others) is incredibly important. I have been in a rather emotionally abusive relationship and grew up feeling like people did not care how they treated me. It is very important that if I tell somebody something they said or did made me feel bad - even if they didn't mean to or realize which I always try and acknowledge! - they apologize.\n\nI've explained to my SO it's not an admission of guilt or me wanting to \"win\" (I apologize a lot because I want people to feel comfortable around me and them to know I am taking into consideration how I have made them feel), but somebody telling me they care about me, don't want me to be hurting or to hurt me, and dislike the fact I *am* hurting.\n\nWe get into huge arguments over this. Usually I'm the reason a fight starts because I do have a hard time letting some things roll off my back (I am working on it and getting much more patient!) so I get initially a little upset. I push it a bit - SO hates being told or even asked what to do during an argument because they don't want to feel pressured to do something. So instead I try and emphasize how I feel and how I personally think what they did was rude or inconsiderate or whatever.\n\nThey generally don't get the hint and end up snapping at me because I keep talking about it. Then I'll be very upfront and say that's not a way to talk to me, it escalates... Etc. We had a big fight the other day because I have said, I really need you to apologize for things even if it was an accident.\n\nThey think this is crazy. I said, \"if somebody had leftovers in the fridge and made no attempt to tell you not to eat it, you ate it, and they were a bit upset, would you apologize?\" and they think not necessarily. This blows MY MIND. If somebody came to me and said hey you said X and didn't know it would upset me but it did, I WOULD APOLOGIZE!!\n\nAITA for thinking this is... how it should work? Is this ridiculous? I told them, it's not about apologizing foe everything you think I *might* misinterpret. It's that if I (calmly and/or kindly, not being a dick about it!) say you did something hurtful, I shouldn't have to pull an apology out of them!\n\nAnd yes I have explained how important apologies are to me, what they mean to me etc. They just say well they aren't that way for ME and says I should compromise and not need apologies but.. I just do!\n\nSo, AITA???? I'm autistic and have BPD (borderline) so maybe there *is* a chance this sounds equally crazy to other more-normal people. ",

Things were moving quick and I was already uncomfortable. Then things got crazy. She was texting me like 50 times in an hour begging me to respond. And also, I found out that she goes to special ed classes and she didn't tell me. And there were a couple signs that told me she was slow. But I still rode the crazy train. And then the straw that broke the camels back. I found at that she's been mutilating herself  (cutting her arms) and she's depressed and a bunch of stuff.

      "description": "Throwaway since the situation is specific enough friends would know its me so don't wanna link my usual account...and sorry for the length. This is a bit off my chest as well and I'm a bit of a wreck and not able to think all that well.\n\nMy friends and I have an annual holiday party in December, the date of course is never set in stone so that we can be flexible with work schedules.\n\nThis year, it so happens that the schedules require that we celebrate early. Very early actually - on the same day I had planned to celebrate my birthday (a Friday). \n\nTo celebrate my birthday, the day before is no go - it's a weekday and I had already planned to see Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse, which I had been really super looking forward to (I absolutely love superhero movies). The weekend before is no go - there will be friends out of town. The day after (Saturday) friends will be occupied with company holiday parties.\n\nAt first, that Sunday was okay - until they realized the Backstreet Boys concert was happening and in the excitement of buying tickets they forgot the party was going to be on that day.\n\nSo now we're back to that Friday being the only option. So they asked, would I be willing to share my birthday party with the holiday party?\n\nThing is, I really don't want to. This past year, has felt really, *really* super hard for me. I had all four wisdom teeth pulled - one even dry socket (it's incredibly painful for those who have not experienced that). \n\nThen my old car (paid off) broke down, so I had to get a new (used) one. This wasn't something I had planned to do this year considering it was a huge financial decision.\n\nThen I had an allergic reaction to poison ivy - this not only drained my health savings (already depleted because of the wisdom teeth) I actually have yet to pay off everything. It was super painful, got everywhere, especially on my hands where they swelled like crazy and itched. I gave up a camping trip I was really looking forward to, out of fear of *another* medical mallady, poison ivy or otherwise, resulting from it.\n\nThen, my phone (5 years old) was barely functioning (would  freeze or delay when writing texts or emails, openning apps...fun) and since I use it for work I got a new one - sounds great, but as I was already stressed over having to pay for a new (user) car *and* paying off my emergency room visit, it was another thing I just really did not want to be spending money on. But its needed for work, so new phone it was.\n\nThe relationship I was in with a guy wasn't working out, so we broke it off. It sucks, we had been working on the relationship since early this year and hopped to work through some rough edges but...it just wasn't working. So now I'm bummed out about that.\n\n*Then* I started to experience swelling and rash on my hands *again* but haven't been able to isolate the cause, nor can I afford to address it with a doctor, so I'm taking allegra and using benadryl to try to control it. I'm trying not to make a big deal out of it - no one likes a whiner - but this is really freaking me out.\n\nAnd then this morning, for the first time in nearly a decade, I cracked my phone. Pretty badly, and it's a *new* phone. I try to take good care of my things so for this to happen, especially to something new, royally sucks ass.\n\nIn addition to all this my dieting hasn't gone as well as I've liked this year so I feel like a rotten failure especially since I did so well last year, all the worries and aches have made my sleep terrible this year, and I'm pretty sure my far-sight is going bad but I have no money for an eye exam, let alone glasses and contacts. Work has been insanely busy, which further contributed to added stress. This year has been an unusual acumulation of terrible luck one thing after another and some days I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.\n\nSo, back to my birthday, I was really looking forward to it, to something *simple* and calm and not terribly exciting. After this awful and stressful year, I wanted my 30th birthday to be for me and something I have control over. All I wanted was some delivered pizza, cake, and play games with my  friends. \n\nCombining it with a larger party where half the people are ones I barely know, where we won't get to sit down and chill with games...I just didn't plan that, I don't *want* that, but if I insist that Friday be for *me* as originally planned...I fear it will cause resentment since that means we have to schedule a day where some people aren't going to be able to make it. I don't want to force people to miss out, but, this isn't just something I can throw away either.\n\nAnd none of the others had to share their 30th birthday. We've been putting effort into specifically marking everyone's 30th birthday, a little extra this or that - but then *I'm* the one that has to share. I don't think I'd be able to emotionally handle sharing my birthday given how much I was banking on it to be just my day, but if I yield and let that day be just the holiday party, I don't think I'd be able to attend knowing I had to give up my birthday party. And if my friends accept that...I don't know how I'd be able to handle that. We've been friends for nearly 15 years and they should know better, I think,, but maybe they expect me to grow up and share.\n\nI already told them no...but I feel like that answer wasn't liked and I'll be pressured later as the day approaches.\n\nMaybe I just need to grow up?",

      "description": "Alright. Here's another dilemma in the \"my parents are moving to my city to live in a stupid tinyhouse debacle\" ([see earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ayf4ec/aita_for_not_letting_my_mother_move_in_with_me/)) \n\nSo, since I won't let my mother move into the flat that I share with my boyfriend, my parents are coming to my city next week to look for a flat. Now, since I just finished my degree and have some spare time, they asked me and my bf (student on semester break) to come to their house for the 5 days (3hrs away in the middle of nowhere) to house- and catsit. When they asked me this, my stepdad said and I quote: \"Don't worry, we wouldn't expect to stay at your place.\" Because he knows that I don't like the thought of people being in my home whenn I'm not there. \n\nAlso, because my mother is so nitpicky and super clean, I just didn't feel like putting several days of work into making my flat presentable to her, only to have her complain like always. However, yesterday I got a message from my stepdad asking whether I might not reconsider letting them stay at my flat, so they wouldn't have to pay for a hotel. A day prior to this he told me that they sold their house and got over 10%  over the asking price. So\n\n1. They do have enough money to pay for a hotel. \n\n2. When they initially asked me to catsit for them, they included that they would not stay in my flat.\n\nHowever, when I told him yesterday that I would only do this now under pressure (because having my stepdad mad at me is really stressful to me) and that I really don't like the idea of people being in my home, he passive-aggressively replied: \n\n\"Well, I didn't know we were \"people\" to you. You are also staying in our house while we're not there. Don't see what the big deal is. But fine. Thanks, anyway.\"\n\nI feel so annoyed. I already took time out of this week to look at a flat for them, even though they told me like 2hrs before the appointment and agreed to help my stepdad all afternoon tomorrow on their property. They even asked me to come to their house earlier than agreed, although I told them that my bf had a day trip planned for me, since it is my birthday on Sunday. I just feel like they want favour after favour just because I happen to live in the same city that they're moving to.\n\nI mean, yeah I guess my flat is empty while we're house-sitting for them, but does that mean I have to give it to them? His super bitchy reply basically leaves me no choice anyway. But AITA here for telling him that I don't want them here? ",

Unfortunately he had a pretty shitty upbringing; he was really badly psychically abused (not by our mother). Ever since we were kids he was... odd. He never seemed really THERE emotionally. We were never really close. He lied. A LOT. Started drinking in his VERY early teens behind out moms back. Got into drugs. But, there was just something cold and numb about him. Maybe it was because he was 4+ years older than me, but I genuinely think he is a psychopath. I remember he stole some eggs from a chickadee nest and threw them against a barn door. They were days, maybe even hours from hatching by the looks of what came out of the eggs. \n\nYeah. Fucked up.\n\nHe has been a troublesome kid his whole life. Drinking, drugs, did terrible in school. Just all around rough kid. Our mom would fight with him constantly. Our mom tried so hard to get him to be an upstanding member of society-- just stop getting into shit he wasnt supposed to. It's not like he was being forced into a religion, or anything like that. Our mom just wanted him to stop being a fuck all and get his shit together. So he moves out to go live with his bio dad.\n\nFast forward a few years; He lies about going to college so our mom can send him money. He spends it on drugs. He attempts multiple times to manipulate her into sending more money. They fight and I am the one to pick up the pieces. It gets so bad my mom starts drinking herself to sleep. He gets a girl pregnant and beats the shit out of her and then abandons them. \n\nJust recently he reconnected with our mom after he supposedly got diagnosed with cancer. Our mom loves him. I am so afraid she will get hurt again and start up her old habits. (I convinced her to get clean about 3 years ago.) She begged me to talk to him. I didnt want to. I dont think he has cancer. He said he accidentally threw out the doctor's papers. I really think he is trying to extort more money. If he is actually sick I would feel fucking terrible, but with his track record? I just dont know. Even if he did have cancer... I really still dont want to talk to him. \n\nTL;DR - My psychopathic, super manipulative brother says he has cancer. I really dont want to talk to him, even if he is telling the truth. \n\nSo, AITA if I dont want to talk to my brother who possibly has cancer? ",

Second bathroom is in parents room and rarely used), slow internet connection, and even complaining that they need to get rid of certain food because husband is on a diet. \n\nThe icing on all of this boils down to a few things though. 1.) demanding my younger brother move out of his room because they need the bigger room. Even though my old room is completely empty since I’ve moved out. \n2.) they’re already pulling “we pay rent therefore we can do whatever we want.” Which has pissed my parents off considering they’re doing them a huge favor for letting them move in (rent is 100$ btw) 3.) making snide comments about “if you don’t turn into your dad, I promise I won’t act like *that*” in terms of how my parents act. \n\nI’ve mentioned it to them that they’re being dickish about all of this, but they’re under the impression that it’s what parents are suppose to do for their kids, so it doesn’t matter. \nNow I get my family can be annoying sometimes, we’re not perfect at all, but AITA for thinking they should be a bit more respectful? Or at least grateful they have a place to stay?\n\nOr is it because now they’re living there, they do have a say in things?",

      "description": "So, I'm going to give a bit of background about this before we jump right in (sorry about the format I'm on mobile while typing also feel free to tell me if I am being a crybaby or if this post doesn't belong here lol).\n\nMe and my friend group met somewhere in the beginning of the year, we all got along decently despite most of us being from different schools and only knowing each other because of similar classes, some of them even had classes with me but I didn't know they existed until around the 2nd month of the school year. And one of the girls in our friend group I have one of my classes with to this day, this is where our story begins.\n\nSo in the morning we usually sit together before homeroom (because people who are on the first two floors are allowed to sit in the cafeteria in the morning before we are sent to our homerooms). And every morning, every day, for 2-3 months now, this girl in our group who has a class with me keeps using the same repetitive joke about me being a basic white girl, EVERY. 15. SECONDS. She literally finds something about me that sounds kinda \"basic white girl-ish\" and calls me a basic white girl and laughs in my face after that and it makes me feel like I'm being walked all over (also by the way I am in a mostly Hispanic school and I am apart of the minorities, like asians, whites, etc.). Am I a basic white girl? You may ask? Well, kinda, I wear band shirts, I like shopping at hot topic, and I like the 90s and 70s aesthetic (very much), at first the joke was very funny and I actually liked it because everyone was laughing. But it slowly lost it's taste and started being more and more annoying by the day. I get so mad when even thinking about this girl. But you may ask, how many times does she do this in a day, and who does she do it in front of? She does it everytime she sees me, and in front of every one in about a 20 mile radius. And I have slowly gotten to hate her, I have told her to stop but she never really does. Nowadays I just laugh it off, but I do say some awful things behind her back. Sometimes I feel a bit guilty for it (because she's really the only one willing to talk to me in the class besides this other girl) but I feel so much anger towards her that I sometimes feel like screaming. I have actually planned on one day facing her head on and telling her to move to another table and not to talk to me until she stops. She has even done it to another girl in our group for wearing \"ugg\" esque boots and she wasn't even white. But the only problem with standing up to her is that she would be mad at me and will probably tell all the kids in our class and worsen the situation. The problem got so bad that I even take off on sub zero weather days because if she catches me in my fluffy boots (because over here in the midwest we are having the crappiest part of winter) I won't hear the end of it from her. AITA for wanting to alienate her from the group because my mental health and attendance depend on it?",

I've talked to her about it countless times but she still refuses to listen, calls me an asshole whenever i express concerns.

She would 100% go on a rampage if i did anything equivalent (E.G. show off abs/wear sweatpants, i never do, i just use them as an example when i tell her to see things through my eyes and how she would like it if i did the exact same thing, and she immediately gets very upset).

      "description": "So I just moved to a new city for my 3rd and 4th years of college and I've been trying to meet some new friends. I never really had many but now I REALLY didn't have any besides my girlfriend of 3 years that came along with me to go to the same college. It's been about 2 months now and I finally met a new friend. She approached me and we started talking as normal people do when they first meet. After a few days of still talking I let my girlfriend know that I was talking to this person (in a friendly way) and she kinda flipped about it, saying how I need to only have guy friends or something like that. I told her that I'm with her and I have no plans on leaving for another woman, even if they were interested in me. I even made it clear to the new friend that I am in a relationship with me, asking her if her intentions were to find a partner (They were, but that's cleared out of the way now, obviously). Her and I are hanging out tomorrow to do laser tag with one of her friends that just flew in and I told my girlfriend and she did not like it. I basically told her that if I wanted to be with someone else I would just leave her rather than cheat and that she should stop being so paranoid. Am I missing something or is there a set-in-stone \"hidden\" rule to follow to where this type of relationship can't happen?",

      "description": "I became good friends with this girl while me and my boyfriend were long distance, it took me a while, but after a couple of months I realized I found her attractive. My boyfriend was back in Canada, and I had no intentions of pursuing anything with her, but she was the first girl I'd ever been attracted to and it made me question some things about myself. \n\nI wanted to talk to someone about it, but my boyfriend doesn't have the best self esteem, and he's always saying he's worried I'll find someone \"better\", so I wasn't sure if I should tell him about it. Instead I talked to a close friend of mine who is bisexual. \n\nAbout a week after I talked to my friend, I decided to tell my boyfriend about it, and I mentioned I had talked to someone else about it, and that I wasn't sure if I should tell him. When we were talking on the phone he acted fine, but about an hour after we hung up he messaged and said that it made him uncomfortable that I found someone else attractive because he never even thought of anyone else, and said that he thought I should have told him before anyone else, and not thought about hiding it from him. When I told him I was worried it would upset him, he said that that wasn't a good reason to keep things from him, and I shouldn't assume how he's going to react. \n\nAITA for being attracted to someone else and thinking about keeping it from him because I assumed he'd react badly? Should I have told him right away? Or at least before I talked about it with someone else? \n",

      "description": "sorry if this story is long and a little confusing. i’ll answer any questions. :) also sorry for long title lmao\n\nfirst, let’s start with information on my personality. i’m a girl, but i only hang out with guys. it’s not that i like them or i’m a whore or anything, they think of me as an equal. they understand my sense of humor, and none of the other girls do.\n\nbut, this doesn’t mean i hate girls. i’m friends with everyone and all the girls in my class are completely comfortable with being around me.\nand then there’s my friend, or technically, my ex-friend. she’s the delusional type and falls in love with any dude who makes eye contact with her, even though she’s ugly as fuck (idk if i can say that but it’s sadly the truth). she already told me that she had a crush on this dude A before, but like i said, i was good friends with him BEFORE she started liking him. \n\nanother important thing are these.. “gals”. i go to school to japan, and there are a shit ton of rules at school, and the length of your skirt is one of them. what the japanese call “gals” are just a group of girls who are scary and have their skirts above their knees. yeah, i get that in america, nobody cares, but this is japan where things are different.\n\ni have gotten into shit with these “gals” because i’m good friends with one of their boyfriends. it wasn’t even shit, we never talked. they just hated me and would come to our class and laugh at me. my friend would always talk shit about them to me. \n\none day, my friend messages me into our CLASS GROUP CHAT.\nher: hey OP, you okay? \nme: yeah? why?\nher: dude those girls said that they are so pissed at you.\nme: haha maybe i’ll just not come to school from now on.\nher: don’t do that~\n\ni was scared. i faked a stomach ache and didn’t go to school that day. i didn’t want to get beat up for doing nothing bad. what can i say, i’m a pussy. \n\ncouple months pass. i’m quite popular in my class, everyone loves me (or at least that’s what i thought). then this other group of girls (i know there are a lot of girls in this story. sorry) in my class tell me that my friend was talking shit about me to these “gals”. at the time, i didn’t know how to react.\n\nhere’s some of the shit she was saying:\n• i’m a whore.\n• i hug guys. \n• i have a crush on dude A\n• i talked shit about the “gals”\n•i said “i love you” to a guy\n\nsome of this is true. but the one thing that pissed me off is that she sent that conversation we had earlier (about girls getting pissed at me) and SENT IT TO THEM as if ANY OF IT had ANYTHING to do with me hating them.\n\ni got my friend dude B (who my friend coincidentally also had a crush on) to trick her into thinking that he hated me too, so that she would tell him information or whatever. SHE WAS JEALOUS. THAT’S IT. \n\ni got so pissed off. SHE was calling ME a whore only because her crush dude A liked ME WAY BETTER??? she was the slut that kept changing her crush even though she looked like a pile of trash and thinks she has the right to talk about ME like that???? i was pissed.\n\nthis is why i don’t like hanging out with girls. because they’ll use you to death and hate you when you do something a little better than them. \n\nanyways, one of my trusted teachers is on my volleyball team, so during morning practice i went to tell her and it turns out, these girls are telling that same teacher that i was talking shit about them, WHICH I NEVER DID, BTW. i was so mad. this was honestly one of the worst experiences i’ve had. \n\nand my home room teacher talks to me about it, and this was during class, so everyone of my friends were there. i was like sure, and started talking. i told my teacher that my friend was a lying whore and fucking stupid for thinking that she could get away for lying (my actual friend wasn’t there listening. she was doing something else idk).\n\nand then that day i cried because i didn’t want the world to hate me for some bitch’s lies. everyone comforted me, and i was happy. i made eye contact with the bitch i called a friend and laughed in her ugly ass face. \n\nshe then apologizes to me. i say it’s okay, i forgive her. but then in the end she asks me “is it okay if i still talk shit about you?” WTF. i was like,,,,, “what???” i was so confused, like that doesn’t even make sense. WTF ARE YOU APOLOGIZING FOR??? i wanted to yell at her but i kept quiet and went to tell all my friends. \n\nthen, in the middle of the night, i’m invited to a group chat with like,,, these people from my class who could be considered the popular kids, i guess. and note, this group chat includes the dude A. this was like a ranting group and we were talking for hours. i talked about everything, how my friend likes dude A and was jealous. \n\nthen dude A says “i can love a girl who does things like that.” i was like YES!! WE FUCKING GOTTEM!! i was so happy. karma really is a bitch. \n\nit’s actually been a couple months since that and now EVERYONE, and literally EVERYONE, eve those “gals” i was talking about hate her. she’s now known as an ugly ass slut gorilla.\n\nand guess what? she’s making it my fault. she’s saying that it’s my fault and she didn’t deserve this. \n\nso, reddit, please tell me. should i apologize to her? should i tell the school that this girl isn’t really as bad as i said she is? or does my friend deserve to be hated?\n",

      "description": "A little history first: my younger brother had a stroke when he was younger and now his legs are weaker than they should be. Because of this he has to wear leg braces for support and goes to school in a wheelchair in case his legs get to tired during the day. He is embarrassed of the leg braces and usually wears long pants to cover them. He’d rather go out without a wheelchair when we do errands or go out and only really uses it for school or times we know he will walk a long distance.\n\nWe had this new family move beside us 3 weeks ago and other then saying hi when we see them on their driveway as we enter our house we don’t interact.\n\nBut it just so happens that the timing of when my younger brother’s bus that picks him up in front of our house and brings him to school is the same time our neighbor leaves for work in the morning.  The driveways on our street aren’t the biggest and with the bus arm that is meant to stop cars from driving past the bus my neighbor’s driveway gets blocked. It’s been 3 weeks and it started with them smiling at us saying “oh don’t worry” to him being visibly upset about it, but there’s nothing the bus driver can do because there needs to be enough room to load my brother and his wheelchair onto the bus.\n\nThis morning maybe he was having a bad start to his day because as he was waiting for the bus to load my brother and leave (which takes 10 minutes at max) he starts laying into his horn and then steps out of his car and then the interaction begins:\n\nNeighbor: Jesus Christ every morning you block my fucking driveway and I’m late for work!\n\nMe: Sorry but there’s nothing we can do the bus only has so much room to get my brother and his wheelchair. Maybe leave earlier if this makes you late for work everyday\n\nNeighbor: I don’t have to change my schedule for you, how bout the bus come earlier and doesn’t block me in, it’s my fucking property. Also the kid doesn’t even need the fucking bus I’ve seen him walk perfectly fine. The schools 20 minutes away my kids walk to school he should too.\n\nNow here’s where I get pissed because he’s screaming this at a level where my brother can hear as he is getting his wheelchair secured in the bus.\n\nMe: You’re a fucking piece of shit dude! First of all you have no idea what my brother needs and doesn’t need. Secondly it’s the fucking law for you to yield for a school bus so you can either leave earlier so you’re not late for work or fucking wait for the bus to leave and go to work.\n\nHe then starts yelling at me saying that I shouldn’t ever talk to him that way and I should respect my elders but my brother’s bus had already left so I tell him to fuck off and go inside my house. My mom heard the yelling outside and told me though I’m not wrong, I was kind of an asshole with the way I said it and now our new neighbor probably hates us. \n\nWhile I guess I could have taken a better way to saying it, the dude escalated it first but I was wondering AITA?\n",

      "description": "So, me and my girlfriend have a long distance relationship, and we've been dating for about a year and a half. I've been seriously considering purchasing a dog lately, and i've sent her several that I like. The dog i'm supposed to visit next week is a purebred black Lab. She was fine with all of the others i've shown her, but she doesn't like this one because it's a Lab, yet the first dog I told her I came incredibly close to buying was a black Labradoodle. The only reason I didn't was because the seller already had someone coming to visit, and they ended up buying it. She seemed dissapointed and wished it was otherwise.\n\nI continued searching for my new companion, and found a Samoyed. She adored it, but it was very expensive and they apparently shed a lot so it was eventually ruled out.\n\nNow here I am, looking at an adorable female black Lab, at a good price, AND it's born right here in my town. It almost seems meant to be, except for...Well, my girlfriend.\n\nIt's just incredibly odd to me that she dislikes them so much. Her sister has two lab mixes, one of which isn't very well behaved and she essentially cites him as her reasoning. As far as I know they don't get much excercise, and I seem to remember her sister mentioning the mischievious one was possibly abused. Both very valid reasons for why the dog acts the way it does. It's also odd that she fairly commonly volunteers to watch the dogs (or at least one of them)/take them for walks. She has shown no signs of really disliking this breed in the past, or maybe it's just because I haven't asked. She mentioned \"not ever wanting to live with one\" and \"their short hair is hard to get out of furniture.\", consistently says \"idk, whatever\" \"it doesn't matter it's not my dog.\"\n\nThere's more, but i've already said so much. I'm caught off guard by this as I expected her to be absolutely ecstatic about this whole situation and I don't want to make a mistake here. Sorry for the wall of text.\n\n\n",

      "description": "TLDR at bottom\n\nI'll try to keep this short but the share house I'm renting in housed four tenants on the lease myself, 'john', 'Harry' and 'Liz'. Two of us (myself and john) are moving out and organising replacements respectively.\n\nJohn is intending to move interstate in 3 weeks with his girlfriend 'Hannah', who has been living in his room rent and utility free for coming up on 3 months now. \n\nJohn arranged a girl to take his place who we'll call Claire. Claire had been living with her partner and his family which hasn't worked out hence the move. According to Claire it was a verbally abusive environment which she was charged 300 a week to live in.\n\n John tells myself and Liz that he has offered Claire to stay with us until her move date due to being forced out of her partners home (this was the night before she arrives) zero notice.\n\nLiz professes her annoyance at the situation to me and heads to work the next day before Claire arrives. Claire arrives the next day and John says to her that she is welcome to stay \"rent free\" until her official move date 3 weeks from now.\n\nI quickly shut down that idea to which Claire claims she is happy to contribute. I propose two options via our FB chat that Claire and Hannah can either a) contribute $300 each (less than 2/3 of the median rent) to be split amongst the four housemates OR b) simply be in charge of general cleaning during this time.\n\nJohn immediately claims this is unfair, that neither have a room to themselves and therefore should not pay rent. Instead that only utilities should be split 6 ways.\n\nI argued that rent covers not just the entirety of the house but our living conditions and that we deserve to be compensated for having a 50% population increase. Rather than a bare minimum contribution toward bills. \n\nHannah argues to have never infringed upon our space in her three free months because she spends most of the time in John's room or working everyday (despite also claiming to be unable to afford rent) however hygiene and cleanliness issues beg to differ (i.e. cleaning up after them)\n\nJohn claims it would be rude to turn away Claire due to moral reasons, that she has nowhere to go. Which after hanging out with her for one evening I know isn't true.\n\nI don't believe $75 per housemate compensation for three weeks in one case and three months in another is unreasonable. I also initially offered for them to just keep the place clean for board but have now been accused of trying to make a quick buck. Liz doesn't like confrontation so refuses to express an opinion openly and Harry claims not to care but is currently house sitting his parents house.\n\nI'm about to move and certainly wouldn't expect my new housemates to put me up free of charge for 3 weeks. \n\nAm I being unreasonable? I'm only living here until the end of the month and usually pretty relaxed about this stuff but I don't appreciate feeling taken advantage of. \n\nShould I just grit my teeth and wait it out?\n\nTLDR; outgoing housemate moved in his replacement three weeks early and doesn't want her or his girlfriend to pay rent whilst living with us.\n",

      "description": "This is my first reddit post, so I apologize if it's written poorly. There's a tl;dr at the bottom, also I'm sorry that this isn't too scandalous, just some teen drama.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some background, I went to a small junior and senior high school, one of the boys, or B for short, entered in the school at the same time as I did, in 6th grade, and we had the same birthday which was our connection. It was very obvious that he had romantic interests in me, even for my socially awkward self I could tell, from 6th grade. Cut to 10th grade, B asked me to prom and I said yes, because I am really bad at saying no, and he takes that immediately that means we're dating and goes around telling everyone that I'm his girlfriend which I didn't like but kept to myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended up leaving that school at the end of 10th grade and was started attending a small alternative education place. My contact with him quickly diminished to nothing  and at some point, he stopped sending them. A while into my schooling at the alternative education place, I was doing my work facing the window out into the parking lot, when a car pulled up to drop someone off and a person stepped out to let the guy who was being dropped off and I recognized that one that didn't go to the school as B. We locked eyes and he looked happy to see me, then he left. I ended up texting him a few hours later because I felt like it was polite and the right thing to do to see how he's been doing and big mistake, he's immediately texting me how much he loves and misses me. I ignore them and two or three nights later at 12am-2:30am, he starts calling and texting me over and over (I was awake but wasn't answering or looking at his texts to give the illusion I was) once more saying how much he loves and misses me and that I had to call him in the morning. I didn't, and another few days later I showed the texts and missed calls to my older brother (who is the only person I go to advice for because I don't exactly have the best adults in my life but that's a whole other story), who upon seeing them, blocks B and tells me to keep him blocked. I feel bad, obviously, because I don't feel like what he did deserved that, but I also didn't want to explain to B why I blocked then unblocked him. A good week and a half after that, one of B's friends (who btw, I do not like, she wasn't the nicest around to say the least) texted me and said that B wants to talk but my brother said to just ignore that as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for failing to properly communicate with B and tell him that I wasn't interested and I am going about this the wrong way? (sorry about the word wall also)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: Boy who had a unrequited crush on me is clingy and I had to block him for calling and texting him in the middle of the night, AITA?",

      "description": "I'm an 18 year old guy still in high school, just started working at a deli up the block from my house part-time a little over two years ago. My family is poorish/lower middle class so it was nice to have spending money, being finally able to buy and save for things like a car, game consoles, PC, etc. Anyway, around February of last year, I come home to find my Dad in my room, cutting the wall between it and my parents room. When I ask what was going on, he explained that he was redoing the house and was turning my room into a closet and small bedroom for my parents room. He explained that he was going to start turning half of the basement downstairs into a new room for me, which would be bigger and afford me more privacy since I'm going to college and not dorming. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but he completely disregarded and disrespected my belongings. He laid all his tools down on top of my game consoles that I saved and bought with my own money, and are now scuffed with paint marks and scratches. My posters were thrown out, and my other belongings were covered in saw dust. When I get mad at him over this, his snaps and goes \"They still work, that's all that matters!\"  For the record, my Dad is a very outdoorsy guy, and a self employed carpenter. He doesn't really own many possessions; he has a stereo in the garage that he'll listen to when working on his truck, but he doesn't really take care of it (\"As long as it works!\").   \n\n\nI got over it because I assumed I would be getting a newer room out of this, but it's been over a year and he hasn't started work on it at all. I'm being forced to sleep on the living room couch and keep my clothing  in a laundry bag.  The other day I get home from a friend's house, of whom happens to be much wealthier than I am. His room is filled with collectibles, PC hardware, games, a TV, etc. I was super jealous, and I get fed up and ask my Dad when he's going to start actually doing work on my room. He gets annoyed and states \"When we have the money, I promise you that we'll start working on your room!\" , to which I respond that it's been over a year and literally NOTHING has been done. He then snaps and says that I'm being entitled, and how he moved out at 15, lived with friends until he was 18, lived in a van until he met my mom at 20.  \n\n\nI'm mad primarily because: a) He didn't tell me he was doing this to the house and completely trashed my belongings    b) Doesn't have the money to actually finish the renovations.   \n\n\nAm I being the asshole for being agitated over this?",

She also taps her foot and sings sometimes. Now, if she was anyone else, I would ask her nicely to turn it down. This woman is not approachable at all. She is unfriendly, defensive, and rude. She had a fit when someone called her out for slamming her mouse in anger. She still does that... about 3 times per day. I have three options:\n\n1. Deal with it. (Its very distracting. It would just continue to bother me until I eventually cracked during a rough day and said something I would regret.)\n\n2. Go to her superior and calmly explain how distracting it is. (He would probably slip up and say it was me. And I dont want a rat reputation.)\n\n3. Call the anonymous HR hotline. (She would get a slap on the wrist, hopefully stop due to the 'official' HR complaint, and no one would know it was me.)\n\nI'm leaning towards options 1 or 3. But WIBTAH if I called the hotline? I know it bothers others in the vicinity, but not enough for them to call since they all use headphones. She wouldn't get written up for something like that, just a talking to.",

      "description": "Just a warning that there’s a lot of swearing because I’m absolutely livid rn.\n\nSo I’m 17 and I have a younger sister who is 15. So we have always had a terrible relationship. We could never get along but I blame my sister for it because she shuts down when something doesn’t go her way. I’ve given her money countless times cause she spent all of hers on weed and juul pods. She usually takes 6 months to pay me back and I always have to do something for her to give it to me. Rn she owes me 20$ and It’s been 3 months. She thinks she is entitled to everything and I’m so close to snapping I think I’m going to hurt her. She had become an entitled brat since she was 5 and my parents are still saying it’s “just a phase”. I asked her about the money she owes me today and she says in order for her to pay me back, I have to go out and get her a gram of weed. I lose my shit and just start cussing her out cause I’m done with her bullshit. She doesn’t have any more weed and is now almost crying because she can’t smoke and she’s begging me for some. I always fell for her stupid fucking guilt trip but this time I told her no. She said okay then I’m not paying u back and I sent her a text later saying “I’m done with ur shit and I’m not gonna listen to you anymore. You think your entitled to everything well your not. Don’t try to talk to me cause I’m just gonna tell you to shut up. I’m not giving you anymore rides, no more favors, nothing. Just fuck off and don’t talk to me.” She responded with “fine u won’t get any favors either” I asked her what she’s has done for me in the last 5 years and she came up with walking the dog for me like 5 months ago and that’s it. Ik she gonna come back begging for something but I’m just gonna tell her to fuck off. I’m still living with her because I have no where to go until I leave for college. But I plan to ignore her and when I leave just block her on everything. So am I the asshole for doing it at such a young age.",

      "description": "Hi, \nSo to be the most accurate I will need to go around 2 years ago, that friend I have, let's call her J, I know her from my parents who are friends with hers, so we had been friends for around 15 years, altough she is 5 years older than I am. \nSo we go way back. \n\nAround 2 years ago for my mom's 50th Birthday party, I had already planned we would spend most of our time together as I don't really enjoy this kind of events, which happened, problem was, we started feeling arousal for each other, while being BOTH in a couple, as far as I am concerned I consider I have cheated on my former GF at that time, even tho we did nothing, I ended up being depressed after this, I still am, altough it's slightly better nowadays.  \nMy relationship went on for around 2 years after this and ended, shortly after, her own relationship with her new BF started to crumble. (this was a few months ago)\nI have that one male friend that really didn't feel well at the time, and I observed they had similar problems, I didn't feel I could understand their issues, so I made them meet, what I didn't know at that time, was that J got dumped the previous day, so it worked in the way I intended, they both had found somebody they could talk to, after learning this, I considered the eventuality they could be a couple, to which I was a bit annoyed by, but not against, as they both needed precisely somebody who could understand them, I assumed this would be good for 2 of my friends. \nNow 2 days after all this, since she had been dumped, I offered to spend time with her, we would just wander around the city, I had my own issues at the time with another girl, so we both felt miserable, and misery loves company. \n\nNow, the thing is, this was the first time we both were single and at the same place since that day,\nDuring that day she said something like \"I will never find another guy that was as compassionate, as smart, as beautiful..etc\"\nNow I don't like this kind of delusional speech in general, but here it felt almost like a personal insult on my part. (I know I'm a bit too proud, so eh, that's on me there)\nLater on she showed me her phone, she had my friend's profile pic as a background pic, (do note she had been dumped 3 days ago, and she had known him for only 3 days). \nI remember saying \"You know he has trouble getting attached\"\nShe said \"But do you think he could get attached to me\"\n\nUp to a point I started looking pissed, she asked what's wrong, \n\"You do realize if you did something with him, that would annoy me?\"\nThen she basically cut herself, didn't say nor looked anywhere,\n5 mins later she said \n\"You're getting jealous\"\n\"I mean you do realize this is the first time we're single and we never even talked about what happened, and then you throw all this at me? Do you even consider my feelings?\"\n\"Yeah but to me this was just a mistake\"\n\"Nice, now you could have told me about it, before you try to compensate with a friend of mine\"\nLater on we argued a lot, she said I was being hard on her, which I will deny to be fair, at that point I just think she just didn't stand me seeing of careless she was. \n\n2 days later she called me to tell me how I was unfair to her and I treated her like an ex-gf, I replied \"You have no idea how I treat my exes obviously, otherwise I wouldn't have answered\"\nWe argued again, she told me she thought how we had a relation on equal terms, to which I didn't agree with because she always dominated everything we talked about, I would let it slip, but usually I wouldn't for others. \nI finally revealed to her all this mess gave me depression, which I hid from her because I didn't want to hurt her, as she had had depression herself before, she answered \"I'm glad it came from someone like me who knows how it feels\" that was it.\nNothing for a few days, then she texted me, \"You and I we're gonna have a dinner\"\nI was like \"sure why not\" of course I hoped a bit she would consider me as an actual option, then again, even if not, we had been friends for so long, she had earned a chance to redeam herself.\"\n\nWe had that dinner, she talked, we had some great souvenirs together so the conversation was kinda ok, she mentionned how she was trying to find new context for both of us so we could go on as friends, we then talked about my friend, on the way back, I started crying because I was overwhelmed by all the emotions going through my mind, I remember her saying \"Anyway you cannot stop us from being together (it was a bit more ambiguous in my native language, could also mean pleasure each other), because we're fine together, and what will happen will happen\"\nI agreed to it, I was like ok, then if you're really fine together I have nothing more to say, I'm even happy for them, I was crying sure, but i wasn't just sad, it was just sooo many emotions at the same time. \n\nThen I met my friend a few minutes later, told him to go, and that they had been stupid to try to act on my agreement, I never had a damn thing to say. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, she came to my friend's while he was with some friends, then they fucked. \nThen my friend told me he didn't want to see her, he said he was angry at her because of how she treated me, he asked me if I wanted him to destroy her, I said, \"We're almost in 2019, we've had enough blood shed this year\"\nAfter that they never met again, he ghosted her, told about how she couldn't count how many partners she had had, how she couldn't see herself how she was being a whore, that he understood how I became depressed, (he has had depression aswell, possibly is currently, but it is undiagnosed). \nThen she tried to talk to me, I was fed up, I couldn't take it anymore, basically asked her \"Why can't you even say you want to see me\" \n\"I thought it was clear from the very moment I talked to you today\"\nI didn't answer, I don't anymore. At that point I started reflecting on all this, how I felt manipulated so she could get my approval and feel in her right. \nHow she had always been using me as an ego-boost. \nI remember thinking \"If you didn't treat like a third-rate sexless hookup, maybe you wouldn't feel like I'm treating you like my ex\"\n\nSo now, Yesterday, her parents met with mine at my house to have dinner, my sister was there, I was away, but I could meet them before I had to go, (I had been ghosting her since a few months now). \nThey couldn't look me in the eye, the father said \"I'm fine and you\" his voice took a higher pitch and he tapped on my shoulders. \n\nI texted my sister over the day, she said they didn't get it, they thought I was jealous because she was just talking to my friend, which is a bit true, but apparently they had no idea they did more than that, so in the end she looked like the victim of poor depressed OP's mood. \nToday, my friend sends me a pic of how she tried to text him, saying he was a beautiful person, and she was sad she couldn't do anything about it. \n\nAITA, frankly i don't know, I'm tired of all this, I just want peace, and I can't reach it if I don't know if what I did was legit. \nI'm sorry because this is a lot, I feel like I miss a lot of informations, and the same time I try to put as much as I can, \nI'll be glad to answer any questions. \n\n\n Thanks in advance \n",

They were both very nice and offered emotional support which was much appreciated. Later during the day, one of the two, who is a very religious Jewish man, texted me the following:\n\nHim: \"hey, can you tell me {my famaly member's} full name so i can pray for him?\"\n\nMe: \"please don't :)\"\n\nMe: \"but i appreciate the sentiment\"\n\nHim \"you're welcome\"\n\nTo give context, I'm an atheist, and i am very much against these kinds of things (and so is the mentioned family member tbh) . He knows it about me, and we are very respectful to each other's beliefs or lack thereof. We didn't talk about it anymore but had some small talk after it and it doesn't seem to have bothered him, but i can't really know for sure.\n\nWas i the asshole?

      "description": "Last night I went to bed at 10:30pm and was woken up by loud voices and laughing at midnight. I live in an old apartment building which does not have soundproof walls. My neighbor had two young men over (students) who did not need to wake up early. They continued to talk loudly and laugh until almost 3am. I have a Marpac Dome noise machine and I could still clearly hear EVERYTHING they were saying. I knew there names, their plans tomorrow, what habits their mom’s have. I work normal hours and wake up at 7am. I knocked once on the wall and my husband says he, “doesn’t want to start a fight with them.” I explained that they probably don’t realize how loud they’re being. I’m guilty of occasionally laughing too loudly late on the weekend. If someone knocked on the wall, it would remind me to shut up and be considerate. I have no problems with people being loud between 8am-11pm. Am I the asshole if I knock on the wall to try to get my neighbors to keep it down? Is it better to knock on their door? Should we really just suffer in silence as my husband suggests?",

      "description": "Excuse the formatting, I’m on mobile and have no idea how this looks. \n\nSo this sounds weird and oddly clingy, so here’s the background. My best friend lives in America, and I live in Canada. I’ve known her for 9 years and never met her, only face time and text and every other social media we could use. She’s been through a lot with me and I would do anything for her. \n\nRecently 3 of my friends (who didn’t know each other) were all talking about Kpop to me, and since I have no interest in listening to it I put the 3 of them in a group chat with me in it. America is one of those friends. It’s only been 4 months. In the time frame, my best friend convinced me to fly to America in May for her graduation for 2 weeks, and then she’s coming up here in July for a month. I’m really excited and I’ve already started planning for her visit and what I want to show her in my city. (This includes leaving the city to explore my Province a little, and I reserved one day for the Kpop group and myself to spend together.) She’ll be moving to South Korea for an internship after so this is the last time I’ll see her for a while, and because of time zones most likely talk to her too. \n\nThis is where everything gets hard. The Kpop group chat heard about this after me and they got really excited too. So excited that they’re inviting themselves to a lot of the things I planned for us to do. That threw me off. I’ve been waiting 9 years for this moments, and people who have known her for 4 months are acting like they’ve known her as long as I have. So far, they’ve discussed 4 separate outings without me to do things they know I don’t enjoy (All of them either related to Kpop, Restaurants I cant eat at, or restaurants I simply don’t like and can’t fathom spending that much money on.) The 2 friends have been talking about it so much that when they mention it in front of me, they don’t bother inviting me. \n\nNow I’ll also be the only one who drives, and my American friend will be staying at my house and will not have a bus pass, so I don’t know how these girls expect her to get around because I refuse to let her spend her money on travel. I think they’re expecting me to be like a mom dropping her child off at daycare. \n\nI talked to my best friend about it, and she told me not to worry because who knows if the 3 of them would get along in person anyways, and that everything would be fine. Although I can guarantee they’ll all get along. Most of my friends have the same personality type. Nonetheless, her words reassured me for a while until I learned these girls planned a whole WEEK of things without me. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m glad my friends are making friends, but at the same time I really want to spend all the time I can with my best friend. She means everything to me and I want to make good use of our time. \n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to keep my best friend to myself, and being annoyed that my friends are purposely making plans without me?

      "description": "We're in a semi long distance relationship where he goes to a college about 2hrs away by train. I commute to my college so I'm in our hometown. I thought he was coming back this weekend so that he could grab his computer which is getting fixed. We made plans to go ice skating and maybe see a movie and since I have work on Sunday, he was probably gonna go hang out with a friend. He called the shop today (Saturday) morning and it turns out his laptop won't be fixed until next week so he told me he wasn't going to come home. I got upset since I was excited to see him and thought he'd come back regardless of the laptop. He said he was also excited to see me but he's sorry we can't now (even though we can, he just doesn't want to get on a train?) He says there's no point since we already saw eachother last weekend and next week is spring break, and that he doesn't feel like taking the train ride. I guess I see his point that we would only have had maybe 20 hours together before I had work but I'm still mad since it feels like he's saying I'm not worth the commute. I visit him at school about once or twice a month and it's a 1.5 hour drive for me but I don't mind because I want to see him.\n\nHe says I'm being selfish by wanting to hang out with him and therefore inconveniencing him with the train ride. He says he wants to spend the weekend at his dorm chilling and playing video games when he already plays video games for hours on the weekdays. He insists he told me that he wasn't going to come home unless his laptop was fixed but I don't remember him saying that so I kind of assumed he was going to come back either way. Even if he had said that I still think that coming to see me shouldn't be this big of an issue for him? We're at an impasse at who's in the wrong. I need some outside perspective, AITA for being angry here? ",

      "description": "A little bit of background, I'm black she's white. Her grandfather was a flaming racist and regular threw the N word around. He was also a dirty cop in the late 60's and 70's and had plenty of stories about how he beat up \"those colored boys\".  However, he was really a really good grandfather to his grandchildren. Because he was racist, she pretty much had to keep me a secret from everyone outside of her immediate family for our entire relationship to make sure he never found out. I didn't really care about that because I understood where she was coming from, but I wasn't really a fan of it either. He lived in the next city over and whenever he was in town, I wasn't allowed to come over. She also knew I wasnt a fan of him and had no intention of ever meeting him. \n\nHe died of lung cancer recently, he was a heavy smoker, and she was obviously pretty sad. When she told me, I wasn't thrilled or anything, but I wasn't even the tiniest but sad. She asked if I wanted to come to the funeral and I  said \"honestly, ill go if you need the support, but I probably wouldn't ask to come otherwise\" she then asked what I meant and I basically told her that she knew I wasn't a fan of the guy or how he lived his life and she knew that. She got pretty upset, said I was being a jerk and that I was judging a man I never even met. I told her that he was an open racist and wouldn't have even wanted me there. She said that his past was irrelevant and that I should have respect for the dead. She was getting more and more upset so I just told her I'd think about it to make her feel better. \n\nI AM sad that she's sad, but I'm NOT sad that he's gone. I obviously never told her this but I can't force myself to care about this guy. I really don't want to go to this unrepentantly racist guy's funeral and act like I care. Additionally, because I was kept a secret for so long, I literally met none of her extended family so I would know nobody there. So am I the asshole here?\n",

      "description": "I (22F) am currently in the midst of a *disagreement* with my boyfriend John (26M). The disagreement is mostly about my close friendship with a guy named Cody (23M). \n\nCody has expressed attraction to me before, and I am also fairly attracted to him (he’s an attractive guy). I’ve never had any sort of sexual encounter with him, mainly because even when I was single I wasn’t a huge fan of the way that he tends to sleep around casually a lot, and because I think that sex can complicate friendships and I don’t want that. Cody and I are very close friends and are open with each other, and since I initially told him I wasn’t interested in sleeping with him he has never tried to initiate anything. He completely respects the fact that I said no and the fact that I’m in a relationship. We have a really strong friendship and I can’t imagine cutting him out of my life, but neither of us have any sort of romantic interest in each other and we treat sex extremely differently and understand that about each other.\n\nLast week, John asked me if I was attracted to Cody. I said yes, because it’s the truth and it would be a trivial thing to lie about, but that it’s not a big deal. John asked if Cody was attracted to me and again I said yes, and that Cody and I are pretty open with each other about that kind of thing but that it’s not a big deal and nothing would never happen. John told me that he was uncomfortable with the fact that I still hung out with him, and that Cody was probably trying to fuck me. I tried to explain that we’d been friends for years and that he was really trivializing a good thing because of one insignificant detail, but he basically said that Cody has a history of sleeping with a lot of girls (true) and that he probably only wanted sex from me. I got mad, because Cody’s a great dude, and yeah he gets around but only with single women who also only want casual sex. It’s not like he goes around lying to women or sleeping with people who are in committed relationships, and he completely respects that I don’t view sex the same way as him and supports my relationship. John basically acted like I don’t understand men and said that he wasn’t comfortable with me hanging out with Cody anymore because I was clearly too naive to see what’s going on. I said that he has no right to tell me who I can and can’t be friends with, and he told me I was being insensitive about his feelings. AITA?\n\nTl;dr: My boyfriend doesn’t want me to hangout with my best friend anymore because he thinks he only wants to fuck me, but that isn’t true and I’m not going to stop hanging out with him",

      "description": "So I have a small group of friends I hangout with frequently sometimes it’s all 5 of us sometimes it’s just 3 of us sometimes it’s just me and one of my friends. Two weekends in a row now I’ve asked 2 of my friends to hangout and their response has been along the lines of “not tonight I’m tired” or “I’m not feeling well tonight maybe tomorrow though?”. Normally I would be totally fine with those responses because it’s a totally reasonable response/reason. The past two weeks however after they’ve said no I’ve found out that that they were hanging out together without me.\n\nI’m friends with on of my friends on find my friends and he shares his location on snap map. I haven’t been intentionally checking his location to make sure he wasn’t lying when he said he was tired but last weekend I tried to add someone I met through a dating app on Snapchat and accidentally opened snap map and saw he was at my friends’(who I also asked to hangout) condo. Then last night same thing happened I asked to hangout they said no I’m tired/not feeling well whatever. My brother wasn’t answering his phone and my mom was just wondering where he was (we are friends on find my friends) so I check to see where he is and they are both hanging out without me again. \n\nThey have a little bit of a fwb situation going on so I understand them wanting to hangout alone/without me but I’d rather them not lie about it. I have on more than one occasion said that I hate when people lie about why they can’t do something I’d rather them just say “I don’t feel like it tonight” or “we were gonna hangout alone tonight”. It’s not like they keep their fwb situation under wraps or anything they’re very open about it. I just hate being lied to. \n\nAITA for being pissed not that they’re hanging out without me but that they’re lying to me about it?",

      "title": "AITA for being frustrated at a 14 year old girl who constantly talks about her personal problems?",
      "description": "This is my first post (and on mobile) so apologies if it looks weird. This happened over the course of about a month in a discord server I am in. For privacy reasons, I won't directly quote messages sent and for context, I am 17.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, someone joined a server my boyfriend and I are in and started talking about how much life sucks. He was (and still is) going through a lot of personal issues since he came out to his parents a few days before and they didn't take it well. They talked about how much life sucks which is all fine every once in a while.\n\nThis fourteen year old girl, who I will call X, is still pushing her personal problems into our lives. The other day, I learned she is in middle school. This is important later. She talked to us about a manipulative ex she met online and when I tried to tell her to block him and tell an adult, she refused to take the advice. This was slightly frustrating, but I didn't think much of it. Another time, X was describing a suicide attempt which was extremely uncomfortable for me to hear. She talked about getting drunk and getting arrested and it's all seeming like a huge grab for attention to me which I really do not like. At one point, she sent a picture of pills mixed in with alcohol and I was really tempted to her to stop it and get professional help since the oldest person in the server is 17.\n\nIn the server, we like to make fun of middle schoolers. A lot. We just have a distaste for the age group and make jokes about it. Typically, we tend to joke about the ones who hate life because of every little thing. X is exactly the type of person we joke about which only fuels our fire so we say things like \"Mom told me I have to get off my phone at 8. Ugh. I hate my life,\" but it never crosses any lines like suicide jokes and whatnot. We also mentioned to her that she is a stereotypical middle schooler.\n\nYesterday, X talked about how an essay she wrote got her sent to guidance. At this point, I was extremely frustrated with her so here's what happened:\n\nMe: Cool. Have fun.\n\nX: I won't\n\nMe: That was a nice way of saying I honestly don't care about your problems and I have no idea why you're talking about them here.\n\nAfter that, she only said sorry and left which made me feel a bit guilty for being so blunt but I have problems in my own life and don't want to hear about some stranger's.\n\nAdmittedly, I have been speaking to her a lot more bluntly and harshly lately since it's annoying that she only gets on to talk about herself and not have a nice time. I'm starting to worry that since I'm doing that, I'm being an asshole to her. If her problems are real, then I could only be adding to it by being harsh. I want her to get help if she is depressed. However, I am not a therapist. I am just a 17 year old guy.",

      "description": "My ex of 3 years and I broke up about two months ago, at her request. We've tried being friends, and up until this incident it was going fairly well. We'd still hang out and attend events together sometimes, still game together at times, grab lunch and that sort of friendship stuff.\n\nThe other day I went for a walk through an old unused road with a lookout point that her and I used to visit when we were together. It's a peaceful, private place and I figured it'd be nice to read there alone for awhile. When I reached the clearing I seen my ex's car parked there, which I thought was awesome timing and we could hang for a bit. As I walked closer I realized she was on the backseat, clearly having sex with some guy. \n\nI feel like a ton of bricks has been dropped onto my chest. I thought for sure I was over her and happy with just being friends, but seeing her with another man made me realize I still have feelings for her. **Before anyone gets preachy, I know she's free to do what she wants, she owes me nothing, who she sleeps with is none of my business**, but it still hurt to see and now I know I'm not as over her as I thought.\n\nI figured that since I can't shake this feeling and don't think platonic friendship is something I can handle with her, it would be most fair to her to go my own way because she shouldn't have to deal with being friends with an ex who wants more from her, and it isn't fair to me to stay in a friendship where I'm feeling hurt. So I told her the truth, not about what I seen but that I realized I still have feelings for her and while I care about her a lot and wish her the best, I think it'd be best for both of us if we go our separate ways. She flipped out, said I was being unfair and that \"I already agreed to be friends\", so here I am.\n\nAITA for thinking we should probably cut ties?",

      "description": "I’m on mobile so sorry! \n\nSo first off I’d like to say that my mom throughout my childhood was a great mother. Still is, just I think something has unhinged in her brain the last 5 years. \n\nAbout 4 ish years ago, my mom cheated on my dad with his long time best friend. Baffled would not come close to describe how me and my sisters felt. \nNow, I do believe that my parents were great together because they were great parents. They got married because my mom got pregnant with me in their early 20s. They popped out two more over the years and as we all grew older I noticed how different my parents were. One was introverted one was extroverted. \nHowever, her cheating on my dad (something she has always preached against “I just don’t understand why the person wouldn’t just leave their partner first”) with a guy who is an alcoholic (her own father was an alcoholic) and blaming my dad for pushing him to his arms (he would encourage them hanging out since he doesn’t like bars) has really strained her and my relationship. \nStill love her though. Still talk to her.\nBUT my middle sister is getting married in October and does not want that guy “Chad” there. Doesn’t like him. Understandable. But my mom CANNOT accept that we are not ready to accept him. My sister has made it clear that other family gatherings he can attend but just not her wedding. Then my tells us a couple weeks ago that her and “Chad” are getting married in April. So he HAS to be able to come now right? \nMy sister still says no.\nSo what does my mom say to her? \n“If he can’t come, I am not going to come.” \nWhen my sister told me she said this, I RAGED. I am the oldest and just knowing how she hurt my sister, all of my protective instincts came out and I almost drove 13hrs to yell at her face! I haven’t talked to her yet because only disrespect will come out of my mouth towards her. \nI don’t want her in my life anymore. She crossed the line by just saying that to my sweet sister. \n\nOh and since my mom won’t go that means her sister (my aunt) won’t go either. So that’s half our family that my sister won’t have at her wedding over this. \n\nAm I over reacting? I love my mom but I cannot have a conversation from this point on without disgust dripping off every word. WIBTA for cutting all contact with my mom? ",

      "description": "*Heads up-- some folks my find this a little gross because it involves anal sex and shit*\n\nI (M, 25) have been hooking up with a friend of mine (M, 29) on and off for a while now. We've both been pretty explicit about the fact that we are friends with benefits, and nothing more. Just in case you need context for our relationship.\n\nHe came over to my place and we started to have sex. For the uninitiated, sometimes the recipient of anal sex needs to prepare by cleaning out their rectum (not always necessary if you have the right diet for the record). He told me he was prepared, so we went at it, and one thing leads to another, and I look down and see his shit squirted out a little. In the process the fitted sheet came undone, so there was shit on my sheet and the mattress itself. In all fairness, it wasn't a lot, and it was pretty diluted by the lube. Still though, pretty gross. \n\nWhen I saw what happened, I was instantly turned off. I told him \"hey, I think I'm done\" and he looked down and started apologizing. I told him it's okay, and it happens, but at the same time I was gagging, almost dry heaving, at the sight of it. So I ran over to my closet and tossed him a towel and asked him to clean it up. I couldn't even look so I told him I'd meet him in the shower when he was done.\n\nHe joined me in the shower and we made out a bit, but we didn't do anything sexual beyond that. We hung out for a bit after that and watched tv, but I could tell he was uncomfortable. Eventually he got home and then texted me saying how embarrassed he was. I told him that there was nothing to be embarrassed about and that was that.\n\nI washed my sheets thoroughly in hot water, and that definitely took care of any germs or stains. My mattress cover was plastic though, so it wasn't washable. I went out to buy a new one. When I did, I texted this guy asking if he would be okay paying for it. It only cost $8. Then he responded \"I said I was sorry. Didn't realize it was such a big deal to you.\" I felt bad about putting him on the spot like that so I said \"How about you just buy me a drink next time we go out?\" He responded \"I don't know if I want to go out again. You really made me feel like shit over a normal bodily function. I was so embarrassed.\" And that was that...\n\nI get he was embarrassed, but I feel like he's overreacting here. Am I way off base? \n\n**tl;dr:** The guy I'm hooking up with got his shit on my mattress cover. He was really embarrassed and my reaction clearly didn't help the situation. I asked him to pay for a new one, and he said I was being petty because it didn't cost a lot.",

      "description": "I started to work in a store a year ago. We are unionized. A lot of people have been working here for years/decades. Those people have some sort of \"old people club\" where they gossip, nag a lot and act like they own the place. They specifically hate my manager(M) because she got the job pretty young, after being here for only a year. I refused to gossip about M because I've never seen her being unreasonable. They seemed a little pissed by it, but I didn't want to bully her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM accepted to show me manager work to help my career because I was working hard and kept doing overtime (we were understaffed).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day the director of the store gave me a check (50$) saying I was doing a good job. Other people working there learned about it and became mean to me. M learned about it from another employee and told the director about it. They seemed to kept an eye on me. People stopped being mean after a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is where I feel like I've been an asshole. One day, a guy shouted at me because I was putting a (small) stand from my department in his. I had never been rude to him at all, so I was pissed to be talked to like that. I told M. I think she then told the director because the next day the guy was acting \"nice\" to me (which felt fake).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months after, I got a small raise. I had a girl from my department asking me about it. She was obviously pissed. She had the habit of not coming to work without telling anyone when she's angry about something like it. I told M so we can organise the next day just in case. M was really pissed and said that the person who deals with pays had leaked information before. So she wanted to make a complain (in my name I think). The pay person became \"fake\" nice to me (and seemed pissed too).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday, there was this girl that I was friendly with who passed by me. She asked me very meanly if I had done some platters we had to make. I knew the girl, I knew she tended to be moody, and I didn't want to create more problems so I decided to reply to her with the same tone she used with me, but not tell M or anyone about it. As I walked off after replying, I saw another manager was near us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, everybody has been VERY cold to me (like not even saying hi). I overheard two girls talking, one who's a new employee and used to be nice to me until then. From what I heard (I was on the other side of the room), it has been about the girl I just talked about, and another girl (who I guessed was myself). The new girl was like \"I never would have guessed she was like that\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough it doesn't explain why the girl was suddenly mean to me, I guessed that the manager heard us, told the boss, the girl got in trouble and told everybody.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'd like to know if I was an asshole, and if ever you feel like it, what I should have done in those situations because I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

      "description": "Long story, but I think i need a fresh pair of eyes to tell me who is wrong here.\n\nI'm 14M and my mum is 48F. \n\nMy mum talks a lot of shit about me in front of my face and behind my back, E.G saying that i'm stupid, telling people that i think i'm always right (i get a lot of things wrong, and i apologise almost immediately for them), telling all her friends the worst about me all the time, and it has led to a few of her friends to build up genuine resentment for me even though i've never been in contact with them.\n\nI've been trying to get my mum to say nice things about me to me and her friends for a while now. She hasn't listened so far.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, i did about 8 hours of work out in my garden with my sister (15F) and one of my mum's friends. It was just general garden work, picking up things to take to the dump, etc... I got tired at about 10PM and i asked to go inside (i fall asleep at about 11 every night). My mum tells me no, i can stay out to do more work. But my mum and my sister are sat around a small bonfire we made. I was only doing small jobs at that point but i was exhausted. I later went inside to go to bed.\n\nThis morning, i woke up with a bit of pain from general strain. I mention it to my mum just as a passing comment, and she goes off on a tangent about how i'm unfit and i need to do more around the house (i help more often than my sister currently, she's doing her exams).\n\nMaybe five minutes later, i ask her why she constantly says bad things about me. I add to this, \"whenever i ask you about it, you either say that i'm trying to start an argument, or you downright deny it.\" Guess what? She does both, immediately. Tells me that she doesn't, then says \"stop trying to start arguments.\" I call her out on it. \"There you go again.\" She denies it again.\n\nAt this point, she's shouting at me.\n\nShe shouts at me about about how i always say the same thing over and over again. I say that I ask her things like this because she doesn't listen. She says she listens all the time.\n\nI tell her about how she treats my sister better than me, backing it up with the fact that she still tells all her friends that my sister got nominated for an award, even though she didn't win and that she was nominated for it almost a year ago.\n\nShe says that she doesn't. (she does, i heard her talking about it yesterday morning.)\n\nI then compare it to how she still talks about m being a complete moron for accidentally putting my SIM card in my phone wrong at christmas.\n\nShe then says: \"you always think you're right, don't you? I haven't said either of those things in months!\"\n\nI tell her that she was on the phone yesterday. \n\n\"You shouldn't have earwigged!\" I was next to her when she was talking.\n\nI leave.\n\nMum then shouts at me for \"running off to your computer like you always do\". I reply with \"Well if you weren't mean to me all the time maybe i'd stay downstairs.\"\n\nWho was the asshole in the situation? Me or my mother?",

      "description": "On mobile and I'm sorry for formatting.\n\nSome backstory:\n\nI've been with my SO for three years now going well into our fourth. I am Filipino/Vietnamese and she has a Greek/Italian background. When we started dating I couldn't meet her parents because they originally disapproved of her dating someone that wasn't of European decent and so we had to keep our relationship quiet. Her Mum caught on but we then found out she doesn't mind us dating as long as her daughter is happy. She only took on that mentality because of her husband and upbringing but had since moved on from it and changed her mentality. But her Dad has been a struggle. My SO has tried telling him on multiple occasions that we were in a relationship and every time she brought up the subject of dating, he would always mention that dating someone out of their original race or skin colour was a bad thing because you're not respecting your heritage and he would sometimes even get angry and threaten suicide if he found out anyone in the family was dating someone of a different ethnicity. Throughout the years her Dad has been abusive and emotionally manipulative. He has OCD and gets everyone to do work for him around the house and things like that because he has a lot of triggers for it. He has always blamed someone or something else when things go wrong and has never thought to look inward and take the blame. He once got violent after she came home late because she was out with me and a few mates. He knew I was a close friend and definitely did not want me dating his daughter and would call me really shitty and derogatory names according to my SO. \n\n\nRecently in the past year her Dad had been kicked out of the house and after an incident that turned violent in the house involving my SO's Dad and her Brother. He is now cut off from the family and my SO is the only who talks to him now. She has since told him of our relationship. She mentions every now and then her Dad wants to take us out to concerts and events and things like that, I laugh it off and make a joke about not wanting to go, but I'm still really hesitant to talk to the him or even meet him. A month ago he popped up to visit us out of nowhere and without warning and I had a panic attack and ran upstairs to our apartment and just freaked out and ignored her Dad. My girlfriend is starting to catch on and is actually wanting me to meet with him and try to bury the hatchet. I think that I am overreacting because he might actually be trying to fix his past mistakes but he still refers to me as \"The Asian\" instead of my actual name and seeing shit like that bothers me. I also don't want him around because from the texts I see he threatens suicide every time he doesn't get his way. I love my girlfriend and I would do anything for her, but I'm finding it so hard to find the courage to actually go out with her Dad. So am I the asshole for not wanting to meet him or have him around in our lives?",

      "description": "This one takes a bit of explaining so get ready.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a group of online friends i like to play video games with. Over Christmas break I went on vacation and couple of my friends (lets call them Sue and Joe for the sake of anonymity and to make events easier to follow I would also like to note Joe is Finnish because this will become important later) played a lot of games together and spent a lot of time talking with each other. When I got back from my vacation sue started ignoring Joe's messages and his invites to play games with us. Even when Joe and I would go play on a TF2 server the entire friend group was a regular on she would act like Joe was not there, and ignore his in-game chat messages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis went on for a couple of days until one day Sue responded to Joe's invite to play Exploding Kittens via tabletop simulator with himself and I. One of her friends who occasionally joined the group for Scriblio also joined we will call him Dan. Dan and Sue were silent most of the time we played together and both often ignored Joe's comments. It turned out Sues computer was over-heating and had connection issues so she rebooted her computer and Joe deleted an in-game tablet that could be used as a browser to make the game less demanding on Sues laptop. Later in the night Dan wrote a word in Finnish on the game table using the in game drawing tool. Joe asked Dan if he knew what that meant, and Dan and Sue ignored Him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy this point Joe and I were both very angry. I asked Sue if i could talk to her later, and she said sure. We played one more round, and Dan and Joe left. I asked Sue if she had some sort of problem with Joe. After struggling to explain to me what was going on she eventually told me she had some issues crop up in her personal life, and put on a more friendly persona and played a lot more games in order to cope. She also said she had been trying to cut back on her time spent gaming for a while and decided to stop playing as much around the time I got back. Lastly Sue said that she struggled to express her thoughts and feelings which was why she ignored Joe so much and didn't come on our groups discord as much to talk. Sue just didn't know how to explain this to Joe or anyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI relay this information to and sue messages him soon after. At this point it was midnight for me and 7 am for Joe. He and Sue agreed to talk about it the next day. The next day (last Sunday) Joe and Sue talk for a bit and work everything out. Joe and I were still a bit angry and I had some trouble buying her story. When i got home from classes yesterday I was considering cutting off my friendship with Sue, because she was still ignoring Joe even when we were on the same TF2 server. I didn't want to associate with someone who in my opinion treated people so disrespectfully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told Joe that I think Sue treated him like shit, and that I was considering cutting off my friendship with her. Later that night my monitor stopped working, so I went to bed. Joe went to go talk to Sue and in that conversation Joe told Sue I felt like Sue treated him like shit. Sue said that really hurt her, and Joe immediately regretted saying it offering to call her. Sue declined saying \"you don't want to hear me cry\". A few minutes later Sue calls Joe still crying, and explains she thought they had worked everything out. Joe offers to contact me, but Sue says she appreciates Joe telling her this, and says she will contact me when she is ready. I get home today and she has unfriended me on steam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though Joe shouldn't have told Sue what I said I still feel really bad as I made Sue cry. I feel like I should've realized that what I said would have hurt her since she has so much trouble expressing her feelings. I want to contact her but I feel as though she has made her stance clear.

      "description": "Apologies for any odd formatting, I'm on mobile.\n\nSome background:\nI am 19 (turning 20 in a couple months) and I have relied on my parents for most of my life. They are pretty protective. I guess they can also be referred to as helicopter parents? They didn't let me take the bus or walk home until halfway through highschool, they just insisted that they drive me everywhere. They almost didn't allow me to get a part-time job in my last year of highschool, it took a lot of persistence. I'm almost 20 and I have to be home by 10 PM or else they keep blowing up my phone with texts and calls. For a majority of my life, I have had to share a room with my sister (until she went to university).\n\nAnyways, as I have gotten older I have been wanting more and more independence. It was only when I started university that I felt like I had more freedom (to an extent).\n\n--\n\nSo, a couple of weeks ago, my parents and I were in the car and they brought up that they were looking to buy a house. My mom said that if they bought a house, it would be for me to live in so long as I give them a place to stay (ie. the basement).\n\nI told them that I appreciate the fact that they would buy a house for me but I would prefer to experience living on my own for once in order to gain some independence. My mom got upset and told me that I am ungrateful and disrespectful for not wanting to let them stay with me if we got a new place.\n\nI told her that it wasn't fair that my older sister (28) was able to experience living on her own/away from them during her college years and they made me go to school locally so I could stay home. I also said that I wouldn't be opposed to the idea of letting them live with me if it were further down the line, but I would much rather experience living on my own/with roommates first.\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": " JW is kind of cult like and are known for their abuse so fuck them. I am aware the members may not be aware of this so I usually tolerate them and excuse myself. I haven't seen them around in a few years so I was surprised when I saw one in front of my house. I was going to ignore it but she literally said my name and that my car was here so I was a bit freaked. Turns out it was one that came and gave me her number after 5 minutes of JW jargon a few years back. She apparently wanted to tell me about it more, though I already told her I am not interested in religion. She came because she wanted to try again since I was probably \"too shy\" to call her.\n\nBack then I was more patient but now I didn't have the time to listen to her so I told her I wasn't interested and to have a good day. This only made her want to explain more. I've had this debate too many times so I didn't even respond. She went off and I tuned her out until she asked to come in. Obviously I didn't want crazy in my house so that was a big no but I understand that she probably been in the house (my dad can't say no to these people) so she didn't think it would be a big deal.\n\nShe wanted an explanation, I already told her again that I was not interested in religion and she wanted to know why. She kept trying to guess what happened to me ( media, friends, abuse). She asked about  abuse to a literal stranger it! It is weird because JW is known for abuse then using religion to blame them. I kept saying it was just not my thing but she didn't accept that so I said \"In my opinion religion is evil, especially yours\". That...did not go very well. She wasn't angry just very sure that I was confused and something must have happen to me. I basically told her I had something to do and quickly close the door.\n\nI don't know what I could've done! I tired to give a simple answer but she wouldn't just accept it.",

I have moved on since then, but she hasn't and attempts to call me to try to convince me that we should get back together because she realized that i was a good person to her and that it was wrong to cheat and that her life has fallen apart starting when i left her. She got kicked out of her parents home(i don't know why), almost lost her job and recently came to me telling me that she's suicidal.  She came to my house and kept trying to talk to me, but i told her she's not my problem anymore and i don't have to be concerned about her. I eventually gave in when she said she's suicidal and wants someone to talk to her. I said that i would try to help, but it turned into her calling me when im with my family and friends, she calls me randomly at night because she feels lonely, she calls and messages me until i answer her call to try to get me to get back with her and when i don't answer she tells me she's suicidal and that she's cutting. After a month of this im growing tired of it and dread every time i get a phone call because i know it's her. I want to stop talking to her, but at the same time i don't want someone to die over me. She calls me every day and i just don't want to talk to her anymore, it exhausts me and doesn't stop until i answer. Am i the asshole for wanting to stop talking to her?",

      "title": "AITA - Not paying my sisters phone",
      "description": "My parents left the country a while ago, my sister and I stayed behind to pursue college and work, respectfully. I am living pay check to pay check. My parents decided it would be too much of a hassle to keep paying for my sisters phone every month on their own account, so they asked if I would allow my sister to come onto my plan. They said they would cover the cost of her phone (extra $20 a line). I agreed\n\nI have never received a single payment from my parents regarding my sisters phone plan but I went with it anyway without complaining, it didn't matter to me. Now comes the list of all of the shit I've had to put up with:\n\nShe went over the data limit a few times. The worst was 3 GB over because she decided she wanted to watch Netflix on her way down to Florida on a trip. \nShe started using the \"Charge my phone\" option when buying things on the app store. She racked up a $70 charge to my bill while playing some stupid game on her phone. \n\nWhen she went home during the holidays, she wouldn't notify me ahead of time so I would get stupidly insane international charges. At one point I had a bill for over $700 for a month and a half worth of usage.\n\nA few months after the conversation with my parents happened, my sister's phone broke while she was home for the holidays. So she called me asking for me to get her a replacement phone, so I did. However, Verizon determined it was caused by her misuse after talking to her about it and refused to give one for free. My parents decided she should just get a new phone. So they went on the Verizon website, I gave them my account details (I know right, I fucked up) and they bought her a new phone. Now I was under the impression, they were buying her a new phone with THEIR money. Instead, I come to find that they actually chose the monthly payment plan on a new iPhone 10 for her. I didn't find out until I was billed $83 extra on my next phone bill. I called them and asked why they didn't pay, they said they didn't have enough money to pay it out right and that they would pay me for the phone. I asked them why she didn't buy one of Verizon's refurbished phones and apparently my sister said that she had cleared buying the iPhone 10 with me before they bought it, and that she also had my permission to do the payment plan. I, in no way, gave her permission, I wouldn't have, I can't afford to.\n\nI coaxed my sister into coming to the Verizon store with me one day recently, under false pretenses because she wouldn't have come otherwise. I made her sign up for her own phone plan, return the iPhone 10 (because she couldn't afford it) and I bought her an iPhone SE. So I'm free of her for now. My parents got wind and are furious with me because now my sister has to spend her own money on her phone instead of mine. My phone bills have gone from $100+ a month down to $45, I have a little more breathing room.",

      "description": "Throwaway account. Let me preface this by saying that I’m a 20 year old guy in college pursuing music production so in a way I guess I sort of feel like I’m being a really lame party pooper for this.\n\nI understand that a music degree by itself won’t land me a “job”, rather I plan on using music school for connections within the industry and professional mentorship, and also to help build my skills as an electronic/alternative musician. That being said I’ve been told that it’s very important to put yourself out there and be social with other people in the industry (musicians, promoters, djs, rappers/vocalists, event planners, etc). \n\nI know not every scene is like this but as a producer from la/Long Beach I typically end up partying/hanging out with a lot of trap/rap producers, hard edm producers, and of course rappers. And boy do they like being all sorts of inebriated. And honestly I’m guilty of it too... on multiple occasions. But I honestly feel like it’s really started to take a toll on my mental health and I just can’t focus on work like I should be able to. \n\nI drink sometimes but weed has usually been my drug of choice, and while I definitely think I’ve been more creative under the influence I’ve never ever been able to finish a song high. And also I’m starting to realize that I’m creative regardless of being faded and it’s just that weed exaggerates my feelings so I always enjoy my music way more while I’m on it, even if it’s just a simple beat or melody. \n\nAnother thing is that one of my friends in this group is trying to start a collective sort of thing where we do shows and podcasts and promote our own music on our website and I’m sort of the co founder. We haven’t even had our first show yet but I don’t think I can work with someone who’s been doing drugs since middle school and doesn’t realize most of his problems stem from that. I know that’s probably not a good enough reason to not want to work with someone but he’s super hard headed and impulsive especially when he’s high (which is like almost every day usually) so yeeeah.\n\nAs I’m typing this I’m realizing it might be obvious to some, and I’m sure I’ll get responses saying that I can still have the same friends but just refrain from drug use, but you are who you surround yourself with...and I honestly just need someone I can jam/make music with sober or even just go out to lunch for a couple of hours and just talk. \n\nTLDR: I realize I need to be sober for a while but my current friend group was formed on the basis of partying/drinking/smoking, so I’m thinking that hanging around them isn’t exactly in my best interest. \n\n\n",

He needs to have a date with me as an excuse. \n\nI felt what he did was manipulative and in disregard of boundaries I’ve set out over the years. I told him so and blocked him.

It feels silly to have to mention this but I think it will provide some context with this whole food situation.\n\nSo recently we visited his parent's house for dinner and the topic of my partner's birthday came up. Every year, his parent's organise a lunch for his birthday with his immediate family and I. This year he wanted to celebrate his Birthday at a Korean BBQ restaurant however, his parent's reaction seemed a bit negative towards this idea. The conversation then followed as so: Me (me), fiance's mum (FM), finance (F)\n\nFM to F: You need to think about if it will be an appropriate place for everyone that's coming, including us, your sister and her new boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe to F: Oh, your sister's bf might not like Korean BBQ, maybe we should choose a different place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFM to me: What do you mean by that? You haven't even met him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: Well Korean BBQ can be a bit loud and intense, plus you have to cook your own food. It might not be the best atmosphere to meet him\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFM: He is actually a really laid back guy. I can't believe you just said this!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: You're right I have never met him. I guess it's just I think I would feel a bit nervous if I was meeting a bunch of new people in an environment like that eating food I've never tried before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFM: This is unbelievable, you're not even Korean, you can't just assume he won't like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe seemed really offended by what I said, from what I could gather I think that she thought that I was trying to say he wouldn't like the food due to his race. In reality, I was just trying to be considerate of the dude, so AITA for assuming that he might not like the food? Is what I said offensive?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I love her, of course, but I’ve always been rather introverted and well I went through a divorce that was extremely hard on me. The combination of these two things has made me into a rather inward partner. She gets mad at me and expects me to want to cuddle and say sweet things but I’ve told her time and time again that I just am not capable of that type of affection anymore. She thinks it’s because I’m still in love with my ex but really it’s more what my ex did to me that I don’t have the energy to put myself out that far again. I know it makes my current girlfriend sad, and I don’t want that at all. I just kind of expect her to leave me be and she expects the opposite from me. I feel like she isn’t trying to understand my needs or position but then maybe it’s me who needs to be more understanding? I find myself content in our relationship, I don’t ask her to change anything about herself other than to not get so upset with me for not being more open. AITA?",

      "description": "My partner and I are long distance. I live in a few thousand miles away. A few times a year we visit each other for maybe a few weeks.\n\nThe flight costs about $500-1,000. He's paid for his flight everyone he comes here, and I pay for mine every time I go there, except once, which we spilt. I work one a week minimum wage and he works 3 days and earns almost double so it's pretty fair.\n\nThe problem for me is, when I go there, he wants to game for 5+ hours with his friends every day. I can't join because there is only one computer and his friends don't have consoles. No split screen games or anything. I've said that if that's the case, I should be able to hang out with my friends while he's here, go out for 5+ hours with them. He says it is not the same because he is in the same room, but mentally he is not with me (he won't respond or anything). I've said 1-2 hours a day would be better but he does not agree and does not want any less time.\n\nI'm fine when he goes to work for 8 hours every 3 days, but I also want to spend as much time as possible with him because of only seeing him a few times a year and paying upwards of $500 and flying 5k miles.\n\nHim gaming is never a problem when we are apart because I have many things to do, and I'm not only there seeing him for a limited time. It wouldn't be a problem if I saw him every day either.\n\nAITA for saying if he games for that long, I should be able to go out and hang out with friends for that long while he's here (even though if I could I wouldn't), and also wanting him to spend less time doing that?",

      "description": "Around June of 2017, I started talking to this girl. She was very attractive to me, and I wanted to try and date her eventually. Around October, I wound up actually dating her. I was ecstatic! A girl I absolutely fell for was dating me. I felt pure joy. \n\nAround late November, she broke up with me. I was okay with that, as she broke up due to stress. I didn’t want to push her, so I backed off and let her be single. I asked if she would consider dating me when she felt better, and she said yes. I was very happy about that as well. \n\nHowever, just a little bit later, I wound up dating someone else. The relationship started mid January 2018, and I was very happy in this relationship. Over time, however, I started receiving hate messages via an anonymous message leaving website. I thought nothing of it, (as around that time I had a meme account with around 18k followers on Instagram) so I thought nothing of it. These hate messages started getting personal however, and I started using process of elimination to figure out who it was. Turns out, surprise surprise, it was everyone’s favorite ex. She wound up finding my meme page (i never told her it) and started sending anonymous hate messages that were personal and obviously directed at me (it was a joint meme account). \n\nI immediately blocked her, and since I needed to vent, texted a few friends who knew her. Some of those people started to stop talking to me because they liked her better. The title says I hate her with a passion, and I do. She wound up ruining multiple friendships, and also cheated on me with my girlfriend at the time. \n\nI know this is an obvious question to both, but AITA?",

I had never dated a woman who had that kind of loss before, so I've been learning as I go, but I've tried to respect that he will always be a part of her story, and I accepted her relationship with her late fiance's parents with open arms. They stayed very close, and by the time we started dating they were basically like a second set of parents to her. Kayla's real parents and her late fiance's parents are all amazing people, so I consider myself pretty lucky to have two sets of great in-laws.\n\nOur wedding is coming up in May, and Kayla told me that after her father-daughter dance, she would like to have a second dance with her late fiance's father to the song Vanilla Twilight. She asked me if I was comfortable with that, and I didn't want to be \"that guy\" and say no, so I said yes. But really, it makes me uncomfortable that she would be dancing to a love song dedicated to another man at our wedding. I am happy to make space in our lives for his memory. A photo of him is on our mantle at home, we make it a point to commemorate his birthday the anniversary of his death, and I feel like I am understanding and supportive when she has bad days. And I am 100% fine with having his parents at the wedding because, like I said, we are all a family. But I also feel like our wedding is one day that it all about *our* relationship.\n\nAm I the jerk if I ask her to reconsider this dance? What are the best compromises here?",

I basically fell in love with her when I first saw her, she's absolutely stunning, her slim, delicate body, her silky, long black hair, her cute face and her adorable smile. \n\nAs it turns out she's also incredibly smart and just fun to be with, we even share a couple of interests. I couldn't believe that she didn't have a boyfriend but it made me think that I got to at least try asking her out, even if she'd turn me down which I was sure she would. So the other day I took up all my courage and did and I couldn't believe it when she actually agreed to it and even seemed happy about me asking her.\n\nSo we now have our first official date next week. However the next day my friend texted me, calling me an asshole and saying that he didn't want to hang out with me anymore. I was a bit confused at first, turns out he had feelings for her too but never had actually decided to try taking it further than just being friends. I apologized but didn't say I wouldn't go out with her. I can understand his point but he's known her for a long time and had more than enough time to ask her out. He can't blame me for doing so, right?\n\nJust want to get some opinions on this. ",

      "description": "I wasn't sure what to write as a title to this post so sorry if it is a bit too long, it is my first post here.\n\nHere's the story: \n\nI met a girl on tinder and we talked during the entire summer and really hit it off, I started to like her a lot and we eventually had a date. It was a normal date, we had dinner and watched a movie, it went fine. Due to conflicting schedules, we took a while to schedule a second date but eventually managed, and it also went well. We then went on a third date not long after and at this point I've really fallen for this girl. I talk to my two best friends, they are up to date on the whole thing and think I should go for it on the next date. I'm not a very confident guy so I went until I'm dropping her off at home and then I tell her: I like you, like \"like\" you, a lot. I know, it was a very teeny way of saying it but I was choking already so it was the only way it came out. She laughed and said \"that's normal, I like me too!\", kissed me on the cheek and went home. I was half hurt half confused. Like, did she really not understand what I just said?\n\nSo I get home and text her and indeed she says she did not understand so I put it the clearest way possible: I'm in love with you. She answers with just \"...\" And doesn't say anything else until the afternoon of the next day. During the following week I kept talking to her and asking what she meant with that answer, trying to get some closure. In my mind I just wanted her to say no, and I would move on, cause I would still like to have her as a friend. She kept avoiding the issue like a plague, so I decided to let it go and try to keep talking to her like before. She starts answering less and less often, and eventually we go like 4 days without talking.\n\nThen she texts me out of the blue with \"I miss you\", which just confused me, cause now I'm thinking King again does she like me or not, so I ask her that and she avoids it like before. After 2 days of talking again, very on and off and not much at all, I decide to take my friends' advice and not initiate any more conversation with her. This way I can see how she reacts, and if she doesn't react at all then I'm sparing myself of hurting more.\n\nWe go 2 weeks without talking. She didn't text at all. Then yesterday she texts saying something like \"are we like this now? Do you not care about me anymore?\" And I respond I needed time and space after everything. And she said I abandoned her. I said i moved away because I was hurt by her reaction to my confession and didn't want to get anymore hurt. She said she only reacted the way she reacted because she was scared, and I asked scared of what? And she said \"scared that you were like all other boys, that you would be influenced by your friends and turn against me and hurt me\". And I said that she had no reason for that, because I had never done anything to hurt her and had always done what I could to make her happy during all those months. And I asked if she liked me back, why did she not say at the time and instead gave me a cold answer. She said she wanted to see if I was different from all other boys, that she wanted me to realize what I was doing and act accordingly and not give up. I was baffled. I said she didn't even give me a chance to show I could be a good boyfriend and she said that was my fault, that I abandoned her.\n\nAfter this I reiterated that I only did what I did because I was hurt and she said she understands but I shouldn't have acted like I did, to which I replied that her actions weren't the most correct ones either and that she had really hurt me. The closest thing I got to an apology was \"I acted wrong, yes, but so did you\". I said it was a shame that things turned out the way they happened, to which she replied \"yes, it is\" and that was it.\n\nLong story, didn't think I would write this much but that's it. Am I in the wrong here? Was it really that bad of me to walk away from a person that had hurt me in order to protect myself? My friends say no, but I'm the kind of guy who really just does anything he can to please someone he likes and most of the times comes out of it hurt or, as my friends say, spineless. \n\nThis is probably the first time I really took a stand and was selfish, but I would like to get some unbiased opinion and if possible. If anything is unclear just let me know, thanks",

      "description": "FC: Fired Coach  AC: A-hole coach ME: Me\n\nBackstory: This coach , along with another coach who was eventually fired , were straight up bullies towards the kids they were responsible for. The one who was fired bullied students and made it hard for us for no reason. \n\nHe made fun of a kid who had a kidney disease for asking to not participate in dodge ball because he was having kidney problems. He also made him sit out that day of PE and didn't even allow him to go to the nurse. He later made fun of the same kid for not having a dad. (The kid's dad had died in the military.) After the FC made him sit out , he talked to him for a bit. The situation escalated like this. FC: I'm going to need you to get your dad to sign a note. Kid: I Don't have a daddy. FC: What? Excuse me? Kid: My dad died. FC: HAH! Alright sure , get your MOM to sign this then. (Then commences to lecture him on how he shouldn't lie and how he should respect the coach. Kid is crying at this point and FC gets even angrier.\n\nAfter this incident me and my friend group were plotting to beat the FC up. Before we could set the plan into motion though , my friend apparently told his grandma everything who then went to the principle and got him fired. That was at the end of that year , so naturally we assumed that we would get a replacement coach, Since there was supposed to 2 because these coaches had to supervise 4 classes , but we ended up only having 1 coach despite the 4 classes. Enter AC. He hadn't been hostile or unfair to us the year before , despite going along with FC's actions. We quickly realized that he wasn't as bad , but he still bullied us. Sorry for the long setup , so here's the story I wanted to tell. It happened around the same time as our school's Christmas play. It had rained outside and they were practicing for the play in the gym , so we just sat in the gym and were told not to talk or get up. So basically this won't make sense unless I explain how we were seated. The boys were next to the girls on the bleachers , only separated by the stairs leading up the bleachers and a wooden fold up table place on the bottom of the stairs. I Had my water bottle with me and was taking a sip every once in a while. Fast forward about 10 minutes and I Had my water bottle sitting by my leg , I moved my foot slightly and accidently knocked it over so I went to pick it up and this girl picked it up and put it on the table. (Quick backstory on this girl: She is a bitch to everyone who isn't a teacher , enough said.) I said , \"hey give that back.\" , then she replied , \"You shouldn't have dropped it.\". I Then get up and go pick up the water bottle , just as the coach turns around. \"You aren't supposed to get up , go to the top of the bleachers.\" AC said. I Didn't think that I had to , since I did nothing wrong. I Replied , \"I Was just getting my water.\" At this point all 4 grades were looking at us , \"You still aren't supposed to get up , now go to the top.\" he said. \"I don't need to because I did nothing wrong, SHE moved my water.\" , I said pointing at the girl. \"Either go up there , or go to the office.\" . he said , but I stood my ground because I HATE this coach. I Said , \"Ok , I'll go.\" , In the most calm voice I could muster. I Got up and pushed myself under the table and onto the floor without falling and began to walk away. A few people clapped and others complimented me. Now I know that sounds like something strait out of a tumblr story but It actually happened. I Went to the office , explained the situation to the vice principal , who then called my mom and let me explain it to her. We both then went to see the coach , because by the time I was done in the office PE had ended for the day. When talking to the vice principal ,AC lied stating that I didn't say anything about my water bottle. When we left on the way back to the office I explained that AC was lying , but they ended up trusting the coach. The Vice principal and my mom agreed that I wasn't in trouble , but that I should've made a better attempt to tell the AC about my water bottle. In the end , what got me in trouble at home was the fact that I legit forgot to tell my dad about it. When he calmed down though he agreed that I wasn't in the wrong. (He was a bit flustered because I don't usually get in trouble.)Also ,(The same day) In class when I was talking to friends they were all congratulating me on what it did. So , Am I the asshole for standing up to a coach?\n",

      "description": "So I work for a large company, and about two years ago we moved to a new building. At the old building we have almost no natural sunlight (access to widows) due to how our desks were arranged. When we moved to our new location, everything was specifically set up so we could have our desks closer to the windows and have some natural light.\n\nIn our office building now the walls are windows. Imagine windows from hip up to the ceiling. It's amazing! Our call environment is stressful (call center) and natural light helps reduce stress as well as, I believe, eye fatigue. Natural light also helps boost employee moral for the most part.\n\nAnyway!\n\nWhen I get to work along with some co workers, we open the shades. We like natural lighting. It helps improve our moods. Out of approximately 20 people on the team I work on, three people close the shades. Three. Two of which close them because of glare on their computer screens.\n\nHere is my thought though. The glare could easily be mitigated if these individuals simply... turned their monitors (we utilize dual monitors). The two people who complain about glare face away from the windows and get a glare on their screens but have made no moves to adjust their screens, both of them having their monitors completely straight. If they turned them just a little they would no longer have any glare.\n\nThey refuse to do it, which causes animosity in an otherwise peaceful and fun work environment. In general I like both of these coworkers but I become agitated when the first thing they do when they arrive is completely close every single blind (the blinds go up and down and they lower them all the way down).\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting the blinds up?\n\nNote: these windows do not face east or west, so the rising and setting of the sun is not causing any issues. There is no direct sunlight, just normal daytime sky.",

      "description": "Mobile, formatting etc etc. I'll try to shorten it this time. But there's a lot of small details so I guess ask in comments if you need more info. 28 Female, lesbian. Ex is my ex duh, gf is the new girl I loved/still do... \n\nMe and my ex, whom sadly suffers from bipolar, had a terrible relationship that lasted almost 13 years. After a lot of bs and toxicity from both of us, started dating at 16, had a wonderful mutual break up. She tried to get with a friend because I pushed them together. One night before a trip we planned as friends now I had to over hear them trying to do stuff and it broke me. I cried in the corner, panic texted her and did something I regret to this day. Begged to get her back.\n\nCouple months ago, nothing had changed after getting back together. Asked for a break again. We're still in a lease until June. Month later found the girl of my dreams, and I was hers. I told ex I'm moving out after lease ends, maybe sooner. Ex lost her crap, one night started a bigger version of her typical verbal abuse. Gf comforts me but a day or two later leaves me because my ex's outburst made her scared I still loved my ex. Like... What?\n\nI begged for her to reconsider, I hadn't even done anything wrong. All I did was ask her for comfort when my ex started her assault. She refused but said we could start fresh as friends first and if things happened they happened.\n\nSeveral weeks in were doing better. Playing games and stuff, talking and sending memes. Playing a game yesterday and something ridiculous in game upset gf, like. High school drama level of ridiculous. I try to remedy it. And then go grocery shopping.\n\nGet a text from mutual friend that introduced us. (slept with ex while me and her where still together yea I know, why did forgive him. Idk.) Tells me gf is very upset, I try to find out why and give my side of the story as he asks. Not realizing he's telling her all the stuff I'm saying and vice versa. Him telling her all of this stuff and trying to \"fix\" it, broke it and made her not even want to talk to me anymore because it overloaded her. So now I've lost her as my gf, and as even a friend.\n\nTLDR; gf leaves me because my ex's abuse made her question my loyalty for some reason? And then abandons me as friend after some dumb mmo thing she took the wrong way, mutual friend tries to \"fix\" it and pushes her further away by overloading her and pushing for answers when I didn't ask him to.",

      "description": "So I'm a person which does nearly everything for the family. Like my siblings and my parents. I buy everything they need, I help out with every kind of work that may come up and I try my best to keep a good relationship to everybody. One thing everyone know is extremely important to me is my sleep. If I don't sleep well/enough I'm going to have a bad day. It was that way since I was a kid and is still the same way and maybe always will be. We all also have our own little floor so if something happens downstairs I won't know and won't hear, so I'm mostly getting the sleep that I really need.  \n\n\nAlright since you know stuff about me: My sister just send me a message saying \"Hey, no ones home tomorrow except for you and your older brother (which is sick btw), so you have to stay downstairs starting at 8AM.\"  \nI responded, that I wouldn't want to, especially since she told me at 23:30PM the day before and how much I need my sleep.  \nShe tried to make me feel blameworthy by talking about how my brother is sick and it wouldn't have mattered if she told me now or like a week ago.  \nMy answer still was no, since she just did not seem to understand how much it bothers me to wake up this early, especially if I normally go to sleep at 3AM since I learn at night.  \nThen she said I'm making it waaay bigger than it has to be and that I shouldn't do it.  \nI wrote \"Yeah, I won't.\"  \nAfterwards she wrote the thing that made me furious. \"Don't expect anything from your family in the future. Wash your clothes yourself from now on.\"  \nIt made me think: Is EVERYTHING I do for this family just not enough, because I've said \"no\" once?  \nAs furious as I was I went downstairs and knocked at the door but she just stayed in her bed and said \"Go away, your fahter is asleep.\"  \n\n\nAITA here? I just don't know how to respond and hate this way of her persuading guilty feelings.  \n",

      "description": "This is super long but I really do want to know if I’m in the wrong, and you need background info decide, I believe. \n\nI guess from my post history everyone could see that I have quite a few problems with my roommate. Anyways, everything is just building up and I let some of it leak today. \n\nSo I live in a dorm room for 3 but there is actually 2 because one left (I had asked the two of them to start helping me clean up every week, but one had a fit and left. The other said that’s no problem and here we are now). Also I was (and am) the only one actually buying cleaning supplies. \n\nSo both of them were/are pretty gross, leaving crumbs/wrappers/misc all over the carpet, leaving our shared sink a mess, etc. Now it’s super noticeable as to who’s doing it because technically the room is split up into sides (I’m going to start calling the remaining roommate Hannah). On Hannah’s “side,” there is the empty desk, the empty bed, and Hannah’s desk. On mine, there’s my bed, my desk, and Hannah’s bed. The side with Hannah’s desk, where she spends the majority of her time, is an absolute mess (on all sets of furniture, even though all of them technically do not belong to her). I have continued pointing out to her, “how could you get the carpet dirty so fast” or “I just vacuumed” but not in a too serious/stern tone but it’s enough where she stops what she’s doing to pick it up. Every time she says “sorry, I didn’t notice.” I never believe her because it’s always chucks of trash/toothpaste/whatever. But anyway. \n\nLately she has been going to the gym which has led her to leave her towels/gym clothes all over the floor/furniture. She has also taken up painting, causing her to leave paint all over the sink. I left her a detailed note (she was asleep and I had to run errands by the time she woke up) asking her to pick up after herself because I didn’t want to embarrass her by saying her sweaty clothes were stinking up the room so bad. This is our way of communicating the chores, I write out an alternating pattern and hang it up where she can see it. I just added this particular detail at that week. I complete my chores before her, so I don’t mess with the note until the next week on the designated cleaning day. But I also say to clean up the little messes throughout the week. \n\nSo after this note it takes her an afternoon to actually get to it and she leaves it up (we frequently have guests, which will be relevant later). She uses the supplies I provide and I notice that she has a habit of leaving things like disinfectant wipes open because she “doesn’t notice she’s doing it.” But every week? No. I decide to take all of the stuff and just put it away just for me to use. There are still ways to get stuff to clean, like renting it or going to the store (which is not far away), so I think I’m being reasonable. The cleaning day passes and she doesn’t have her part done, but all I do is circle her part in the note. Then it gets done. Okay. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to today (Monday). I just vacuumed last Friday (and of course there’s trash all over Hannah’s side) and she cleaned the counter on Saturday. I get up later than Hannah on Mondays and I go to brush my teeth and see coffee spills all over the counter and in the sink. \n\nI am FUMING. How could she “not notice” brown liquid all over a cream, smooth surface? So I record the mess (with a bottle of soap that I bought, which I decided to leave out) and post it on my Snapchat. I caption it “I wonder when I’ll blow up on my roommate for always making such a big mess?” I know that I have my roommate and our friends on my story. I made no attempt to block her or them. Please note that this was not an attempt to create any drama, but to just express my feelings because obviously no one is listening to me in real life. \n\nI later get a text from Hannah saying that I was talking shit behind her back about her, how I’m always rude and she is always the one to apologize for it. How I’m always saying she’s dirty in front of guests. I have no idea what she’s talking about. I wasn’t talking shit, I was telling the truth. And I brought up this issue multiple times way before I even posted on my snap, in all forms of ways: the notes, texting, and in person. Other people even call her out when she visits their rooms and leaves food on the floor. I don’t ever recall being rude when asking her to clean up after herself, or bringing it up when there’s company (unless they decide to read the note that was left up), but maybe, who knows. What I’m really focused on is how I was talking shit, even though it was the truth? Was I talking behind her back, even though I made several attempts in the past to get through to her AND I didn’t block her from my story? \n\n\n",

      "description": "Some context: My sibling (M, 26) is probably a compulsive liar/has some level of autism that has never been diagnosed. Ever since we were teenagers (I'm F, 25), he's been trying to pull something off to be the \"cool guy\" and then tells genuinely impossible-to-believe lies when it blows up. No matter how much you work with him, he'll **never** admit that he did the thing. Throughout the years, it's gotten worse and worse. Police have been involved, he's lost his job, and he's built up lies so big that he can't get down from them, but it's always tied to a specific topic that the rest of our family just doesn't bring up so he doesn't have to lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, he started completely ignoring me out of the blue. This was around the time he lost his job but I wasn't aware. Won't return my phone calls or texts, etc. When I saw him around Thanksgiving, I asked \"Hey, what's up with you not answering my phone calls?\" And he told some ridiculous lies that made no sense, which I told him didn't make any sense, and he got flustered and eventually said \"So what. I don't care.\" I got very upset, walked away. Later on, approached him and said, \"Hey, let's talk.\" We went outside and tried to hash it out, but when I caught him in his lie he once again got flustered, said \"This is bullshit,\" and I flipped out. He got in my face like he was going to hit me, it became a screaming match, and my mom broke it up. Last thing I said to him was \"This isn't you bro, something's going on and I'm worried about you.\" He laughed once and said \"Have a good night,\" before walking away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow it's Christmas. Told my mom I wasn't ready to talk to him, but if he was coming over for Christmas anyway I'm just going to completely ignore him until he can talk to me about what's going on so that I don't just burst into tears when I see him. I asked to not have him bring anything for me to avoid potential further conflict. Mom says \"ok,\" but doesn't actually tell him so that I'll be forced to play along in front of the family and make everything ok. Neither of us greets the other. He asked me one question that I addressed but dismissed, that's the extent of our interaction. When gift exchange happens, I don't open the two gifts he gave me - just set them to the side. He's obviously noticed it, keeps checking to see that I haven't opened it. When goodbyes come, I excuse myself. When he leaves, he tells my mom he's sorry and he's clearly upset. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParents want me to call him to make up for it, but I want him to reach out first. IMO, if he's truly incapable of contacting me because he's mentally ill and can't address his lies, then his condition has gotten severely worse &amp; my parents need to step in and force him to see a therapist before the stress causes him to hurt himself or worse. If my family and I continue to allow him to lie without realizing the harm he's doing to his relationships, I think the condition will continue to get worse and that he ultimately will hurt himself. If he can work up the courage to contact me (and I've told my parents to encourage him to do so &amp; support him) then maybe it will be a turning point and he will work with us to get the help he needs. Until then, family has been guilt tripping me on a daily basis to call him and tell him everything's fine. ",

      "description": "I started dating my best friend Chris when we were in high school, after we graduated we chose the same university and found an apartment together. From the start we agreed to be in an open relationship because both of our parents got divorced and we didn't think too highly about standard monogamous relationships. We didn't practice polygamy for the first 2 years though (we're together 6 years now).\n\nOur relationship is great, we enjoy spending time together, share similar views and hobbies and have a lot of close friends in common. The only issue is that he has considerably more feelings for me than I for him. At first we were both in love but as time passed I've fallen out of love. I still love and appreciate him a lot, he's still my best friend but there are  few romantic feelings left. \n\nAs I was falling out of love I began to hope Chris will find someone else (that's why the emphasis that we are in an open relationship, he is free to pursue other people). I don't want to break up with him because he's my best friend and I don't want to hurt or loose him. He knows how I feel, is a grown man and can make decisions for himself. As long as the relationship works for both of us I see no reason to end it. \n\nRecently one of my friends told me she thinks I'm an asshole for staying with him. She thinks that the reason he's not ending the relationship is because he still has feelings for me and is too scared to end it. She also said that I'm being a coward because while I say that I'm still with him because it works for both of us the truth is that I'm just scared of the consequences of ending it (him being hurt and worst case scenario ending the friendship). She said that it's highly unlikely that he will seriously pursue anyone else while we're still together and that I'm selfishly holding both of us back and that if I was a real friend who genuinely cared about Chris I would have ended it long ago no matter the consequences.\n\nNone of my other friends have ever expressed such an opinion not even the ones Chris and I have in common which kinda reassures me that I'm not doing anything wrong by him, but she seems so certain about her view I had to ask, am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "On mobile so sorry for any possible formatting issues. This also might be all over the place as I’m rather worried.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were having a discussion about art. Basically, I was about to commission a poster from a fellow artist and friend. My GF mentioned offhand that she wanted to do commissions really cheap, as she is also an artist (and far more skilled than I am.) She essentially said, “If somebody asks me for a huge poster, hell I’ll do it for ten bucks!”\n\nI tried to explain to her why I felt that wouldn’t work, my reasons being as follows: good art that cheap would likely attract more seedy crowds (she’s already gotten questionable requests on Tumblr) and she has this attitude where she feels obligated to draw what people ask of her. \n\nAnother reason being that, with such low prices, she would likely be in high demand, leading her to be stressed and feel overworked. Having such cheap prices would just make everybody flock to her and she’d get overwhelmed.\n\nAfter I raised my concerns, she then said, “Fine, no commissions. I’ll just do requests.” I pointed out that was even *worse,* but she didn’t really listen to me, insisting that once she got her animation career going or whatever, she’d be alright. \n\nI’m fairly certain most animators aren’t paid enough to make a decent living without doing something on the sidelines as well, and that brought up another concern: if she did these so cheap, when she turns 18, she won’t be able to make a damn living! Sure, when we eventually move in together, we’ll be splitting bills up somehow, but we both want similar career paths.\n\nI just feel as if she doesn’t truly value her art if she does things for dirt cheap, plus the other reasons above. Am I the asshole for thinking that? Or am I just overthinking things in general?",

My roommate whose room is upstairs comes running downstairs yelling and banging on my door and my other roommate's door saying we need to get up and help him. The other guy gets up immediately, then they are both banging on my door trying to get me to join them.\n\nApparently there was a bat upstairs in the hallway that scared my roommate. He wanted to get rid of it right away, but needed help to do so. I told them to just ignore it until the next day and I would call animal control to deal with it. Not only had I already gone to bed and didn't want to ruin my chance of getting enough sleep by running around and energizing myself, but I also just didn't want to risk coming into contact with a bat that could be infested with rabies (seriously, have you read about that shit? fuck that). Anyway, they spend the next hour or two jumping around with a garbage bag and trying to get the bat to fly out of the house. When they finally got the bat out of the house, they insisted that I should go fuck myself and to this day claim that I was a dick for not getting out of bed to help them.",

      "description": " \n\nFor context, it's about 60-70 degrees F outside where I live but we are having problems regulating the temperature in the house. It's a townhouse 5 stories high, of which the top three belong to us (myself and two roommates) and the lower two to neighbors.\n\nIt's hot as hell. I think what's happening is the neighbors below us have the heat cranked up and it's all going upwards into our house where the temp stays about 78 degrees + when we don't touch the thermostat. One of my roommates has no problem with the uncomfortable heat, but I think it's because he spends most of his day outside the house and is perfectly content to let us boil while he saves money. He is the only roommate with a master bedroom, so his rent is a little higher either way and he complains about his bills constantly.\n\nHis solution is for us to \"crack a window\" which is fine and dandy except that there are two cats in the house (not mine or his) that like to play with the screens so we can only barely crack them. This isn't his fault but he also knew the deal with that when he signed the lease.\n\nHe also wants to not pay the utilities while he travels for a month. Man, I sure would like to swerve the bills while I'm at my girlfriend's house half the time too but I just don't believe in dividing up the bills according to who spends time in the house because even if we are ALL gone we can't shut off the utilities and no one should have the option of leaving for a few days and screwing everyone else over with the bills.\n\nTLDR: I am running up the electricity bill to cool the house in the middle of fall when it's 65 degrees outside and my broke roommate is unwillingly going to pay for 1/3 of it.",

      "description": "So about 2 months back, I felt that I didn't want to be in a relationship anymore so I broke up with my ex. At the time we've dated for about 5-6 months (we broke up for like 1 month in this relationship but got back together). I just felt that I wasn't suited for being in a relationship and I just couldn't handle one so I chose to break up with her. Around 2 or 3 weeks before I broke up with her, she kept telling me how she wanted to break up with me for like about a week at night but she'll go back to normal in the morning but I had to spend an hour to convince her to not break up with me (she does have depression and was going through a lot in terms of how her family treats her). After how she kept trying to break up with me, I decided that I should just break up with her even though she stops telling me how she was going to break up with me. I thought about breaking up with her for 2 weeks and finally asked her to come out and I was going to break up with her but she guessed that I was going to break up with her since I was asking her to come out so I had to do it through a phone call. I've been thinking about it every day since it's not that I broke up with her because I lost feeling to her but rather I don't feel like being in a relationship and I feel very sad about breaking up with her.",

      "description": "I'm currently taking a data structures CS class in college, and we just turned in our group project for the semester. Our task was to design an \"evil hangman\" game that would covertly change the word the user was guessing every time they picked a letter so that the new word doesn't contain any of those letters. Maybe for some this would be simple, but I'm not the best at this class so it took me a long time to figure out the logic behind the game, and it wasn't fully functional until the day before it was due.\n\nThe problem is, one of my group members spent a long time designing nice-looking menus, game screens, etc. but made no effort to understand how the game actually works. She didn't attempt to understand or help with the game logic and just spent her time drawing elaborate menu screens (without considering that the rest of us were too busy doing the actual hard work to add in the bells and whistles she was building buttons for). As the deadline approached it became clear that she didn't know how to use our code to actually get her screens to draw at the right times, because she hadn't paid attention or asked any questions about what the rest of the group was doing (she did not even bother to read the code containing the actual game logic). Ultimately we tried to help her but by the time we realized the problem it was too late, so almost none of her work actually made it into the final program. \n\nI understand that she did spend as much time working on the project as everyone else, but I found it extremely annoying that she spent all of her time trying to make the game \"look pretty\" without attempting to contribute to the actual challenging parts of building the game. As a result, when evaluating the group, I reported that she had done the least work, as none of what she had done ended up helping us in any way. This will probably hurt her grade.

      "description": "A bit of a back story here. I've (18F) been depressed for a good part of my life, me and my boyfriend (22M) have been together for a year and for the most part my depression has gotten better. However as of recent it got worse again.\n\n\nSo yesterday I was home alone, I cooked, cleaned, did all of the necessary stuff. For some reason I felt really happy, knowing he was coming home and we could spend time together. Once he came home all seemed well, he noticed i was happy, we ate together and that was it. He went to game while I sat in the couch, occasionally giving a kiss but still being happy. I tried making small jokes he usually loves but he was acting rude and just ignoring me. Around 10 we decided to go up to sleep, i remember dropping something on accident. I said sorry, because it was quite loud. I remember him saying \"Why the fuck are you like this?\" that did it for me, i slammed the box of tissues I was putting away on the table and stormed to the toilet, pissed off and upset. 2 minutes later I heard him going upstairs. I hoped he would send me on messenger as I had my phone with me and so did he or he would come back down. 15 minutes passed and I decided to go lay in the couch. Waiting for something at least. He eventually decided to send saying he spend so much money on me and if that's how I repay him it's not needed. Blah blah. I explained after 15 minutes of arguing that it would be best to sleep alone. He got even madder at that and made me feel horrible. My heart was aching and I felt weak as shit. Yet he made me come up stairs, he made me ask for a hug and for comfort. I'm now wondering if it's my fault or not? AITA? ",

I have a very good paying and stable job while she is a junior in university.  I love her a lot.  She also comes from a poor and abusive family.  She has a athletic scholarship for tuition (soccer) but lives with me and relies on me for spending money and other expenses. \n\n  \nRecently we have had some problems.  The soccer team has this weird ball/formal dance with guys soccer team.  She gets matched up with a random soccer dude and they go to the dance together.  This isn't a problem but the way she described it is a problem.  She basically said it's supposed to be a crazy night and asked for a one night pass from our relationship.  I said \"no\" very firmly.  I told her it was offensive and innapropiate to even ask and I'm shocked it crossed her mind.  She got defensive and said she's still in college and all she wants is one night to go wild, but I stood my ground. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then told her I don't want her going to this ball at all, because she won't committ to me that she won't go wild after.  She said \"no, this is a important team bonding exercise\".  In response I cut off the money I gave her and informed her we won't be going on the european trip this summer.  I also said she cant live with me until we resolve this issue. She now has to live at her house with he family who is abusive verbally.  One week later she called and asked if she could move back in and have her allowance back, I asked if she was still going to the event and she said yes but she wouldn't try to have sex or anything that night.  I said I would think about it.  My friends say I'm being a manipulative ass whos taking advantage of a pretty college girl with no money.  AITA reddit?",

She has a website and Instagram where the photos are posted. These shoots are more focused on body positivity, not like a porno shoot. \n\nAt the cabin, all the girls talked about going out into the woods and doing a nude photo shoot. Totally cool! I’m all about my girlfriends body positivity. They went on their shoot and it was fun for them. I talked to my fiancé and it sounds like P is going to post the pictures, and she’s comfortable with that. I am not. I voiced that opinion to my fiancé but she says that it doesn’t matter. P says her website (with the fully uncensored pics) is private and you need the link to get to it. This was a lie because her instagram is public, 2,000 followers, and the link to the website is in the bio.\n\nI fully support my girlfriends body positivity but I am not comfortable with thousands of people seeing her nude. Now she is upset with me because I pointed this out. Am I the asshole for not wanting her nudes posted? ",

      "description": "A bit of context might help here. I have a best friend that I've known since 7th grade (we are both about to turn 21 in February.). His parents have always been really stingy about letting him go out and do things. They never wanted to bring him anywhere, and if my mom picked us up and brought us out he wasn't allowed to go further than 15 mins away from his house. He also had these crazy time restrictions, for example, if we went to see a movie that was usually ALL we had time to do, even if we left out midday and the movie was over by 3. This all sucked, but luckily my mom was extremely patient and put up with the restrictions so I could spend time with my best friend outside of school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today and things have gotten better, but not by much (keep in mind we are about to be 21 in college now). He doesn't have a car, but he does have his license. However, they never let him use their cars even though one of his parents works from home, so the car just sits in the driveway. They tell him he needs to have a job whenever he is in town from college (he goes out of state in St. Louis) or else he's \"being lazy\". The crazy thing is they expect him to find his own rides to and from work everyday. This leads to him usually working with one of his friends and they act as his ride for the break. If he wants to go out, we have to be his ride and he usually has to be home around 10-12 depending on their mood. This was extremely annoying given the fact they never even offer gas money or offer to at least drop him off and let one of us take him back home.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe finally got his own car in September. He's coming down for winter break in December, but his parents just informed him they don't want him bringing his car. Their reasoning was that they are looking to get new cars for themselves and that if anything happened to his car, they wouldn't have the money to replace it. After I heard this I got upset, but kept it to myself because I don't really see what he can do about it. Anyways, AITA for not wanting to be his ride anymore? He's a great friend who hasn't really done anything wrong in this situation, but it's so annoying to deal with these restrictions at damn near 21 years old. ",

I'm the only person on the lease and I've paid for about 80 % of the furniture in the apartment. Before moving in me and my roommates decided on bedrooms during which both me and my newest roommate A (who I don't know very well) wanted room 2. We decided that I should have room 2 and A got room 3. But now on the move in day it turns out room 2 is the smallest room of them all (it's a big difference) so I decided to change to room 3. A was not present and no fourniture had been moved in yet. I didn't think it would be a big deal since she previously wanted room 2. A got really upset, way more then I would have expected from anyone in this situation. It really felt like a kids tantrum. \n\nI know it was kind of shitty for me to change rooms against her wishes but it's my apartment, I pay for all of our home insurance and I've paid for most of the furniture (and our other roomate has paid for the rest). There's no way A would have been able to get this kind of apartment on her own in my city. AITA for changing rooms against her wishes? ",

      "description": "I was dining at an upscale restaurant and the bill came out to $49.82. I pulled out a $50 to pay, and told the waitress I didn't need change. Goes without saying, but I was planning on leaving the rest of her tip on the table. I used to work as a server. I always tip generously. \n\nThe waitress misunderstood my intentions and said \"Really?\" loud enough for all the other diners to hear. Before I could say anything, she said something like \"Woooow- thanks for the generous tip\", snatched the payment from the table, and walked away in a huff. All the diners around me were staring daggers at me. It was humiliating. \n\nI flagged down the manager and let him know what happened. He knows me and knows I'd never stiff servers. \n\nHe offered to comp the meal, but I said it wasn't necessary. I just wanted to let him know what happened and would be on my way. The manager insisted that I was owed an apology. Made sense to me at the time. She apologizes, gets her tip, I leave, everyone is happy. \n\nWhen the manager called the waitress over, both of us saw her roll her eyes as she was walking here. As soon as the manager saw this, he put on his \"you're about to get fired\" face. All the tears and pleading made no difference. It was ugly. People were filming with their cell phones. \n\nAs she was being escorted to the back by some kitchen workers (who probably think I'm the second coming of Satan). The manager insisted on comping our meal and we went on our way. \n\nWhen we got home, the wife claimed I was an asshole for making a huge scene out of nothing, and getting that poor girl fired over a simple misunderstanding. I feel like all I did was share a legitimate complaint to the manager. She is the one who escalated it by rolling her eyes at us. Am I being unreasonable? What would you have done in this situation?

      "description": "Context - Today is my 7 year old step daughter's birthday. She has been counting down the days, extremely excited to share cupcakes with her friends in school. \n\nI have had a sporadic sleep schedule the past few weeks. Unfortunately, some of those long nights resulted in me sleeping through the alarm to take her to school. \n\nLast night, her mother was coughing a lot. Not like the sick barky cough, more like the tickle-in-your-throat cough. I asked if she's okay, to which she said \"no,\" but she literally says that any time I ask. She kept coughing like that until she threw up a little bit. She and I laughed about it and went back to trying to get some sleep. Her coughing continues for about another hour or 2 until she throws up again, but more. I went into the bathroom to ask again if she's okay and hold her hair and rub her back if she wanted me to. I also brought in a water bottle for her. I didn't hold her hair because she already had a hair tie in, but I still rubbed her back and asked her if she needed anything. She ignored me. I waited a bit, giving her extra time knowing that she's not feeling well, but she just completely ignored me. I had to wake up in about 4 hours to take our daughter to school, so I took about 1mg of melatonin. She saw me do it, and she insisted that I was being so rude trying to knock myself out to sleep through her throwing up. She was done throwing up before I took it, but literally any explanation I've made she writes off as excuses and just defending myself. As I'm writing this, she texted me asking why she even bothers trying work on things with me and that she wants to break up. I apologized for using the wrong words to explain myself and said I only had our daughter's wishes in mind. She threw her phone at the door and told me to get out. ",

      "description": "My friend just sent me a long message about how I treat her badly, and she deserves better, and told me to « grow up »... I’m a little like, wtf? I hurt my back badly recently and wasn’t able to walk, i was very afraid (I am doing better now!) My friend tried her best to be consoling. She lives far away, we talk everyday in messenger and everything she was saying to me just made me feel worse so I decided to just give myself some space from her. I told her later how it felt and she was hurt that she didn’t make me feel better and that I took it all the wrong way. I want to also explain she’s been asking everyone if she is « emotionally intelligent » so instead of my usual quiet self I have been answering her probing questions of self reflection. Yesterday I shared with her how I was worried about working out but wanted to, and she flat out said « wow that’s dramatic. » I thought that was annoying, as she talks about working out everyday and how insecure she is about her body. So I told her I thought that was an insensitive thing to say she asked me if I was mad I said, « a little bit, I’m not mad really I just don’t want to talk right now. » she has been injured like 10 times since I’ve known her, it’s scary being hurt or sick and I feel like I have been there for her. This is the first time I have been the vulnerable one, I don’t need anything from her exactly, but today after not talking to her for like maybe 18 hours (during which I saw my physical therapist) she sends me these angry messages telling me I am a terrible friend for being offended by her efforts to cheer me up, and is mad I haven’t visited her in LA??? She is treating me like I am her boyfriend and she is a princess, calling me selfish when literally all I am trying to do is take care of myself ! She said I have always randomly ignored her, and I responded by saying usually when she hurts my feelings I tend to just give us some space. She’s also a hypochondriac and so she freaks out pretty much daily that she is sick, I always rationalize with her, and I thought that when I was hurt it just wasn’t something she could handle because of her fears of illness and injury but now I’m thinking she just always has to be the victim and the baby and I always have to be the valiant super friend taking care of her. I hope she reads this because I’m honestly baffled, friends don’t DEMAND friends to come visit them even when I can’t afford it, or demand them to not feel hurt... I feel like she is crossing some boundaries with me, my understanding of friendship is more supportive and less based on these rules she seems to be making up on the spot right now. AITA because I decided to talk to her less and can’t visit her in LA? Or am i just an introvert and she is an extrovert?  I think I have replaced her boyfriend honestly because she even sends me selfies of her in her underwear and I am always like « why? »",

(The old roommate threatened to burn the place down and a lot of drama happened between them. They were both in the wrong though.) Shortly after I moved in my roommates little sister (18F) started staying with us and eventually moved in too. She does nothing to help. And our lease states that there can only be two occupants living here although the landlord hasn’t noticed bc the little sister doesn’t drive. I don’t care that she’s living with us but she plays a part in a lot of this. \n\nThere’s also been an unspoken rule that you clean up after yourself. This is where I’ve had the most problem. Things were fine up until I started dating my boyfriend 4 months ago and left the job that my roommate and I worked at. She’s a messier person than I am but has a “holier than thou” attitude when it comes to cleaning and it’s only gotten worse. I’m talking literal shit covering the toilet after almost every use, a shower that had never been cleaned before I moved in, and the kitchen is always in a state. IE the trash can is overflowing after a day, counters are dirty, and the fridge has food rotting in there for weeks and even months at a time. I’ve been cleaning it all up until about 3 weeks ago. I don’t ask her for anything in return and honestly have given up even trying to talk to her bc she just ignores me when I try. Today I overheard her bitching about the trash not being taken out and also stating that she’s “tired of having to clean up after everybody”. \nTo keep this shorter I’m going to say that I clean up after myself and leave any mess that they make for them (minus the toilet bc that’s just disgusting). We don’t talk to each other and she leaves passive aggressive notes for me. I have 4 months left in my lease so I’m just trying to keep my head down and get out as soon as I can (I stay in my room for the most part.) AITA?",

Anyhow she walked away in huff and I got a complaint filed against me, and she actually told my supervisor that I was mentally \"slow\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just wondering if I\"m the asshole in this situation, cause its my second write up in 2 days, 3 weeks in my new job. The first time was when a woman told me to check out her items, I told her I wasn't a cashier and wasn't authorized but I could find one for her. I actually got in trouble for this because even though I brought her a cashier she filed a complaint against her for not helping her in a timely fashion? I'm on a roll guys, and I need to know if i'm an asshole.Thanks!",

      "description": "Background: I'm an only child and I have been homeschooled my entire life.   Because of this, we spend a lot of time together (more time than most families), and are very close.  I know this sounds crazy, but I probably consider my father to be my best friend. \n\nProblem: Recently, as my moving out and going to college grows immanent, my parents have become extremely clingy.  They want to spend more and more time with me, since I'm leaving soon.  Soon being, by the way, a year and a half from now.  At first, I wasn't bothered.  I love my life at home, and I'm happy to spend lots of time doing things with my parents.  Recently, it started getting kind of out of hand.  I recently applied for a highly selective five week summer camp, and my father tried to talk me out of it, because it meant being away from home.  He constantly criticizes my going, and won't hear a good word about it (such as that it's the first opportunity I've ever come across to experience my greatest interest: astrophysics).  All this still wouldn't be a problem, except that my mother and I have always had a kind of shaky relationship, in that she isn't good at expressing her happiness with others.  That often leads me to think she doesn't enjoy my company, and makes me not want to experience hers.  My dad recently told me that she was crying at night because I'm leaving so soon (again, one and a half years, normal time for a kid to leave and attend college).  \n\nProblem diluted: Now I'm finding it difficult to live my life the way I want to.  My parents constantly make me feel guilty about spending any amount of time away from home (the five week camp is a crazy example, most things are just day activities or weekends).   I already spend far more time at home than anyone else I know, and am in fact often called a homebody.  \n\nConclusion: So tell me, AITA for not wanting to spend as much time with my parents as they want?",

      "description": "Alright, I'll be honest here: I am a young teenager, which is the main reason I'm in this situation, because I don't get to choose where I am, but I want to hear others' opinions about this. \n\nLittle backstory: my mom and dad are seperated, and my mom lives in [Place] and my dad lives in [Place.] I live with my dad and stepmom and I have an older brother who lives with our mom. We try to keep a consistent schedule by swapping every other weekend so I see my mom. \n\nMy dad and stepmom are in a middle-class community and my stepmom hates smoking, while my dad used to smoke but recently quit. They both have extremely well-paying jobs and hold themselves together very well. \n\nMay I mention, my dad, when smoking, was extremely cautious about the wind and his smoke etc., and making sure that nobody around him had to inhale his cigarette; he smoked outside, as well. He also rarely ever smoked in the car with me and often would just wait until we got to a rest-stop or something so he could exit the car. \n\nMy mom, meanwhile, lives in more of a lower-class community and has more of a low-paying job where she works about 10+ hours a day (overtime to make more, she says.) She purchases cigarettes on a daily basis and smokes them with me in the car and in her house. Now, this, I think, wouldn't be too much of a problem if she didn't A) chainsmoke and B) have multiple people over at once smoking constantly. She also has a boyfriend who chainsmokes in the car and house. \n\nExcuse me for possibly sounding \"fake,\" but my lungs are really sensitive. Two examples: Last schoolyear, I joined the track team and did short-sprints. Often, when returning from a weekend at my mom's, I would stuggle to run as much because I was coughing a lot. The same happened when I played my instrument in band class. \n\nPresently, this is the loop: I go to my mom's house every weekend, she and her bf smoke like their lives depend on it, and I inhale and cough a lot. My coughing gets worse the longer I'm at her house, as expected, and I really dislike coming to her place during holidays because I cough so much and smell like smoke. \n\nI've tried complaining to her for years now, so have my dad and stepmom, that she should stop smoking indoors and in the car when I'm with her. She says that \"it's too cold outside\" and that she's \"sorry,\" but never fixes the problem. Her bf makes snide remarks about how I should get over it. (Ex: I was supposed to be picked up by my dad in a few hours, and I was coughing a lot. My mom yelled, \"What's wrong?\" from the other room, and sarcastically, I yelled back \"I'm inhaling smoke, what do you think's wrong?\" Her bf then asked her what day it was, she said [day that my dad is getting me] and he VERY sarcastically said \"Don't worry, your dad will be here soon.\" Which honestly feels like a lame excuse to smoke around a kid who's not yours.)\n\nIt seems like the issue never ends, and there's more personal problems than meets the eye that also continue with my mom and I, but this is just one of many that I'm beginning to get tired of. \n\nWould I be reasonable if I tried to confront her, officially, to stop smoking when I'm around, or would I be an asshole because it's her stress relief from 10+ hour shifts? \n\nTL; DR - My mom smokes indoors and in the car when I'm at her place, which makes me cough consistently. I'm especially not used to it because my dad, who I live with, doesn't smoke at all. ",

      "description": "This is gonna take some background, but I'll try to be brief. Also, I'm on mobile, so sorry if the format is bad.\n\nMy parents are divorced, and my dad married my stepmom when I was in 5th grade. In the early years of their marriage, she was very emotionally abusive. She'd insult me and yell at me over little things, mostly about cleaning. She had a lot of issues and took them out on my sister and I until about my Freshman year of High school, but has slowly been getting better over the years. However, I always have this underlying fear that she'll revert back to the way she was before. On the other hand, my dad and stepmom currently have a great marriage, despite the hiccups. My dad, up until this point, had the impression that my stepmom and I were great pals. She'd taken me coming out very well, and she supported me in all my hobbies, etc. I don't hate her by any means, but she just makes me uncomfortable.\n\nA week ago, my stepmom left for a few days to visit her son in Colorado, so my dad and I were by ourselves. We went to a nice restaurant, and my dad decides to start asking me some really personal questions. Eventually, he asks why I'm going to the community college in the city where my mom lives, rather than the one closer to his house. There's a lot of reasons, but the biggest one is my stepmom. At first, I lie and say that it's that I'm not as independent as i would like to be. But that makes me feel immensely guilty, (especially since my dad tried to fix the made up problem) so I told him the truth.\n\nMy dad then spent the next hour (I checked, it was a full hour and then some) telling me what I said was unfair, that I fought back against my stepmom, and also \"subtly\" insulting my mother. He also said he wished I had said something sooner (I had, but nothing got solved) but also that he \"could have gone the rest of [his] life without knowing that.\" I kept telling him I never planned to tell him, but that didn't really help.\n\nIt's been a week, and things are pretty much back to \"normal\" around the house, but I'm still peeved about it. AITA for telling him?",

      "description": "So about a year ago, I learned someone within my friend group (not necessarily someone I liked all that much but I tolerated him because I liked the other people in the group) had an abusive relationship with a girl I knew, both sexually and emotionally, and it really messed her up, as well as another friend who was (at the time) best friends with the two of them. When I learned about this, I was pretty disgusted (specifically on some of the sexual stuff). The aforementioned friend group consisted of mostly girls, and this guy (from now I'll refer to him at R) had done some pretty *jokingly* (as they perceived it) sexual stuff to the girls in the group, stuff that was really creepy but they just sort of laughed at it. Knowing R's history with girls, I wanted to warn them to take that sort of stuff seriously and really not let him get away with that behavior. I told them about R's history with the other girl (which I now regret ever mentioning her, should never have brought her into it and just made it worse for her), and they seemed to really start to bear down on the behavior more, but they continued to be friends with him (I sort of hung out with him occasionally too, but only because of mutual friends and I tried to avoid him as much as possible).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while, I cut off that group of people for various reasons (partly because they wouldn't stop being friends with R, but also, long story short, they weren't very good friends). I still saw them around school and hung out with them occasionally because, while they weren't good friends, I still cared about them and enjoyed their company. Recently, however, I've gotten nothing but dirty looks and passive aggressive conversation from the group, along with them claiming that the stuff that happened between R and the original girl never happened. This has, by extension, made a lot of other people I know start to dislike me, and I'm not exactly sure why. Am I the asshole for bringing up the topic to the group in the first place? They still hang out with him, and whenever I did still occasionally talk to them, they didn't speak about him fondly, but now all of a sudden they seem to completely side with him and a lot of my old friends don't like me anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI probably left stuff out, and of course there are some other things going on but nothing that I could think is significant. I really just want some form of outside view on how I handled the situation, however critical it may be.",

      "description": "So the people involved are me [26F], my recent ex-bf \"Matt\" [26M] and my new gf \"Stella\" [25F].\n\nMatt and I dated for two years, during which time we had several threesomes with female friends and women we connected with on Tinder. I am bisexual so this was great for both of us, and it didn't bother me too much that he wasn't open to an MMF because he's straight and I respect not wanting to, even if I never would have had him do anything directly with the other guy. But that is neither here nor there. We dated, we had threeways semi-frequently, and we eventually broke up about two months ago due to a number of reasons, but the main thing was differing values. One big thing is that he didn't like me participating in LGBT stuff—going to pride, being in an LGBT meetup group, etc.—and it annoyed me that he seemed to only appreciate my bisexuality when it directly benefited him.\n\nSo we broke up two months ago. Very shortly after (to be honest it was like...a week) I met Stella, a girl we had had a threeway with, at one of my club events and we kind of hit it off. I was honestly not intending to get into another relationship so fast, but we really hit it off and I had been unhappy in my relationship with Matt for several months before we officially broke up, so I felt like I had already mourned that relationship sufficiently and didn't want to miss an opportunity just because I felt it might be \"too soon.\"\n\nMatt and I share a friend group so we haven't cut contact. We don't hang out one on one, but since it was a fairly amicable breakup we've just been a little distant but cordial. I have not brought Stella around to hang out with any mutual friends yet, but word has gotten back to Matt that we are dating. He is actually really upset about it and told our friends that we had had a threeway with Stella before. He has been sending me instagram messages basically saying \"not cool\" and that I should have known Stella and any other 3way girl was off limits for either of us, and accused me of cheating while we were dating.\n\nI think I should be able to date whoever I want, but I'm worried I might be TA because of the timing of it.",

      "description": "So about 3-4 months ago, I made a post in r/SquaredCircle of a link to an article discussing wrestling. A lot of the members immediately commented on the post and started shitting all over it just because it was an article from Ringside News. The began to downvote every comment I made and I literally lost 100 karma on one post. \n\nSo, a couple weeks later I used an alt and posted an article from Ringside News (commonly referred to as RSN on r/SquaredCircle.) Again, they eviscerated my account just for posting an article from RSN. This gave me a sick idea. \n\nOne user in particular, u/JT_Diamond, made it his personal mission to destroy the RSN website. He actually drew the conclusion that accounts were coming here to AITA to “amass karma” before heading over to r/SquaredCircle to post but he didn’t realize that the spam filter restricted a new account from posting for 48 hours, not based on the amount of karma said account had. He’s a moron but he made the trolling much more worth it. \n\nI began to create multiple alts and randomly post RSN articles. Most of the time they began to eviscerate them, no matter if the article was genuine or not. So over the last couple of weeks, I’ve used multiple VPNs to circumvent IP bans and bypass spam filters to constantly flood them with posts. Today alone, I managed to post more than 30 articles, to which now they have increased their spam filter to avoid these posts. Now, you’re probably thinking that I couldn’t have possibly done that because Reddit applies spam filters to accounts first, then IP addresses. The truth is, I created over 30 alts and used multiple VPN services to spoof my IP address. \n\nAm I the asshole? Maybe it’s easy to say yes, but I was just a Reddit user trying to create conversation and I was annihilated for it, so I took action the only way I know how.   \n\n",

      "description": "I love her to death and this is my ONLY qualm with her, which is amazing, but my wife (let's call her GD) is the messiest person I've known (her car looks like cookie monster hangs out in there, I'm not joking). B/c we suck at it we have a cleaning lady who comes every two weeks, the house stays clean for about 2 days before it's destroyed again. Then the night before the she is due back GD wants us to stay up late to clean the house before it's cleaned (cleaning lady does deeper cleaning, not tidy our tedious messes).\n\nAfter doing this about 20x, talking about it and not seeing any improvement in the trend, and some changing circumstances (GD is going to quit her job to dive full time into her own biz, which is cookie decorating and doesn't help with the mess) I told her I wanted to stop having someone clean our house. Understandably she was against it but given the info at hand I still felt like we were throwing money down the drain and creating a bigger headache for ourselves by having to stay up hours on end on a work night trying to tidy up for it to be respectable enough for it to be cleaned well. It feels like one of the most futile tasks ever and costs us about $250 a month or so.\n\nLately I haven't helped much the night before. I stopped for a multitude of reasons such as I typically work out at night b/c our kids go to bed late (her request), the money doesn't appear to be well spent imo, we don't keep it clean, it's legitimately mostly her mess, etc.  It's caused a few spats, never serious b/c really it's not that big of a deal, but I still wanted to get some input here. Am I the asshole for 1.) wanting to get rid of the cleaning lady since it feels like a waste, and 2.) since she put her foot down on that not helping out each week prior to the cleaning lady coming leaving her to spend a few hours picking up (her own messes, mostly)?\n\nLastly, just for more context, in our time together I am the one who cooks, does dishes and laundry, puts away our kids laundry and my own (while hers sits around in piles for weeks), sweeps the house every other day, and I'm pretty damn good at picking up my mess as I go. Right now I GUARANTEE there are no less than 8 diet coke cans (all about half full) on her nightstand.\n\nTL;DR - my wife is incredibly messy, we have a cleaning lady but it's a waste, I want to stop paying someone to clean our house and she said no, so I no longer help out each time prior to the cleaning lady coming b/c it's a hassle and we're already incredibly busy plus it's mostly her mess as I clean as I go\n\nThanks all!",

      "description": "So don’t get me wrong, I love my gf and all that good stuff but this is something that’s been going on for about 2 years now.\n\nWhen we first started dating I was spending a lot of time with her friends and this is when I first started noticing. Someone could say something funny, someone will follow it up with a witty comeback, &amp; we all burst into laughter. Then my gf will toss in a joke that completely kills all the laughter. And not the “so bad that it’s funny” kind of joke, but the “how did you think that’d even contribute to the laughter?” kind. For example, say that we’re all in the dorm kitchen making fajitas or something:\n\nPerson 1: I swear the minute I even think I smell something burning I’m going to McDonalds\n\nPerson 2: I spent $50 on these ingredients so you better McFuckouttahere and eat this.\n\n*we all chuckle*\n\nGF: Were you really gonna choose a quarter pounder over these fajitas man come on haha \n\nAnd the thing is that while most people would cringe at no one laughing at their joke, it doesn’t affect her whatsoever &amp; she’ll be ready to deliver a new one within a few minutes. Like I said, I still love her &amp; this is in no way detrimental to our relationship or anything. And also she actually is really down to earth &amp; interesting to talk to, she just sucks at comedy. A real life example is the first time she met my parents. On our way down we passed through a small town with a funny name (let’s just say Flippybay) &amp; chuckled about it for like 15 seconds before moving on to something else. 7 hours later we get to my house, parents are super excited to see us, they ask how the trip was &amp; the first thing she ever says to my parents is “Would’ve been cooler if we didn’t have to go through Flippybay haha.” They obviously have no idea what she’s talking about but laugh anyway. I just silently cringe to myself &amp; go on with the night.\n\nSo anyway, I haven’t really said anything about this to her yet because she isn’t doing any harm &amp; as far she’s concerned she’s just being fun. The only reason I’m concerned is because I don’t want her to embarrass herself &amp; I’d hate for someone else to tell her before I do. Also, having to laugh with her and/or contribute to her joke for the sake of her saving face is getting kinda old.",

      "description": "Okay for a little context, I've been in a relationship with \"Ren\" for about 10 months now. I wouldn't say it's a loving relationship because I'm practically the only one trying at this point.\n\nHe's a gamer bi dude that's still in the closet with his family.\n\nNow in the beginning he was really sweet, he would move his best friend of 7+ years just so I could sit next to him. He would wait for me outside of my class when they ended. He would text me asking where I was when I was late.\n\nBut that lasted about a good month and then stopped. But the thing is, over time I've come to actually love Ren despite that.\n\nRecently though, he would have times off weeks or multiple days at a time and as an outgoing guy I like eating out and watching movies and maybe the occasional park. He doesn't tell me anywhere he'd like to go so I bring him to places I like, maybe enabling him to develop his own opinion. But nada. \n\nIn 10 months we've gone on 4 dates alone together. 4. Every other time I would join him in his DND campaigns or get blown off. 20 times I've been blown off and by now I've gotten pissed at him. \n\nHe would say he's busy but then I hear from his friend that they met up two days in a row. Honestly I'm glad he's spending time with them, but it feels like he'd rather spend his time with literally anyone else. \n\nI try to offer to spend time with him at home if he doesn't want to go out but still.. nada. I get that he's still in the closet so I'm not just gonna go up and grab his ass whenever, so like???\n\nI threatened a break up with him he doesn't change this and I feel kind of an ass? Is my psyche just being over self critical again or does/do it/I have a point?\n",

      "description": "First post, might get a little longer (sorry), tl;dr at the end.\n\nThis happened yesterday and I am really stressed out by it, I will discuss it with my friends but I guess I'd like to have some opinions from uninvolved people first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory first:\n\nYesterday was the funeral of the grandmother of a friend of mine. She hated her because her whole life, the grandma was rude and mean to her, she was a real bitch. So my friend wasn't sad but still stressed cause the whole situation was confusing, obviously.\n\nI offered for her to come over to my place after the funeral, I have the nicest and cuddliest cats living with me to give comfort and would have cooked for her. These were the original plans for yesterday (Friday).\n\nThe other part of the backstory is that I've started dating a guy living 1.5 hrs away from me (I will call him date). It's not that much but we kind of rely on seeing each other on weekends because we both work. It's no big deal but as it's still fresh and we like each other a lot (I've never been with a sweeter and kinder human being) we kind of want to see each other once a week. \n\nIn my mind it would have worked out to have my friend over, be there for her and then meeting date around 9, maybe even have a drink all together (my friends haven't met him yet).\n\nNow, I realized in advance that this arrangement might contain potential conflict and actually felt a little bit like a snitch for absolutely wanting to see date (I have seen him last weekend and will see him next), but I also had a bad week (toothache since Monday turning me into a cranky baby, long days at work for parent meetings-I'm a teacher-other work that needed to be finished) and really just wanted the calming presence of date.\n\nYesterday morning, friend texted me very happily her results of her bachelor exam which were absolutely great, so she said she feels very happy and confident now and wanted to go drinking in the evening. so we agreed to go to a bar. I also let her know that I won't be staying late and as well as won't be drinking a lot because of my mofos of teeth and that date will be there too.\n\nIn advance, I didn't want to pressure her into giving me exact info about when (or if) she would come to me, I just let her know that she can text me once the gathering after the funeral is over and tell me what she wants to do. This also meant that I just organized my day as if I didn't have any plans because there was a lot to be finished. I still had to submit something to a prof of mine (I am also at uni) and Friday is cleaning day. I actually wanted to go to the gym but in the end I didn't have time anymore and skipped that.\n\nAt 6pm friend wrote in a group chat that she's heading home now and will be ready for us to come over if we wanted before going to the bar to celebrate her bachelor. At this time I was home, cutting fruit to make juice because it started to rot and I hate throwing away food. I still needed to shower so in the end it became clear that I wouldn't make it to her before date arrived and we'd just meet in the bar (actually agreed with date that he'd come to the bar on his own and I will be with friends first).\n\nSo in the end I went to pick up date at the station and it was nice to see him, I was happy, we were at the bar first and had good talks.\n\nEntry friends (original friend and other friend, they had gotten really close in the last few months): they were both looking super nice (I didn't dress up or put on make up at all; I am including this to say that from the first second on it was like two groups - party mode and casually sipping a drink mode), came to our place and said hi. \n\nNow a lot of stuff happened between the lines but I felt like they were subtly aggressive towards date or basically the two of us, made stupid remarks about us dating (we never make out in public and opened up the conversation as soon as they arrived so us being in \"date mode\" shouldn't have been an issue).\n\nSome examples:\n\n* leaving us going to talk to another guy, coming back telling us \"X said he'll be coming to crash your date soon\"\n* said guy would later walk past me and elbow me in the ribs - coincidence?\n* making fun of me because I told them I saved two chairs next to us (they were standing a little awkwardly behind us).\n* just being hyped up and saying weird, uncomfortable things\n\nWhen they left to smoke a cigarette, date asked why they didn't like him, that he doesn't understand what's wrong, which broke my heart and as I felt really shitty too I decided to leave. I asked him if this was ok, he didn't want to take me away from my friends but I made clear that I didn't want to be with them at the moment because they (in my view) were assholes, so we said goodbye, they reacted, what a surprise, with a snappy look, and we left.\n\nWe later went to another bar and I started crying because I was so stressed out, I felt responsible for this whole shit. Then later back home I cried again when I told my flatmate and today I had a near panic attack because I was scared he might leave me. I know this is stupid and I don't really think he would but I really like him and I think this could be a longterm thing so I want my friends to get along with him and I want him to feel welcome. \n\nTo be clear: \n\nI think the shitty part on my side was double booking my evening. \n\nI don't feel especially bad for only being ready at 9 for I don't see the point of waiting around a whole day to be ready when someone else is.\n\nI feel bad for telling my friend I'd be there and then not be there for her.\n\nI will talk to both of them, that's why I wrote down all of this, to get some different perspectives on what happened and to better plan what I'm gonna say/to prepare myself mentally.\n\nI hope this doesn't come off as validation seeking for it's not meant to be and I am sure that some of you will think IATA.\n\nAm I?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Told a friend I'd be there for her in a difficult situation, ended up only seeing her in a bar with other friends and my date, they were hostile towards me and date so we fled the scene early.",

      "description": "So let me explain, as I am genuinely concerned that I messed up somehow. \n\nSo in my business class, I sit next to a guy named (let’s call him Ken). Ken and I have never really talked; he is really quiet and likes to keep to himself. I’ve made a joke here and there throughout the year, but it’s never gone past that, until today. \n\nThere’s been a bad bug going around my town, and it seems everyone’s been fighting something at some point. I myself caught the bug, and have had a stuffy nose for the past few days. To help combat this, I always carry some pocket tissues in case I ever get stuck. \n\nNow today, it became very obvious that Ken is feeling under the weather, because he began sniffing with great effort very frequently. It didn’t really bother me much at first, but in the span of 5 minutes it got drastically worse. (Now I really try not to mind other people’s business, but he was making such a scene it was hard not to notice). He began taking several lengthy and noisy breaths in, and eventually began blowing into his index finger as if it were a tissue, only to wipe whatever came out onto his pant leg. \n\nWe sit far back enough in the room that our professor can’t quite see what the commotion is, besides just a muffled sniffle, and the students in front of us rolled their eyes at each other. \n\nIt was at this point that I reached into my bag and handed Ken my last pack of tissues. I pushed it over to him and asked if he wanted to borrow mine. Immediately, his face got beet red,  reluctantly took the tissues, and stifled a thank you. The rest of class went on about the same, accept he blew into the tissues.\n\nAfter class, I began packing up my things, and Ken approached me, saying how he was really embarrassed that I called him out on his gross behavior. I was taken aback, as I thought I was just giving a kind gesture, and tried to explain how I was just trying to help. Ken explained that he now believed everyone else around us knows that he is a “gross individual.” Pissed off, he walked away quickly, before I could truly apologize. I looked over, and saw the two students in front of us giving me a harsh look. One of them spoke up, saying they also thought it was rude to offer him a tissue. Now I’m concerned that I made a bad move, and really embarrassed Ken beyond apology. \n\nSo reddit,  AITA?",

      "description": "Cast\nMe : Me \nB : Friend/Braggart\n\nOkay so this happened today and people think I am the asshole. Quick note, I am a thirteen year old boy and in my school we always cuss a lot. But when we say it its actually not that harsh. For example : Sial, Bangang and more (I’ll translate in English)\n\nTo the story\n\nSo B came to our class because we are the only 2 class (My class and another) who taught in English for Math and Science. The rest are taught in my native language. B was actually pretty cool. He was so fat that everybody thought he was cute including me(not gay). \n\nSo during our Math period, I liked to do tasks that teachers wont tell us to do. This is because I was taught way earlier in middle school. (We start high school at 13 yo). I loved Math and my teacher didn’t care but was confused at first. And then B came in. Mind you we were facing face to face so I had to see his face every time he’s being a braggart. During Math, he always calls me out saying\n\nB - Dave, (not my real name) what are you doing?Teacher didn’t tell you to do that one\n\nMe - Yeah, I know but I learnt this during middle school\n\nB - Stupid / Bodoh (if you translate in eng its weird)\n\nNext time during Math period B told me he was inspired to do like me during Math period\n\nB - Dave, I’m going to do my school work just like you. \n\nMe - No, you should probably learn it first before you do it. I’ve learnt square root during middle school. \n\nB brushes it off\n\nAnd then B got confused, he asked teacher. Teacher told him not to do it and why would he do it\n\nB. WAS. FURIOUS \n\nB - Dave, what the fuck why did you make me do that\n\nMe - Why me? You were the one who wanted to do it just like me. I even told you to not do it yet if you haven’t learnt it!\n\nAnd here comes today, today is our test week so we had to study everything. During recess I brought my book to the cafeteria. (They don’t let you in the class during recess) And then comes B. B also brought the same book as me. I then call up to my friend to help me study. \nThe following conversation goes\n\nMe - (skipping to 3rd paragraph) The third paragraph means everyone has— (what I’m trying to say is everyone has advantages and disadvantages in yourself that’s different)\nGets cut off\n\nB - Its not the meaning you stupid. \n\nLooking confused because the actual meaning is even though he has disadvantages, surely he has advantages of himself too. Oh boy here we go. \n\nMe - Stop being such a braggart. Is it wrong to change the sentence?!\n\nB - SINCE WHEN IM SUCH A BRAGGART\n\nB went red in his face and storms off. Everyone thinks I’m in the wrong. During class I overheard B saying Dave is so stupid\n\nMe - Like I said, is it wrong to change the sentences?\n\nAnd then we haven’t talked yet. AITA for calling my friend a braggart. \n\n\n",

      "description": "Two important notes to start with. One is that because of past problems I keep a hidden camera in my living room and I live in a single party consent state. And two is that in my living room I keep a money jar for my daughter. She decides what she wants we take a picture of that thing and tap it onto the front of the jar along with the cost of it. When ever she does chores she gets a set amount of money put in the jar as well as she gets a bit of money each week that she can use to buy snacks and stuff at school if she wants. But any money she doesn't spend on snacks go into her jar.\n\nNow to the situation;\n\nI recently started to date this guy. He seems like a decent guy. We get along and we are both in similar situations. We are both single parents. He as shared custody with his son's mom and I have shared custody with my daughters father. \n\na lot of the times when neither of us have out kids he will come over and we will drink wine, get high, and have an awesome night of sex.\n\nThere was one particular night where he came over with a small bag of coke. This isn't my thing, I will happily stick to alcohol and weed, but he really wanted to try it so I didn't care what he did.\n\nWell one day I notice that some of my daughters money seemed to be missing. My daughter just had a sleep over so I assumed he was her or one of her friends. I look at the recording and it turns out it is my piece of shit (now ex) boyfriend!\n\nI confront him and he gives the money back and then some and we break up. But I am still so pissed that he would steal for a child. Especially my kid!\n\nSo I uploaded the video of him trying coke and I send it to his HR. I stalk him on social media (I don't use any social media other than Reddit) in order to find out who his ex wife is to send her the same video so she can use it for custody if she wants. And not only do I find her but it turns out he isn't single and has actually remarried!\n\nSo I send the video to his ex wife then upload a video of us fucking and send it to his current wife apologizing for not knowing he was married.\n\nI kinda feel like I over reacted but damn it feels good!",

      "description": "My roommate and I have lived together for almost 2 years now. When we first moved in, there was a bit of a controversy over who got the bigger room. I obviously wanted the bigger room so I told her I would cover the electric bill for the extra 5 square feet of space (stupid, I know).\nThis year, I am in the apartment a lot less because I go home to visit my family more often. Our electric bill has been obnoxiously high lately for only two people living here, especially since I’m only here a few days out of the week.  She is here every day of the week and is terrible at turning off the lights or the television. I usually fall asleep before her, but when I wake up in the morning I notice that she turned on every light in the kitchen and living area including the lights being on in her bedroom. Not only is keeping the lights on all day every day a waste of money, it’s not good for the environment. I tried to be nice about it by telling her to try to be better at turning off the lights if she isn’t using them. \n\nLast year, I went grocery shopping for the apartment often, and she just constantly ate the food I would buy. I don’t have a problem sharing bread, butter, or any of the basics, but she thinks that everything is free range for her. This year I started buying less groceries because I am here less, but she still finds a way to eat all of my groceries. She makes all of my coffee k-cups and she doesn’t even finish the coffee. I don’t use anything of hers or eat any of her food (because she doesn’t buy any). On top of everything, she is the most entitled person I’ve ever met. She doesn’t have a job and treats her parents (who give her all of her money) like they’re an inconvenience to her. \n\nShe is also very messy, she will leave her stuff in the living area for days on end... from laundry and textbooks to her cats litter box (which we agreed would stay in her room). I also didn’t agree to a cat in the first place, considering I’m allergic. \n\nShe comes into my bedroom whenever she wants and who knows what she does when I’m not here. We’ve been friends for years but it’s ridiculous how little boundaries she has and how little she chips in for ANYTHING. I know I’m a pushover and should have addressed this earlier, but I just don’t want to feel like I’ll be the one in the wrong if I do. I’m just tired of being a pushover. ",

      "description": "Throwaway. TLDR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: My SO and I have been together for three years and live together with our dog. All of our couples friends have been getting engaged or married recently. Whenever someone asks us what our marriage plans are my SO is quick to say we are just happy being together and not worried about that part of the future yet. Realistically, we are nowhere near being ready to get engaged, but I think after three years it is a discussion we should start having. Normally we are very happy together. He is my best friend and I know he would no absolutely anything to keep me safe. You will not hear about any of his wonderful redeeming qualities in the rest of this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy SO rarely talks about his feelings, particularly about me, our relationship, and our future together. He does not make pans with me the way most couples seem to and, frames things as though we are complete individuals, not a couple. (For example, if he wants to get dinner with someone, he'll always say something like 'I'm going to get dinner with so-and-so tonight' and my invitation is supposedly implied, rather than ever asking/inviting me, or even using we/us instead of I/me when he makes plans.) We don't often cuddle and we aren't intimate very often. My SO's family lives fairly close so we see them often, and I feel like part of their family. However, my family lives farther away my SO is always disgruntled to spend time visiting them, (or even having dinner with them if they visit our city) and has started a fight nearly every trip we've made together. When one of my friends invites us to parties or gatherings, my SO will tell me I should bring my sister or literally anyone else as a +1 as he is fairly introverted. He says these things are because he values his free time more than anything else and does not want to have to answer to someone else's schedule.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of these things contribute to me sometimes feeling like we are just friends with occasional benefits or roommates vs a couple.  My SO will occasionally drop something hinting that he wants us to be together for a long time like, 'I'm upset when you call the dog mine, not ours, because it sounds like you don't think we'll stay together and he's basically our practice for how we'd raise a child together.\" He's been complaining about having to take care of the dog alone in the morning and wants me to wake up earlier to help so he can leave for work earlier. He already wakes up before me, showers, then gets back in bed until 15 minutes before I need to leave, and then takes the dog out after it's time for me to go. I already do all of the cleaning around our apartment, dishes, and feed/take the dog out in the afternoon and evening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, my best friend went through a break up with a long term partner and  that led me to asking my SO how he saw our future together. He got very defensive and said he doesn't like to talk about feelings. Claimed I am obsessed with religion when I asked about about us raising mixed religion children, and was adamant that I am not a minority (I am light skinned but a religious/ethnic minority) when I said passing on my heritage was important and I wanted my SO to support me in teaching my children about that heritage. When I asked what their feelings were about our future he whined that he didn't want to talk about it, didn't know what I wanted him to answer, and should not worry about our future together until we get to the point of marriage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGetting him to discuss the future is like pulling teeth, and while I am not ready to get engaged it is still something I think we need to discuss before moving the relationship forward any farther. Out of desperation I am starting to feel like the only way to make any plans or come to any conclusions is to issue an ultimatum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I do not want to get engaged or married not having a plan for things like how we'll spend holidays or raise kids. I don't want to spend my life feeling like a roommate and not a partner. WIBTA for telling my SO if they don't start pulling some weight, treating me more like a partner, and honestly discussing our futures by the time our lease ends I will move out and leave them?",

Overall she’s a good girlfriend but she’s a little controlling and really insecure. \n\nI have this friend Anna who I’ve known since high school who is a total smokeshow. We used to hookup but we stopped about 3 years ago. Lisa HATES Anna. She thinks that Anna acts inappropriately toward me and she’s not totally wrong but I think it’s unfair of Lisa to try to control my friendships. Anyway Lisa doesn’t know that Anna and I used to hookup so she shouldn’t have any reason to feel insecure. \n\nA few months ago Anna started sending me nudes over Snapchat. The first time she did it she said that she was drunk and meant to send it to someone else but I told her that I liked the picture so she started sending them to me more often. \n\nWhen she sends the nudes, I tell her that she looks sexy and sometimes I tell her what I wish I could do to her but I’ve ALWAYS made it clear that we can’t hook up because I have a girlfriend. I’ve also never sent her nudes back. \n\nI know Lisa wouldn’t be happy about this but it’s basically the same as porn so i didn’t think it was that bad. I haven’t hooked up with Anna since Lisa and I got together so I’m still being faithful. \n\nAnyway somehow Lisa found out that I’ve been sexting Anna and wants to break up with me. Idk how she found out because she won’t tell me. She says I cheated even though I explained to her that I haven’t actually done anything with Anna. \n\nLisa never told me that she thought sexting was cheating or that I wasn’t allowed to do it so I think she’s being unfair by not giving me a second chance.\n\nI know I’m not totally in the right here but I think Lisa is more wrong because she’s mad at me for something that we never decided was against the rules.  \n\nTLDR:  Girlfriend wants to break up because I sexted a friend but I didn’t think sexting was cheating.

      "description": "A friend and I have birthdays in January.  Because we're in our thirties, we have made plans to do a large, combined, party with a lot of our mutual friends.  The plan is to spend two days in an Airbnb in a mountain resort town two hours outside of our town.  Not sure if this detail is pertinent or not, but I booked and paid for the Airbnb.  The idea is to collect equal shares of the cost when we're at the house.  \n\nHere's the dilemma: I'm having doubts about going.  Here are the reasons.  \n\n1. Of the four couples whom are attending, three of them are on some type of no-alcohol program for the month of January.  One entire couple is doing a 'dry January' program wherein they don't drink alcohol for the month.  They won't make an exception for the trip.  However, come February 1st they go hard with a huge party.   Another couple is six months pregnant, and the husband is doing the same 'dry January' thing.  Finally, my birthday co-conspirator is training for a 50 mile run later in January.  He's on a strict diet and isn't consuming alcohol.  That leaves me and my wife.  Like I said, I'd have fun and enjoy myself, but this scenario has happened in the past with all of these friends just watching me drink and eat like a glutton (it's my birthday!).  It's not nearly as fun as it sounds.  Everyone usually ends up going to bed around 10:00pm.  \n2. The whole trip will be around $400-$500 for each couple.  That seems ridiculous to me for the amount of projected fun to be had.  We all live in the same town, see each other frequently, and could easily make another plan that would be less expensive, or even reschedule it to the spring or summer, which I think would be more fun.  \n3. Finally, during the trip, we would miss my daughter's choir singing the national anthem at our local hockey team.  We didn't know this until after the trip was booked.  \n\nWould I be the asshole if I cancelled the trip?  I'm going to speak with my buddy for whom this is a joint party, but I'm 95% going to cancel the trip and make other plans.  If the other couples end up going to the cabin, that's perfectly fine and I won't be bent out of shape.  They'll be able to rebook the house with one of their accounts.  It's just that I don't want to celebrate this way.  I'd rather do something else or do something low key with my kids.  I'll be turning 31, so it's not like this is a landmark or important day in any way.  My wife thinks I'll be a total asshole if I cancel this, but I don't see it at all.  ",

      "description": "AITA \n\nI'm getting married in October, and I'm trying to keep the guest list to people who are good friends and family (we're anticipating about 100-130 guests). My wedding is in London where we live (most of my side are from Florida/the States), but my fiance is from London. My dad's side of the family is considerably larger than my mom's (parents are divorced FYI, but pretty civil), and I have always been much closer to them, but I have decided to only invite my aunts and uncles and first cousins from both sides. I have invited my uncle and his family from my mother's side because I grew up having a relationship with them and always see them when I visit. My mom has one other brother who is estranged and no one speaks to (I met him one time when I was a toddler), which is fine as she is not asking him to be invited, nor would she want him there.\n\nHowever, she keeps demanding that I invite my great aunt and three of her cousins. I barely have a relationship with them. I see them once maybe every ten years, and we don't speak otherwise. I don't even know the names of some of their kids who are around my age. We're not close and never have been. I don't dislike them or anything (I don't particularly care for her aunt and one of the cousins because I find them a bit rude and weird, and one of them talked shit about me to my mom at my gran's funeral). But it's now become a huge argument between us. She's brought it up 5 times after I've repeatedly said no, and we just had a big fight about it. She thinks they might not even come, so I should just send them an invitation, but I know they have money and most are semi-retired, so I think they might. I've told her that we're only inviting my aunts, uncles, and first cousins, and I'm not inviting any of my dad's cousins or his aunts. Her argument is \"they're family and would do anything for me\". I told my mom that she was starting to make my wedding about her, and she implied that because I'm her daughter, it is a little about her.\n\nI wouldn't expect to be invited to any of her cousin's kid's major life events, and I haven't been. And when I went to California, her cousin didn't offer to let me stay at her place when she had let my mom and other sisters, which is fine, I don't really mind, but to me, that takes away from the argument of \"they would do anything for me\". Also, one of the cousins had said my older sister could stay with her in NYC and then rescinded her offer a few weeks before she was scheduled to fly there.\n\nBottom line is, I'm not, nor have I ever been close with this part of my mom's family and wouldn't really want them there, but it's starting to cause problems between my mom and me. And now I'm not sure if I should just send them an invite to ease the tension between us.\n\nAITA for not inviting them?\n\nSide note: we have a limited budget (my dad and my fiance's parents are splitting the cost)",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for cutting ties with my friend?\n\nA year back I lent some money to my friend when he was going out of town and he promised to return within few weeks. After few weeks he returned back to town, I asked him money back because I had to pay someone money. When I asked him to return my money explaining that I needed to pay someone, he replied \"I guess your text was meant for somebody else\". I didn't do anything and again stated that I badly needed it, but he said he did not have it then. Few months passed, I thought he forgot about the money. We used to hang out together but he never returned me the money back. I wanted to teach him a lesson and I thought of an idea. He had completely forgotten about my money by then. I asked him to pay my internet bills, utility bills stating that my online payment is not working. I used to return him the money back next time we met. I did it many times returning money every time except this one time. I promised to return him his money back in few weeks. But after few weeks I stopped receiving his calls, I started ignoring him and he used to call and text me daily for that money saying he has problems. I didn't care and kept ignoring. He started calling me from unknown numbers, then he texted me saying he wanted the money back. Then I replied the same thing he texted me back \"I guess your text was meant for somebody else\" and sent screenshot of his text too. Then he messaged me that we are friends from child and how could I do it? Now I have started feeling bad, since the money broke our friendship. We are no longer in contact with each other. I lost a friend because of money. And I think I should not have broken friendship for some cash. AITA for breaking my friendship for mere few bucks?",

      "description": "First time poster here, this has been on my mind for a while\n\nFor context, I (24m) am gay, and a very affectionate and open person, and I tell my friends that I love them all the time. A quick \"bye, love you\" when they have to go, or sometimes during the day if they're having a rough time. It's really normal in my friend group and I enjoy it. (we are all extremely close knit)\n\nI met this girl and she got attached to me really quickly. I didn't mind, she was fun to talk to, we had interests in common.  We became friends, and she was fitting into the group nicely, so I didn't mind giving her some emotional support and saying that I loved her in a friend sort of way (I had done this with other friends with her around, so she was aware it was a thing I did) and letting her rant to me about her difficult life (she had issues, I won't get into it because it's private but it really made me feel for her)\n\nShe ended up deciding that we were dating, and me being the clueless idiot that I am, didn't pick up on the fact that she was being too affectionate, or that the pictures she sent me showed too much cleavage. She never asked me out, I never said anything to suggest we were, but eventually she started being passive aggressive if I didn't message her first or if I wasn't paying too much attention to her.\n\nThis really annoyed me because I have other things to do than to pay attention to her, and I ignored it and just apologized but said I'm busy if she was being too pushy. I heard that she had a complete mental breakdown, and started accusing me of using her, and that I was cheating on my boyfriend with her.\n\nMy boyfriend just found it amusing, thank god, but she was very upset and made a bunch of posts on facebook calling me an asshole. I've been a lot more careful with who I show affection to now, friends or not.\n\nAITA for leading on a girl, despite being gay? ",

      "description": "For context we're all in the age range of 19 - 21. I think if we were older it wouldn't bother me as much and I'd be able to feel excited for them.\n\nIt started with with two friends of mine I met in high school getting engaged to each other at 19 and 20 almost a year ago. They were together for maybe a year and a half before the engagement. Their wedding is this summer. Of course I told them when I learned that I was very happy for them and wish them all the best, which is sort of true. I do wish them all the best and I'm very happy they found each other because they're great for each other, but it's hard to feel excited for them really since they were 19 and 20 at the time of the engagement. \n\nThen, a friend had a baby. I knew she and her boyfriend were serious. She was 20 when she had her son. The father is 21. Again, I'm happy they're so good for each other, the baby is healthy and really cute, and they seem happy, but it's still hard to feel really happy for them because that just feels too young for a kid. \n\nWhat I learned this morning made me the most uncomfortable and the worst about not really being able to feel truly happy or excited for my friends when it comes to engagement, marriage, and having kids. A friend I've known since sixth grade got engaged. She and her fiancé are both 21 and have been together for about a year if I remember correctly.\n\nI feel awful about not really being able to feel happy or excited for them, but 19 - 21 just seems too young for this stuff. I know some people start families and find \"the one\" earlier than others, but it just doesn't feel right and there's something holding me back, though I do congratulate them and act 100% supportive in person. I like all of their partners and the baby (he's approaching 10 months old now) is wonderful. \n\nBut AITA for not being able to feel excited for my friends? ",

      "description": "Right this person is my best friend (let's call her Casper) and I love her to bits but there has been a few concerns about our friendship. \n\nFor some context Casper rarely ever sees me she is always at her bfs house (who is an ass) and I usually see her like 3/4 days a month 5 if I'm lucky. Before she went with him I saw her all the time so it was a bit of a change for me rarely Getting to see her. However when I do see her it's usually past 12 and only for a few hours. I was beginning to think maybe she only used me as a company source since at that time she has to do shopping at Asda for her mom and she would also always get me to bring her fags.\n (what I would do anyway but I got a bit wary once when she took a packet of tobacco that I bought and went to her bfs. I was left with 4 fags to last me 4/5 days and then she told me her mom binned it)\n\nSo recently it was supposed to be her birthday actually Tuesday is her birthday and two days ago her mom, me, her bf and her where supposed to go together to nandos.\nOn the Thursday before the Saturday she was at my house seeing the new kitchen, Getting a few fags off of me and playing some mario kart when her mom phoned my phone and told her her bf wanted to talk to her.\n\nHere is the thing with her bf for some reason whenever she is at my house he starts and argument. Last time he made some thing up that she was cheating on him because he was on her Facebook and saw she sent her ex stepdad daughter an xx in messages. Her bf doesn't treat her nice either so I said to her why don't you tell him he has a month to buck up the way he acts or you're leaving him but don't let him know that he will still be tested for another 2 months afterwards. (This is the only thing I can think of for him to here me)\n\nWhen he phoned he shouted at her saying he was worried about her being at mine so late (didn't didn't do this another time even when she's walking about at 3am coming From asda) then he brought me into it saying that I she is always at my house and that I am a twisted fucking cow and I was leading one of my ex pals on (I was friends and he still wanted to hang I told him I wasn't interested but since I was his friend I apparently am leading him on?) He said that Casper isn't allowed to hang out with me anymore and that Casper needs to buck up her ideas and be a \"good girlfriend\" he said she is 16 and she needs to grow up and then would say she wasn't an adult because she isn't 18.\nHe finally hit out with \"its either me and your mom or (my name)\" Casper said well obvs I'm gonna pick you and my mom and gave me this look like don't worry I don't mean it so I was okay and then he also said I'm not allowed to go to her birthday meal on Saturday. \nShe motioned to me to roll her some fags and I did but I was too angry and upset to do it's right so she rolled herself some out of my baccy for going home idk how much but there was very little already in the packet so there wasn't much left. \nI was obviously in tears cause I thought Caspers mom didn't like me and that I couldn't see her again and more so because Casper was my only friend. \nThis is what I find weird Casper knew I spent alot on her for her birthday I sent about £80 on her out of my own money and I get like £60 a fortnight. She asked me if she could get all of her gifts early since she didn't know the next time she will see me, so I was like sure but it just made me more upset that I couldn't give her her gifts on a better environment so I just broke down crying she told me she'd speak to her mom and her bf when she got home.\n\nThing is she didn't message me that night, so far she hasn't messaged me at all. Yesterday I sent her a message saying I'm here for her and it's not her fault he is a dick and she responded saying thanks but she needs to go since she is at his house using his mom's laptop and Caspers mom messaged saying that Casper will message me when she gets home. I went on Facebook and saw that she did go out for that meal and Everything and she still isn't messaging me so I finally snapped and deleted Facebook off of my phone but idk what to do rn, but it makes me think of I didn't give Casper her birthday presents would she still be talking to me am I the asshole for thinking this way.",

Recently, though, I've developed a crush on her, and was wondering how to handle it. \n\nThe other night she was gonna come over to hang out, like usual. However, a week before that day, I'd had arm surgery, and for the pain the doctor gave me some painkillers. It was hurting pretty bad, so I figured before she came over I'd take a couple to be able to function better.\n\nI had never taken painkillers before, and had no idea how they affected you, but they made me not care even a little about what I was saying. Lexi comes over, and things got bad.\n\nI felt like I loved everything and had no ego, so I started telling her how much our friendship meant to me. I talked about how great of a person she was, and for some fucking reason, told her I was gay. Even though I'm not. I starting saying things like \"I wanna be your gay best friend,\" and she was like, \"I always knew you were gay. That's so awesome!\" I was braiding her hair and shit. Then she told me she had a crush on one of my friends, and this was the best news ever to me. I gave her his number and told her she should go for it. The whole night was like this.\n\nI woke up the next morning in total shame, and since it was the weekend I didn't speak to her at all. At school on Monday she comes up to me, telling me that she went on a date with my friend on sunday and it went great. Nice! kill me dude. \n\nI'm thinking of telling her what happened, and that I didn't mean it. I also want to imply that she should stop seeing this guy, and somehow wedge them apart. It's not like her life would ultimately be any different. I feel like I'm in too deep. ",

      "description": "I was dating a person for five weeks and it was going great.  There was one time where I mentioned how I thought it was odd he wanted to know all these details about me.  He was wanting to know all the details like what I ate, where I was, he would carry out a topic in great detail like what a book was about that I was reading, etc.  I enjoyed talking to him, but it made me a little uncomfortable.  So I brought it up and he was pretty direct that it's just a personality difference and that I didn't need to worry, \"it's not like I want to *be* you.\" So I passed over it.\n\nThen a couple weeks later my work was really suffering, it felt too intense, we were talking too much every day (he would do most of the initiating but I was still complicit.). So I gently said that we needed to tone things down a little, that my work was suffering, and I wanted to be able to process things better.  He said he understood but gave the impression that I meant flat out stop talking for a while, so he emphasized how much he liked me.  He even said that if I distanced myself from him that he would be very lonely.  Exact words.  \n\nI clarified for him that this need to tone stuff down wasn't a reflection of me losing interest.  He kept acting like he understood, but would say strange things like, \"if things work out without constant contact then fucking awesome and yay!\"\n\nThese things made me slightly uncomfortable, but I still had strong feelings and didn't pay great attention to it.  Even the very next morning he was wanting us to schedule our next visit a week in advance.  I noticed he wasn't responding well to my proposition but ignored it nonetheless.\n\nTill that same night....\n\nI admit, my emotions went haywire, but I started thinking about the constant contact, I started thinking about how he seemed to start acting strange/manipulative when I proposed toning things down....at this point I may have gotten paranoid and remembered manipulation elsewhere in my life history....and so I texted him asking about the way he reacted to my new boundary...I did it very gently, admitting that I could have been reading too much into it.  He seemed to avoid the topic, or not really face it.  So I gently pressed it again.\n\nHe said I was misunderstanding all of it, that he understands, that he's \"not some weak, fragile being....(he) can love but he can also cut a bitch out\" and that he doesn't build his being on me and that if others did in the past that that's not the way he is.\n\nFor some reason, he really changed in my mind after those comments, but I kept on trying to be peaceful about it.  It felt vindictive, it felt like invulnerability.  But maybe I was in the wrong to press the issue, to think it meant anything bad, maybe his anger was warranted.\n",

      "description": "So, last semester, I (17M) was in choir with a girl (16F) and she and I became good friends (or so I thought). She would always give me big hugs every time I saw her. When I told her she was super nice, she reciprocated. I was starting to have a crush on her. I asked for her number and Snap and got them both. Once, I said I’d miss her over break. She said that I could talk to her anytime, having her number, Instagram and Snapchat usernames. Fast forward to the last day of  the semester: I get a DM from one of her friends (17F)  (someone I used to be friends with as well, just kinda grew apart from them): saying “Leave (her name) alone. Completely”. I say that I will, but want to know what happened there. This is when it comes out that during the 10 minute breaks the teacher would give us during class, she would go into the ladies’ room to cry and be away from me. At this point, I was shell shocked. AITA for not understanding what happened? I’m leaning toward ESH because maybe I missed a social cue or 2, but she also could have been more straight forward with me. ",

      "description": "My girlfriend drove me and my mates to a music concert probably 2 hours away from our home town, however she brought a friend of hers who we will call “Meg”. Meg is a bit of a character, whom both me and my girlfriend agree is bitch from time to time. \n\nAfter the concert my girlfriend drove us back to our home town (2 hours away) and we went back to one of my friends places house to smoke some bongs and talk shit. (it’s 2am at this point). Me and my mates were high on mdma and were okay to talk for a few hours until we fell asleep while my girlfriend passed out asleep on the the lounge while her friend was awake. \n\nThis is where it gets interesting. \n\nIt’s around 4am now and my girlfriend is sound asleep, her friend is on her phone and me and my mates are still awake talking. I notice Meg is getting slightly agitated because she was laying down on the floor so I asked my friend if it was alright if we slept here and he didn’t care and even got a massive mattress out for Meg to sleep on. While I was cleaning the floor up to make room for the mattress Meg sits up from laying down and dead ass looks me in the eyes and SCREAMS\n“I AM NOT SLEEPING HERE!!!!”\n“I NEED A BED TO SLEEP IN!””\n\nBoth me and my mates all look at each other with WTF reactions. \n\nMy friends house is very luxurious, tidy and most importantly safe. I wouldn’t put my girlfriend in a nonsafe environment let alone her friend Meg. Clearly this girl was having a mental snap from all the weed she’s smoked or something so I quietly and calmly said\n\n“I just assumed we were sleeping here because Sarah  (my girlfriend) is passed out and has driven five hours in total for all of us already”\n\nShe just looked at me with a full resting bitch face so I said:\n\n“Look we can go but you can be the one to wake my girlfriend up and deal with her. “\n\nShe begins shaking my girlfriend to wake her up.  She wakes up and is extremely dazed and tired. She didn’t really know what was going on and just assumed we were going home so she started packing up her stuff.  I help pack up and thank him my friend letting us crash for a bit here.  \n\nMy girlfriend is deadass half high half asleep and is nearly passing out while she is driving. There was a few times where she nearly nodded off all because this girl wanted a bed and not a mattress to sleep on. \n\nWe get get home, I went to my room while my girlfriend showed Meg to her bed. I had my door open and I could hear Meg and her talking about the mental break that just went down. My girlfriend is confused by it all and doesn’t really give care and then explains that I probs assumed we were all staying at my friends house because of how late it was. Meg says that we are assholes and should have checked to see if she was fine to sleep at my mates place. My girlfriend says whatever and then comes back to my room and we bitch about it then head to bed. \n\nAm I the asshole for not asking her if she was fine to stay at my mates place even though our driver was asleep?",

      "description": "My university class and I are in our second week of clinic. On orientation week our new supervisor said we’re all just here to learn and there’s no wrong answer etc, but from the very first day of class she has been passive aggressive and makes you feel stupid when you are asking/answering questions. For example when asking a question she might pause/raise eyebrows and say what do you think. It’s making me feel like I shouldn’t talk in class anymore and same for other people in my class. \n\nToday I had class with my lecturer who is in charge of the clinic, and during the break I told her the feedback about my supervisor and that most of the people in my class felt that way, not just me. She said she had been suspecting something like that and would address it with her anonymously. \n\nBut now I feel really really guilty. I’ve never given feedback like that about someone before and I don’t think it will be nice to hear... And she said to email her if you had any feedback so should I have just talked to her directly/not at all? \n\n",

They started me qestions that were not their business . Her father left us alone in her room, with music on high volume, he called party music when that were love ballads and soundtracks like from bad romance  movies.  \n  She wouldn't talk to me, everything was akward, I had to makeup the stories to even make her speak which was hard. Then the rest of the guest artived. TURNS OUT, I WAS THE ONLY MALE, I WAS THE OLDEST . THE WORST WAS WHEN THELSE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS STARTED FLIRTING WITH ME! (WTF !). Entire  party was super akward, none of us was talking to each other unless to make joke which melted in the mist of akwardnes.  \n\n  So she invated me again. I made a bunch of lies to keep myself out of there. \n  Right know i feel bad for lying to her but i don't want to go to another akward party \n\nDid you think I did  wrong.

      "description": "Ok so a little overall context before I start the story: Everyone involved here is in their mid teens so hormones, puberty and all might play into this. I am also going to use made up names because I really dont feel comfortable with sharing our real names. English also isnt my first language so I apologize in advance if the grammar, wording or spelling gets a lil messy. Also, I am terrible at limiting myself so this might get rather lengthy. Lastly, this is a throwaway account as I felt more comfortable that way, Im new to reddit so this might be terribly formatted for all I know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it all starts out with this friend im going to call Steve (fake names as stated previously). Steve is a good friend, usually very kind and funny. He is a bit immature at times and sometimes a bit insensitive but often there is nothing wrong and hes great fun to be around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem arises when we just play a few fun games of Overwatch (feel free to roast my taste in games lmao) and he starts making passive aggressive and toxic comments and \"jokes\" to another mutual friend im going to call Jenny. It went something along the lines of her being called \"boosted\" (term meaning that you dont deserve the rank you have) and overall insulting her over her gameplay. Now Jenny gets frustrated and tells Steve to stop, that she doesnt find it funny and reminds him that hes lower ELO than her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe keeps on saying that \"its just a joke\" and repeats that like 3 times, and it overall grinds to stalemate of them both repeating their arguments with nothing really happening. Now before I continue, Steve has a tendency to get toxic and passive aggressive ingame which is something I usually brush off. This is not just Overwatch and not just with Jenny, although they are the ones who have had the most disagreements. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, Jenny ends up quitting the discord call and playing alone. I messsage Steve asking him why he didnt just stop when his joke wasnt well received. He says that \"it was just a joke\" and that he didnt mean any harm. I then message Jenny and she says that this isnt the first time hes been toxic and that she was getting really tired of it. They still get along irl but dont play together.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis might seem really minor, and it probably is, but the last few months he has been acting more and more immature and it is starting to bother me and my other friends. He always says that he doesnt mean any harm and I do believe him. He does this ingame or out of game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe does this annoying thing where he always makes dick size jokes to me (asian) and other slightly racist jokes (hes white). Its all fun and good had he been able to take it as much as he dishes it out. He cant, and gets super defensive and offended when I snap back a little. That, along with him being generally immature has led me to distance myself from him. That includes avoiding playing OW with him and not hanging out with him even close to as often as before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe recently switched schools (School system in my country has 1-9 seperately from 10-12) and he went to a different one than most of us. From what I gather he doesnt have many friends at his current school as he told me, he also told me he considers me his \"best friend\". I dont consider him my best friend tho. We still hang out every now and then but I genuinely dont find it as fun, and sometimes it is downright frustrating to be with him. He has called others selfish and egoistical for telling him that he is being immature before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe hasnt had it easy before, bullying among other things. I dont know if he is doing well mentally although ive tried to ask him when appropriate but he doesnt want to talk about it, which I respect. No one in our friend group has had it easy, mentally and we try to be as supportive and caring as possible but he doesnt want any help, and acts disrespectful towards others emotions saying they should \"get thicker skin\". It feels a lot like gaslighting (I hope I used the term correctly), especially since he belittles my complaints about his behaviour every time I bring it up. Maybe Im just oversensitive tho?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole and blowing minor things out of proportion, or is Steve just a bit of an asshole himself? Am I selfish for not wanting to be with him, although he may need the support? It really does feel like I might be overreacting but at the same time not. Im curious to see what this subreddit thinks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Friends makes rude comments and acts somewhat immature overall. I dont want any of that and try to distance myself, but at the same time, friend is likely going through a tough time and I feel like an asshole for not being there with him as much as I could. He says I am oversensitive, I think hes just being rude. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I’ve been “best friends” with a girl for a few years now. At first our relationship was fun filled and we were both there for each other in times of need. We are both diagnosed with bipolar disorder so we struggle with a lot of the same mental health issues. We’ve also both had a history of bad experiences and made bad decisions. She hasn’t kept any friends in the long term, most of her relationships have fallen out within a few months for whatever reason. \nSince we’ve been friends I’ve tried to get my life together by going to college, moving out, and holding the same job. Recently she decided to move into the same apartment complex as me and get a job at the same place as me and it’s made things less stable for me. \nShe causes a lot of drama at work and talks about my personal life to coworkers. Anytime she calls or texts there’s something going wrong or she needs me to do something for her. \nI’m really sick with something right now and she made me pick up a shift at work for her a few days ago and drive her to the emergency room yesterday for some seemingly minor pain in her back. I stayed with her all morning and afternoon while she got xrays (they didn’t show anything) and took her to get her asthma medication and pain meds before I had to go I work. By the end of the night I was completely wiped, coughing and hacking, dealing with headaches and a fever. She texted and called after work saying she needed to be with me because she felt depressed and was crying. I ignored the messages and went to bed instead of helping her. I’ve had to pick her up because she was upset or needed something so many times and it’s been draining. I deal with the same depressed moods and feelings of impulsivity but I’ve been trying really hard to stay stable and balanced and being there for her every time really compromises that. She’s gotten really angry with me in the past for not being readily available when she wanted to hang out or needed something and everything feels so over the top. I don’t know if I’m being selfish or if she’s really asking a lot. \nSo, am I the asshole for not wanting to be there for her half of the time? ",

      "description": "I am 18/F. I am about to start university abroad and my parents are paying for it. They are conservative, south Indian people who would be appalled by sex outside of marriage, queer people and anything outside the norms of the country we live in.\n\n  \n\n\nI am bisexual, I have a boyfriend who is not Indian, am sexually active with him and have used birth control. I have friends they would not approve of (but are in my opinion, excellent company and are safe to be around). They don't believe in me having privacy so I selectively delete texts my friends send me to protect their privacy when they check my phone (yes, they're still sending me abroad).\n\n  \n\n\nI am not a wild partier by any means. My relationship is quiet and peaceful, my friends are few but they're great and my grades are doing fine. They could be better, but I was in hospital for anxiety a while ago and they fell- but not too much and it's nothing I can't save. I'm not mistake-free, but at the end of the day I can comfortably say I'm responsible.\n\n  \n\n\nI know that if my parents truly knew me and my beliefs and actions, they wouldn't want to fund my education any longer. I feel guilty for letting them, like I'm cheating them and am thinking about working abroad to support myself instead of using their money (free tuition) to lessen my guilt. AITA so far? Thanks. ",

      "description": "My mom has been in Arbonne (MLM) for about 2-2 1/2 years now and I have never really been supportive of it. There have been a few times where we argue over it cause I think that she puts way too much time into it and is neglecting some of her responsibilities as a parent. I also think she is putting way too much unwarranted stress on herself and it bothers me when I hear her complain about it almost every other day like she has no control over it. She argues that long term this is going to be so good for our family. But I don't really buy it. Financially-wise, I don't believe that it has brought in any extra cash flow that made a difference. We are not exactly in a stable situation in regards to money. But she is so passionate about it and I feel like an asshole for not supporting her. It's not like she's doing anything illegal (although I would say that MLM schemes are immoral/unethical to say the least). And I'm of the belief that you should support any venture a friend/family member is wanting to try unless it is self-destructive or illegal. Also, she was in another MLM scheme when I was a child called Herb-a-life. And apparently that failed miserably and she was pretty distraught about it, but I was too young to know. My family and my aunt pretty much agree with me and my aunt has been more vocal about it and I know they had a big fight about it several months ago, but my family is not the type to be very open. I was raised in an environment where our feelings were never really expressed. She is so adamant about it and shows no signs of slowing down, and I just wonder if maybe I should stay quiet and be as supportive as I can and let it run its course. ",

Until recently I didn't mind doing this for her as she doesn't drive because she doesn't have her license. \n\nA couple weeks ago I jokingly asked her when she's going to get her license so that she can start driving me around? She laughed and said she doesn't want to get it because guys are always begging to hang out with her and drive her around.\n\nNow this made me think back to a few times I asked her to hang out but told her I wouldn't be able to pick her up/drop her off and she would immediately make an excuse to not hang out. I didn't think much of it, but now looking back the common theme has been that I wasn't able to pick her up/drop her off.\n\nI haven't hung out with her since I made the joke, but we talk everyday, recently she asked me to chill I said ok but I wasn't going to pick her up. She immediately blew up saying we haven't hung out in weeks and that I know she doesn't have her licence and that taking public transit isn't the safest for her (which is true but she takes public transit to and from work everyday).\n\nShe made me feel guilty for putting her safety at risk which is somewhat true but also I don't want to be one of \"those guys\" she mentioned that are always driving her to and from places.\n\nAm I the asshole for not agreeing to drive her whenever we hang out?\n",

      "description": "To preface, I had a best friend, call her Sarah. A girl best friend who I'm sure you all can follow the train of events to realize she had friend-zoned me. We were good friends for about 4-5 years. That's enough of that, I never spoke about my feeling to her nor her to me. It was something of an agreement. I lied to myself that I had lost feeling for her. Moving on, I met this wonderful girl from the other high school in my county, call her Erin. We hit it off and had the best of chemistry. We got together.  However, there are always these little indications that I still had feelings for my Sarah, I brushed them off. Erin picked up on them she went along though. We had some spats about it with me always saying \"I have no feelings for her\" you know the usual.  Well, it comes time for me and Sarah to go to college. Erin (where she was so small as a child was held back) had one more year left. Well, its the last weeks of August. Football season starts. Erin goes to our Highschools' rivalry game. There she sees multiple people who all said the same thing that I love Sarah. She finally broke and said I need to cool off on messaging Sarah. Well, I did for a week, I even informed Sarah about it. Then Sarah begins to get upset. It goes into an entire day of me trying to compromise between the two and being accused of supporting the other. It ended with Erin and I together and me removing Sarah from my life. I didn't want to lose either. However, I had to pick. Love or friendship. Erin made me write a scathing message to Sarah, which I regretted. I'd later delete all correspondence between Sarah and I. That would prove an issue when I had no proof.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater I would be accused of talking to Sarah again. Apparently, she had messaged my girlfriend's friend, Jennifer, and said we still stay in touch. May God strike me dead as I'm typing this I never came into contact with Sarah since that day in August. That was a fight, I should've handled better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward, now some 6 months later. Erin and I have had some ups and down. However, all-in-all we're great. We quite honestly make a 4 1/2 hour drive up and down our state work! We talk all the time. She's still the girl of my dreams. I've completely lost all care for Sarah. She messaged me once, while on a date with Erin. I let Erin blast into her, as me. She was on a different number is how she was able to message me.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen today \"She\" messages me. I am stricken by her apologetic words.. It was only inevitable she'd message me. There were messages of \"You owe me at least this\" and \"Would you really do this for all those years of friendship,\" \"I'm just here to apologize.\" I told my girlfriend she had messaged me. She said she trusted me to handle it. Then Erin had a change of heart and said not to. I said to let this be the test of how far I've came. She said no the test is for me not to message Sarah. Well, I had already had my thoughts piqued and thought whats the issue in at least giving quarter to someone and hearing them out. I'll listen to Sarah then Erin can say I can't talk to her anymore, everything will be fine...I'll have closure.   Well she goes to apologize. Sarah says she wants her best friend back. I explain my logic why it weighed on Erin and that I loved someone else. It truly did hurt her. Sarah seems to understand. I ask about why she messaged Erin's friend and she said she really thought I would leave Erin for her. I tell her to prove that she's serious delete the messages up. She shows me a screenshot of said messages deleted. She then reiterates she wants her best friend back I say I need time I do forgive her though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, it all falls apart. Turns out it was Jennifer messaging with Erin sitting in the car watching me message \"Sarah.\" I am then accused of lying, again, and now I'm blocked from everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* I know I wasn't supposed to lie to my girlfriend. The guilt I had of not hearing Sarah out was biting at me though; just out of respect to our old friendship. \n\n\\*\\*If this goes big and some youtube is going to do a reading of r/AmItheAsshole please refrain from reading mine.

      "description": "So I'm 23 and I got diagnosed with incurable ovarian cancer a couple months ago. Basically the whole body is fucked, it's stage four, it's in my lungs and all over my chest and even if it went into remission, it would 100% come back. I tried a chemo regime which was \"light\" so didn't impact my life that much and that did nothing. As a result, the doctor informs me that while there are other chemo regimes I could try since the first stuff didn't work there would be a less than 15% chance of that chemo being effective. Crucially however, these other chemo regimes would be the \"hard shit\". The stuff that makes you wish you were dead. Surgery is also an option but it would be intense and my doctors only want to do it if my lower body just stops working and it becomes an issue of \"do or die\". My doctor basically said it was a choice between living out the reminder of my time the best I can, and that might involve squeezing out every last day out at heavy cost, or it might just be me going as far as I can without chemo. \n\nSo it's fair to say that I got massively slammed with the bad luck mallet. I really do want to live more than anything but I'm not willing to be massively unwell or sick for that, especially when the chances of \"success\" are less than 15%. I know that's in part me just being weak but right now I don't look sick. I don't feel bad. If I have less than a year left, I'd rather just have fun with it. Everyone keeps pushing me to try the hard chemo, to try to live, but I know I'll be miserable. I'll be miserable even if it does work. I keep saying that I'd only consent to the hard chemo if they could put me in a coma for the duration of the treatment so I wouldn't have to feel any of it. \n\nI don't really know where my family is regarding whether or not I continue treatment. I know choosing to avoid treatment would be the cruellest thing I could ever do to them but since I'm already dying at 23 and they're going to have to deal with that one way or the other, I wonder if I'm allowed to be selfish here. I'd do it if they begged me. But I don't want to. I don't want to break my father's heart but it seems a foregone conclusion at this point. ",

      "description": "This happened at the gym today. \n\nFor some context, my gym has three floors with most upper body equipment, some squat racks, and cardio machines on the top floor, some more machines, mat space, and bathrooms on the second floor, and free weights and leg machines and a boxing room on the bottom floor. \n\nI was working on a squat rack upstairs and see this guy rotate among the three barbell benches (regular, incline, and decline). The gym was pretty empty so he wasn’t causing any problems. He even wiped down the benches which I always appreciate. But then he went downstairs without re-racking the weight for any of the three benches. This is a big pet peeve of mine at the gym but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he was just going down to the bathroom or something. \n\nWell I finished my last set just a minute or so later and went down to the bottom floor to work on a leg press machine. When I get down there, I see him lacing up boxing gloves. For context, he was definitely bigger than me so not sure what I was thinking but I just got super pissed. I walked over to the boxing room and said something like “hey man- pretty shitty of you to leave all three benches racked up.”  He stumbled through some excuse of about to go back up. The best part is he is literally lacing up his glove as he said it. A woman was in the room with him - I presume his girlfriend. They kind of gave me dirty looks but I was already off to my next set. From what I can see, it does look like I shamed him to go back upstairs and re-rack the weight. \n\nSo basically here’s the question- AITA for not minding my own business? Having thought about it afterward, the gym was pretty empty and I wasn’t even using the benches. So I feel pretty judgmental right now and just curious what you all thought.\n\nThanks for any thoughts on this!\n\nTl;dr: called out a guy for not re-racking his weight in front of his gf at a pretty empty gym and now feel like an asshole.

      "description": "For six months, I worked as a server (waitress) at a nursing home. The first three months were great. My co-workers didn't like me (turns out my CO habit of sarcasm was not taken well in Indiana), but they weren't rude. \n\nTh he fourth month, an old employee who was fired got rehired. This place has a quick turnaround in employees, many of them quit in less than a month (5 employees came and went while I was there, varying from 3 weeks to 3 days working there before leaving). My co-workers remembered her and were immediately friendly, but I had never seen her before. \n\nThings were fine among both of us until about three weeks after she started. She decided she hated me. T, as I'll call her, came out and yelled at me for the simplest things. She'd essentially order me to do part of her job for her, then yell at me for not finishing it for her (an example would be when she took out the trash and said I had to clean the place where we put the dirty dishes, but was upset that I didn't mop the floor as well). She'd yell at me for folding silverware if she felt like doing it instead. It got to the point where she'd check on me to see if I was doing anything wrong. She'd go in the back and eat, leaving me to deal with her section, then get upset if I came back and told them residents needed her help. I'd have ten old folks raise their hands at once and all ask me for help. \n\nI had BPD and EID (which means I can become overly upset when provoked, including anger and crying). T berating me would send me into depression, making me cry/tear up no matter how little it was (not conducive with residents making orders). The lack of help would mean I would often have multiple tables of old, cranky people needing my help. Suddenly the chef would yell at me for not grabbing the orders off the food window. I'd get anxiety attacks and freeze, unable to even fill drink orders. \n\nI spoke to the managers constantly about it. The floor manager saw it happen in multiple occasions. I was assured for two months that T would be fired when they found a replacement. I was one of their best employees, I can think of two of us who didn't break the rules. \n\nAfter a while, I dreaded going into work on days where T was working. I never spoke when she was there. Towards the end of the six months, I'd call in sick once a week. I stopped taking extra days. \n\nFinally I broke. I texted my boss, told him I quit. I wouldn't be coming in that day, or ever again. They must've been stuck for weeks with a missing person (we were already badly. understaffed). Im sure tiffany stayed after I left, she was only rude to me. \n\n\n\nTl;dr, a co-worker was harassing me so I left without warning. AITA for leaving my managers understaffed because I couldn't handle it?",

      "description": "Bf and I have been together for nearly 6 years and have lived together for the majority of that time. Things have been going well for the most part, though like most couples we've had our rough patches. Very early on we made it clear to each other that entering into a serious relationship meant our goal was marriage and kids eventually, something we mutually agreed on. We were only together for about a month before he made a comment about putting a ring on my finger one day. Life was good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today and no ring so far. Obviously I didn't expect him to pop the question immediately, especially since when we first moved in together we had some financial trouble and of course keeping the lights on and putting food on the table are a priority. But since then he's gotten a very nice job and even a promotion, and he's making really good money. He just bought us a brand new tv and other furniture, which definitely wasn't cheap, so clearly money is no longer an issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, why am I considering leaving? Well it's gotten the point where every time we go out to a nice dinner or for a special occasion, I'm always hoping for a proposal. Even my friends, annoying and nosy as they may be, have been asking him \"when you gonna put on a ring on it?\" and he always responds \"I don't know\". Then he took me to a very expensive restaurant for my birthday last year, and when the waiter dropped off a small little jewelry box on the table with the dessert I was ecstatic! But sadly my hopes were crushed when it turned out it was just a small trinket box, a birthday gift from the restaurant. And it was certainly nice of them, and I appreciated it, but to be on such an emotional high one moment and then to be let down so suddenly was extremely jarring. When we got home I immediately went to take a shower where he wouldn't be around and had a bad panic attack (I have a lot of issues with anxiety). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis event made me realize I can't take much more of getting my hopes up just to be let down, like an emotional rollercoaster. It's messed with my anxiety a lot, and I'm practically dreading everytime we go out now. We talked before early on in our relationship sort of mapping out our future for ideally when we'd like to start moving things forward, and we talked about wanting to start a family by the time I turned 28. I will be turning 27 in just a couple months, and we aren't even engaged yet. I don't know if he's forgotten or changed his mind or what, but if I try to talk to him about it he doesn't really say much and I don't want to put any pressure on him or push him into something if he's changed his mind. I worry that if he doesn't propose by the end of the year then he might not care about having a future with me anymore. WIBTA if I left because of this if he doesn't propose by the end of the year?",

      "description": "To give context my friend is one of my closest friends and we have a great friendship. Me, him and his gf all go out to eat all the time. We usually do not share on any appetizers but ME and HIM (his gf had her own meal) decided to do so this time. When we were eating we both barely at much of the appetizer but I ate a little bit more (more than 60% of the app was still not eaten, and i was saying i was full and they could take it with them). When it came time to pay we agreed to split the meal however his gf came out and said in a rude manner since i ate more I should pay for it. Remind you this is like $5 and I was totally fine with paying for it but the way she said it and demanded did not sit right with me. I obliged as it was something fine with me and not risking my friendship over. However, later on her negative comments to other things bothered me and so I decided to talk to my friend. I told him I apologize if I ate more and was more then fine with paying. But did not appreciate his gf stepping in like that and if he ever felt that way he should have told me. He told me he never thought about making me pay and did not think like that and said everything is fine.\n\nHe actually texted me today and said that his gf said she was just joking and he does not want to speak for her but apologizes on her behalf.\n\nI just want to know AITA for bringing it up and talking to him instead of her? I only did so because the money was between me and him and as a result I thought if he was thinking that way I should address it. In addition, his gf has a temper and is stubborn, therefore I was in no mood to explain to her why I didn't appreciate how she made her demands. Also, since he is one of my closest friends I care more about keeping my friendship with him and talking to him rather to his gf.\n\nReposted this to give some more context! ",

      "description": "Sorry if the nature of this post might go off-topic and if it isn't appropriate for this sub. I'm also on mobile so apologies for poor formatting.\n\nBasically, my mum broke up with her long-term partner a couple of days ago. It is a nasty, hurtful break up and I feel it is my fault as I told her about some abuse I had experienced at his hands as a child and I tried to convince her of his true nature. (i.e. emotionally abusive - very manipulative and gaslighting/grooming her and the family).\n\nLong story short, finding this out obviously has devastated her completely but it has also been extremely hard for me emotionally and mentally to finally come forward about this abuse over 12 years later. I have also been dealing with issues with my bio father recently which has taken a considerable toll on me mentally and probably caused me to have a breakdown and tell her everything I guess.\n\nNow I really really want to go home. (Currently sitting up in the early hours torturing myself mentally enough to write this post). I feel terrible and guilty for wanting to leave my mum on the day (valentines) she needs me most. I want to stress that I absolutely do not want to go home to spend valentines with my boyfriend, but because I want time to recover mentally and emotionally before I have to go to work again Monday. I feel restless and anxious being here and I can tell it is making my mental health deteriorate.\n\nAITA for wanting to look after my mental health before I travel home and go back to work whilst leaving my mum alone to cope with a breakup on Valentine's Day? \n\nSide note: she likely isn't going to be completely alone as my brother lives with her but I don't think he has the capacity to be as supportive as I could. \n\nLastly, I obviously feel that my mum isn't the asshole in this unfortunate situation but I would just like an opinion on if I would be an asshole if I  return back home on valentine's. (I have been here since Saturday and they broke up on Monday bc of me). ",

      "description": "Through my adulthood, I’ve gone through depressive episodes. Christmas would be when my depression would be at its worst, stemming from some terrible memories from childhood. I would still be functional and generally no one would ever know I was dealing with depression. \n\nThis happened 10+ years ago. My boyfriend at the time and I had been together for 5 years and living together for 2. He was well aware of my issues around Christmas. For my part, I tried really hard to go through all the motions around Christmas and I tried make things special, which I hoped would help me make good memories around the holiday. \n\nSo, Christmas morning, it’s just he and I at home and we’re exchanging gifts. I gave him gifts that I’d put a lot of thought into. They were very meaningful to him and he was happy and thankful. \n\nHe gave me my present, I unwrapped it and then just stared at in disbelief. He’d gotten me a All-in-one tv remote. We already had a all-in-one tv remote, the one he got was just a slightly better one. The one we had worked just fine, so the gift didn’t make sense to me. This was also my only present. All at once, this rush of disappointment came over me and I started crying. And kept crying...  The ugliest crying you can imagine... when I could speak again through the crying I told him how it felt like he just got himself a gift since he primarily was the one who watched tv... I told him how he must not care about me or even know who I am if that’s what he got me. I felt there’s now way he loves me because you don’t get people you love shit impersonal presents. This escalated to him screaming at me about how I ruined Christmas, how I always ruin Christmas and that I’m an ungrateful bitch. I didn’t fight back beyond saying I didn’t think he loved me and repeatedly apologized saying I was depressed and I couldn’t control my reaction. I spent Christmas Day by myself feeling numb and broken while he went to celebrate with friends/family. He was angry with me for days, but eventually things when back to normal. Every so often he’d bring it up and how my reaction was completely out of line and it had really hurt him. \n\nWe broke up months later (not over that) and I haven’t seen him in many years.\n\nI feel both tremendous guilt over my extreme reaction and still have anger with him over what transpired. Should he have been more empathic? Should I have accepted the gift, somehow controlled my emotions and thanked him for it? It’s the thought that counts, right? Do I have any right to feel hurt that 5 years into a serious relationship that my Christmas present was so meaningless?\n\nExtra info: pervious christmases, the gifts he gave me weren’t all that special, but also not so impersonal. \n",

(Fast forward to after his move) we haven't talked much after we moved apart (I'm not a big social media user and dont really like calling people) we make small talk over messenger and I usually leave it unread but before this last Christmas we were talking I asked him how he was and he responded with just dealing with depression.

      "description": "Two years ago, I was walking home through my neighbourhood with my friend at about midnight. We were approached by a group of nine guys who surrounded us, and before I know it I was on the ground, blood everywhere, completely dazed and confused, having the living sh*t kicked out of me by myself as my friend managed to get away when the first punch was thrown. I ended up in hospital having headscans and assessments as the doctors were worried about possible damage to my head. \n\nI didn’t realise it for about a year, but I have pretty bad PTSD-like symptoms from this, and I’ve been trying to get over this experience ever since. Two weeks ago I walked home from my girlfriends house who lives about 15 minutes away, at around midnight again. I saw the silhouettes of a group of guys ahead of me on the road, and I had what I’d class as maybe my first ever panic attack? I froze completely, legs went to jelly, and was overcome by fear before quickly running and hiding behind a parked car. I had to call my mom to come and pick me up as I couldn’t move.\n\nSince that night two weeks ago there has been two attack’s on men walking by themselves in my neighbourhood, similar to what happened to me originally. \n\nLast night my girlfriend was out with friends drinking and decided to get the bus home instead of a taxi, even though I had told her a taxi would be much safer. When she got off the bus, she called me and basically wanted me to walk to meet her, walk her the 3-4 minute walk back to her house from the bus, and then for me to walk home alone, all at about midnight. She knows about the attack, she knows how badly it has affected me, and yet she still wanted me to do this. \n\nI told her that Im really sorry but I just couldn’t make myself do it as I’m really struggling with it at the moment. My car is in the garage so couldn’t drive to pick her up, which she also knew about. I offered to hop in my moms car with my mom (I’m not insured on it to drive it alone) to come get her to drop her home, and she went crazy at me for even suggesting that.\n\nShe went on to tell me that there are certain things a boyfriend are EXPECTED to do, that it’s the male’s job in a relationship, and basically went through how I’m flawed as a SO. Even after I explained the situation again, about how when I even offered a solution she rejected it as it wasn’t exactly what she wanted, she refused to see it from my point of view. \n\nI understand why she would want that, but I feel like she’s not even coming close to considering my needs and feelings. \n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "I’m in college and this happened about two Halloween’s ago, but I thought I’d still share the story.\n\nSo there were a bunch of Halloween parties going on the weekend before Halloween and me and two other buddies decided to go to this really big one that a friend of ours was throwing. Before we went, we pregamed at someone else’s place, and I got really drunk from that, almost to the point of blacking out. So when we get there, there’s like 400+ people at this party, and most are waiting outside the house trying to get in. Somehow, me and my buddies come across my friend/roommate’s gf (S) and her friend (M) who I kinda had a crush on. We then decided to group up with them for the night, but next thing you know the party got crashed by the cops and we all had to dip out and find somewhere else to go.\n\nWe ended up getting a ride from my friend/roommate (B) who wasn’t really pleased that we called him for a ride, back to my apartment. Once we got back to my place, another friend of ours invited everyone to come drink at his place. So me, my buddies, and the two girls S and M ubered over there, while B who again was dating S, stayed home (I think he was trying to study for a test). On the way there, me and M were both pretty drunk and started getting kinda flirty with each other. Once we get there, we’re hanging out and S and M mention they wanna play beer pong. So we go to the garage and M kinda flirtatiously says we should play strip pong. So I, being drunk almost to the point of blacking out, am like hell fucking yeah. It was me and my best bud, against S and M. We’re playing and we’re having a good time; me and my buddy end up standing there in just our underwear, and M just ends up taking her shirt off (she had a sports bra on still). However S wasn’t really feeling it. Pretty sure she just wanted to play normal beer pong. She never took anything off, which I kinda gave her crap for, and she ended up letting one of our other guy friends take her place because she was uncomfortable with the whole situation (I felt pretty bad about it the next day and apologized to her for my behavior. She said she understood and wasn’t upset with me). I was mainly just trying to continue being flirty with M during the game though. I wasn’t trying to make a move on S at all. After the game, we all end up heading home, and I pass out in my bed.\n\nThe next morning I wake up to find an envelope with my phone in it (I accidentally left it in B’s car when he gave us a ride) had been slipped under my door. It was from B and I saw that he wrote “we need to talk” on it. I was super confused as to what was going on and text him asking what was up. He texts me saying how the friend who invited us over that night told him how I was playing strip pong with his gf and he was pretty pissed about it. Now maybe I was just being really naive in this situation, but I tried explaining to him that the game itself wasn’t sexual with how we were playing, but that it was just funny and a good time for everyone, not to mention that it was M’s idea to play. We had a bunch of people in there watching and laughing mainly at me and my buddy playing in just our underwear. Yeah, maybe I might’ve been trying to make some moves on M that night, but I was not in any way trying to make a move on his gf. He didn’t see it that way though and he went on a huge tirade saying how friends don’t try to get their friend’s girlfriends to strip. We ended up getting in a pretty heated argument over it while our other roommates kinda had to sit around and listen to us yelling at each other. My other friends who were at the pong game later helped explain the situation to him and he eventually calmed down a little, but he was still pretty upset with me for a while, maybe for about a week. We eventually cleared the air with each other and became good friends again. I think he eventually realized there was nothing going on between me and his girlfriend.\n\nHowever I would like to know, was I the asshole in that situation?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "After going out for the Super Bowl, me and my roommate got back a bit drunk. I live with him and his wife, who'd already gone to bed so we say our goodnights and all that and everything should be normal. \n\nWell next thing I know it's 1:30am and I gotta shower and use the bathroom but it's locked. No problem, I just wait as usual.\n\nExcept a half hour later it's still locked.\n\nI knock a bit and bang a bit, but still no response. And trust me, there's (probably) no way the bathroom can be accidentally locked. Cue the fear that something is wrong. \n\nI'm debating between waking up the wife or just going to bed and hoping it's all fine in the morning. The fear of the former is that it turns out he's in bed and the bathroom's just locked, causing me terrible embarrassment. The fear of the latter is that he's passed out choking in a pool of vomit. In my awkward head, those are equally bad outcomes. \n\nAfter another half hour spent pacing around the apartment, I decide I couldn't live with myself if I just went to sleep without making sure he was okay in there.\n\nSo I awkwardly wake up the wife at 3am. Understandably annoyed, she goes and starts banging on the door with a ferocity far more confident than mine. A minute of that passes as I finally hear him get up—perfectly fine.\n\nNow it's 4am and I'm scared they'll hate me in the morning.\n\nI know I'm dumb, but AITA?",

We text almost every day.\n\nIn the past couple of weeks I've been feeling attracted to her; she really is everything that I like. Even though my feelings are not strong right now, I definitely think that they will grow with time. She is a little older than me and works out; I've asked her out a couple of time and she's told me yes but only \"as friends\" which definitely tells me that if I tell her my feelings I will fall into the abyss of the friendzone.\n\nA couple of days ago I told her that we would not be contacting each other for some time because I need time to get my feelings together, I don't want to fall for her. I feel that I am being a total jerk for not giving her an explanation. I think that ending the friendship right now could save me some pain in the future, but she doesn't that and I kinda feel like a a hole for doing that\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

On the day of coming out as gay I didn't plan to come out, but my brother caught me watching porn and he saw what I was watching (he already knew I was gay though and totally supportive of it). So I decided to rip the band aid off and officially come out to him, then my mom and then my dad. Everyone took it amazingly and were extremely supportive, I was relieved for two reasons, although I was almost certain they'd be great with it, I had the what if they aren't thought, and secondly I'm quite introverted and anxious and so opening up felt difficult anyway.\n\nAfter they knew and my then best friend knew (she had known for a while), I decided to make a Facebook post to address the rest of my family and friends, with my family consisting of aunties, uncles and cousins. Again everyone was extremely supportive. I later found out from my mom, that one of my cousins (who I do get on with but not closely) was upset that I didn't come out to her personally. I can understand her position, but to be honest I just wanted to get it over with and rip the band aid off. I asked another family member about this and she said that my cousin needs to grow up.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "I know this sounds bizarre. Why haven’t you introduced her? Are you ashamed? I know, I know. Let me explain.\n\nShort(ish) life story: So growing up I’ve had a shaky relationship with my mother. Sometimes she’s my best friend and sometimes I fear her existence. Household was her, myself, and two siblings. Sister’s Dad was sometimes around and me &amp; my brother’s dad got banned from our existence for about 3-5 years at a time. Physical &amp; Verbal abuse was rampant, with most of it being verbal after my aunt had a chat with my mother. I’ve been kicked out of her house which has led to me being homeless when I was 18. Now I’m not painting myself as this helpless victim. I did grow up to not have any drug problems, finished school, and waited to drink at 21, but I was a self-entitled idiot growing up because “woe is me and my circumstance” and “I deserve better”. I hated myself then and I still loathe who I was. Being homeless was probably the best eye opener for two reasons, I understood how scummy I was being when I was seriously put in circumstances where I had nothing but a backpack full of stuff. I was lucky to even have a phone and some headphones, &amp; I realized how much I didn’t need to move back home to that environment.\n\nVerbal abuse noted, I met a girl I really liked. After some months of long distance dating we risked it and I moved in with her. It’s going really well and after some complications, we have a child on the way. Til this day, my mother doesn’t know her. Initially, I meant to have her meet her... but each time I visited my girlfriend (who lived a whole 1000 miles from me at the time), I would get a call via messenger video chat and all of my family is there insisting they meet her. My girlfriend having ptsd and not being able to deal with confrontation or people in general real well, would shy away every time. Whenever I was on the phone with her and my mom would visit my brother, my mom would make comments about my clothes. Specifically my jeans being too tight (I wear slims but I have big calves) and my girlfriend didn’t like that all that much noting my history with her and her verbal abuse. What abuse you ask? I’m black &amp; Japanese... being mixed has its own slurry of identity issues with you never belonging to any one group, so add on questions of sexuality at home due to a lack of a girlfriend and specific fashion choices and we got years of gay jokes at my expense. \n\nTo anyone of the LGBT reading this, it isn’t meant as a slam to you from me. In fact, it made me understand the pressures of coming out especially in the black community where for a while homophobia was secret but rampant. But I digress... these were the tame attacks compared to the years of uglier things I faced living with her.\n\nNow I know, I could have just let these kinds of comment roll off my back. All 26 years of my life.  But you know... it’s not that easy. Especially when it happens all the time and any response to it is just “you’re just too sensitive”. But now there’s a whole other person witnessing all of this. I can’t bring myself to try and defend or excuse my mother’s behavior. With a lot of my family even. Even though my brother and his girlfriend are now very well acquainted with my girlfriend with them being the only people I trusted wouldn’t run her away. Recently, my mom urged my brother to move in and he fell for it, and it’s not gone well. My brother, being the expressive person he is, urged my girlfriend to not meet her. Or tell her about our future child. In fact, we don’t even encourage that... my girlfriend seeing all of this is now way more convinced she probably shouldn’t meet her because of how much she reminds her of her ex (who was the source cause of her ptsd). Couple AITAs...\nAm I the asshole for exposing her to all of this?\nAm I the asshole for taking so long to introduce her?\nAm I the asshole for agreeing with my brother in front of my girlfriend about my mom’s behavior?\nAm I still an asshole and did nothing change while I was homeless?",

What I was thinking to do about the situation was to buy a cheap bike to give them so as to ensure that they don't have a reason to say that they are short one bike, bear in mind that in the five years that I was out of the country they had plenty of time to buy another bike with even better parts than my old bike, and I have been back in my home country for two years now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here come the question Would I be the asshole if I follow through with the idea of giving my aunt a cheap bike so I can get back my old bike that was build by my dad ?

      "description": "Backstory: I studied at a university in the south far from home and haven’t visited since graduation (about a year ago). Of course I made a ton of friends and I miss them all, but this is about my best friend from college. \n\nLong story short - I am now working full time at a 10-12 hour/day stressful yet rewarding job. She just graduated a few weeks ago (she took an extra semester of school to study abroad) and now has a ton of free time. \n\nShe wants me to come visit her (she lives in the city I went to college in) but I’ve been trying to explain that I don’t have a lot of time off now that I’m working. She said that she misses me and keeps stressing how much it sucks that we can’t see each other. \n\nNow I’m not broke, I make enough money to be able to travel, but I had already planned on using my vacation days for the rest of the year as days off for my own sanity and just breaks from the job. \n\nA group of our college friends are all meeting in May for a vacation so I’ll see her then, but she keeps pressing me to come down and visit her. \n\n When I suggested she come visit me up north, she immediately ranted about how she would never come up between November-March because it’s way too cold. I suggested she come in the summer but she said that it was too long of a time to wait. I live in one of the biggest cities in the country yet she still said it would be boring if she came and stayed on a Thursday and Friday because she only wanted to see me and not do other things. This is endearing and I recognize that she’s not trying to be rude or mean - she genuinely misses me. \n\nI miss her a lot too, but it seems like she’s just asking me to do all the planning and taking time out when she’s not working and isn’t paying for anything herself. I don’t want to be petty and I really don’t want to be mean, but it just sort of feels like she doesn’t want to get out of her comfort zone at all. \n\nIdk, what do you guys think? AITA? I feel like it, i know I should just go and visit her because she’s my friend and I love her but it’s just really frustrating. ",

      "description": "Hello everyone. Throwaway for privacy, and my husband will be reading these responses as well. \n\nOur son Jake has been best friends with Sam for four years. They are both 15 years old. About three years ago Sam's parents asked us if we would be alright with Jake going to church with them on Sunday so that our boys could have sleepovers there on Saturdays and we readily agreed. House to ourselves every other weekend? Yes please! On the other weekends, Sam sleeps over with us on Fridays. This is a decently consistent schedule during the school year. \n\nPlease note that Jake fully supported this and wanted to learn about religion as his father and I are non-believers. We have nothing against religion and we were initially excited to see him wanting to explore his beliefs.\n\nAbout a year ago Jake began making comments that we were not fond of. Example: \"If you do X, you'll go to hell.\" He would say this in response to us \"gossiping\" (talking about an actor), saying words like \"asshole\" (which, fair, I'll give him that one), and punishing him for bad behavior/grades (taking away his playstation). This escalated to him judging how we live and conduct ourselves, because we do not adhere to \"normal\" church behaviors. Example: My husband does the laundry, which my son said is not a man's duty.\n\nAt that point, we sat him down and had a long discussion on sexism, gender roles, etc. The whole nine yards. My husband and I also had a conversation with Sam's parents which we thought went over well. \n\nExcept his behavior hasn't changed, only became less targeted. He quoted the bible at us last week when I wouldn't let him practice driving. He quoted it again when my husband opened a beer. And again when my sister and I mentioned a current hot button topic.\n\nI'm done. We're done. We told him that if he was going to use his religious beliefs/knowledge in such away, then he could no longer attend church. We spoke with Sam's parents about having sleepovers be only on Fridays at either house, but now they're mad because they think we're judging them for their beliefs/way of life and putting us on blast all over Facebook. But it's only because our son apparently isn't mature enough at 15 (I *know* this is ridiculous) to handle religion, I swear. We've lost two mutual friends over this situation and Sam isn't allowed at our house anymore (their decision) so at this point I'm doubting our decision to pull him from church because this is a lot of shit to deal with. Jake, of course, says he hates us.\n\nI don't know. So are we the asshole? I honestly didn't think we were until this blew up.",

So I decided enough was enough and just straight up said to him 'you gotta stop following us because we aren't your friends and your jokes are just rude'. I think I said it in a better way than that but I just wanted to get the point across to him.\n\nHe proceeded to cry and not come back to college for the rest of the week. \n\nIn which I got told that I was a bully and a asshole from the 'friends' who were bitching behind his back.\n\nAITA in this situation and should I just have let him follow us ?",

I’m all about her being able to express herself and be creative however she wants, unless it means posting your nudes for your entire family to see. I don’t mind it as much as the rest of my family but my parents are starting to get questions from friends if she’s ok. On top of this all she has been going to doctors appointments and therapy sessions for years which she’s finding out are more costly than expected. My family isn’t exactly well off and my parents have done what they can for her treatments, but that hasn’t been enough I guess. When my family can’t support her though she tells us she’s going to have start stripping and selling nudes since she quit her job and has been on unemployment. To make this even more unsettling, she’s married to a man that has been pimping her out and supporting her in promoting and selling her nudes. I’m becoming concerned for her safety and sanity but she’s not talking to half my family and I don’t know how or if any of us can make her realize how toxic the situation she’s in is. Basically I just want to know if I’m being an uptight sister for not wanting to see or support this life for her. ",

She says that our father was just a monster and that she doesnt want to participate in it. \n\nI feel very angry about this. I realize she is an adult but I also feel like she is being childish and over dramatic and extremely hurtful to not just me but my elderly mother who has lost the will to live.\n\nI want to tell her to give back the money the monster paid for your wedding since you think that.

The amount of crap I have had to put up with is astounding. First she didnt tell me that shes been giving him 4 cups of prune juice per day, because of stomach issues, thanks for the heads up about the poo explosion. She let's him do whatever he wants including hitting the pets, pulling hair, ect. Give me very little instructions throughout the whole week. And the main issue has been 45mins-1 hour late every day.

I've been interested in the solo traveling style for a while now, but I really haven't been able to attempt it because the last time I was single I didn't have enough money/time for a trip.  Now that I'm older and have a bit more money to spend, I wanted to take a long weekend trip out west to Idaho/Wyoming area to see Yellowstone and the Boise area.  I haven't planned it out too much yet, because of this situation, but I'd stay out there about 4-5 days to visit the National Parks in the area.  It's not that I don't want her there with me, but I've just always wanted to try this, and it would probably be a bit weird to do it after we are married.  But it might also seem weird that I'd want to take a solo trip without her even with context. \n\nI don't know anymore, so I'm just gonna leave it out there and see any responses I receive.

The dog (it’s a she) is sometimes with her owner, a homeless guy in his 40s, but most of the time she gets tied to a pole and left there for hours. I wanted to report this to authorities but I was told that because most shelters in our area are kill shelters that could be even worse for the dog. Recently it’s been showing a lot in my city and seeing the poor dog tied to the pole was just too much. A few nights ago my fiancé and I were walking back from a restaurant in the area and saw the dog alone again, we decided to take her home. When I told my mother she was outraged, she says homeless people need their animals to keep them company and that I had no right to take her. I told her a dog isn’t a toy and people shouldn’t get one if they can’t look after it. My mom says I’m cruel and don’t care about human beings. I disagree and maintain that you should not have an animal you can’t take care of. We took the dog to the vet, he said she’s a little over a year, malnourished but not critically. We scheduled her shots and made sure she was okay. The plan is either to keep her or let my aunt’s family adopt her. We have two cats (they’re used to dogs) and we’re leaving our apartment to live in a house with a backyard in a few months. On the other hand my 8 year old cousin fell in love with the dog from the moment she saw her. Regardless, we all live in the same city and will be there for the doggy to shower her with love. I just hope my mom gets over it.",

      "description": "I [girl] started playing CoD with him when it came out some weeks ago, which was my first ever first person shooter, and he had played nearly all previous CoD games. \n\nHe was really helpful as a teacher, but all the time he either made fun of me for asking stuff (e.g. today I asked what a K9 is, and he wouldn't stop making fun of me for not knowing this - without even explaining it) or for asking what things mean more than once. I see how someone could find this annoying, but i asked him several times to cut me some slack please, because there are so many new words (all the weapons, game modes, ults, special attacks, ...) that it's really not realistic to remember everything immediately, especially because I have a life outside of gaming, and I have never played a shooter before.\n\nThe specific situation was that someone in the chat wrote \"Sniper2000 how did you get that calling card?\" and I asked what a calling card is. Cue my friend acting like I am retarded for asking this, because clearly he mentioned it before (once when we set up my initial player icon)... And he just doesn't stop. It's not a one sentence rant, it's a fullblown discussion how it is my fault that I am just too dumb to remember (his wording might have been different). At this point I got so tired of it that I said I'm going to leave and disconnected from the discord server (after the game ended).\n\nAnyway I know it was snappy of me to leave like this, but I feel degraded and even after asking hundreds of times if he could stop, he just continues to make fun of me and act like I am mentally retarded. AITA?",

      "description": "My hometown is home to one of the country's top universities, and the university has the same name as the town. I accumulated a few items while living there that say \"(Town)\" on them. Some of them I did buy at the university store, but I don't have anything that actually says \"(Town) University.\" I should also note that one of the items is actually from my high school which is called (Town) High School.\n\nNow I am past college and living in another state with my boyfriend. He has recently confronted me about my hometown gear and says that it makes him uncomfortable when I wear it out in public. He says that it's a dick move because I am putting the idea out into the world that I went to (Town) University and basking in the assumption that I went to a top school. He even went so far as to say that I'm doing it, whether I realize it or not, because I was a C-D student my whole life and I want people to think I'm smarter and more hardworking than I actually am.\n\nI don't think I'm doing that, and I don't think I am flaunting it as much as he is accusing me. I have like two drawstring bags, a hoodie, and a t-shirt (which has my HS colors) out of *everything* I own and I don't wear any of them that often. I guess I can see where there could be confusion, but it's not like I am wearing stuff from a completely random place, it's my home town. Am I actually the asshole?",

      "description": "Just a rant to get things off my chest more than anything, TLDR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live in a house with my dad, my sister, my little brother, and our dogs. I've been living her for over five years, she moved in with us about a year and a half ago. I love her, but she is a lot to handle.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, I have been eating healthier and working a LOT. At my busiest, I work upwards of 70 hour weeks but the pay is great, and I am happy where I am. My sister doesn't work at the moment, she is constantly sick, she takes LONG naps pretty much every day, smokes a lot, and she is not a very healthy eater. I don't believe this makes me better than her, or anything like that, but it's just the facts.\n\nA few days ago, I had a TERRIBLE stomachache, I'll save you the gruesome details, and she offered to do the dishes for me that night (my chore) because I wasn't feeling well. I thanked her and said yes.\n\nToday, she woke up not feeling well again and while I empathise with her, I am getting a little tired of hearing it. I know its genuine, but it's still irritating. She took another long nap today, and since it's one of my days off I also laid down and dozed off for a while.\n\nI woke up from the dogs scratching at me and whining, it was 6pm and they hadn't been walked yet. My sister was still sleeping, so I got up, got dressed, and took the dogs on a walk. She was awake by the time I got back (probably because the dogs bark a lot before going on a walk). So its fine.\n\nA little while ago, I asked if she would do the dishes tonight since I walked the dogs for her. She agreed at first, but after a few minutes it was clear she wasn't okay with it. I tried to pass it off as a joke, since we often joke with each other, but she was serious. She said what basically sums up to: \"I did your chores when you were sick.\" Keeping in mind that all she has right now is a runny nose and slightly sore throat.\n\nSo I was annoyed, but I left it, and a little while later I sent her a message apologising if I upset her, and that I hadn't meant anything by it, wanting to clear the air and be the bigger person.\n\nShe sent back a LONG message complaining about how she feels like everyone else gets a pass on chores when they're sick, but she always has to do them anyway. She is CONSTANTLY sick to the point where if we gave her a pass on chores when she was sick she'd never have to do them. I don't always ask her to cover my chores, but because she doesnt do anything and I'm always working, I DO expect her to do her own chores even when she's sick, and if I've worked a 14 hour day yeah it would be nice if she could do the damn dishes at night so I dont have to come home and put away dishes I didnt use from meals that I didnt eat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My sister is always sick, and complains about having to do chores when she's sick. Covered her chores today, asked her to do mine in exchange, and she gets mad.",

      "description": "So earlier tonight I made a trip to gamestop to trade in a game for store credit and take advantage of this buy 2 pre-owned games get 1 free deal they currently have going on. I got $20 store credit and the games I planned to buy were $40 and $25 respectively. This should have made my purchase around $45 total and include the third game for free.\n\nHowever, the cashier that rang me up was new, as one of the other workers walked him through how to do trade-ins for the first time. As he was still familiarizing himself with the system, he messed up and scanned in two of the games I was getting (the $25 one and the intended free one) as trade-ins. This mistake ended up giving me an extra $11 store credit instead of charging me. This now made my total purchase under $10.\n\nWhen I was told my total I was surprised, but didn't say anything as the initial relief of saving $35 seemed like a huge stroke of luck. I'm not familiar with Gamestop's employee policies or even if anyone noticed the mistake after I left, but I can't help but feel that this new guy might receive some type of punishment for his mistake.\n\nAm I an asshole for just walking out and not correcting the mistake?",

      "description": "Going to try to shorten this, but basically I've (24 F) had a crush on this guy in one of my classes (24 M) for a while now. Turns out one of my acquaintances (22 F) (we're in the same major and we've taken multiple classes together but I don't know her out of class and for some reason I've always got the vibe she doesn't like me) was interested in this same guy. He would always try to talk to me and flirt with me and help me with projects in class but he seemed really shy and I was hesitant to ask for his number because I'm fresh out of a long term relationship that ended last fall. So this girl starts to hang around him a lot more, obviously was into him and would interject herself in our conversations. Then one day she asks if he wants to go to lunch in front of me. He says sure. \n\nI noticed them hang out a couple times afterwards on campus. and honestly I'm not sure if this makes me the asshole but I'm really into this guy so I decide I probably need to make a move at this point and speak up. So I find him on instagram and ask for his number. He asks if I want to hang out some time and then asked if I wanted to go to dinner the next night so we go and hit it off, everything's going great. We coincidentally run into her leaving and she just says \"oh okay\" passive aggressively and then walks off when she sees us. He says that they hung out literally couple of times but he wasn't interested in her. \n\nShe confronts me the next day in class and says that she sees what kind of person I am and that I knew she was talking to him and called me a \"fucking bitch\" when she walks away. I'm such an unconfrontational person so it was beyond uncomfortable. \n\nTLDR: Me and acquaintance/girl I know from classes liked the same guy in our class. She asked him to lunch first, hung out with him a couple of times. I ask for his number and we go to dinner. She confronts me and calls me a bitch. AITA?",

He did this several times a day, often starting with the question \"Busy?\" to which I always answered \"very busy!\" and then would continue to drone on. \nOne day he stopped by and proceeded to ask me questions about my marriage followed by 40 minutes about his relationship and all the trust issues he has with his new girlfriend because of his ex-wife. 40 frikin minutes.\nThe next day I decided I'd had enough and stopped talking to him outside of a \"morning!\" when I walk in and \"have a good one!\" when I leave. When he asks conversation starting questions about my weekend or life I give him one word responses and don't ask after his weekend, which he is so clearly fishing for. He eventually started to get the message, and mostly doesn't talk to me anymore.

I’m a very physical person with a high libido and most of the month we both perfectly fulfill each other’s needs. On my period, sometimes I’m hornier and sex can help me with my cramps, but my man doesn’t like getting his dick up in that. We’ve tried it a couple times with a condom (we usually don’t use one as I have an IUD and we’re both clean), but he still gets some blood on him and then I feel bad because I know he’s not comfortable with it. I’m torn between wanting to make sure he’s comfortable and kind of feeling like shit because I’m less desirable because of something I can’t control. Thoughts? Think he might eventually change his mind? I’ve been with guys before who don’t mind period sex at all. I love my man and I’m willing to give up sex for a week each month so that he’s comfortable, but idk I kind of would like some input. ",

      "description": " Hi, I (28M) have been with my SO (28F) for 3 years and we have a great solid relationship. At the moment it's long distance (relevant) but we'll be reunited soon. However, as with all relationships, we have our disagreements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is one thing, however, that causes more discontent than I think it should.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI generally shave my beard (if you can call it that anyway) as it's better for work and I generally prefer to be clean shaven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut sometimes 1) I like to have it grow a little bit and see it how looks, etc.; 2) I just can't care to shave and so it grows a little bit. Having said that, I'm almost always clean shaven.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the thing is, my SO doesn't like me when I don't shave. She is VERY VERY VERY vocal about not liking that. I would understand if she were her next to me and she didn't like the feeling of the beard (which is why I never let it grow when we were in the same city) but now that we're long distance she doesn't even have to deal with that!!! It's been growing for a week and she's been complaining non-stop multiple times a day and certainly every time I try to send her a nice picture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt annoys me to no end because I don't really like being told what to do with my body (maybe immature? whatever), especially if it's within reason - I'm not getting a full body dragoon tattoo!!! The beard can be shaven in 5 mins and it's gone!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo every time she tells me that I should shave because I'm ugly with my beard and she says it's like as if I was overweight or other offensive things, I cut contact with her for a while. I think it's the only way to let her really understand that I don't like or accept this behavior. AITA?",

      "description": "I live in small 2-bedroom apartment in a very large &amp; expensive city. I often sublet the spare bedroom to people who come to town for extended stays. I provide them with everything they need bedroom-wise...bed, nightstand, dresser, TV, linens, and of course they are welcome to use any of the amenities I have in the apartment. Every tenant signs a sublease with me listing the rules and expectations of the house. One of these rules is my guest policy: 48 hours max. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently, I have a roommate who has been taking advantage of this policy. First, it was a guy she was seeing that was spending multiple nights in a row. Then, another friend came to visit from out of town. This friend was originally scheduled to stay for 4 nights, but I reminded my roommate of the policy she had agreed to, and now he's only here for 2 nights. Last night (while her friend was still in town) she told me her mother is coming to stay with us next week. For 4 nights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I remind my roommate of the policy she agreed to, but this time she pushed back. She said things are \"pretty tough\" with her family right now and she would really appreciate it if her mother could stay for 4 nights. I stayed firm on my no (beyond 2 nights). My roommate was not happy about this and is clearly very upset with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being ridiculous here? I was very upfront about this rule, and I live by it, too, btw. I also offered to help her mother find an affordable housing alternative for her visit, because if things are as \"tough\" as roommate says they are, there are certainly options available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I have a strict 48hr guest policy for sublets in my apartment. Roommate has a ton of guests, now wants mother to stay for 4 nights and insists that I should allow it because \"things are tough\" right now. I still said no.",

      "description": "So my friends and I were playing a casual game of poker during a gathering, but they set the rules so that the maximum bet was five dollars. \n\n\nBut after a short while I felt that the game was totally pointless because there no way to make a person fold. Nobody cared about 5 dollars so the game just became everybody without a good hand folding at the first turn and the rest go all-in. There were no mind games anymore so anybody without a good hand didn't have a chance at all.\n\n\nI felt that everybody should have a chance to play the game and the game was only fun because you could play mind games so I suggested we play the game the way it should be: no maximum bets. They said ok. So I went crazy.\n\n\nI started using large amounts to make people fold like how the game was supposed to be and after a few rounds everybody was telling me I was playing dirty.

At this time we knew the lease on the house was up at the end of the next month. There had been drama with my fiancé and my mom so everything lined up for us to move out. I told parents we’re going to move out since the lease is up and we want to be on our own. \n\nI paid 350$ rent and nothing else. We buy our own food and I had given my parents 5000$ to pay off debt so that’s my justification for not paying utilities. They told us they couldn’t afford the house if we moved out and that we never even pay utilities. I asked them why not get a smaller house since the lease was up? They said it wasn’t up until a couple months later. \n\nMy mother and father are pathological liars. Knowing this I called the landlord and asked him myself. He reconfirmed that the lease was up within 4 weeks. \n\nI now own a house with my fiancé and we’re doing well! My parents don’t contact me anymore though and I have no urge to contact them.

My brother is a marine and he is back home on leave before he deploys for a couple of years. \n\n3. My brother, sisters, and I went through a lot of abuse and neglect when we were younger. No one in our extended family did anything to try to help us. Also we NEVER speak of this.  EVER. \n\n4. Myself and my two sisters have all attempted suicide at one point in our lives. Our parents know about it but they never have talked to any of us about this ever. It is to be ignored just like our traumatic childhood. \n\n\nMy brother has been home for about a week. We already have spent 3 days together in a rented home. On top of daily visits where we just hang out. My family has never spent this much time together ever. But since my brother is leaving we are trying to cram as much time together as possible. This is absolutely draining on me mentally but I can’t tell them that. They wouldn’t take it seriously and it will just create drama. Tonight we were supposed to go to a basketball game. My parents bought us the tickets, which was really nice of them. I just didn’t have it in me mentally. I tried going out to dinner and struggled the entire time. I felt overwhelmed and anxious and just needed a break.  So after dinner I said I wasn’t feeling well and went home.

This leads to constant accidents around the house and anal glands needing to be drained, infections leading to vomit and constant visits to the vet. We've done everything we can including buying the most expensive fiber food to keep her stool soft, putting puppy pads around the house, we have tried multiple litters and litter boxes, nothing we do helps our cat. And it's worth mentioning that our cat seems very happy, she doesn't seem to be in any pain or suffering, just discomfort I think. \n\nThe vet says there is nothing they can do to fix this aside from antibiotics and draining the anal glands when they fill up..short of that he said it's all just pain management.\n\nI've brought up the possibility of moving her to the farm to be a farm cat (where they're very nicely taken care of) or finding her a new home or ultimately, putting her down...

I haven't lived here long and I am one of the youngest adult members of the community. \n\nThe first time I went up there, the guy made it a point to tell me I was pretty. As a fairly petite woman, in a completely isolated spot with an imposing stranger, I was instantly uncomfortable with this guy. During some renovations with my mother, we have needed his help moving a handful of items--but during the winter, bulk trash isn't an issue. Household bags only. I'm fit and perfectly capable of hauling my 2 small grocery bags of garbage. \n\nI drive a 15 passenger van. The last two times I've been up there, the weather has been shit so instead of getting out to organize the recycling, I just step into the back. Twice now, he has opened my side doors while I'm in there. Last time, I just kept it kicking, threw my trash out and left. This time, I said \"hey man, can you please not try to open my van?\". He said \"oh, I was just trying to help.\" Okay. I threw my trash away and as I walked back to the van he said \"I didn't mean any harm. I won't try to help again.\" My response was a bit of defeated muttering about \"I appreciate the help but...uh..yeah, okay. Thanks.\"\n\nAm I overreacting to this guy? Do I need to make amends with this dude or can we just keep it kicking. I honestly don't want to be chit chatty \"friends\" with him but this is a small island community and I don't know if I've stepped over the line with him--considering he's delayed.",

Four repairs and two or of hours installations for a bank in London.\n\nI drive 3 hours home and for some fucked up reason my girlfriend has gone hungry today like an infant.\n\nIt's past midnight here in the UK and she asked me as soon as I got home 15 minutes ago to make her some food. I said I can't, I'm gonna have a shower and go to bed, I already ate a pretty big lunch so I wasn't planning on cooking and she goes ballistic. Saying I didn't tell her I was going to be gone this late and I didn't tell her when I was home (I did)\n\nI asked her, if I was in a car accident and didn't ever come home would she just fucking starve? How hard is it to bring a pizza in the oven and set a timer if she's so hungry. Why wait for me to return home and cook. I'm not her Dad.\n\nShe works too but has had over five hours to cook. Or order a takeaway.\n\nOn top of it, she's mad at me for working so much now. I get it, I do work a lot but I'm just trying to pay my mortgage and bills. Which she doesn't contribute to despite us having lived together for over a year now.\n\nIt starts this whole argument and I've now had to go out for a walk. Posting this from a park bench.",

      "description": "So my roommate just broke up with her boyfriend of four years. It was a pretty serious relationship - like they spoke in terms of \"WHEN we get married...\".  I get it. Rough situation. However, my roommate chooses to cope with this in the most irritating ways. She sits in the room all day and night popping bubble wrap, watching gossip girl without headphones, and having friends over in the room. None of this is inherently problematic, but she extends this past the time I go to bed. I usually get into bed at 11 pm and the gossip girl/visit with friends/bubble wrap popping will continue until about three am. On top of that, I have an auditory processing disorder that makes it really hard for me to block out these sounds. And I have 8ams every morning! So does she! AITA for asking her to move to the lounge after I go to bed or while I'm studying. I genuinely feel her pain with this breakup and I don't want to make it seem like her sadness is a burden for me, but this is my room too, and I feel like these accommodations are fair. ",

My role is usually restocking and \"loss prevention\" when not restocking.\n\nI spotted a child, probably around 8 years old, who took a pack of fidget spinner (not my choice to have them in stock). I kept my eyes on him at a distance, especially when he went into a corner of the store. He started looking around so I knew the boy was up to no good. I pretended to be on my phone and he went under the table then came back out. \n\nAfter the boy left the corner, I checked under the table and there's an empty package for fidget spinner so this is definitely theft and not simple mischief of shoving toys where people can't find them. However, I chose not to confront the boy just then.\n\nI purposefully waited until the boy met up with his mother. I then tapped on his shoulder while showing the empty package. He gave up sooner than expected and pulled the fidget spinner out of his jacket pocket. His mom witnessed this and understoond immediately, then lashed out at the boy. When the family was checking out, the boy was trying to hide his tears.\n\nAITA for handling the situation this way?",

      "description": "Ever have one of those day's where your life has been comfortably regular and then all of the sudden you wake up and everything is pure chaos and it's terrifying and wonderful at the same time? That's where I'm at right now. \n\nI could go on dramatically and bore everyone so I will try and keep this simple. Three years ago I broke up with a guy who literally checked every box I have because he was in the Navy and moving and I felt like I owed to myself to finish grad school. I decided that if I kept in touch with him in any way I would drop everything and willingly become a happy housewife so I changed my number, deleted all social media and got on with the business of getting over him. Call him Charlie. \n\n\nFast forward to last week, I work in a large office complex and evert single day this very sweet, cute guy walks past our front door and we wave. We've chatted a few times so I know his name. On Wednesday he very nervously asked me out and he was just so nice and earnest and sweetly awkard that I said yes. \n\n\nWe went out last night and I was having a nice time but was like MAYBE there's possibility here but I liked him as a person. I went to the bathroom and ran smack into Charlie's parents. They always loved me and when they said that Charlie had just moved back into town for his next assignment, my knee's literally got weak. His mom asked for my number and without even thinking I gave it to her. I said goodbye and rejoined my date. \n\n\nIt wasn't even 15 minutes and Charlie texted me \"is this really you?\" I texted back \"yes\" and then he asked where I was. I told him I was at a restaurant and he asked if he could come pick me up. Again without even thinking I said yes. I told my date that I was having a family emergency and that was the reason for the texts. He offered to give me a ride home. I told him that it was ok and my brother was coming to pick me up. I said I was so sorry and I paid for our entire meal but he insisted on waiting with me out front. When Charlie pulled up and it was the first time I'd seen him in 3 years I again got weak in the knees. I told my date that he was my brother but I could absolutely tell by the look in his eyes he knew I was lying but he was way too nice of a guy to call me out on my bullshit. \n\n\nOf course it was instant chemistry with Charlie and after playing an hour of catch up we were back at my house doing what we did best. Only he's such an amazing such an amazing guy he said he wanted to slow down a bit and not take it all the way, instead he tucked me in and left with a kiss on the forehead. He's on his way over now to take me to a champagne brunch. I'm ready to drive to vegas and get married and never say goodbye to him again.  \n\n\nBut enough of the school girl gushing and back to the problem. I feel AWFUL for what I did to my date last night. I don't know what to do or say to him and I know I'm going to see him tomorrow. I guess to help me know how to plan for tomorrow, I guess finding out if I am a light asshole, a major asshole or even some small chance NTA would be very helpful. \n\nso AITA?\n",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago, and I'm not sure how I should have handled it.\n\nI agreed to live with one of my friends during our last year of college and our relationship soured. He would throw  temper tantrums for no reason. He would get really angry at me and say really hurtful things. Normally this would happen after he was embarrassed. For example, one time we were at a bar and this girl rejected him, not a big deal right? He proceeds to rant at me about how I have no redeeming qualities. Another time, he went on this huge rant about how I'm a burden to everyone. Both of these cases happened before we agreed to live together and were unprovoked. \n\nThe reason that I still agreed to live with him despite these outbursts is because I really doubted that they happened like I remembered. I assumed his ego had been bruised and he just lashed out. This was compounded by the fact that whenever I brought up what he had said to me a day or two later, he would say he didn't remember. If I pressed the issue, he would say \"Can you blame me?\" or \"It's true!!\" So, I kind of just let it go.\n\nThe other issue I had with him was that he would spam me constantly on fb messenger. He would send a lot links to articles, youtube videos, screenshots, etc. Occasionally he would also have these outbursts through here. If I brought these up, he would say he was joking.\n\nAfter we start living together, these temper tantrums start happening at a greater frequency, and I'm starting to get annoyed by them. I really hate talking to him because I always feel like I am walking on egg shells around him. He keeps messaging me on fb and generally just being a dick on chat too. I feel trapped because he won't acknowledge or admit to what he is doing in person, and when I bring up the online stuff he says he's joking and not upset or that \"I need to learn to laugh at myself\" or \"It stings because it's true.\"\n\nI tell him that really don't check fb that often and if he needs something he should text me. He continues to spam me on fb. Now I feel validated in ignoring his messages, because in my head I set a boundary and told him how he could reach me. I also just try to avoid him and spend as little time as possible in our apartment. I wear headphones more and am generally less friendly. In retrospect, this is really passive aggressive.\n\nAfter a week of this, he gets fed up with me and tells me off in another temper tantrum. This time I feel bad because despite all the insults he's slinging, he seems really hurt. I decide to just suck it up and be really nice to him and a doormat until we graduate and then not keep in contact with him lol.\n\nAITA? What should I have done differently? I never really got why people gave the silent treatment until now. Anytime I brought up an issue with him  he would deny it ever happened, start insulting me, or do an impression of me lol.\n\nTL;DR Started ignoring my roommate because he would be kind of hostile towards me",

      "description": "I apologise for the clickbait-ish title. \n\nWell this is happening right now, so excuse me for being a bit incoherent. Also, posting from mobile so I'm sorry in advance for any formatting trouble or typos. Finally, English is not my mother tongue, sooooo lower your expectations. \n\nSo, my SO (27F) and me (28M) have been together for almost a year. We've been going through some rough patches in the last few months, but overall our communication seems to be great (apart from the cause of this post, lol), so it's all working out.\n\nBoth of us are working full time, but we've been spending most nights at her place (she lives alone) and only 1 or 2 each week at my place (I live with my 2 brothers). She isn't the tidiest person (honestly, kind of a slob regarding the chores around the house), but nothing extreme. Today, she came to pick me up after she left from work and we went to pick up some groceries and back to her place. When we got here, a friend of hers called, so she picked up the phone and stayed on it for about 20 or 30 minutes. In the meantime, I saw the mess that was the kitchen sink and took it upon me to alleviate the situation. She got off her call, gave me some more dirty dishes and pans that were out of my sight and went inside. While I was struggling for the better of 40 minutes washing the dishes (after loading a full dishwasher, yeah that kind of mess), she calls for me from the back of the house to inform me she's going to take a nap. I tell her calmly but obviously bitter that I haven't actually seen her and I'd like to chat about our days etc. Before you think I'm a weirdo who doesn't want his SO to take naps, you need to know that her nap is like 3 hours long, then she wakes up for 20 minutes to grab a bite and sleeps again until the morning. I tell her that my hands are wet and I'll be right back and before I can walk the 10 ft to the kitchen and back to the bedroom, she's fallen asleep. So I'm left alone at her place, typing this up on reddit to kill some time.\n\nAITA for wanting to chat instead of seeing my SO for 30 minutes until the next morning?",

      "description": "So I don't know how long this text will be, but I really wanted to get this clear.\n\nLast week I gave my birthday party (17M) I invited around 25 people of whom I knew 22 people drank. I said there will be beer and wine and it will be enough to enjoy from it the whole night.\n\nI don't have anything against liquor, I know that some people prefer it over beer or wine. But my mother is, she was totally fine with the beer and wine and made it very clear that's she was against any Liquor (think roundabout 20% alcohol). So I didn't want to disappoint my mother and made it up too three times clear I didn't want any liquor at my party. Everybody understood it and said they were fine with it.\n\nThe night of the party started and everything went well. There was enough beer and wine and nobody had a complaint. Some one girl dripped in later from work, but still I was very happy to see her around. The night went by, and at almost the end of the party I heard somebody brought liquor and were drinking it. (This to me was a problem, some other people also said they brought liquors, but when I told them I didn't want to see some of it they understood and didn't open the bottle at all). The person who brought the liquor was the person whom was later at the party, I knew it was from here because she was the one screaming that she wanted here bottle back. That's because I grabbed it and left it with my mom with the message to the girl that if she wanted to have her bottle back she would have to ask it back to my mother. She didn't and the bottle staid at my home.\n\nThe next day I noticed that she left a piece of clothing from work and apped her if she wanted to get it back. She did but was too afraid too get it back from my home probably because she was scared of my mom. So I said I would bring it with me to school.\n\nThis all happened on Friday and Saturday day. On Sunday I asked around to some people if they drank from the liquor. There were three persons who admitted it and some of them said they had remorse. One of those persons said all the other names of the people who drank. And some of those names were persons who said they didn't drink at all. \n\nThis is where is started to get disappointed and couldn't believe some of my best friends lied to me. Of course some of them also had remorse but one person didn't. And this was the person who brought the alcohol with here. Is just wanted to know why she did it but she just didn't have a normal reason. After I pushed about it she said I shouldn't be so childish and just forget about it. \n\nBut now I not disappointed anymore but am leaning more to the angry side. Tomorrow I will have a chance to have a conversation with here in person and I hope this will get things straight.\n\nSo AITA for desiding about not trusting her anymore and  getting her bottle of Liquor?",

Everything is already booked and cannot be cancelled. Prior parties which costed a good amount of money. Wedding invitations to HUNDREDS of people are already made. \n\nI agreed to it. They asked me if I was ready and they found a girl and yeah. She's going to be pissed more than I can put into words if I say nevermind.

He was home at 9, and spent the last 4 hours of the time at work riding in a car so the opportunity to text or call was abundant. I could have texted to ask, but since I always make it a priority to let him know timing when the situation is reversed it seems the same should be expected of him.

      "description": "So when I was a teenager (from the age of about 16 til I was 19 or 20) I had extremely poor mental health. Way beyond teenage angst, I was suicidally depressed and so anxious that I couldn't order coffee in a coffee shop or even go into a resturant without a full anxiety attack. I still suffer from moderate anxiety and occasional bouts of depression (now 24) but not anything on the scale I used to.\nDuring this entire period, my dad made things significantly worse. He would tell me constantly to 'get over it', that I was doing it for attention, get mad at me for becoming mute and panicky in social situations etc etc.\nObviously I got better, but I have the scars to show for it.\n\nIn the last year my younger brother (20) has developed mental health issues. He's not very forthcoming with what's up, but he's had a falling out with his friends and is probably quote depressed.\n\nCritically, however, my dad is being really supportive and is really concerned for his well-being. Obviously I am glad that he has changed his attitude. Probably the recent campaigns about mental health have gone a long way towards changing his attitude, and I'm not denying that that is great.\n\nHowever there is a large, festering chunk of me that is really resentful and quite hurt that my dad cares and is providing my brother the support that I needed when I was a teenager and really didn't get, and this is materialising in me lashing out and being honestly quite nasty to my brother.\n\nI /know/ that this is not a good way to feel about the situation, I know that I need to reign in my outward display of resentment, but am I an asshole for resenting in the first place?\n\nTL;DR I suffered really bad mental health as a teenager and got zero parental support, now that my brother is going through Some Shit, I am resentful that my dad is supportive.\n",

      "description": "Over the holidays, I (20F) brought my boyfriend (27M) to stay for two weeks with my family. I have two sisters, 16 and 18. Everything was going well, boyfriend was polite with everyone but spent more time with 18yo sister since they have more in common, and 16yo sister can be loud, hypersensitive, and frankly a pill, and has a history of vindictive and histrionic behavior (6 months ago she wrote a note calling me a fat whore, then left it on my desk where she knew I would find it). She is kind of a troubled kid, struggled with some anxiety and depression, but has been growing up a lot lately. She is younger and can’t always talk about the topics we enjoy (politics), and is sensitive about her inability to participate. We do our best but obviously we can’t modify our conversation completely. \n\nOne night the four of us are hanging out and 16yo sister says something unintentionally funny—“Margaret Sanger didn’t study eugenics in college...at least not formally”. She says this with a totally straight face. Boyfriend laughs. Sister gets offended, boyfriend says he’s sorry and doesn’t mean anything by it, it was just really funny. Sister gets mad and storms up the stairs. This is around 7pm.\n\nAround 11pm, bf goes upstairs and there is dog shit in his bed. Wet, hot dog shit. Like fresh turds. They are from his barely ambulatory pug, who has been downstairs all day and can barely walk down the sidewalk, much less jump on the bed or climb an entire flight of stairs. The turds are inside the bed which is made. They were clearly put there intentionally, and 16 year old sister was the only person upstairs. I know it’s her.\n\nThe next day I confront her about it. I say I know it was her, because she was the only one upstairs and it fits her pattern of vindictive behavior (fat whore incident). I tell her to apologize to my boyfriend and that if this behavior continues it will damage our relationship. Later my dad gets really upset and tells me that I was wrong for bringing up the note incident with her, since I already forgave her for it (true, I did forgive her and have moved on, but I wasn’t bringing it up to berate her, just to highlight a pattern of behavior). \n\nAITA for assuming it was her? For bringing up the note incident? Should I have handled this differently?\n\n",

      "description": "For some background, we live in Canada. I am white and she is Filipino, but is not permanent resident of Canada and working on her citizenship. We are both in our early 30's, live together, and plan to marry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the issue, she is always sending money back home to her mother and sisters (Mother in her 50's, 3 sisters all 25+). Obviously I did not care about this when we started dating 3 years ago. It's her money and she can spend it anyway she wants. At the time she had very few expenses since her employer provided her with housing, food, transport, etc. Now she has a different job (RPN) so she doesn't have any of those expenses covered by her employer and we live together and rent while trying to save for a house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where things got messy. She is still sending a large amount of her income to her family back home, sometimes to the point where she is short on her half of the bills. I mentioned we are trying to save for a house and both agreed we'd contribute $x to the house saving account each month. It's been 6 months and not once has she contributed her full share to the house fund. At most she would reach 20% of what we agreed to. This leaves me picking up all the slack in the bills and also left making the only meaningful contributions to savings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't be so upset with her sending money home, but the mother works full time in a decent job. My GF also paid for all 3 of her sisters to get post-secondary education and they have since graduated. NONE of them are working in their fields, nor are they working full time. Only 1 of the 3 make enough money to even help out with the bills at home. They just live at home carefree since big sister sends them money each month. This pisses me off beyond belief (I'm not mad at the mom, just the sisters). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally broke down when I realized we will never get ahead, never be able to do anything fun like vacations, and definitely never be able to afford a house.  AITA for telling her either she stops sending so much money home (we would set an amount we both can agree on and send that each month), or I am done with the relationship? She says I \"just don't understand her culture\" and maybe she's right, but it feels like she has not consideration for my feelings in the situation. So, AITA here? ",

      "description": "Before i begin, some background info about this teacher: She's only taught us for 2 months, &amp; though i feel she does care for the wellbeing of our class, she can come across rather passive-aggressive &amp; anal.\n\nYesterday, we were having a discussion in class. My friend (R) had raised her hand to ask a question that was well received by this teacher (Mrs T) who then went on to answer her. I had wanted to ask a similar question before this &amp; even after the question was answered, i felt i needed to clarify again as she did not cover part of what i had wanted to ask, so naturally i raised my hand to clarify my doubt:\n\n\"In response to what R has asked, i'm still unsure if aspect y needs to be addressed in our answer if the text dosen't explicitly point it out?\" \n\nImmediately, she looked at me with this overexaggerated horror, her eyes staring in anger &amp; her mouth widely agape, almost as though she had witnessed me committing a murder. Then followed her 5 second long, earpiercing shrill. With no intent to mock, she looked just like a child screaming her head off in a tantrum. \n\nThe entire class was just terrified &amp; shocked. This outburst came from nowhere &amp; in instinctive respose to her shrill, we abruptly moved our seats backward &amp; i, along with a few other friends who have shared, felt like tearing because this dramatic reaction was unexpected given the fact that i merely asked a question. To quote in her words, i \"did not pay attention to what R had already clarified\"\n\nTo back herself up &amp; to validate her feeling the victim, she asked the class, \"Class, am i in the wrong for being angry at hellohappyfeet's question? Do you all too, think this question is of low quality because i have already answered it?\" To which, two of my classmates responded with slight nods because she was staring at them, hoping for that validation. I feel that this was intended to guilt trip me because she had seen how the class so negatively responded by being terrified following her shrill. In all sincerity, I'm saying this not out of defense but from hearing first hand her tone &amp; sensing strongly that she did it to make me feel as though my question was the cause of her anger. She intentionally avoided eye contact with me the rest of the lesson.\n\nThough its been a day &amp; may seem like an issue that i shouldn't be mulling over anymore, i can't help but feel her sudden shrilling was absolutely unnecessary, uncalled for &amp; unprofessional. \n\nI felt very wronged &amp; couldn't help but tear after the lesson because she explicitly accused me of not paying attention in class when i clearly did &amp; to me, screaming out of nowhere like that inevitably scars the heart. \n\nAfter reflecting over it, i see that perhaps she may have had a lot of pent up stress teaching, &amp; released that unintentionally in the heat of the moment after how she couldn't understand why i would ask that similar question.\n\nSo In all sincerity, AITA?",

      "description": "This happened back in January 2017 and I still end up thinking about it from time to time. \n\nSo in my area, we have a bar that's become quite popular for bands or other artists to come to do shows or screenings of their work. One of the artists to come for an event is a filmmaker I look up to and I consider to be a personal hero of mine, and it was going to be a fan screening of one of his movies - along with a chill hangout event afterward that would end when the bar closed at 2am - something I told my spouse in advance, which he claims either never happened or he doesn't remember. \n\nI was very excited for the event and made it clear to my spouse how much it meant for me to go, as I have tremendous social anxiety and I never get out much. It was also going to be a means for another friend of mine, who is also an aspiring filmmaker like I am, to meet new people as well. The night went along fairly smoothly and it was the happiest I had been in years, but periodically during the night I'd get occasional buzzes from my phone that I'd tried to answer with how bad the Wi-Fi was. However, I wouldn't be alerted to all of them due to my phone being old and buggy. Even with my ringer on the highest setting, I wouldn't hear it or be notified of any text messages or notifications I would be getting - all of that being made worse by the bar being noisy and me being hard of hearing.\n\nThe night is coming to a close and last calls are being made, so my friend decides to call his mom to come pick us up since neither of us drove at the time. As I'm helping them all their supplies packed and to their car, my phone starts to go off and I answer it. It's my spouse, who is very upset with me for not answering my phone. I ask him to repeat since it's noisy inside, and he immediately accuses me of being drunk, which I wasn't and I rarely drink. I tell him that were already preparing to leave, and he's still upset with me. I tried explaining the situation about my phone not being responsive, but he doesn't buy it and proceeds to get more upset - which can be audibly heard from my phone outside. He said something to the tune of he'd see me at home, then hung up before I could get much else in.\n\nI'm sorry if this is more of a thread for the relationship advice sub, but I'm not sure if I'm the asshole in this situation or not - let alone for letting it bother me nearly two years later.",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I both have friends that we thought would be a good match for each other.  We’ve been talking them up to each other for a little bit now and made plans for the four of us to meet up at a bar last night.  It was supposed to just be a casual hangout kind of thing, not a date. \n\nWhen we do meet up my girlfriend’s friend pretty much ignored any attempts he made to start of conversation with her.  She’d either say nothing or give one word answers before going back to talking to my girlfriend.  Then she was outright rude to him.  Her and my girlfriend were talking about coffee and still just trying to have a conversation with this girl my buddy said actually the darker coffee has less caffeine.  My girlfriend’s friend did like an exaggerated nerd type voice and mocked what he said.  Then my girlfriend and her busted out laughing right in front of him like it was the most hilarious thing ever.  It was awkward as fuck.  \n\nAt that point I just tried to have my own conversation with my friend.  Once we started talking my girlfriend and her friend actually got up and moved.  I thought they were just going to the bathroom or something, but they just went to a different part of the bar and stayed there the rest of the night.  My buddy took it well as far as I could tell, but I still felt bad for building up this meeting to him to have it turn out to be so shit.  \n\nMy girlfriend doesn’t get why I’m angry at her and her friend.  She said her friend wasn’t feeling it and shouldn’t be forced to fake it.  I mean she’s technically right, but it doesn’t make it any less fucking rude.  There are friends of her’s that I absolutely cannot stand and I would never treat them like that.  Well at least I wouldn’t before.  I mean I shouldn’t be forced to fake anything anymore.  ",

      "description": "A friend and I both recently graduated from college and we've been talking about how difficult it is to find a job. A couple of weeks ago, I got an offer for a part-time job in my field, while my friend's been struggling to land interviews. Feeling kind of bad for him, because he's always complaining about paying rent and his student debt, I sat down with him for hours, helped him rework his resume, even helped build him a portfolio to help him stand out a bit more in the job search. \n\nFast forward to this week, a mutual friend of ours posted on his Facebook that he was hiring full time for a position at his company. I matched all the qualifications, all the criteria, and have the work experience and portfolio for someone he's looking for with better benefits and better pay than this part-time job I'm about to start.\n\nFriend #1 told me he saw the post and is going to apply. Thing is, I know in a head to head comparison, I would have the stronger resume/skill set. And while there's obviously no guarantee I would get the job either, I feel like applying would lower this friend's chances at the job himself.\n\nWIBTA for applying to the job because I feel like I'm more qualified?",

      "description": "A guy I work with is special needs.  In any case, I just started a new job and this guy works in my department.  Every single meeting I’m in with him, which is thankfully infrequent, is completely derailed because he personally answers any question asked and devolves into conversation about irellavant details.  The protocol seemed to be to just let him talk, and when he hits a natural stop, say “thanks &lt;name&gt;” and then move on. \n\nThis strategy generally fails because this man does not breathe.  It’s just a single, uninterrupted run-on sentence sometimes spanning one or two minutes where nobody can slip in a “thanks” or “sounds good” so we’re all stuck listening to him.  I don’t say anything because I’m relatively new and people just seem to deal with it.  Whatever, wasted meeting time isn’t the worst thing in the world, just annoying.  I eventually talk with my manager, who is on these calls, about him and his useless tangents, who seemed appalled that I even brought this topic up.  Said that he can be a little long winded but we need to be respectful.  Keep in mind the majority of these uninvited monologues start on topic, quickly get off track, and will continue relentlessly any time there’s a lull for him to speak.  My manager disagrees that this is disruptive behavior.  \n\nFast forward a couple months, I’m in charge of organizing team meetings and heading a task for a project.  Lo and behold the project leader brings on Dr. Rambleton to our project and he’s in the meetings I’ll be heading.  Cool.  First meeting with the team, things are already being derailed, times being wasted.  As the person leading the meeting I have a list of things that need to get sorted out, so I politely ask my coworker, who answers other people’s unaddressed questions with things like “I don’t know but you could probably ask &lt;name of other person on the call&gt; I’ve talked to him before.. maybe a couple months ago... for this project the um... (etc.)”, to limit talking in the call for things that are important or relevant.  This does not help.  I have to once again pause the meeting to ask this guy to only speak when addressed, hoping we can squeeze out what we need to talk about in the little remaining time we have.  This does not help so I mute his mic and continue the meeting.  We finally get through the itinerary.\n\nFast forward later in the day I see some project members and they’re giving me the “not cool, dude” treatment.  Basically treating me like I was being an asshole to the guy.  Reminding me that he’s special needs.  What the hell am I supposed to do? Let him derail our meetings?\n\n",

      "description": "To make a long story short, my uncle who also happens to be my godfather ended a 4 year long battle with melanoma this on Friday morning.\n\nI’m in the military and took emergency leave the prior weekend once I learned he was in hospice care, because not only is he my uncle, he’s my godfather, my dads identical twin, and has always been a second father to me. Him passing might as well be the equivalent of my dad passing away.\n\nMy wife was fine originally, and she was glad I was going but sad she couldn’t tag along because of her work. I told her it’s not a big deal, she’ll be there in spirit and love. I fly home, everything is fine.\n\nAbout midway through the week she begins to lose her shit because I’m not talking to her enough or FaceTiming long enough for her when I’m at home. I could have definitely talked to her more, but the majority of my time was spent consoling my father who was watching his identical twin pass away. \n\nFriday morning, he passed away. My dad is an absolute fucking wreck and it kills me to see him like this. I’ve never seen him cry before and he’s bawling his eyes out and completely devastated. My wife tells me now that my uncle is dead, I should come home early to be with her again. This really pisses me off and I get irritated and visibly upset with her on FaceTime and she tells me she has to go. \n\nShe stops texting me, won’t answer my phone calls, and only responds “love you” when I tell her “I love you”. Haven’t heard much from her all weekend.\n\nI fly back today, and she tells me she’s not getting me from the airport and I have to take a Lyft. She tells me this, mind you, when I’m already on the plane and she promised me she would pick me up. \n\nI’m on my way home right now but when I get home, I’m considering going to a friends house for a few days. This was a major death in our family and she was only concerned with herself the entire trip. I get that it’s because she misses me and wants me to be home, but this was absolutely ridiculous. She never did anything mean or cussed me out or anything, just stopped responding and became very distant. I’m super pissed and don’t want to talk to her at all tonight.\n\nAm I the asshole here? I don’t mean to paint her in a bad light at all, because I definitely could have communicated better this trip, but I don’t know how to handle this. Perhaps this would be better x-posted into relationship advice?\n\nThank you all in advance. ",

      "description": "Alright, so this requires a little backstory. I’m changing names for privacy reasons + using a throwaway. \n\nI’ve been friends with Bella since I was 7 years old. We met in second grade and played soccer together. We were close, but not insanely close. In middle school, she moved to a different state, so I lost contact with her. She came back our freshman year of high school. \n\nEver since then, we’ve been inseparable. We play the same sport (same team), are in the same friend groups. We’ve helped each other through a lot. Mostly, I help her through boy problems and such. \n\nTwo days ago, I was dumped. \n\nI’ve was in relationship with a junior (we’re both seniors), we’ll call him Jacob. Originally, I was planning to take him to prom, until things got a bit rocky. Every day, he would change his mind about if he wanted to date me or remain friends. It was a shitty, flip-flopping situation on his part. I really felt hurt - like he was using me. \n\nDuring this time, I noticed she was texting him - but she started to hide her phone away from me at lunch. So I was getting REALLY suspicious. \n\nTwo days ago, I couldn’t do it anymore and cut off all communication with him after he “dumped” me for the third or fourth time. I went off at him and refused to speak to him. \n\nBella calls and tells me that the reason she was talking to Jacob was because he contacted her to make sure I would be okay after the breakup. I was fine, but overall pissed at the situation with Jacob. They continue to talk as friends. \n\nEverything was better until today I get a text from Bella. She asks me if it’s okay to take Jacob, the boy who dumped me two days ago, to prom. Now, Bella and I were planning to be in the same prom group with all of our other friends. We had a whole prom weekend planned and such. \n\nI said no because I’m not comfortable with that and she should find someone else. She retorts that she doesn’t have anyone else, and that she won’t go to prom AT ALL if she can’t get a date. I said you can get someone else. She said no, I don’t have any options. \n\nI don’t have a date to prom, neither does a mutual friend of ours. I was intending on going solo if she didn’t have anyone else, but she refuses to. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying no?",

      "description": "So here’s the deal. I like hot stuff. I wanted to make my own salsa, hot sauce, pepper flakes, and powders. I research any and everything extensively before I do something. Well I bought some seeds that my wife was well aware of. I got some jalapeños, Carolina reapers ext. I germinated them no problems. My wife didn’t say anything at this point. It’s too cold currently to start seedlings outside and I wanted to get a head start so I could increase my yield on peppers. Well I asked her if it was okay if I bought the necessary bulbs and a clamp light for the grow box and she said sure. I said okay great. Well my set-up came today and I put it all together and just in time because my seedlings have now sprouted. I put them under the light in the box and left for the gym. I could tell something was up because she was quiet at the time. So omw to the gym she blows my phone up about how this is unsafe and read the warning on the cfl bulb that it can cause cancer etc. I put my foot down and said the set-up is staying because I’ve already put work into it. She’s threatening saying it’s an eye sore and is going to go stay at her parents if it stays because it’s dangerous and doesn’t want it in the house. She currently cut it off while I’m not there which literally defeats the purpose and I’m trying to keep my cool. Currently cutting my workout short to go deal with this which pisses me off as well. I don’t have anything that I can call mine in our entire house except my PlayStation, computer, my office chair, and what’s in my closet. AITA??? I’d be happy to answer any questions on this.",

      "description": "TLDR; my headphones went missing - I am pretty sure one of my housemates took them and is not telling me, so I messaged them all and told them that the four of them will be splitting the cost of new headphones for me. They ain't happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I (20F) live with four other female housemates - Sally, Rachel, Kate, and Bridget. (21F, 20F, 20F, 20F). It sucks tbh, but that's another post lmao. Okay so I came home from work one night and unplugged my headphones and threw them on a chair in our living room (they're the ones with the cord that go to the charging connector, the lightning I think its called). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was about midnight and I had to work again at 7 the next morning, so I just left them on the chair and went to bed. The next morning I get up and I can't find them anywhere. Like I looked EVERYWHERE - under the bed, in all my pockets, in between the couch cushions and nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI message my housemates and Kate says she accidentally took them to school thinking they were hers. Nbd. Kate gave them to Rachel to give to me. Rachel said she put them on the kitchen table, but I was already gone to campus for the day, so I planned to get them when I came home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get home and there are no headphones on the kitchen table. I message everyone again, and nobody knows where they are or has seen them. I don't want to accuse, but I'm pretty sure one of my housemates took them and isn't fessing up. I mean who else could it be?!??! We haven't had any people over in a few weeks, so it couldn't have been some random person. We are uni students and we live in the student district, but break-ins don't happen in our area (knock on wood) and nothing else is missing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[a little background\\]   \nOne time, Sally took Rachel's adidas slides and wore them around the house for three weeks, then kept them in her room while Rachel was trying to find them. Bridget is kind of stupid so it wouldn't surprise me if she took them and literally didn't realize they weren't hers. Rachel and Kate have a nasty habit of leaving things out in the open for days - this includes their macbook pros, ipads, phones, etc. So maybe they took them by accident again?? Also a few weeks ago I opened the fridge and somebody had helped themselves to my whole bottle of blueberry smirnoff. Like it was empty. So I am PISSED that this keeps happening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just trying to say that, it could have been intentional, it could have been an accident, but either way I want my shit back. Nobody will tell me anything, so I messaged again and told them that the four of them will be splitting the cost of new headphones for me. Now they're pissed because they don't want to pay. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

When my GF found out that sex hurt, I was find with going without until she could get it fixed. She got some tests done and her doctor never got back to her so we don’t know what’s going on with her. We only have one OB/GYN in my town, and it just closed down (both the doctors retired), so she can go anywhere else in town.\n\nCut to 4 months later and I’m getting serious blue balls and she’s still on the pill. I had a couple drinks that night and was browsing the internet. I can’t remember exactly what happened, but I called my girlfriend a prude and she got mad and said that it was an insult. I looked up the definition of prude and I called her one again (probably because I was drunk and not thinking rationally) and it upset her so much that she started crying and locked herself in the bathroom for an hour.\n\nWe got into a huge fight and she said that sex isn’t a big part of a relationship, but I don’t feel that way. That was a couple days ago and it’s weighing on me heavy. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I called my girlfriend a prude because she doesn’t want to have sex with me",

In the begining I said that I'd look out for their stuff in the sand due to the fact I didn't want to enter the water, since I'm very very very insecure about my body, and didn't want to remove my shirt to go to the beach (my gf knows all about this, and so does one of my friends). When we arrived, I got pumped to enter the water and said I'd want to go with them, but they told me to stay since I had already said that I would stay. They went, stayed in the water for around 10 minutes, and came back. I started acting weird, since I was kinda bummed due to the fact that the only time I actually feel comfortable removing my shirt I get told to stay. They went again and have been there for around 5 minutes. I know it makes sense that I stay, since I said I would, but am I the asshole for acting weird/kinda down?\nI was hoping at least my gf would allow me to go, since she also suffered from body related insecurities a while ago, but she was the one that told me to stay the most out of them all.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 2 years now and things were going awesome until recently. She has this cat, and it's just old and in terrible condition. They picked it up as a stray so exact age is unknown but vet guesses in the upper teens. It's been old and decrepit since I've been with her but 5 months ago it took a turn for the worse. Thing is, my family we probably would have put it down months ago, but shes been prolonging its life and its fucking miserable. The thing literally just lies in its bed and pisses and shits itself. It cant move more then 5 feet and is blind and I suspect deaf at this point. Honestly I'm angrier at the vet for supporting this charade but I can only imagine the money has something to do with it. \nObviously medication and surgeries are not cheap, and I've been partially footing the bill. In our recent argument I lost it. I've been patient with her for months, I've covered bills happily, only really mentioning that hey, cost is skyrocketing for an already elderly cat. I couldn't take it anymore though and just told her in plain English to \"put the fucking thing out of its misery\" and asked if shes seriously cant see how much pain it's in. I know its harsh but I didn't know how else to respond anymore, I've tried everything except pull a Dwight and kill the thing myself (not considering that) I might be coming across a little too money oriented but I dont like watching an animal die a slow, painful death because somebody cant face reality.

      "description": "Throughout the semester in one of my classes, my professor will often arrive to class a few minutes late. She may even arrive 5, or maybe even 8 minutes late to class (granted, that was one time). Despite this, she felt compelled to mark several students absent, including me presumably, for her seeing us on our phones in class (I only checked a quick text message, but didn't time it right). The following week, it bothered me to the point of asking her after class why she did that despite being late to class sometimes. I tried to be as polite as possible about it, but I don't think she was very happy that I asked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Context: The grocery store I often visit was a bit short-handed and only had 3 cashiers for checking out. One of these three lanes is a dedicated lane for pwd&amp;senior citizens. The other two are regular checkout lanes. (self checkout isn't a thing in my country). Now because of how short-handed the store was, the lines were quite long (maybe 4 people in the special line, 8+ in both the regular lanes). \n\nSituation: When I was up next (in the regular line), a woman from the special lane, left her spot and demanded that she be next in our lane.  (the special lane, though shorter, often takes a bit longer per person. Coupons, paying in coins, special discounts and promos, etc) She showed her senior card and the cashier, a bit scared, asked me if it was okay. I may have told her to\"go ahead\" but my god, I am ashamed to say that I was filled with hate and detested every inch of her.\n\nNow, was I wrong to bear these feelings? I know I should respect my elders but I had felt she was being a bit inconsiderate. I let her go ahead of me because honestly, I dislike unnecessary confrontation.. especially since I could easily be the one in the wrong. She had bought standard groceries, and she didnt even seem to be in an urgent rush after getting her way (though this is my opinion) Am open to your thoughts. Thank you.",

I always invite him because I love him and always want him with me, but he doesnt like clubs or nights out so declines\n\nWhen ever I say I want to go out theres always a reason why this upsets him. Eg, me and my bf always see each other during weekends. Due to distance we dont get weekdays together, so when my friends where going out on a Friday, I said I wanted to join them and he was invited as well. Of course he declined. when Friday came he said he didn't think it was fair I planned things over the time we are ment to see each other. We had a big fight about it  and I apologised and said I wouldn't do it again. \n\nThen a few weeks later my pal was performing at a small gig and I said I wanted to go see her. Again it was on the weekend. he told me that I was doing it again and it was really upsetting to him that i kept going out with friends and not spending time with him. I asked him why he couldn't come with and he said he had work the next morning, so couldn't. Once again there was a big fight and I ended up leaving before the end of the gig to go home alone.\n\nAnyway fast forward to today, he was over cause hes on holiday and doesnt have work, but has to go home cause hes got stuff to do tomorrow at his house.\n\nI have college tomorrow and it takes too long to get to my college from his house so we say goodbye and leave each other with plans for me to go to his tomorrow. All seems good. \n\nMy friends then ask me if I'm busy and if I want to come into town, and I told then sure since I have no other plans.\n\nI tell my bf that I'm going just cause I like to keep him in the loop and he starts asking me why  if I could afford to go out, didn't I want to come to his house instead? I didn't know what to say, I feel like shit again, but I dont know what I did wrong. Hes not talking to me now, has ignored all my messages and now I'm questioning everything. \n\nAm I being the dick here?? I feel like I'm to blame but I also feel like hes being some what controlling?? There a few more things that bother me  but word count ",

      "description": "Last week, there was a discussion in my workplace over an exhibition we'd had. \n\nTo preface this, I'm white, just to clarify why I'm concerned about my potential assholery here. PoC is shorthand for person of colour. \n\nLet me tell you about the exhibition first. First day of the exhibition, an artist from the group who didn't respond to any e-mails and didn't sign up for a space showed up and said they needed a space for a bar and a performance. The organizing team said no, and that the space and schedule was full. Me being outside the organizing team and just another participant, I only heard about it when I saw the team looking kinda done and upset backstage.\n\nShortly after the beginning of the exhibition, the artist and some friends of theirs showed up, protesting and sitting in front of the exhibition handing out flyers about how they had been excluded from the exhibition on the grounds of the organizing team's racism and oppression of women of colour. They also sold beer there, in the name of solidarity with their cause. \n\nNow, this is where I was starting to feel irritated. I think the organizing team was acting in accordance with their schedule and while I think that they could have been a bit more lenient, I didn't think it was racist or misogynist of them to say that they had no more space for that installation/performance, especially since the space /was/ tight and that artist /had/ not responded to their reminders, which everyone else who was participating had done. \n\nIn the discussion we had about the exhibition, some people were adamant in saying that we needed to talk about racism. But I thought that while racism was important to address, calling this incident one that resulted from racist behaviour on the part of the organizing team would be to miss the point, which, to me, looked much like one artist appearing on the day of the opening, asking for the organizing team to change the setup and schedule for them, getting angry when rejected and trying to blame the organizers for the artist's own failure to show up earlier and their earlier lack of communication.\n\nDuring the discussion I said that I thought that there had been an agreement in the group about the deadlines for entering the exhibition, and that I understand that someone would be angry about being rejected, but that I also thought that the issue here was cooperation and that I didn't find it fair how the artist whose performance had been refused had acted towards the organizers. \n\nWhat do you think?\nAm I the asshole for thinking this way?

      "description": "My dad has not been a pretty toxic influence for most of my life. He was emotionally abusive and manipulative with my sister, my mom, and I, and has had problems with addiction for his whole life. As a result, my mom kicked him out of the house about 10 years ago when I was 14 and my sister 15. My mom is the sole bread-winner for the family so the house and basically everything in it was purchased by her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she first threatened to kick him out, his counter threat was that he would never come to visit my sister or I, and when he was kicked out he stayed true to his word and didn't speak to us for 4 years. He came to my sister's high school graduation, and since then we've only spoken on holidays, and only seen him at graduations. He's currently sober and has been for the past 9 years, and he's the manager of a sober-living house where he gets compensated with a room &amp; food, but as he's getting older that situation is going to expire soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow in all of this time, my grandma (my dad's mom) has been declining in health and myself, my mom, and my sister have been the ones taking care of her. She's 90 now, and my dad is 70 and his eyesight is fading (he's diabetic and isn't really taking care of himself). My grandma has invited my dad to come stay with her so that they can sort of take care of each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat presents one major complication, though, because my grandma has a reverse mortgage on her home, and when she dies the bank will take her house. That will leave my dad without a place to live, in his 70s, with poor or no eyesight. Here's where I'm conflicted, he's been abusive and manipulative to our whole family since I've been born, I don't know if I could bring myself to help him. I don't think he would do the same if the roles were reversed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a compassionate person and the idea of leaving him to fend for himself in his state makes me queasy, but I also don't know if I could help him. I work in theatre and don't have a lot of disposable income, but even if I had the means to help, I'm not sure I would. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to help my dad?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Dad has been an asshole, now he needs help and I don't want to bear the responsibility.

Then, I saw that someone had grabbed her hand and he/she/it handed it to me. I couldn't see the person. I pulled her up and she hugged me out of trauma. Then I took her home where she had a long shower and immediately I dropped her home. All of this happened within half hour so we couldn't talk Bout it.

      "description": "So, this might make me seem like a spoiled brat, but PLEASE hear me out. \n\nSo, sometimes on our relationship, I would see him work extra hard or is tired, so I would go the extra mile to make him food and send it to work etc. Mind you, I’m happy to do this, and I don’t request anything in return, because I enjoy making it for him. But the thing is, these “extra mile” things take effort, things like going out of my way after work to buy ingredients, waking up an hour or two earlier to start cooking etc, which I’m willing to do. \n\nThe thing that annoys me now, is that my boyfriend would keep promising to do these things as well, but have no clue or idea about how much effort and sacrifice it takes to make it happen. He will say “I will make you this, or that” knowing we won’t have the ingredients nor will have time to buy them. \n\nIt all came to a head today, when I’m getting ready to leave and go to work, when he makes a comment saying “oh don’t forget the tuna salad, I’ll make you a sandwich” knowing that he has no bread to make it, and I’m literally two minutes from leaving. I literally asked him to buy it yesterday if he was serious, but he insisted he would buy it “tomorrow” at 8 am (I have to leave at 8:30 am for work). I snapped and said if he doesn’t want to put in effort for me, stop giving me false hope. \n\nI’m seriously annoyed because I don’t ask for him to make me food or do something nice, but STOP creating ideas when you don’t go through with them. But now I’m thinking if my reaction is legitimate or not.  \n\nAny thoughts?",

      "description": "I befriended this girl we’ll call “Em” in the freshman year of high school. She has a rough family life with her single mom and a brother who committed an extremely serious crime. we’re close friends but the situation started about a month ago, when she tells me she can’t go on a trip that she said she would go to. I thought it was understandable, $120 is kinda pricy for universal studios. I suggested she could cut down on the weed to save up, but she says she hasn’t smoked in a month and that not every parent hands their child money like my parents (which isn’t true).\n\nThen I asked her if she’s going to join the tennis team, something she’s talked about for months. She previously told me she really wants to get back into the sport and that she had a crush on the coach (who’s in his mid 50s). But then she denies ever saying that, which frustrated me cause that whole “i have a crush on ur coach” part wasn’t easy to forget. \n\nThis isn’t the first time she said she’d do something, but leave me hanging. Like homecoming, she said she would go but denied saying it right after i told her i bought my tickets. I nearly spent the night feeling alone and embarrassed. And it’s also not the first time she’s said anything strange. she’s also told me jokes about her mom threatening to kick her out of the house.\n\nSo I called her out on this pattern of behavior but she said I just couldn’t take “no” for an answer.  I told her I’m more comfortable with her saying “no” the first time than saying “no” later. All of her responses were not serious, it was just “lol” and “why do you care” while I was going off on a serious tangent. I’ve actually never been “the mom friend” to her, this is probably the first time I’ve confronted her on anything. \n\nBesides the stuff above, she’s also attempted to lose her virginity to an 18 yr old when she was 15, called me gay for sitting next to her, dropped 2 classes and dropped other close friends (one of them only asked where her hickey came from. It was nothing major, imo). I told her this pattern of behavior is worrying me and disappointing. To this she responds “just don’t talk to me if I’m disappointing”. I finally said “(Em), shutting people out of your life won’t improve it. It’s time to take things seriously cause this really isn’t funny anymore”\n\nI didn’t talk to her except for a “happy birthday” a week later and she texts me a few days after that saying “oof, so are we talking or what?” I forgot to respond to it and 2 weeks later, she blocks me on literally every social media. \n\nYes, there are things that has made her life shittier than the average teenager’s. But sometimes she lives under the false impression that my life is great, so I don’t feel a lot of support from her when something happens to me. I support her in the long run, but I do believe there’s a limit to what we support. \n\nAITA?",

They're really helpful, I get taken out for lunch on a regular basis, they joke around, they humblebrag, etc. Of course, only the guys are like this.

She had been in bed due to having had a bad health week and was then quite irritated with us for the inconvenience.\n\nNow I'm normally happy as larry if my food arrives at an earlier time than anticipated but this specifically bugged me, mainly because we'd ordered the food intentionally for this time instead of the general ASAP. As we walked up the path to my partners house the delivery lad was walking down and made a joke about how we should wait till we get home to order pizza.\n\nAITA for a) not tipping him, and b) getting annoyed at the comment he made?

      "description": "I’m on mobile so bare with me. This is only my second post on Reddit. \n\nThis happened when I was younger. I was probably about 12 years old. My sister being about 7 years old and has special needs. You can physically tell she has special needs. It takes her a while to learn things therefore at the time she didn’t know much for manners. \n\nMy mom took my sister, my friend and I to the mall one day. We were in the food court enjoying lunch. We overheard the people beside us talking about a little person that was directly behind me. My sister never seen a little person before and because she was curious she pointed at him and said “mom, what’s that?” \n\nMy mom told her to never mind and just eat. I then looked back to see what she was pointing at. My friend says “(my name) don’t look!” I turned my head back and continued to mind our own business. \n\nNot even 5 minutes later, this girl (probably a bit older than my friend and I) and her mom came up to us and said loudly “You are the rudest people we’ve ever met! Staring and pointing at that person was so rude!” \n\nThe mom goes over to my mom and says loudly “Teach your retarded kids some f*cking manners!” And they walk away. My mom was offended by the r-word and sternly calls for the girl and her mom to come back but they ignore her and keep walking. It was embarrassing! Everyone was staring at us. The cleaning lady came over and asked us what happened and if we are okay. She asked us if we wanted to file a report or something (I was too young to really understand what she said so I don’t really remember exactly). We just said no and moved on with our day.\n\nI still think about it to this day and I still wonder if we are the assholes or are the girl and her mother the assholes? ",

      "description": "So this happened recently and I’ve been feeling like total shit because of it. I’m stationed somewhere in the Midwest, about one thousand miles plus away from my home. My friend, lets call her Friend is having her twenty first birthday and I wanted to get her something special for her. I was browsing around Redbubble and Hot Topic, as those are places she likes to shop at and I send her pictures of the things that might interest her. She shoots them down without missing a beat - politely yes, but it’s still a little disheartening. She tells me that presents should be surprises - that isn’t like her at all though. She hates surprises and will beg constantly for hints or clues until I give in completely and tell her her gift. \n\nShe hasn’t told me anything that she likes recently, so I’m flying by the seat of my pants and drilling into my brain to think of ideas that she likes. She’s good at art and spiral notebooks are in season, let’s try that. After talking to her some more and showing her some spiral notebook ideas that I thought were gorgeous and right up her alley (I thought at least) she doesn’t like them either. Okay, no problem. She’s entitled to her own opinions and what she wants, I’ll go and find something else. I find some graphic tees and send her pictures of them. Once again, she doesn’t like them. Okay, she’s being a little picky here, that’s fine, like I said, she’s entitled to her opinions and what she likes, I’ll find something else. By the third time I’m feeling a little frustrated because the inner perfectionist inside of me keeps telling me that it has to be a good gift for her. I ask her what she likes, because obliviously I’m messing something up or not understanding what she really likes and she replies with a few ideas along with a “I thought you knew what I liked.” \n\nOkay. Pause. That not only hurt, but pissed me off a little. I was trying my hardest to find her a gift that she likes and she responds with that? \nI didn’t respond for a bit, and instead I found more stuff to show her. After a while we begin to talk again and she tells me, “My style has changed. And it’s not your fault for not knowing.” \n\nI’m confused and a little hurt at this point, and I tell her how I feel and how I felt like garbage because I wasn’t able to come down to see and her and I was just trying to find her a nice gift. After I tell her my feelings she replies with a \n“Nvm.” and nothing else, essentially shutting down the conversation and shutting my emotional state down. I felt like she didn’t want to hear about my opinions and feelings when I was trying so hard in order to find out hers. I haven’t responded, and I don’t think I should because I’m already upset at her. Do I have a right to be upset here? AITA? \n\n",

      "description": "Context. This happened about 3 years ago, ive never figured out if i was right for being so pissed off or if i was totally out of line. The two other people who witnessed the argument refuse to have any input (which is fair enough really)\n\nWhat happened, we were there for her birthday. It was about 3 days after, we'd celebrated the day before. I was there with my then bf and his sister we were all mutual friends. So the sister (M) had a migraine so was lying prone on the couch, couldnt move. And the bf (L) had already helped out a ton, so i offered to cook dinner. We went out, bought all the ingredients (i paid for everything) and when we got back i asked my friend (B) to wash the dishes because i needed the bench room. These were dishes that had probably been sitting for a week at least, her housemate doesnt wash them because she has 3 jobs and teaches so shes still working even whe she comes home, not to mention her uni course. While B had one class a week and did nothing else.\n\nB said she would do the dishes after dinner. I told her i needed the bench room now, can you do them now please. She kept refusing.\n\nI got a little upset a little quicker than i probably needed to but cleanliness has always been a problem with B, she wasnt even showering until i started badgering about how much she stank when she didnt for a week. She kept saying not all the dishes were hers, i reminded her her housemate has 50 other things to do while B doesnt. \n\nIn the end we got to yelling, and after years of trying to help this girl and getting nothing in return (not even a thankyou. Im the one who paid her rent every couple months when she didnt budget properly) i called her a lazy bitch and called her out on a few of the things ive done for her, like clean her apartment for inspection day and empty her cats litter etc \n\nShe went to her room and stayed there until dinner was ready. L ended up washing the dishes for me. And i ended up yelling at B further that if she was going to eat what id made she was going to do it out in the lounge with the rest of us and not in her room (she did but made sure to act as scorned as possible).\n\nAnd  no, there are no chores that B does. The floor doesnt get vaccumed, clothes dont get washed, or hung, or folded. Dishes stay on the bench for up to a month at a time, pins get left on the floor despite knowing the cats will pick them up etc etc\n\nYes her housemate could do more, but as i said she works 3 jobs and goes to uni, and teaches. She has enough on her plate to have an excuse, my friend had one class a week, and thinks shes writing a book... there are enough hours in the day to vaccum between chapters (or god forbid shower).\n\n...........\n\nTLDR asked friend to wash the dishes so i could cook dinner for everyone, she refused, saying she would do them after dinner despite me needing the bench space now, and the argument ended in me calling her a lazy bitch and her storming off to her room.\n\nAm i the asshole?",

My boyfriend started smoking early in our relationship and he was the typical lightweight new smoker. It was fine when it was only a few times a week but now he's smoking everyday too. Everytime I smoke he wants to share with me, which I wouldn't mind except for when he's high he either is very physically rough (playful but he's stronger than me so I regularly get hurt) or he acts incapable of doing anything and makes me do everything. He often pays for the weed for both of us so it's not about the money but about how we interact when he's high. He's just having a good time but I get sick of the roughhousing and laziness. \n\nI still plan on letting him smoke whenever  he wants but AITA not wanting him to smoke with me anymore? Even if I smoke 5-8 times a day? ",

      "description": "So basically I have an old truck I have been wanting to sell for a while because it’s diesel and I can’t deal with all the problems as a teenager right now. My parents told me they would be fine with me selling it and buying a new truck as long as I understand they still own it. So I put it up for sale and a guy wants to trade me this really nice truck in great condition because he wants a diesel, and our appraisals are almost the same and I love the look of his truck and it’s gas and I’m very good condition. \n\nWe chatted for a while and I sent him all the stuff about my truck and he sent me all his stuff and we agreed on trading this weekend. I told my parents about it and my dad keeps blowing it off and saying he is having second thoughts and wants to research some stuff before selling the truck.\n\nNow, this is what my dad ALWAYS does when he’s not interested in me doing something. He just keeps trying to blow it off until hopefully I forget about it. So now I am set up to trade trucks with this guy and he is keeping it from other sales for me and my dad is telling me no now after he clearly told me yes earlier.\n\nSo this is my question: am I an asshole if I cancel this deal after I told the guy I would this weekend and he cancelled other offers with people? Or is my dad being the asshole for not letting me sell it after saying I could at any time? ",

      "description": "Originally I thought it was over with the original post, so I never thought much of it.\n\nThat couldn't have been further from the truth as I now realize that having my \"best friends\" as roommates is far superior than not rooming with them anymore.\n\nOriginal post found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ai39dr/aita_for_wanting_to_abondon_my_roommates/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nBasically, after I moved out, I did my best to convey to these girls that they were still my best friends, and that we shouldn't go our separate ways over my decision to move out. I thought all was well, and that we'd be capable of remaining close, but about a week later things started to go downhill.\n\n\nI hear from some of my other friends from the basketball team that there's several rumors going around about me. Including things like I'm a messy little slob, I’m incredibly fake and hate most of the students at the school, and worst kd all, the reason I don't take boys up into my room is because I've carried an STD since middle school. All of these things are grossly false, except for the fact that I’m messy (though the stories attached to the rumors are greatly exaggerated), and I'm livid. As much as I hated to believe it, Louisa and Victoria seemed like the most likely origin of the rumors.\n\nI stormed into their room after school and asked if they knew anything about the recent rumors about me, knowing fully well that they did. Louisa was pretty dodgy about it at first, but I basically got an admission of guilt from Victoria when she started heavily damage controlling the situation, and eventually Louisa told me when she realized I was 99% sure they were behind them.\n\nNow, as mad as I was. I didn't make the decision that I probably should've made, which was flooring them right then and there, and instead decided to let bygones be bygones. Though I was annoyed, believe me, I was very annoyed. Until, a week later, when not only had the original rumors gained a ton of traction, but even more were surfacing. I've been greatly affected by everything, I'm treated much differently in the eyes of a chunk of my peers because they bought into rumors that have done nothing but vilify me. At this point I'm beyond infuriated, and too irrationally pissed to simply take it to administration to take care of. They'd made me miserable when I was rooming with them, and I was just as miserable now. \n\nFun fact: ever since my departure, both girls have gotten infinitely more obsessed with boys. I’ve seen on multiple occasions two boys making their way to and from their rooms on trips to the communal bathrooms. So, what did I do to get back at them? Well, leave an anonymous tip to the night patrol that something might be going on in that room of course.\n\nLong story short, the next night both girls were caught being spitroasted, and are now facing expulsion from the school for breaking the boarding policy, which is a critical offense.

      "description": "Hi folks, LTL/FTP, finally had an intriguing but not depressing AITA moment come up. I know how I feel, but I'm curious if posting this will vindicate me and get this off my conscience. Or you're all going to verify. So this should be fun!\n\nBackground: Work-wise, our office is fairly small. There is one hallway between six offices, and it's impossible not to pass pretty much all of them to get from the break room to the front/reception. Co-worker, we'll call her L, has eleven dogs. That is not a typo. I don't think she's a dog hoarder in the negative sense, so I mean i'm not going to scurry to the ASPCA or anything. I think circumstance and dying family members dropped pairs of pups on her at a time. But lordy, the smell on her clothes just permeates everything when she's in a space for a while.\n\nSo, on to the incident. I won't bore you with the details but, I didn't sleep but 2 hours last night and then had a godawful morning. I'm walking by her office and I get hit in the face with this wall of dog stink, like that smell you get right after you washed them and they're still drying, but you didn't use enough shampoo to leave the shampoo smell and instead you get vaguely clean-ish wet dog. \n\nI'm thinking, no baby Jesus, this is not happening today. Now, L hates perfume smells, and I don't really blame her. I'll get stuffy when someone lights one of those candles or whatever, too. But here I am thinking, \"L isn't here yet, so i'm going to febreeze her office. The perfume will dissipate before she gets here and everyone wins.\" \n\nI grab the febreeze can from the bathroom and walk in like a firefighter with an extinguisher, just going ham on her carpet. A bathroom bomb gets two sprays of the can? I think I was up to about eight before I headed out of her office and put the deodorizer back in the bathroom. \n\nWell, folks, here's the problem. L WAS HERE. She was just in the back office and hadn't settled in yet. I can see hers from mine. (There's a corner in that aforementioned hallway, and ours are facing each other's.) A couple of minutes later, she gets back to her office, stands outside of it frowning for a moment, then walks up to the reception area instead of going in.\n\nYa'll, AITA?  I mean, i'm kinda mortified either way, but... curious of your verdict. Thanks!",

I have lived in American to this day (13 yrs later).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe left him because he beat her badly. He cracked her skull. Her medical records from this is what allowed her asylum in America.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to two years ago, we managed to work overs lots of things in 10 yrs. We talked on how much dad has changed. So when mother needed a helping hand in her work, we decided to bring him to America.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings went really well first. My sister and I even agreed not to mention his past. We agreed that he’s probably dying with remorse. Two months later, we found out that he makes himself the victim for everything by distorting what has happened in his favor and firmly believing that is how it happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen asked about the attack, my dad replied, “Oh yeah, I hit her once.” He remembered the actual attack VERY differently from what actually happened. He thought she took one blow to her head and got up right away, when in reality he mounted her, beat her head senseless til she was unconscious and carried to the hospital\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, he believes that he was provoked into beating my mom. Apparently, she learned on how to get asylum through spousal abuse, and somehow manipulated my dad in beating her. Therefore, to him, my mom planned this to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom almost died from that attack, how do you plan an immigration by getting beaten to death?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe found out about this very recently, that this is how he remembers it. He also told us that he cannot live and be treated like he’s the bad person and that he should be ‘forgiven’ and treated without bias on all footings because he regrets what happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause of what he said, I cannot treat him like nothing has happened and will always be biased against him. Its not what he did (I worked hard to get over that) but how he thinks about what he did that completely disgusts me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow talks of him leaving us is on the table. I do feel terrible about wasting his time and uprooting him from his life. He has nothing to go back to. To make things worse, I have told him before coming here, that even if my mom changes his mind and decides that she cannot stand him, I would sponsor his immigration process and live with him as ‘insurance’. It turns out, its me who can’t stand him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut how the hell was I supposed to know this is how he remembers it? Should I have somehow expect him to be like this? Should we have never have brought him here if we cannot forgive him unconditionally? I really believe that I forgave him for everything I knew before him coming here. But I just cannot forgive him for thinking himself as the victim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to cut my father out of my life after I brought him back in?",

      "description": "Ok, so I'm currently attending my last year of uni. We've got our schedule, I don't have problems with it. We have 4-hours lecture scheduled on Monday, 12 pm - 4 pm. I don't mind it, in fact, I'm pleased with lectures starting at 12 since I'm terrible at getting up early. However, my group is strongly against it, since they believe it would be better for us to move this lecture to Wednesday, and by doing so have 3-day weekend. I do see the reasoning behind this, but it simply doesn't work for me. I'd rather have classes from Monday to Friday, rather than moving this long lecture to Wednesday, when we already have another 4 hours lecture. By doing so we would have free Monday, but would be forced to stay 8 hours on Wednesday, from 8 am to 4 pm. \n\nI didn't like the idea, but I was the only one opposing this solution, so beside voicing my concerns I didn't do anything about this and let my classmates go to dean's office and change our schedule.\n\nAnd here it starts to get messy. Dean's office informed my classmates they need signature of EVERY person in our group to change the schedule. And the only person that didn't sign the petition was me. So now I have 20+ people pressuring me to sign it. And my only argument is \"I'd rather have classes on Monday\". However, their only argument is \"we'd rather have longer classes on Wednesday\". So, would I be the asshole if I refuse them and \"make\" them come to the classes on Monday, even though I'm the only person satisfied with this solution?",

      "description": "OK, so, some context.\n\nI once befriended some guy on Wattpad, who will currently remain anonymous. We spoke a lot, read each other's books, and liked them, and I was really happy to have someone who acknowledged my writing.\n\nRecently, he asked me to go talk to some other writer, who will also stay unnamed. He explained that he and that writer were talking until the other guy muted him, and he wanted me to go and find out why.\n\nI spoke to this writer, and here's what he said, quoting him directly:\n\n\" If you're wondering why I muted them.   Look...  If you wanna advertise a book, fine. But don't go claiming you love my book if you've never read it and just randomly vote on some chapters to create the illusion that you do. If they wanna know why I blocked them, that's the reason. \"\n\nI questioned my friend about it, and he denied it at first, but after further pressing, he admitted it. I didn't particularly care that he never read my book, I was just upset that he lied about it, *and* had done the same thing to others, too. After all, our friendship was built on the idea that we both enjoyed one another's books.\n\nAfter talking to him and telling him that he shouldn't do that to people, I muted him. Was muting him the right thing to do? Should I give him another chance? What do you guys think?",

      "description": "It's the weekend and I just woke up to my mom loudly complaining to my dad beside my bedroom door that I haven't done the dishes. I slept in and wasn't aware of them piling up. This upsets me because she could have just asked my brother to do them instead of getting mad at someone who was still asleep.\n\nYesterday morning she asked me to do the dishes in her stead since she had developed hives on her hands. I said of course, I would be glad to do so. If, my 13y brother would contribute in the workload as well. It's an understatement to say she was upset about it. She called me selfish for wanting us to get equal treatment when I was so much older. that I should share my room with him and etc. \n\n Honestly, speaking my brother(13m) and I(18f) are very incompetent. We rarely do any housechores. After finishing my sats I might move out of the state for university for next year and I'm terrified because I have zero life skills, but I am determined to learn them. My brother is going to junior high next year and he doesn't know how to clean dishes. \n\nIsn't that weird ? Am I really that self-centered and lazy for suggesting we help out together?",

We were sat after 9pm by 3 other tables that were empty at the time. Within 15 minutes two of the tables were sat and both had children less than a year old with them. Neither table were couples out for a nice evening together, they were both mom's with friends. Who were all very loud in conversation I should mention. \nBefore we could get our main course both babies were crying and fussing very loud, and the mother's were both very inattentive. \nWe get our food, order another glass of wine, and we finish quickly because we were both uncomfortable with the ear piercing screams surrounding us. \n\nI do not have children, so I understand how I can sound insensitive. Are Friday late night dinners no longer sacred? Is it socially acceptable to take your children into the cold of the night so you can blabber with your friends and ignore their cries publicly??? \n\n\nTLDR; Went to a later dinner and screaming babies ruined date night dinner.

      "description": "A bit of a long story\n\nI made friends with a group of a few girls and guys four years ago and hung out with them ever since, at least once a week since. After a year I met my girlfriend and we have been together for 2 years.\n\nMy girlfriend and two of the girls in the friend group do not get along by any means. They met before we started dating and seemed ok. However after we began dating the whole dynamic changed and they seemed to exclude my girlfriend from any conversation (just the two girls). My girlfriend has confronted them a few times to specifically ask why they don’t like her and they seem to shrug her off. I agree that this is wrong of them and for this reason and because I love my girlfriend very much I have not hung out with the girls of the group for at least a year and have repeatedly ignored invite after invite to hang out with them.\n\nHowever the guys from the group are still very much my best friends and I hang out with the rest of the girls in the group when I hang out with my guy friends because naturally they sometimes (rarely) invite the girls who my girlfriend struggles with. At most I see the girls of the group 3 times a year compared to the once a week I used to see them.\n\nI have never confronted the friend group about this but I feel there’s nothing I can do to change how they feel about my girlfriend. \n\nMy girlfriend assumes that it’s because one of the girls from the group would rather have me to themselves and is super jealous. There was some very very mild flirting with the same girl that struggles to get along with my girlfriend but that was before me and my girlfriend started dating. But all of the flirting stopped as soon as I started dating my girlfriend. And since then the girl has found and moved in with her own boyfriend.\n\nSince then I have had zero contact with the girls except for as I mentioned before at most 3 events of the year (mostly birthdays/holidays). And when these events occur my girlfriend gets furious with me for going to the events with the girls present even though my guy friends are my main reason for attending. \n\nShe explained to me that she wants me to confront the two girls in the group and ask why they don’t like her and why they don’t give her a chance. I refused because it seems to me that she is over reacting because I already avoid these girls for most of the year except for events where my best guy friends really want me to attend. There is no changing how these girls feel towards my girlfriend. I can’t make them like her and I already chose my girlfriend over them. There is no way in hell I would ever cheat on my girlfriend with these girls but my gf seems to think otherwise. \n\nAm I the asshole for hanging out with this group of friends against my girlfriends wishes?\n\nThanks for any responses and I’m sorry for my horrible grammar and I welcome any questions.

      "description": "When I came to school I had no friends as did most other people. I found a niche of people and we hung out a lot, eating together and hanging out. When school starts we all get busy so we don’t see each other as much. But our friend Ken always wants to hang out. The thing is, no one in our (decently large) friend group really likes Ken. Why? Because whenever we hang out he would say racist comments to an international student, transphobic comments to our trans friends, etc. and whenever he said a comment, someone in our group would say “hey, that wasn’t very nice,” to which he’d reply “oh, sorry” while chuckling. Except he didn’t change, he kept saying comments like that at every get together we had. He was rude, annoying and nobody really cared for him. But we weren’t about to tell him that as you can’t go around telling everybody you don’t like “hey, I don’t like you, stay away.” This went on for a couple of months. Eventually we started trying to give him subtle cues that we didn’t want him hanging around (not responding to texts, not showing up for dinner if he initiated it). And honestly, I felt bad that we were just ditching him as he had revealed plenty before how he “didn’t have any friends, dealt with depression, had a hard time making friends.” But every time I hung out with him I felt belittled. Then one day he starts texting one of the other friends in the group how he feels that our group is drifting apart and he doesn’t know why. He mentions that maybe people are avoiding him but brushes it off. So some of my friends and I sit him down and politely tell him that we don’t want him hanging out with us anymore and why (he’s said hurtful comments to numerous people). He was in denial the whole time and asked us to “list specific examples” of when this occurred. Obviously we can’t list a certain one as there were many times. Later that night he begins calling and texting everyone in our group saying he’s sorry. But by the next day he’s texted one of the friends who told him and accused them of “lying, I don’t know what you have against me but I’m tired of it, etc.” anyways, he didn’t take it well and has since left the school. \n\nI’m really stressed out about the whole situation and some of the friends in the group are turning on the people who told him, including me.

      "description": "So I'm at the end of 1st year university, turning 19 soon, and a lot of the people that I match with are in senior year of high school (recently turned 18). Now I dont have a problem with them being on tinder, and some are pretty cool, but I don't like dating, or flirting g with people more than a year younger than me. This is mostly due to there being a big difference (in my mind at least) between the maturity of a high schooler and a university student. Now that I'm in university I have taken on so much more responsibility, such as being responsible for my own meals, making sure I go to class generally trying to be more of an adult. \n\nUsually what happens if I match with a high schooler, I'll talk to them (I usually assume they have graduated) and then if it turns out they haven't, I will try to politely explain that I am not comfortable dating/flirting with/hooking up with a high schooler. Nothing against them, but I feel like there is a massive gap and stigma. I unmatch after that. I feel like if I were to actually date somebody in high school, even though they are completely consenting, and we are only about a year apart, I still think I would be more a .\n\nSo Am I the asshole for not wanting to date people more or less based entirely off of their age?

      "description": "For context, I am 19 and he is 20. We both started university this year (GB) and since arriving, we have had problems in our relationship. This has been difficult as we've previously never argued (been together for 2 1/2 years) and haven't really struggled with loving each other before. We live 15 minutes from each other so can easily see each other if there is a problem and we try and see each other about 3 or 4 times a week.\n\nI have mental health problems which are fairly under control and have been for the past 2 years, but my boyfriend (although has had issues in the past with minor anxiety) has never really had issues of this kind before. He thinks he is depressed and I believe he might be as he seems unable to motivate himself to do anything and even when we spend time together, we don't really do much as he doesn't want to interact. He says he \"feels grumpy\" and then we just sit there or he cries until one of us leaves to go home. He also gets really annoyed with himself when he feels grumpy as he sees it's hard for me to deal with - this then makes me have to try and console him without admitting that it is hard for me as I don't want to make him feel worse.\n\nHe recently went for a meeting with someone in the University who gave him some contact details of someone who can support him. I try not to push him or remind him to contact the helpline as it'll make him put it off even more but eveytime I mention doing anything (or offering to help him with it) he just says he'll do it later.\n\nI want to be there to support him through this but due to worrying about him so much, some of my previous mental health issues have started to resurface. I have found myself wanting to self harm after being clean for over a year and am in the process of trying to get help for myself so that I can sort myself out again.\n\nIt is very frustrating watching my boyfriend suffer and not being able to help, and also not watching him get the help he needs. He calls me crying and tells me I'm lovely for sticking with him and that he doesn't deserve me, which just makes me want to run in the opposite direction because I am scared of saying the wrong thing. He has threatened suicide so I feel I have to watch what I say in case something tips him over the edge. He also admitted to self harming (punching a wall) in order to get attention from me when I noticed. \n\nI am one of the only people he will talk to and he relies on me a lot as he struggled to make friends at uni. I try and encourage him hanging out with people on his course but he struggles to make friends as he isn't very outgoing. Because of this, he only really asks me for help and doesn't really offload onto anyone else.\n\nWe have had lots of serious talks over the past few months and have both said to each other that we want to work through the problems we are having but I am not sure I can deal with the stress of trying to support him through something like this if it is going to continue for a very long time. I still love him, but it is very difficult to feel what I used to feel for him when he doesn't seem like the person he used to be.\n\nI feel awful that I am even contemplating breaking up with him but I am terrified of being dragged down with him because he wants me to support him when I can't.\n\nWould I be the asshole and do I just need to deal with my problems and support him or should I break up and just move on?",

      "description": "So I have two jobs. A full time job in the ER and a second job I've had for awhile as a construction site medic per diem.  They pay pretty much the same and don't mind the job too much but with my current full time gig it's pretty limited when I can pick up shifts. I work 1900-0700 3 times a week. Now if I haven't worked in a day or so ill pick up a construction site shifts. But they're having staffing issues and recently have been calling me regularly for coverage. I've explained that because of my hours if I have work Tuesday night to Wednesday morning I can't work either day (their shifts start at 0600 and end at 1600 but I don't wanna work like 20hrs in a row). But they've been pushing it saying it's fine if I come in late and pushing for me to work mornings before my ER shift. Now I don't mind the pay for a normal day if I haven't been in the ER in a bit, but I feel like if they want me to come off work then drive an hour to the site and work another 7hrs the pay isn't really worth it.  Is it ok if I explain that if they expect me to work like that I'd want time and a half pay?  Like.i work next Friday and Saturday night and they want me to come in Sunday morning. And for how much they pay I'd rather sleep. Is it an asshole move to ask for a raise only on those shifts where I'm coming off an ER shift or have a shift that night?  \n\nAnd if I'm not an asshole and advice how to ask?",

      "description": "For context: I’m really into cosmetology and learning about the ingredients in beauty products, which is why this is important to me. I’ve read about a lot of nasty stuff they put in makeup.\n\nHere’s what happened: I check out an indie makeup brand’s website by clicking the link in their instagram bio. I like their products and am considering buying some. I click on a lip gloss and see that they don’t list all of the ingredients, they just say it’s made with coconut oil and a “thick gel base”. That seems weird to me, as they don’t actually say what the base is made of. I’m thinking, “Okay, no big deal, I’ll just ask them where the ingredients are in case they have another page with full ingredients that I can’t find.”\n\nI message them and they direct me back to the incomplete ingredient list. So at this point I’m kind of frustrated because I’ve seen a lot of this same thing, upcoming brands not listing ingredients. But at the same time I understand that starting a makeup line is complicated and not everyone knows all the rules and regulations associated with selling cosmetics. \n\nSo I message them again basically saying “I checked out the website but it doesn’t appear to have a complete ingredient list. I just wanted to let you know that listing ingredients of cosmetics is something that the FDA requires, unless you register a product or ingredient as a trade secret. This message comes with no ill will towards you or your brand, I feel compelled to tell you this because I see so many makeup, and especially lipgloss companies doing the same thing and I think it’s really an issue in the indie makeup community. Knowing this I hope you’ll add a full list of ingredients.”\n\nThey read my message and didn’t reply. I give it a day, and then check their site again a few minutes before messaging them for the second time to see if they had added ingredients, and they didn’t.\n\n\nThe second message I sent them said, “Hi, I saw that you read my message and I would really love to hear your perspective on this. Thanks”. \nThey messaged me back saying, “my products have a full ingredient list”.\nI told them that I looked a few minutes ago and it was the same as before. They said to look again, and sure enough they added the ingredients. I’m thinking, “great! It’s awesome that they listen to consumers and make ajustements accordingly.” \n\nBut based on they way they replied to me it seems pretty obvious that they were really annoyed that I had asked them about this and persisted with it. It’s hard to explain but you know when you’re messaging someone and you can just tell they’re pissed? It was like that. I hate conflict/making people mad so this is really bugging me. AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So right off the bat I'll just say that I feel like the asshole for this, but I want to see what everyone else thinks. I'll try to give as much background as possible without getting too long. \n\nI'm getting ready to graduate college (engineering degree) and managed to get a job offer for a well known, large company in my industry. The salary offer was about 10% higher than what I was expecting, but the position is doing work that doesn't really interest me. At the time I received the offer, I was waiting on a second company to get back to me, but they ended up not picking me. So I only had one offer on the table, and thinking that's all I was going to get, I accepted it. The start date is about 6 months in the future because of background checks/security clearance, so there's quite a bit of time before I actually start working. As far as I could tell, accepting the job offer doesn't mean I'm legally obligated to work for them, simply that I've agreed to their salary terms. (Also this is California which is an \"at will\" employment state) \n\nAbout two weeks after I accepted the offer, I got calls from two other separate companies asking if I would interview with them. I took the interviews, mostly because I didn't expect them to go anywhere. Now it's a few more weeks down the line, and I'm in the final rounds of interviews for both these new companies. I feel like an asshole for accepting a job offer, and then interviewing with other companies, like I'm not being a loyal employee and I haven't even worked there. On the other hand, I feel like an asshole for already having a job and taking up the time of these new companies. \n\nOne important point, if either new company makes me an offer, I would strongly consider leaving the job I've already accepted. So it's not a total waste of their time to interview me, there is a possibility I can work for them. It's a dick move to walk away from an accepted offer, and I know it'll majorly piss some people off, but if the new offer is good enough it might be worth it. \n\nSo AITA for doing all this, or it is mostly acceptable?",

      "description": "My ex has been harassing me all damn day to drop my kids off with his mom. They finally woke up from their nap, and I took them over. He had something going on tonight, so he wasn’t even going to be there. I knew she wouldn’t mind me showing up whenever, she just moved here from 500 miles away and is working at a job that I helped her get. I usually try to keep my distance, even though I want to talk to her, but my divorce was ugly and I never wanted to put her in the middle of it. Anyway, I get to the door and stand there kissing my kids goodbye, and she asks if I’m going to work and I say no, so she invites me in. I politely declined but she asked again if I had anything going on and I said no and she insisted I go in. So, I did. We were talking about work and life, since we work at the same place now. I got up and told my kids I should really get going soon, since they were going to eat dinner soon and his little brother got a call from my ex and he came out and got his mom on the phone then handed the phone to me. As I picked up the phone she walked past me into the kitchen looking pissed. I said hello and he asked me what I was doing and why was I there, told me that I had no right and that I needed to stop acting like I was part of the family, because I’m not. This all coming from my ex who hid a 7 month long affair during my entire pregnancy, and I even took him back after the affair to try to keep my family together but he left us two weeks before Christmas two years ago, and is still with the girl he cheated on me with. Am I really an asshole for going into my ex mil’s house when I was invited in? I didn’t want to be rude, but maybe that’s a boundary I shouldn’t have crossed. I don’t know. ",

      "description": "Ok, here’s the deal. I’m driving to the mountains for the weekend and we stopped at a rest area. I go into the bathroom and of the three total stalls only one is open... the handicap restroom. I go in, do my business (which literally took less than two minutes) and come out to wash my hands. A woman with a wheelchair had entered merely 45 seconds earlier and as I walked out she gave me the stink eye and passive aggressively said to her friend “isn’t it rude of some people to use the stall that is specifically designated for handicap?”  \n\nI’m not looking for validation. I know this woman was an entitled bitch who just so happens to be in a wheelchair. My question is in general.... is it okay for an able bodied person to use that stall? I always thought it was fine. You rarely find someone handicapped in the restroom, and even if I did , why can’t they wait in the line like the rest of us? If I entered and someone in a wheelchair was already there, of course I’d let them go first. But I believe they should be treated just as everyone else is. And that includes waiting in line for the restroom. \n\nAITA? Should I leave that particular stall empty on the off chance someone who can only use that stall comes in, or is the stall fair game and handicapped or not.., wait in line! Set me straight if I’m wrong!",

I've(23F) been with my boyfriend (28M) for over a year now, we get along great. \n\nHis family on the other hand does not like me, they have told him it's because of my religion. I don't even practice my religion anymore but I guess the fact that I once did bothers them. (Not a crazy religion, a pretty common one)\n\nHis family constantly tells him how there are other \"fish in the sea\" and he can find someone better, that kind of thing. I haven't ever met his sister (25F) but she's the main one telling him these things. He's never stuck up for me with anything his family says, and it definitely bothers me.\n\nWell, this Easter his sister, her new puppy, and her boyfriend of a couple months are coming down to visit. My boyfriend mentioned in passing a pottery class they are going to Friday. He didn't invite me but I had to work anyways and I know he wants to get in as much time with his visiting family, so I didn't ask if I could join. \n\nBut on Easter Sunday I expected him to bring me along, when I asked him to make sure it was okay with his parents that I come he said he didn't need to ask as he felt it would be awkward if I came. When I asked him why, he said that if his sister says something to me he doesn't want me to say anything and wants me to avoid her being rude.\n\nI am a very laid back person but if someone was rude to me , I would tell them that it was rude of them to say or do that. It kind of irritated me that he would say that/not want to stand up for myself.\n\n\nAITA here? I feel so silly for writing this or asking but I gave no one else to vent to or ask about this. I understand him not wanting his sister to be rude to me but he knows I would not make a scene or be rude back as I always try to avoid confrontation if possible.\n\n\nTD;LR boyfriend's family doesn't like me, he doesn't want me at Easter Sunday as it would be awkward if his sister said something rude to me and I stood up for myself.\n",

The argument is that this person is serving you and they rely on their tips to make a living. I worked in retail for years, making a little more than minimum wage, and server's in my state make minimum wage, so this argument is a little lost on me. I have never not left a tip, even with bad service I leave 10-15% (to me, bad service is being rude or ignoring me for a very long time without explanation). I understand server's get taxed on estimated tip amounts, but I think 15% is more than fair when this is in addition to minimum wage.  I often tip 20%, because I often get good service and am a regular at a few places.  What I don't like is being made to feel like I'm a shitty person if I tip anything less than that, in my mind 20% is a *very* good tip, not an expected amount. I run my own on-site beauty business and am tipped there, I would be more than happy with a 15% tip.

      "description": "Context before the situation. A few months ago I moved into a dorm style apartment complex (shared rooms, kitchen, bathrooms, etc.) The complex has an incredibly friendly atmosphere and I've met and spoken with many new people since living here. I am also very closing to graduating from my IT program and have gladly helped many friends and family with IT related concerns. I've also been sick lately and lately have had trouble hearing out of general tiredness, I'm extremely eager to get more hands on experience and answer questions or figure out an issue when possible. My eagerness and excitement brought me into my current situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was heating up my dinner in the shared kitchen and was in the company of a few other residents who were eating/cooking their dinners as well. I overhead some tech talk between 2 female residents (a younger one, probably in her 20s and an the other probably in her 40s). My initial read on the situation was the younger woman was asking for assistance with her chrome book and the older woman was helping. I didn't catch much of the situation but overheard a simple question from the younger female regarding IT. I immediately begin to answer the question, out of habit almost. The older lady cuts me off and asks \"Would you like to answer the question?\". In my tired state, I believed she was sincerely asking me, as I am not used to other people also having a background in IT, so I begin explaining once again. The older lady says something that I cannot quite hear, laughs, and begins explaining her answer. I notice another resident across from me laughing under his breath while looking at me, at which point I think \"Did I do something wrong?\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realized right away that it was rude of me to just jump into the conversation. I somewhat knew the younger female resident and just didn't think straight in my eager ' I'm an IT' guy moment. Afterwards I apologize to the older woman for butting in and explain that I'm just excited about the IT world. She exclaims that I was mansplaining and she found it offensive. I tried to explain to her \"I wasn't thinking about gender at all, simply the IT question. I apologize for interrupting and meant no harm.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe informs me that I answered the question because they were 2 females and I was a man so I thought I needed to answer the question based on that. I really was just excited about being able to answer a question related to IT. The older woman worked as a software developer for 9 years and was very capable of answering the question. Working for 9 years in IT, I can understand she's probably had to break through some sexist boundaries, especially for the time she went into it. She also tells me she will only accept my apology if i accept that what I had done WAS mansplaining. Eventually another resident broke the tension and we all carried on with a casual conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI apologize if this all sounds jumbled, I'm typing it as I'm recovering from a nasty cold. I will try to resolve any confusion anyone has. The question is, was I  a mansplaining asshole? Was what I did wrong only because of the genders involved? Would what I did normally come off as offensive, or was this blown out of proportion? ",

He then incessantly pounds on the door demanding to talk and return his cooking pot.\n\nShe calls the police because of this. Ironically, the dispatcher informs her that police are already on the way because he called them because she is \"withholding\" his cooking pot. When the police arrive, they inform her that this guy already has a protection order against him from another female in the city. \n\nThings cool down. He leaves with no charges pressed. And my sister relays these details to the family over the next few days. \n\nThis event took place in December of 2018.\n\nFast forward a few months and she reveals that she started dating him again in January of 2019.\n\nI am under the impression that this guy is a lunatic and start fact checking every detail he ever said to make us feel sorry for him. During my search I discovered a few discrepancies:  \nHe didn't grow up in the affluent community he claimed to be from  \nHe claimed to hate our home town because he always gets pulled over but has zero traffic violations on his record  \nHe said he was born to a teen mom but his mother was 20, almost 21, when he was born  \nHe claimed to have had a full ride for college but it turned out to be ROTC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I keep pointing out these discrepancies to my sister, yeah they are relatively minor but to me the paint a picture of deceit. I also point out how his behaviors are are in line with someone engaging in emotional abuse and manipulation by sending her documents from the National Domestic Abuse Hotline.\n\nI know what I am doing doesn't fit into society's view of reasonable or rational, and she sure as hell is bothered by it, but am I the asshole for trying to get my sister to leave her abusive relationship?",

      "description": "Long story short. My best friend (bff) met her boyfriend (bf) about a decade ago during our freshman year of college on an online dating site. When they first got together I was ecstatic. She had lost her mom just a few months prior and went into a depression from that. Before that she suffered from low self esteem due to her weight and constant bullying. So for me I saw it as her becoming more confident and independent. \n\nI met him once early on in their relationship and he gave me a weird vibe but didn’t think too much into it. Continuing on bff started to confide a lot of stuff about him and their relationship. He would often ghost her for days/months at a time and then come back to ask her for money. He was cheating on her leading to her getting an STI. And on top of it all he was a registered sex offender(I’m hesitant to put that out there but I think it highlights how desperate she was at the time). The last time he ghost her was for several years and I assumed they were done done. Until I was at her house a few months ago and he walked in the door. I feigned ignorance as to his identity. As far she knows I think this is a new guy. She plays along with it so she obviously doesn’t want me to know that it’s him. I ask them questions about how they met and she lies to my face about it.  I know she does it because she knows I’ll say something. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went out to dinner with them and the whole thing was cringe worthy. He kept making comments to me. Nothing overtly sexual but just kept bringing me up in conversation. He was also loud and obnoxious making anti semitic comments and following them up with “I’m a quarter Jewish” and kept  cutting everyone off in conversation. You could tell she was annoyed by the situation. He’s definitely a douche but if it was just all of that I wouldn’t say anything.  \n\n\nFast forward to today-ish, I’m on tinder and he pops up. I haven’t swiped left or right but a part of me wants to make a “fake” account and see where it goes. Though, I also get that sometimes ignorance is bliss. If your health and well being are on the line is it reasonable for me to just overlook it for my best friend? My biggest concern is that she’s being taken advantage of. If I was in the situation I’d want to know.\n\n(Ugh I guess the thing that bothers me most about this situation is that she other opportunities but she’s getting tied down by this manipulative trash dude. )\n\nAlso, just a note, they’re not open or polyamorous. \n\nTl;dr I found my best friend’s boyfriend on tinder and I want to catfish him to see if he’s still cheating on her.

So some context: it was 9th grade, and I was definitely on the lower end of the popularity totem pole.\nAfter 9th period was almost over, everyone was waiting by the door, waiting for the bell to ring. A girl  (let's call her 'A') calls me over to the back of the room. Her friend (who we'll call 'B') is standing next to her. A asks me if I would want to hang out with B sometime. Believing that it was some sort of a joke (Both of the girls were popular; I had bad relations with some of the popular male student), I figured it was a 'Birds of a Feather' scenario. I reply with something along the lines of 'no thanks, I appreciate the offer', and was promptly saved by the bell. It was never brought up since.\n\nI'm not asking to see if I was an asshole for turning her down.

      "description": "To start - I am 19F who definitely doesn't help around the house as much as I should. I know I'm lazy sometimes but I do occasionally get massive surges of energy and clean lots. I find it hard to do jobs or work due to depression (motivation and ability to concentrate is unfortunately shot atm). This has ruined a lot for me as I went from being a top student to bottom and I have struggled since with not being one of 'the best' like my mum in particular has always pushed me to be. She is pretty onboard with my bad mental health though.\n\nToday we had an amazing Sunday roast and I helped clean and set the table. I also cleared all the dishes and did a couple loads of clothes washing. My parents asked me this evening to do the dishwasher, which I thought was slightly unfair because my brother (17) hasn't done any household chores today.  \nAnyway I unloaded the dishwasher but decided I wanted to ask my brother to load it back up. This is because I am vegetarian and honestly the thought of touching plates and trays which pork has been cooked in, and are covered in fat and grease is revolting to me. I am also the only vegetarian out of the 4 of us if this is relevant at all.\n\nMy parents really did not like this even though I explained I did not want to touch all the fat and grease left over from the pork. They shook their heads at me and gave me their disappointed glare that I hate and told me how lazy I was. Mum would barely look at me. In about an hour I expect she will come into my room and tell me how awful I am for not completing the dishwasher and lecture me on my laziness.\n\nSo my question is - does she have a right to be this angry?\n\nTL:Dr - didn't load up the dishwasher because did not want to touch meat, my parents are really unhappy about it.",

We liked sharing our creative ideas with each other.(Note: I didn’t like hers most of the time, but I tried not to be an asshole about it). Years go bye of being pretty good friends, we branch out a bit, I’m a fairly conservative-Libertarian Christian, and she was quite the opposite in most regards.\n\nShe was often very crass and rude, but I try to look past this for a while.\n\nThe 7th grade comes, and right before the year starts, she tells me that she is Transgender, and has changed his name to (let’s say) Eric.\n\nAt first I reject this, I hadn’t had a lot of experience with sexuality, gender, and all those kinds of things, so I saw it as a bit of a phase.\n\nEric very quickly put me in my place and I decided to accept it for both of our sakes. It was rocky at first, we all made slip ups, but Eric was always exceptionally angry.\n\nEven if it was an unintentional misgender, I’d get physically hit for it.\n\nI’ve gotten better at being respectful and accommodating.\n\nBut Eric knows I don’t feel great about Transgenders and I get harassed by him quite a lot. \n\nI rarely unintentionally misgender Eric, I rarely even discuss transgenderism with him in any sense, but he’s still a jerk about it, even though I accommodate his identity as much as I can.\n\nI understand that Eric has issues with his parents and mentally, and that being Trans is hard as hell, but sometimes he can be so brutal to me, and also extremely hypocritical that I can’t help but ask,\n\nAm I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "This originates from events that happened last year.\n\nMy parents went on holiday. I chose to stay home and look after my Dogs and the house with my older brother.\n\nWe decided that during the first week I would stay in the living room to look after the Dogs and he would do the same on the second week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first week was completely fine, I stayed with the Dogs and he went out to see friends on Thursday and Friday. On Saturday he stayed out for the night (D&amp;D) and he came home late Sunday.\n\nThe second week comes along and as we had decided, he was to stay with the Dogs for the week. Instead of doing as he agreed, he decided to repeat his actions from the first week. I talked to him on Saturday morning about this and he brushed it off with \"I do D&amp;D every week.\" he proceeded to go out and not come back until late night Sunday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think he's an asshole for doing this, but I can get over it. The thing I can't get over is the mess he made in the kitchen and kept making worse throughout these two weeks.\n\nMy parents had asked us to clean the house before they returned, my brother never returned to help with this. A friend of mine decided to come hang out with me at my house on the weekend and he decided that he would help me in my brother's place. We managed to get everything cleaned up (my brother never thanked my friend for doing his work for him).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's the end of the long winded backstory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I was told that my parents were going to go on another two week holiday in May. I sent a message to my friends which said, \"Oh boy. My parents are going on holiday for two weeks in May. Can't wait to spend two weeks doing literally everything around the house while (Brother) acts like a fucking victim because he has to look after the dogs for all of three days.\" (I found out that he was calling me lazy for not wanting to spend the weekend looking after the Dogs)\n\nThe long argument that followed boils down to this.   \nA friend who always starts arguments in this group chat claimed that I'm immature because \"housework is easy\" and that I shouldn't be dragging them into it. This doesn't make sense to me, because I never mentioned the housework being difficult, just that I don't think it's okay to make me do everything and I don't think that I dragged anybody into it, I simply vented a bit.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for being a \"killjoy\" with kids and my animals?",
      "description": "My family has a small farm we jokingly refer to as a \"Fisher Price farm\". We have horses (normal and miniature), a donkey, goats, geese, chickens, a rabbit, dogs and cats. I own some of the animals myself and some belong to my parents- the vast majority of the animals are rescues. My mom absolutely loves inviting people, especially kids, over to hang out with animals they may not normally meet and to ride our horses. She always expects my help handling the animals and children, which I don't mind, I love animals and like kids. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe current problem is that my mom thinks I'm way too firm with children around the animals. I think that what I say is for the benefit of our pets' health and stress levels, and to keep the kids safe. She says that I'm a \"killjoy\", that I \"make children and parents uncomfortable by being too controlling\" (her words). This stung a bit I'll admit since I dislike having to be the one with boundaries but I consider my mom a people pleaser who wants all the kids/adults to have an idyllic farm experience without any realistic boundaries. Here are some examples of points of conflict:\n\nKids are chasing chickens around in 90 degree (or hotter) weather, until chickens are panting and obviously overheating. I say \"Please don't chase them, they're nervous and it's too hot for them to run this much. There are quiet chickens right here you can pet or hold gently!\" Repeated multiple times, eventually dropping the please. Finally pick up the chickens they're chasing (chickens don't run from me, they know my call) and put the chickens in the coop out of reach. Mom says that I'm ruining their fun and that it won't kill the chickens to get a little hot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKids running around the horses' hindquarters, hitting them in the face with a metal comb, screaming in excitement. I say \"Guys, you have to be quiet and calm around horses or they may get nervous and spook or kick. Be gentle when you brush the horses.\" Mom says it's fine, our horses are safe and quiet. I remind her that the horse in question once kicked out and caught her in the thigh when a horsefly bit her. Mom says I'm scaring the kids and getting worried over nothing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKids chasing already skittish cats, I ask them to not do that and play with the dogs instead, mom says it won't kill the cats to get chased. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot more unfortunately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually my mom says maybe she shouldn't ask me to help her anymore with kids around since I'm \"a killjoy and make people uncomfortable\". I have never swore at, shouted at, or even raised my voice at kids. I always try to be calm but firm. However the one time I wasn't supervising it (in a roundabout way, to be fair) ended up with the death of one of my chickens so I'm not confident in my mom's ability to supervise all the animals and kids. I often time get left watching 6-8 kids by myself around a barn with large animals while my mom chats with the parents. That's also been frustrating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I'm afraid I am a killjoy and an asshole for being firm and maybe over controlling? I do really try to be polite but I know that I often put what I perceive to be the animals' comfort/wellbeing over kids' enjoyment. I'm happy to clarify anything, I want to be as fair and present all sides as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My mom thinks I'm kind of an asshole and too controlling about kids playing around our animals, i.e. telling kids to stop chasing chickens or lower their voices around horses.

      "description": "Longtime lurker/new poster here, but wanted to get thoughts on a situation...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some quick background: a friend of mine is getting married and we're booking hotels. Originally, a friend + his gf + I were going to share a 2BR condo (2BRs each with a king bed). Boom, done, no issue. Well, in comes party #3 and his wife. He asks if he can share a place with us; sure no problem, find a new 3BR that works for all of us and we'll be good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe new place he finds has 1 BR with a king bed, 1 BR with a king bed, and 1 BR with two twin beds. It seems to be assumed the couples get the king beds and I, as the single one, would be relegated to the single beds. Well, I didn't like this \"downgrade\" and I said that I wasn't interested in sleeping in a twin bed. I didn't demand that someone else had to, nor did I even request anyone else had to... I just said that \\*I\\*, personally, didn't want to do that. And of course, no one else wanted to either (there were no volunteers to take the small beds).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso to note: 3 BR condos with all king or queen beds is rare, but there were some other options, including upping to a 4BR and bringing in another person or couple. We were in a rush, though, as rooms were booking up quick so we wanted to book something as fast as possible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, eventually, party #3 (a couple) agrees to sleep in the twin beds, if we gave them a discount on their share of the room. I agreed and thought this was awesome. I talked to party #3 on the phone and he's perfectly fine with it... but I feel slightly awkward being a single guy sleeping in a big bed (while a married couple sleeps on twin beds), and I'm worried this could make things a little awkward when it actually comes time to check in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thoughts: I feel that I shouldn't have to give up comforts on my vacation because I'm \"single\". It's my vacation and I'm paying for my share of things. I was also willing to find another place, and again, was not demanding anyone else sleep in a small bed; I just said that \\*I\\* didn't want to. Lastly, I already had plans solidified and am making accommodations to party #3 by changing plans in the first place, so he can save some money ($250/night for 1 BR vs. $100/night for 3BR is his cost; I'm saving money overall as well, but not to that extent).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to sleep in a tiny bed on my vacation?

Weeks into moving in together her complaining started including fantasies of quitting. \n\nOne time I asked her what she would do for money.  She said she would find something else.   That anything would be better than where she’s at now.  So I told her that she should apply around and secure another job first and then quit.  She agreed with my thoughts on it.  \n\nThen in September she quit.  With no other job lined up.  She said she just couldn’t take it and promised me that she would spend all her free time finding something else.  \n\nShe has plenty of retail experience and we live in a city with pretty much endless retail jobs.  I know she hates it and doesn’t want to do it anymore, but as I said I hate my job too.  I suck it up because we have bills to pay and my income alone barely squeaks us by.  \n\nI’ve been getting more and more frustrated.   Especially when she gets testy with me when I ask how the search is going.  I honestly resent the fuck out of the fact that she sits at home watching Netflix all day while I’m working.  \n\nI haven’t 100% made my mind up about ending things, but I’ve been thinking about it more and more lately.  \n\n",

She's been going through a stressful period in her life due to family stress, thus she's began binge eating and gained some weight over the past few months (I'd say around 10-15 pounds I'm not sure but it's visible). She's not unhealthy I don't think but she's sorta pudgy. I don't mind but I'm less attracted to her to be frank.\n\n\nI've tried talking to her about her weight directly but she just gets upset and starts crying. So I've tried helping her indirectly. When we eat together I try to encourage her to eat healthier and less. For example I'll say \"hey maybe you should have some broccoli instead of rice?\" or \"that's a lot of food you, you sure you should eat all of that?\"\n\nRecently she snapped at me about and it caused a huge fight. I think she's just over dramatic, but maybe I'm just a dick. AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "So, In my town, there´s this guy who sells kebab. True, he isn´t the only one, but there has been some gossip that someone got a disease from it and although I haven´t heard it from the most credible sources, I´d rather eat at the first one. You see, the problem is that there´s no way of communicating with the guy, since he doesn´t know Czech  (you know, the language of the insignificant state in the middle of Europe whose main job throughout the history is to get occupied) nor English. Not that he doesn´t try, my main problem is that he can´t really put sentences together, plus he has this thick accent because of which you can´t hear anything. And, the worst of all, he tries to open window for conversation, which is absolutely horrible, because of the problems already listed. The time there usually looks like this: I enter, say ,,Hello\", and order. There is the first problem since he probably can understand you, but you can´t. So every time the conversation goes like this: Me: Hey, can I get a six and some small fries please?\" (I usually get something for my brother when I´m there)\n\n Kebab guy: Ev´ing? Me: Uhh... yes.\n\nThen, I just walk around the shop while I wait for him to finish my food, maybe watch some Netflix. Or at least I WOULD be if the guy didn´t try to talk to me further.\n\nKebab guy: H´w ar´ yu? \n\nMe: Uhh, good. \n\nKebab guy: Yeh?\n\nThen the other employee walks in, chats with Kebab guy and then they laugh. And if they do, all hell breaks loose. You see, I am not the oldest, so whenever the dudes laugh, Kebab guy 90% of the time  says: ,,Yu kno´ wh´t that me´ns?\" And then he proceeds to explain to me what it is, and all I can do is to awkwardly stand there and let him talk. As you probably got right now, I really don´t like it. The guy is probably just all day alone there having nothing to do, since the other employee is rarely there, and if he is, he is in the back doing something, so I wondered if that justifies all the cringy conversations.",

I hate the man for what he did to my family but also I'd hate to think other children would be at risk. The reason I'd do it is spite and fear. There's very little justice in my country.

      "description": "I get that parenthood changes your life. I get that early parenthood is especially consuming. But I also feel like my BFF has completely disengaged from our friendship in any meaningful way and I’m sick of being the only one to put any effort into our friendship. I’m ready to drop the rope and when she’s ready to get out of this mommy fog that has made her so selfish (friendship wise, I think she’s a bit of a martyr Mom actually), she can reach out to me.\n\nSome examples: She hasn’t called me in 2 years. She sends texts sometimes, but every time I call her, I get a text back about why she can’t talk. We’ve only seen each other three times in 2 years - for most of that time, we only lived 3 hours apart. She wouldn’t come to me and wouldn’t stay longer than a few hours when I came to her. Every single one of her Instagram posts now are pictures of her daughter. She rarely asks about my life and seems annoyed when I talk about my dating life. She kept trying to make plans for a girls’ weekend but would always cancel or push it off because her daughter still isn’t weaned from breastfeeding or sleeping through the night. She’s a stay-at-home Mom and just seems totally consumed by her kid. I can’t relate and I find it frustrating and sad when I just get a barrage of Mommy reasons why she can’t be a good friend.\n\nIt kind of came to a head when I asked her to call me this week and she promised she would. Then...crickets. Then an apology text that her kid has the flu. Which sucks of course but her husband can’t take the kid for 30 minutes? I’m just done. \n\nMy mom says I’m being an asshole (not her exact words but for the sake of the sub) because someday when I’m a mom I’ll understand how hard the first few years of motherhood is and I’ll wish I had cut my friend a lot more slack if and when that time comes for me (I’m not childfree, just still single). She keeps quoting the “to everthing there is a season” bible verse. Which makes me feel like an asshole, but at the same time...I’m angry and feel left behind and done.",

      "description": "He goes to a UC and wants to pursue the medical field after his undergrad. The only club he’s involved in is this Kpop one. He’s planning to run for president of the club this year and wants to put that as one of his EC on med school applications. \n\nI personally thought this was a bad idea because it’s mainly a social club. They have a meeting every week where they just talk about latest Kpop news and have fun. They have socials every other week (going out to eat, hang out, play games, etc.). There’s no community service aspect in the club. \n\nI’m happy he has found his niche in his school because he struggled to find friends for the longest time. I was actually the one that told him to put himself more out there. So this club means a lot to him and I’m not surprised why he wants to run for president. However, he might not run anymore if I tell him all these things. I still want him to run because any leadership role is a great experience to have, but putting it on a med school app (for this kind of club) doesn’t sit well with me.\n\nDo you think med schools would care? Should he just stick to his internship experiences and omit this club all together? \n\nTl;dr: Boyfriend wants to put his role as president in a Kpop club on his med school application, but I advised against that. AITA for telling him this?",

My BIL has no issue because he learned from his family how to talk to people with tact.  After 15 years of being a part of his family, and being told that she should find better ways of saying things to not come across as rude, you would think she would learn to, but no she refuses. Like telling me when I was pregnant that I need to work out more or my husband will definitely leave me, (I was 103lbs before pregnancy and when she told me that I was 7 months and 135lbs).  So it makes talking to her without getting insulted almost never happen so I try never to talk to her.\n\nShe uses her deafness to get her way no matter what.  She uses the kindness of my husbands grandparents (90f and 89m) whenever she decides she wants to do something last minute.  I couldn't tell you the amount of times the grandparents asked to have our kids over for the night and then I find out after dropping my kids off, she dropped her kids off for the weekend because \"I just need a break\" or her friends decided to go out last minute.  I always ask if they would like me to pick up my kids because 4 kids for 2 elderly people is too much.  At least for them.  She always got her way growing up, because she was deaf and it continues now in her adulthood.  \n\nI dont like her daughter (11) because she is just like her mom but she isnt deaf.  Everything has to be her way, she is rude and mean to my kids just because she is older so \"she is in charge\". She doesn't talk to my mother in law or father in law for whatever reason. She just stares at them. She expects her way all the time and throws a fit if she doesnt get it. I've had my kids ask to stay at their house overnight and she just goes no I dont want you to play with my stuff.  Her brother on the other hand is a funny, personable little guy who I love having around. \n\n\nTl;dr, my sister in law is deaf and doesnt know how to be tactful when she speaks and uses her deafness to get her way with everything and her daughter is just like her, who isnt deaf, but still demands to get her way and is rude to everyone.  \n\nAITA for seriously disliking my SIL and niece?",

      "description": "TL;DR: I had a few dates with guy 1 (nothing happened in terms of kisses etc), and now want to go out with a guy I met on Tinder whom I just found out is in the same sports team as guy 1. I am insecure whether I should tell guy1 about that because I think he already knows I don’t want to be with him. \n\nSo a couple of weeks ago I started dating this guy. We went out twice before I confessed to him I was feeling insecure about the whole thing because I still had feelings for someone else who had just recently rejected me. He said he could understand that and if I ever wanted to meet him again I could just call him. A few weeks passed and my feelings for the other person floated away and I called him again. We had two more dates and I realised that...I am just not feeling comfortable in his near. \n\nOn our last date we were watching Netflix and he tried to cuddle with me and I was just like “meh...please don’t”. Eversince that we haven’t been texting much, I think he can tell that I am just not really into him.\n\nOut of boredom I started texting with a guy on Tinder, and we two instantly got along quite well. He asked me out and I agreed. Now I found out, he is in the same sports team as is the other guy I was/am dating. This was PURELY out of luck, I had no idea guy 2 is in the same sports team as guy 1. My best friend, whom is coincidentally also in this sports team, told me I NEED to be upfront to guy 1 that I will be having my first date with one of his teammates.\n\nMy original idea was to have the date with guy 2, and tell guy 1 something along the lines of: “hey I think you have already noticed I don’t really have feelings for you and I am sorry etc. and I had a date last night with someone else. I hope you find someone for you, I am sorry I couldn’t be that person.” But my best friend says guy 1 is definitely going to ask her whom I met with and THEN he is going to be mad as hell when he finds out. \n\nI don’t really know what to do. Nothing ever happened between guy 1 and me (in terms of kisses, cuddling, sex), so I feel like...he already knows I don’t want to be with him. Should I tell him “hey my date is with one of your teammates?” Bc then he is definitely going to think I was “getting in touch” with guy 2 behind his back. ",

      "description": "Okay so for context, we live in a 2 person apartment in a duplex, that we're renting from an old couple who are gone to Florida for the duration of our school year. Their son lives upstairs and takes care of yardwork and such. My roommate (21M) has been going through a rough patch recently since his girlfriend dumped him and a family feud that's been going in for a little over 2 months. With all this going on he started smoking again, which is completely fine because many people smoke and it's whatever. The problem is that we live in Canada and it gets pretty cold outside and he is an international student from a much warmer country. However, he's been to british boarding schools or something like that and is pretty culturally western. Anyways, as it's been getting colder, he started smoking in his room and even in the living room. I asked him politely if he could keep smoking outside, to which he replied \"that's too inconvenient because it's getting cold.\" My resolution to this was to get him to ask our landlord whether it was okay or not to smoke inside and he agreed to this. It's been about a month since and he hadn't talked to her yet. \n\nThe day after I got back from home for the holidays I asked him if he talked to our landlord yet. He said that he hadn't but had asked their son and he said was fine. I thought it was odd but gave him the benefit of the doubt. \n\n.I decided I've had enough of it because I can't stand the lingeing smell, the health affects it could potentially have on me or even our landlords when they move back in at the end of our lease, and my possible liability for any damages/contract clauses caused by his smoking. Today, I texted our landlord myself. She wasn't very pleased so I let him know that she doesn't want him smoking in tbe apartment. He freaked out at me for snitching on him. \n\nIn my opinion, just the fact that he used the word snitching implies that he knew it wasn't okay in the first place. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have been with my SO for 3 years. Last year one of his friends from his hometown was getting married and invited him to the wedding. Without any explanations he said that I could not come. This invitation was made 6 month before the wedding, so it was not due to the difficulties of organisation. I have never met this friend before, nor his fiancée, so no personal disagreement could take place. My SO have probably shared some details of our relationship with his friend, but I can’t think of anything that could have influenced me being not invited. It was probably simply due to the fact that they wanted to limit the number of guests.\nShortly after the invitation my SO goes to the bachelor party (here it normally takes the form of a travel to another country with partying, strip clubs and other stuff). I’d basically be cool with that, but it seamed really weird to me: normally if you’re close enough to the groom to go to this bachelor trip, you have the right to bring a +1 to the wedding. But it still can be explained in a 100 different ways.\nThe only thing I can’t handle is the fact that since the wedding was being planned, my SO started going out with this group of friends, and I, given that I have never met anyone and have not been invited to the wedding, whereas all their parties are thrown around the wedding (preparations, planning, bachelor stuff, meet the groom after the wedding so that he announces the baby coming etc), don’t come as I’m being very uncomfortable with the situation. \nWhat bothers me is the fact that my SO does not do anything to make me feel comfortable, he simply leaves, parties, drinks and says that it’s not his problem that I don’t feel comfortable to come or did not have an occasion to meet his friends.\nI know that if someone did something similar on my side I’d simply and gently refuse to come to the wedding without my SO as I find it not cool. Or at least I’d do my best to include him and make him feel better. So AITA for being angry with my SO and not making an effort despite being uncomfortable?",

      "description": " AITA Drugs and alcohol make me really uncomfortable I'm not sure why. I get panicky and end up wanting to hide. I do have anxiety so it may be that. My family also has a bad history of drug and alcohol use which may be the reason why but I don't think that is of any importance. Anyways onto the story I was at my friends house really late with a couple of good friends when my friend who owns the house got a call from another group I don't know (but my friends knew them) to see if she had sprinkles she said yes and they asked if they could come to get them. So they arrive, and they are... very clearly high. This instantly made me uncomfortable, but I tried to hide it so I wouldn't bring down the mood. My good friend saw right through it and asked if I was alright I said yeah just a bit uncomfortable. She asked if I wanted to leave and I said no its okay because I was trying to be polite (if I could go back to when this happened I would have said yes) anyways I got really uncomfortable when they started getting a bit touchy with each other and asked my parents to come to pick me up. When they arrive all I could think about was getting out of there as fast as possible, so I stormed out went home and cried myself to sleep. I woke up and felt horrible about storming out and making everyone worried so I apologized to all of them and I thought that was the end of it. However, every time we are now together they bring it up and say how I need to be more accepting of alcohol and drugs and people who use them and it makes me feel guilty. Am I in the wrong here? is this an irrational fear I need to get over? Am I the asshole?  \nTLDR: I'm afraid of drugs and alcohol I stormed out of my friend's house after feeling extremely uncomfortable with it I kind of stormed out and apologized the morning after.

      "description": "Some context: I have never stolen anything, or even asked for a cup of water and then filled it up with soda, or anything like that. But this time I feel like it's maybe justified.\n\nI was in a grocery store and felt like treating myself, so when I saw this brand of cookies I really liked on sale for $1.50, I decided to buy them. When I went to pay, I thought my total ended up being a bit high, but the line was so long and everybody had already been waiting for so long that I decided not to hold up the line since it was probably nothing. Then, when I got to my car, I unfortunately forgot to double-check the receipt, which is on me. At home the next day, I found the receipt in my pocket and checked it, then found out that they charged me $4.00. I don't know if the register glitched or something, because below the name of the cookies, it even said that they should have been $1.50, but then the number next to it said $4.00. That is so much to spend on a single box of cookies that were already kind of a splurge. I would let it go if they overcharged me by $.50 or even a dollar, but the thought of paying $2.50 extra is making me feel so guilty.\n\nHowever, the store in question is kind of far away since I had stopped by it on the way back from another place, and is not my normal store, so it would cost me that much in gas to go back and get my money back. The next time I'll be up there is in a couple weeks. WIBTA if I took 1-2 dollars worth of pens or candy or something to even it out, or should I just eat the cost and take it as a lesson to double-check the receipt in the store? Either option is making me feel terrible, so I appreciate any input. ",

He tolerated S's presences, but was uncomfortable with her being around. His girlfriend has never has a problem with S. \n\nThis week, C was informed that S was friends with and communicating with K on Facebook. He told me I was not to have S around because of this, as C is still doing the same business he has in the past.\n\nI have stated that I know S, trust her implicitly, and know she would not tell K anything involving other people, especially not anything like this. C has retained his position, and I dropped it. \n\nThe lease for the rental is not in either of our names officially, but the landlord has told me I am the one who she considers it under. I pay exactly as much as C does for rent, utilities, and other bills here, and I don't believe banning S is fair or effective.\n\nI want to have S over.. The way I see it, if S wanted to make something like this a problem, she already could have. We aren't moving, so she still has all the information on C's business and location, regardless of this ban.

      "description": "(Obligatory throwaway account disclaimer.)\n\nI have a lot of mental health problems (depression, anxiety, gender dysphoria, etc) and over the past couple of days or so they’ve gotten bad to the point where I’m pretty much constantly in danger of overdosing or offing myself in some other way. (please don’t offer sympathy or whatever, that’s not what this is about) For the most part I’ve been keeping my brain in check by bombarding one of my close friends with all of the suicidal shit for multiple hours a day, and it’s kinda been the only thing keeping me going. I feel terrible for wasting all of her time with all of my stupid problems though, especially since she’s the only one who really knows how bad I’ve gotten recently because I’m too scared to tell my parents or my therapist about it and know that I don’t deserve people’s sympathy or assistance. I wish that I never told her about how bad I am so she wouldn’t have to deal with it, but now that I have the cat’s out of the bag so to speak and it won’t go back in. \n\nI’ve had thoughts about lying about getting better and then slowly stopping replying to messages in an effort to get her to stop worrying about me, because it feels like I’m a huge burden and that I’m never gonna get better and feel actual happiness anyway, so there’s no point in dragging people down to my level. I know she says that she wants to help and that she cares about me, but I can’t believe that another person honestly cares about me and I just want to let her not have to worry about me anymore.\n\nDo you guys agree that it would be a good idea for me to cut myself out of her life so I won’t be an issue anymore? Hoping for genuine honesty here, please none of the “I’m sure she cares about you” shit.",

      "description": "Hey all, I've sat in judgment of several questions in this sub, now it's my turn to be judged. \n\nStory: My wife and I are monogamous. A few years ago, we joined an IRL community that meets on Sundays. We're not religious but we didn't have any friends after moving from the town where we met, and we found a non-religious community that was welcoming. A TON of the people in the community are polyamorous. We'd never been exposed to that. At the time, we knew that wasn't for us - it didn't bother us, but we had too many years of thinking that serious relationships are only monogamous for us just to overcome decades of living a certain way that fast. We did talk a lot with each other about it, which led to us being more open with each other about crushes (a good thing, IMO). \n\nI struck up a friendship on Facebook with a friend of my best friend. We started off just sending memes and chatting about news and other stuff. She said we should get dinner sometime. Now's a great time for me to say that after years of being completely monogamous, I am Naive. As. Hell. I didn't read any romantic overtones into her saying that, so my response was basically \"Sure! Next time you're in town, we can hang!\" She let me know a couple months later that she was going to be in town, and asked me to dinner. I said \"Sure! Can \\[mutual friend\\], my wife, and my kid come too? We all like \\[the restaurant she wanted to go to\\]!\" She said that was totally okay. \n\nAfter the dinner, she messaged and asked if we were polyamorous, and put forward that she was attracted to me. I showed it to my wife immediately, and she helped me draft a response: \"Flirting isn't illegal, but it won't go anywhere with me, and we're really not poly.\"\n\nWell, she did take us at our word and kept flirting. I'd keep telling my wife, and she just said \"I'd rather you not flirt back, but if it makes you feel good that she's flirting, I'm okay with it.\" I told this lady as much, and for a few more months, it kept up that way. I checked in with my wife, and that's when my wife said \"Do you want to flirt back?\" I said \"I have to admit, I really like her, and the flirting is pretty fun.\" My wife gave the go-ahead, and even offered to help me flirt if I wasn't sure what to say. I was over the moon. \n\nThere's no question that I was the asshole at this point: Having zero experience flirting in over a decade, I took it over the line into outright sexting. No pics, but me and the lady I was flirting with had covered pretty much all the ground in texts. There was a point at which I realized I'd fucked up, and came clean to my wife about it on my own. She was really, really, rightfully pissed. I took what was coming, stayed in my doghouse, and worked to make it up to my wife. Wife told me that she felt partially responsible for greenlighting everything, but not staying as involved as she felt she could have, and that I shouldn't just dump my flirt. Wife said we could keep in contact, but to keep it strictly G-rated. \n\nThat lasted all of two days before the lady I was flirting with made a sexual comment about me being sensitive to one of her phobias, saying \"The fact that you care about this stuff really turns me on.\" Remembering the doghouse, I immediately blew the whistle and told my wife, and she shut everything down. I went with it, remembering my fuckups from before. Before I cut communications, I'd told the lady I was flirting with that I hoped we could stay friends, that there was a lot I thought we had in common, platonically, and that even though she made a clear mistake, I still thought we should be friends. Her response was \"you shouldn't stay friends with me.\" Normally, I'd leave it at that, but I knew that the lady I'd been flirting with had a history of depression and found the darkness a little too easily at times. I told her I wasn't going to just abandon her. \n\nThen, my wife said she was just done with all this drama, and had cut communications, and that she really wanted me to do the same. Again, remembering my fuckups, I didn't feel like I was in a position to argue, so I cut ties...but I really wonder if that was an asshole move after I'd told her everything I did about not abandoning her. So, my judges, AITA for going back on my word?  \n\n\nTL;DR - Married, monogamous dude gets permission from wife to flirt, it goes too far, wife shuts it down, flirtee crosses a line, dude basically promises flirtee not to abandon her, circumstances prevail and dude breaks promise, and now wonders if he ITA.

      "description": "My parents paid for all of my brother's tuition and they have been paying for mine too. I took summer classes (around ~$5,000.00) and they had just put an addition on their house so they asked me to pay it and they'd promise to pay me back. I have a really stressful job that I work while going to school and I work really hard and save most of my money. I'm planning on moving out of my small town after college and my parents are unsupportive of that so I want to be able to save as much as possible so I don't have to rely on anyone. \n\nSo I took that money out of my savings to pay for the classes. But now, six months later (I kept giving them time) they say that they're not going to pay me back and that I should be grateful that they even pay for my schooling and that I should be paying for it to begin with since I have a job (there's no way I could afford it).

We've been dating for about 7 months and are currently living together. However, the pill affects my mood terribly and really spikes my depression and anxiety to the point where it sometimes makes me non-functional. \n\nSo I'm planning on changing to the contraception bar. This is for three years and is 99.9% effective. However, it costs roughly about €400-450 total once off payment including implantation. This is quite a spike and I could do with the help to pay but I make about €300 more a month in wages so I feel bad asking him to pay half. I know if I'd ask he'd give it no bother, but in the general grand scheme is it an asshole move?\n\nWill I be the asshole if I ask him?",

At some point they must've started talking about me (idk if this is the case) because he started texting her friend about me. I feel a little uneasy about this situation but because he's been my best friend since 2012 I let it slide. At this point he's telling me this girl is cute and I should get with her.\nI should point out that this girl is located in China. If it were in New Zealand I may have considered it okay because it would be possible to meet this girl.\nI tell him that I didn't want to talk to her because of this, he responds with \"it only takes a minute to get to know someone.\" At this point I started getting pissed because I've said no about it multiple times at this point. He gets pissed as well and says that I should at least talk to her. From here I explain that I have no interest in \"e-dating\" or whatever the fuck it's called and that I had no interest in talking to a complete stranger over Facebook. (Idk if that's weird or not because I dont like talking to strangers on Facebook.) \nIt's at this point he gets pissed about it and basically says whatever.\nCome to this morning I find out he's told her my snapchat username and god knows what else. I confront him about this and he claims he told her  my info yesterday. I dont believe him and I'm pissed, so that brings me to the verdict: am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Hi Folks, first time potential asshole here, this occurred yesterday:\n\nMy spouse and I recently moved into a new neighborhood. It's been great as we now have a yard for our 1.5 year old dog to run around in. As it's getting cooler though, in the mornings I've stopped letting him out there on his own since he will run through grass that has condensation from the cool night on it. It makes his paws wet and then he gallops through our unfinished parts of the yard and gets muddy. What I've been doing is taking him on a leashed walk through the neighborhood to stretch his legs.\n\nCome to yesterday morning. I'm walking him down our street which ends in a cul-de-sac. We get about five houses down from ours and a neighbor is getting in their car. They see us walking up and kindly let us walk by before they pull out of their driveway. We continue on passing a few more houses and rounding the end of the street when my dog does what he does best, lays a steamer in a different neighbors yard. I'm always prepared for this and have a baggie ready, I pick up the poop and am tying off the bag. As I turn around the neighbor from before has pulled up to me in their car and says:\n\n\"We don't like it when dogs poop in our yards, no one around here does. Take them somewhere else to do that, like the dog park\"\n\nI try to explain that's difficult when I work normal day hours and dog parks are not nearby. They don't seem to want to hear me and drive off.\n\nI was in shock, this neighbor had stayed in their car for a few minutes to, supposedly, watch me walk my dog and then bring this up to me right as they watched me bag the deed. I completely agree that you shouldn't leave your dogs business in someone's yard, but I thought it was a normal practice that it's OK as long as you pick up after them.\n\nPS: We live in a neighborhood with no HOA, but not sure that matters.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I let my dog poop in a nieghbors yard and as I was picking up the poop a separate neighbor told me to have my dog poop somewhere else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We spent a lot of time together, and he confessed he had feelings for me. However, I told him that I prefer women (I’m bisexual), and he lost it. He got mad at me for leading him on, which I won’t deny, because I didn’t explicitly say no. He did say he had a crush on me, but I was vague about it. I told him it was okay that he felt that way, but I didn’t outrun say I didn’t feel the same.\nAfter I rejected him, he became suicidal and would constantly corner me, telling me that it was my fault that he wanted to kill himself, and kept berating me. Every time we spoke, it would always fall back to me rejecting him. We couldn’t even say one word before we started fighting over it. I wanted to tell him it was emotionally manipulative, but he said I was no better(which I think he’s right. Giving him hope was a shitty thing to do.) It was taking its toll on me, and it got to the point where my own mental health was taking a hit. So during yet another fight, I told him I did feel something for him. \nHe was elated and the fighting stopped, and we began dating. I told myself that I would fall in love with him gradually over time, but I’m not feeling anything more than friendship. It’s been six months. And if I end it, it’s right back to the fighting and him threatening to kill himself because I led him on and don’t want to date him.\n\nAMITA for saying yes and lying to his face?

      "description": "Me 20M has been dating a girl 18F for about 6 months now. Things have been going well, but throughout the whole relationship she’s been borrowing her guy friends clothes and constantly wearing them. Hoodies, sweatpants, shirts, doesn’t matter. She always does this, she always has, but within the last two weeks I have told her that it bothers me that she continues to do this. She said it’s understandable and that she would stop, but now she has continued to do it without me knowing. I confronted her on this and she said that she hasn’t borrowed and new clothes, which is true that she said she would stop, but she is still wearing them. Would I be the asshole if I continued to get upset and possibly end the relationship over this?",

I knew she hated me, and I thought it was my fault. \n\nYears later, some family drama takes place. I went NC with mother as soon as I left the house, but the rest of my family did not. During this dramatic turn, I am appalled to hear my sibs and father wax rhapsodic about how wonderful mother was. I tried to ignore it, but it just kept getting piled higher and deeper. Finally I sorta growled “She was an evil, abusive old woman trying to buy her way into heaven.”\n\nHoly shit, everyone lost it on me. Even my little brother, who I’ve talked to about this in the past, was like “I don’t agree with you, your experience was different than mine.” No kidding, Mr Golden Child. \n\nAm I the asshole for feeling like my family is still making excuses for mother, and treating me like I’m wrong to feel the way I do?",

      "description": "My husband and I (31 M and 28 F) tried for a few years to get pregnant. We are both college graduates, settled and already have a nice, two bedroom apartment in an area we love. This year, it finally happened. Two of my aunts are throwing me a baby shower to celebrate. \n\nThat said, my 13 year old cousin recently announced that she too is expecting. Again- this child is in the eighth grade. Against all better judgement and even the option to give the baby up for adoption to a close family member who so desperately want a child, she has decided that she is going to keep and raise the baby herself with her ninth grade boyfriend. \n\nMy other aunt —her mom— started throwing a fit about her sisters throwing me a shower (even to the point of telling me she hopes I miscarry so she doesn’t have to go to this @&amp;!? Party after all...) and says that if we’re going to have a party we should have a joint shower so my cousin doesn’t feel left out and judged by the family while we are celebrating my baby. \n\nThis branch of my family is vile, crude, mean-spirited and almost always drunk and I really don’t want them mixing with my amazing in-laws and tainting this day to make it all about them, as they did with my wedding. (Whole other story!) \nMy aunts have left it up to me to decide if I want to share or if they should throw a separate party for her later on. \n\nAITA for not wanting to share this celebration of my child and this new phase of my adult life with a Middle Schooler who honestly shouldn’t be procreating in the first place? \n\n(Not here for abortion debates, please and thank you. It’s after that point anyways.) ",

      "description": "I work in an somewhat of an open shop where we maintain medical equipment. There are several computer stations around in this room which we use to process paperwork or work on smaller items where we have tools and some random desk items (sticky notes, pens, stapler etc) handy. Each person in my shop pretty much has claimed a workstation as their own and keep different things in those desks. Paperwork, snacks, really whatever they want to have a spot for. The thing is though, those desks aren't EXPLICITLY assigned to us so each person having a personal station is really more of an informal understanding between us, and we don't really use other people's stations unless we have to.\n\nRecently however we've had a new addition to our team at the shop, I was out of the office for about a week for other work related stuff, and when I got back I found that this person had set up their paperwork and whatnot at the station I have been using for several months. Now in this station I had (still have) some things that were mine; office supplies, hand sanitizer and documents mostly, nothing really that can't be moved or replaced, but as it turns out they were using those things, (assuming that they were provided by the shop), and the remainder of my work items had been shoved somewhat unceremoniously to the side. I asked them if they might move to another station as I had already set this one up for myself, and I had all my things in the drawers still, and they seemed angry about it. They asked me if really mattered where I  was at and that they already had their stuff there and were working for the day. I spent the rest of the day returning to this desk to grab documents and forms I needed and every time I went into the drawers they got progressively more annoyed. I'm pretty certain they have no intention of moving from that station or setting one up for themselves. And while I can take all my items somewhere else I would have to set up a computer and desk again the way I had it which seems unnecessary. It seemed a little annoying to me that they took over what was understood as my space, and i'm kind of insisting they move somewhere else, but they clearly have no intention to.\n\nAITA for asking them to move from this station?",

      "description": "My last relationship was awful. My boyfriend jumped into things before he was over his ex, and spent months doing some pretty sketchy things with her. Eventually I gave him an ultimatum: cut his ex off and commit to a relationship with me, or I was leaving. He agreed to cut her off, and we discussed specific terms like deleting her phone number, removing her on social media, etc. That was nearly two years ago. A few months ago, I found out he had just changed the name in his contacts list and actually still had her number (...and her nudes). I broke up with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're not dating anymore. We're also not speaking about his ex or his lies anymore and have agreed to be friends since we work together and participate in a lot of the same activities. We are regular partners on class projects, play tennis together, he lets me use his laundry machine since my building doesn't have one. In some sense we almost act like we're still dating, on any given hour I could probably tell you where he is and vice versa. We text every day, hug frequently, and I have had sex with him a few times since the break up. The last time was over a month ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo weeks ago I slept with someone else I met online. When he asked about my day the next afternoon, I only vaguely mentioned 'seeing a friend'. My new guy is strictly a FWB; if I'm honest, my ex was extremely selfish in bed and I've felt unfulfilled for a long time. This new relationship has made me feel a lot better and brought some fresh energy into my love life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, now that I'm sleeping with someone else, I'm starting to feel like I'm using my ex. I don't think he'd let me come over and do my laundry at his place if he knew about my FWB. He probably wouldn't hug me the way he does or help me with class projects either. In some sense, I feel guilty of the same thing he did when we were dating: seeing someone else on the side. It's obviously quite different since we are both very clear on the fact that we are not dating anymore but it still feels a little wrong. On the other hand, I don't think he is entitled to know about my sex life since we are not together and I will not sleep with him again. So, Reddit, am I the asshole? Should I tell him, and if so, does anyone have advice on how to do it?",

I find it a boring game and even worse it's not a group activity.  When you play backgammon you sit there, concentrate on the board and converse back and forth with your partner about backgammon.  On top of that when I'm not playing I find the constant dice rolling to be extremely annoying. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't reply in the group chat as i had missed the initial conversation but when i saw the outcome i sent a text to my friend saying i wasn't coming.  When he asked why I simply stated that I didn't want to spend my Saturday listening to 4 hours of dice rolling and backgammon talk.  He asked me again to come and i simply declined.

      "description": "So I work in a school and a teacher went on paternity leave (we will call him Bill).\n\n.\n\n**Background on Bill (feel free to skip)**\n\nStrike 1\n\nBill has previously acted in ways that have unnerved me. When I started at the school he made inappropriate comments about the students (like that the girls' chairs 'would be wet' when a certain member of staff wears a suit to an event); these made me feel very uncomfortable as I don't feel that they are the sort of comments that should be made in a professional environment. \n\nStrike 2\n\nHe then attempted to add me on Facebook (I denied) and sent me selfies of himself (just normal selfies) asking how I was going. As we are both in relationships I found this strange and unwarranted. \n\nStrike 3\n\nBill is not someone I am close to (in fact I try to avoid him). When he was leaving for annual leave, I said goodbye to everyone as I was leaving the office and he made a big deal about the fact that I didn't say goodbye to him personally (???) and demanded a hug. I asked if he was going to solicit hugs from everyone in the office but he engaged in a non-consensual body squeeze between the two of us and didn't answer. It actually made me feel sick and intimidated. I am the only person he treats like this and I feel that he is doing it on purpose because it makes me feel uncomfortable.\n\n.\n\n**Important part of segment - am I the arsehole? (asshole?)**\n\nSo Bill PM'd me on FB (apparently not accepting his FR was not a big enough hint that I don't want contact outside of work) pictures of the baby and announcement info (weight, length, name etc). It was announced at briefing and I heard other teachers telling students that asked. So when my students asked, I told them the babies name and showed the image that had been bulk messaged to staff.\n\n.\n\nBill comes back from leave and pulls me aside saying it was his announcement to make and how dare I take that away from him etc. He was disappointed that when he went to tell students they had already heard it from me. I said I was sorry and that I didn't realise that announcing the name was of importance - I thought I was being nice to students who had shown an interest. He was a bit confrontational and I felt intimidated by the whole \"chat\" to be honest.\n\nAm I the arsehole here? I've apologised but he said that it \"wasn't good enough\".",

      "description": "Two years ago, right after my husband and I had adopted our dog, we left her to stay with his parents for a night. I wrote up detailed instructions and also told them verbally that it was very important she was not left out in the yard because there was a gap in the fence she had wiggled through the previous day when I went around to the front yard. Since we had just gotten her, I was terrified she'd get out and not know how to get back. Well, shockingly, they did not listen (they're nice people, but this is not unusual) and left her in the yard and she got out. My husband and I had to spend the entire day searching in 15 degree weather and very, very luckily we got her back. His parents were not apologetic in the slightest and I was very upset at the time. Since then, we've rebuilt a great relationship with them but I've made it clear to my husband I'm not cool with leaving her with them again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this week, I'm visiting my Mom on the other side of the country, and my husband casually mentions he's left the dog with his parents for the day. I was LIVID. I told him that he had gone behind my back and done something I had said over and over again I wasn't cool with. He claims that because he told them not to let her out and because he never agreed to not leave her with them (though he has never strenuously disagreed either) and because it 'worked out', that I have no right to be mad. He also has said he didn't 'know' that he was going behind my back so he didn't need to tell me. I feel like he should have at least told me that's what he was doing and what his plan was (for instance, I would have been more comfortable if he told me what he'd said to them or what he said to his brother, who lives at home and who I trust). I told him that it was a violation of my trust and that what he had done had crossed a line. I also told him that in order to figure out what he needed to tell me, he should have used his damn brain.

      "description": "So it's been a few weeks since the incident, but I am a navy wife with a deployed husband and 8 month old twin daughters. I sometimes only eat one meal a day because that all I have time for. My brother is 23 living at home keeps claiming he's going to join the air force. He is mildly autistic as well.\n\nI went to go vist my parents and they happened to buy some pizza that night. I was goofing playing games with my siblings. while my younger sister watched and played with my girls. My mom REALLY wanted to talk so I take off to the store with her leaving my barely touched pizza on the table. I know that wasn't the smartest choice, but whatever the only people that clean are my mom, my little sister, and younger brother so I thought it was fine. I did it before when I was living at home.\n\nMe and my mom talk she gets some things off her chest and we return. I go up stairs wanting that delicious pizza and it's gone the one time my older brother decides he wants to clean it just happens to be the one day I forget to eat anything else. Now I'm fuming, because 1 I'm hangry, 2 about a month ago he punched my 16 year old youngest brother in the gut (my 23 year old brother was treated to ice cream over it), 3 he's done some other messed up crap.\n\nSo I go charging down to his room in the basement, he answers the door, and I proceeded to yell at him saying that the pizza was the only thing I had to eat all day and than it breaks into a rant about how he needs to be more considerate of other people because when he joins the military even though they claim bot to care they do and if he treats his future fellow airmen the same way he will be eaten alive. \n\nHe held up his hand and I thought it was going to be an apology and I would've apologized back, but NO his exact words were \"thank you OP for giving me another reason why I don't want to live.\" To which I replied with \"what kinda messed up logic is that?! I'm just asking you to consider other people's feelings.\" He than goes in a rant about how he knows that no one loves him and how he'll be happy to leave. I left before he finished, because I knew I was going to say something that I might regret. \n\nI took my other brother to a gas station with me that had a little restaurant inside, we filled up and got food. Flash forward a to a couple days ago my mom gets on my case to apologize and I said no, because I would not mean it in the slightest and I personally hate hollow apologies. She said it would mean a lot to her as he now refuses to leave his room except to go to classes. He's on spring break. So I bought him two tickets to the new captain marvel movie as a peace offering. For him and whoever he wishes. He turned me down so fast.\n\nSo the question is am I the asshole for not wanting to apologize and for demanding he treat others like humans?",

      "description": "Sorry for any formatting issues I'm on mobile.\nI have a friend that I've been close with for close to a decade. We met in high-school and have been close ever since. Two years ago she met a guy that we had gone to school with that was a few years older. He had a failed marriage and twin daughters that were a few months old. Noone in our friend group was a fan of him but supported her anyway. Within 6 months they were engaged and they were married almost a year later. They moved about 6 hours away immediately after the wedding so he could get a job as a cop.  She had worked two jobs to support him thru the academy.\n\nShe reached out to me about 4 months ago and said she would be in town and wanted to get together. We got lunch and told me she had caught her husband having an affair with a younger woman and she was moving home. I spent all my free time making sure she was doing okay. I helped her thru her depression, helped her find a job, let her live with me while she looked for a place so she didn't have to stay with her parents. I even helped her move into her new place. I went with her to the divorce attorney when she decided she was done.\n\nAbout a month ago she had gotten kind of distant. I saw her ex was in town and texted her to give her a heads up, but never got a response. I ran into her sister and she said that they had gotten back together. I kept reaching out with no response. I finally asked her and she initially said no, then a day later said they had gotten back together but she didn't want to tell me. I immediately ceased contact and haven't spoken to here in 3 ish weeks. \n\nOur mutual friends are calling me an asshole for not supporting them, but in reality I'm hurt I wasted all that time making sure she was okay and she lied to me about it. So AITA?\n\nTLDR: friends husband cheated. I did everything to support her and make sure she's okay and she lied to me about them getting back together so I stopped talking to her.",

      "description": "First time poster here. 24 y/o male.\n\n\nMy dad got engaged about a year ago and shortly after, he asked if I would be his best man. I accepted because we were on relatively good terms at that time.\n\nShort background is that he has been verbally abusive, manipulative, and has been in generally just a down right bad father my whole life. He has supported me financially because he is wealthy, but it has come at a cost of him demanding unreasonable performance, that if not met, brings wrath. I tried my best when I was younger but I am now financially on my own so I am creating distance. \n\nAn example of his character- When both of my parents were still together, my moms mother died and he told my mom if she did not sign over her $1M inheritance, he would not allow her to use any of his money. She signed it over and he invested it in real estate. When they split, that money was not traceable due to his shady accounting techniques, and it was lost. My mom never touched a cent of that $1m. My parents split after an argument ended with him putting his wedding ring on her bathroom sink (double vanity) for a few weeks. My mom left a bit after that. This was 9 years ago.\n\nOn Christmas Eve of 2018, my grandfather on my moms side was airlifted to where I live from where he lived, a few hours away. I was in a different state visiting a friend at the time, but drove home upon hearing this. I called my dad to tell him, and he basically said nothing and told me to drive safe. No condolences. Next day we were all meeting for lunch at my grandmothers on his side for Christmas and he was very awkward. I called him out for not talking to me about my dying grandfather and he flew off the handle calling my grandfather all sorts of names. I left and didn’t see him for a few weeks until I sat down with him and tried to hash it out. He told me he should not have treated me poorly for how bad of a person my now deceased grandfather was. ( the man won a Pulitzer Prize for eradicating the KKK in his town, as he was the owner of the local newspaper. Not a single bad bone in his body). All he did was defend my mother in their divorce. \n\nLast weekend was my dads bachelor party in west palm.  Reluctantly I went but it was so awkward. I kept things civil but he was ignoring me and rude, etc.\n\nThe last thing he was helping me with financially was my car, which he stopped paying for about a week after my grandpa died. I’ve been paying that and the insurance since. He’s trying to stress me financially to make me need him. \n\nAm I an asshole if I ditch the wedding? 300 people are coming out, and it’s a pretty “high society” affair in our city and I risk my name being tarnished, but the thought of going up on the stage to deliver a speech in honor of him makes me want to drive my car full speed into a brick wall. \n\nThanks for any comments and sorry for the long post. Emotional stuff. \n\n",

      "description": "Now I have always felt like the least liked child when it comes to my mom. My parents went through a bad divorce a few months after I got born, and my mom ended up getting full custody of me, with no timeplan or anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow although I don't know if I'm the cause of the divorce, I feel like I am and my mom probably agrees with me on that point. I feel like I have always had to \"pay\" for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is everything like weird small things like her always making jokes at my expensive when at family gatherings (everything from embarrassing stories to ridiculing medical conditions) to what I would call borderline abuse, saying that she would beat me black and blue and throw me where no-one would ever find me and saying that she would send me to an orphanage before killing herself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow when I was in my late 15's I got sent to a boarding school, which was actually very refreshing and helped me gain self-confidence and friends etc. This also meant that I had a chance to get in contact with my dad, which I had not been allowed to do before, and quite frankly I like my dad and my dads side of the family a lot more than my mom/moms side. This meant that I automatically got closer to my dad and distanced myself from my mom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also smaller things that make me feel like I'm less than my older brother. My mom paid for my brothers drivers license, first car, school equipment like books and laptops, multiple international trips and gave him allowance. In comparison my mom paid for the boarding school I go to, and that's it. She didn't pay a penny for any of that, and even when it comes to birthday presents, I remember when my brother turned 18 he got around $3000 in various stocks and bonds, I got a wire transfer of $200 and a happy birthday call. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe obvious explanation for this is that she has less money now compared to then, but I know that's not true since she worked as an accountant when my brother was my age, and now she is executive director for a somewhat big danish company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the rambling ends: I turned 18 mid October this year, and I arranged my plans for Christmas myself this year. The plan I had made was that the days leading up to Christmas I would be with my dad and his family, celebrate Christmas with my mom the 24th (in Denmark you celebrate Christmas the 24th), leave at around 10pm and catch a late flight to London and celebrate Christmas with my girlfriend and her family the 25th (girlfriends family is from London) and stay with her for a few days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me that sounds like a pretty fair distribution of time, but when my mom asked about my Christmas plans she freaked out and asked why I even wanted to celebrate with my girlfriend since we have only been together for 2 years, and why I wanted to be with my dad since he is mean and that he tried to send me to an orphanage when I got born. I told her that I'm an adult and I will do with my time as I please, to which she tried to guilt-trip me about how she spend so much time and ruined her life trying to make me successful, and if I really just wanted to betray her like that.\n\n \n\nI told her that I was done with that guilt-tripping and that was the straw that broke the camels back, and I was gonna celebrate Christmas with my dad instead before hanging up the phone. Then I blocked her on all social medias and blocked her number from my phone, ultimately trying to cut my mom out of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was the 4th December, and my brother called me earlier today telling me that he just got off the phone with my mom crying that I hated her and my brother told me that I should give my mom another chance, I started feeling bad but I feel like I did the right thing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom an outsider perspective, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "This is probably a very mild story here but I really gotta get this off my chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in April my best friend of two years and I are going to a convention together, and we got a hotel in my name. The hotel is very expensive and we're paying fairly.\n\nAbout a couple weeks ago my best friend asked if their friend could stay with us, since the person really wanted to go to the con.\n\nHere's some background info on my friend, we'll just call them M. M is the type of person who needs someone around them at all times, and needs lots of friends to accommodate with this. However, because of this M has made VERY toxic and abusive friends. They mentioned to me one of their new friends at the time got drunk and beat them, another friend did unspeakable things to them, and more just ended up using them for their money. I've had an encounter with a \"new friend\" which ended up them verbally abusing me and me getting a panic attack over it. Little to say I REALLY don't trust their \"new friends\" when they show up. TLDR, they become friends with toxic people.\n\nBecause of this, I'm EXTREMELY uncomfortable having the thought of a stranger I don't know, and possible toxic person stay with me overnight. I explained my side to them, but they seemed very disappointed and upset over my decision. I'm diagnosed with severe anxiety and they know this, but I constantly feel like I'm in the wrong here.\n\nam i the asshole for declining?",

      "description": "Context: I grew up very much low-income in LA and the only reason I am financially independent as I am is because of my parents helping me so much financially/emotionally and what have you. Anywho, I went to college on a scholarship and ended up getting a job that I didn’t expect to pay me this much as I have no experience and just graduated with my bachelors last June. Not six figures yet but definitely more than fresh graduates do make. So my relationship with my parents is mostly really strong, love em to death, then I came out as queer and we drifted apart for about a year (they’re conservative immigrant latinx peepz), then we worked things out and are much better off. I’m 23 years old now. \n\nIssue: So I moved to San Francisco and got this job, so it’s been a whole thing getting my parents to understand why I would want to be somewhere new and not save all of my money and live at home. I understand being fiscally responsible and I feel like I am that. My whole plan was to cover all monthly expenses (including rent/utilities) with my 1st paycheck, and my 2nd paycheck of the month will go to my savings. I’ve been looking to move as I live far from work, spend a lot of money on public transportation and car insurance, so in total ends up being close to $1200 (including rent) and that’s excluding parking which would be an extra $100 that I just don’t pay for cuz parking tickets aren’t that popular here for that. So my budget to move was $1000-1400. People who are in the bay area (especially in the city) know that is a typical range for people who don’t want to break the bank but still have convenience of the city. Anywho, I call my mom excited that I found a place (with really cool people) and then she asks me the price and I say it’s $1400. She gets UPSET with me exclaiming how that’s a sin and how I know they’re struggling and I’m not giving them that kind of money. Once I get her to realize that my $800 in rent is actually about $1200 w/o paying for parking, and once I move I’m giving the car back to my parents and won’t pay for public transportation/insurance, she realizes that it isn’t that much of a grand difference in actuality. So the problem is that she made me feel like a dick that I’m doing this. But I’m queer, love being here in the city, having a different experience, and DO plan on giving them money just once I save more first so I can feel more of a safety net. \n\nBasically, AITA for wanting this experience for myself? Or am I really being a dumb bitch about this whole situation? Living at home just isn’t enticing for me, I’m so comfortable being surrounded by queer energy in the bay area and also exploring a new city/new people atm. Gonna talk to my mom later too to let her know how she made me feel.\n\nTLDR: Am I an ungrateful bitch for living within my means and saving for myself, instead of just living at home and giving my parents rent money?

      "description": "My wife is a veterinarian and started at a new practice a couple months ago. This practice is much larger with a more formal structure than the one she left (left a one owner practice and went to a mid sized corporate group). Today was her day off, except she had to attend a doctor's meeting in the late afternoon. These meetings can take up to two hours.\n\nShe kept floating the idea of taking our oldest to the meeting, which I kept saying was unnecessary as I stay home with our other two kids and regularly get him after school on days she's working. She eventually told him he might be able to come with her, which in his mind means he gets to go with Mommy to work. At this point I flatly told her no, he's not going. This upset him, as he doesn't understand that neither an hour plus meeting of professionals nor an active vet center is somewhere a 5 year old should be.\n\nI know she wants to spend more time with the kids, our son especially, but bringing him to a doctor's meeting where she needs to be actively participating isn't the way to do it.\n\nTL/DR: wife wanted to take our 5 year old to a doctor's meeting, I said no.

      "description": "So some background information. I am a gay male in my 20’s living in NYC.\n\nA few days ago I met this guy on grindr and went to his apartment and hooked up with him. He told me that he was interested in doing a group thing because he’s never done it before. I said that I could host one because I have my own apartment so we would have free run of the place. We started a group chat on grindr yesterday and began looking for guys for a sex party that was supposed to occur today. The group chat was not active at all yesterday and it wasn’t until this morning that people were chatting and showing interest. \n\nThere were a few guys in the group. I had added one of them who I had previously hooked up with. After a little bit, several of them bailed and new guys were added so we were about 5-6 total. \n\nI didn’t know these new guys and that’s when I started to get cold feet. I didn’t want complete strangers in my place (the guys previously were friends of the guy I originally planned the group with. He didn’t know all of the new guys). I wasn’t sure how they would treat my place, if they would steal stuff, etc. The more I thought about it, the more anxious I felt. I wasn’t even horny and it did not feel like a good vibe/time to me.  Bottom line is that I did not want to have sex (with anyone). \n\nSo I texted the originally guy and told him my reasons and that I didn’t think I could host these guys. The guys had only confirmed about an hour ago (while I was at the gym and didn’t see the messages) and they wanted to come over in another hour from the time I cancelled. \n\nWell the original guy flipped out on me. Told me he was really disappointed and said that he had cancelled plans. He also mentioned that my friend had cancelled going to a bday party for this (which he did not because I saw he was there currently on his Instagram story). Basically he was trying to guilt me into still having them over. \n\nI feel really terrible about this and that I inconvenienced him/these random strangers. I totally understand that this was flaky of me and I apologized to him several times. He kept saying that other people had cancelled plans too and eventually said that he doesn’t want to meet up with me ever again. I said that was totally ok and warranted. \n\nNow I’m left feeling like an asshole. AITA because I changed my mind/consent and didn’t want to host strangers at my place for a sex party?\n",

      "description": "***TL;DR***:   I left my ex over skype, 700km away from her, 10 days before school   started knowing well that we'd see each other everyday at school. I  couldnt do it anymore.\n\nI work summers full time, 12 days work, 2 day weekend, 4 months. It is a very physically demanding job.\n\nAs the summer goes on, she gets more and more demanding of my time, requiring that I call her **every single day** after work and that we spend almost all night talking on the phone. The weekends I work and with her she keeps me awake at 11-12pm   when I have to wake up at 4am. During  the weekend we also do all of her  chores. Laundry, groceries, vet for  the cat, all by car in a city that  I hate, so no rest here. I'm also the one  paying for \\~everything we  do.\n\nI get exhausted, to the point of  being sick for 2-3 days. I tell her I need to rest because I'm really  tired and was just sick. She takes it super personal, calls me  names  and claims that I don't love her for not wanting to spend time  with  her. This would happen every time I said or did  something she didnt  like.\n\nAnyway, we get into a big fight,  as in, bigger than usual. We don't talk for 2 days, and honestly,   during those 2 days, I only felt **relief.**\n\nTwo   weeks further, she's now at her parent's place, I'm about to finally  take my week off from work before school. She  asks me if I want to  visit her at her parent's place for the week.  She wanted to spend time  together there, but also for a  gynecologist apointment that she was  gonna have.\n\nBasically,  I refuse a first  time clearly mentioning that I needed to rest a lot  before uni  started. She tries to convince me. I refuse a second time clearly   insisting on my exhaustion and needed rest.\n\nShe  calls names, says it's not her problem if I chose an exhausting job (it  wasnt for 3 years before her),  accuses me of not doing anything for  her and not doing any effort for  our couple. At that point I was  already close from leaving her so I say  \"so be it\" and then she blocks  me on facebook. I tell her by text \"it's  sad that it finished on such a  bad note. I just want you to know that  I'll respect you anyway.\" She  calls me panicking asking if it's really  over. I tell her I need time  to think, after four days, I break it off  by skype video call. I wanted  to leave her while she  was at her parents so she has someone to be  with while being  heartbroken.\n\nShe   claimed afterwards that I was extremely mean for breaking it off and   calls me a monster for leaving her by skype, 10 days before school   started. She then accused our mutual friends of plotting behind her   back with me for wanting to hurt her. Then at school she tried to rally   up every one in our program against me telling the story I'm telling  here.\n\nSo reddit AITA ?",

      "description": "Sorry, this is on mobile.\n\nLet me preface this a little bit. Me and my brother hardly ever hang out. He lives in another state, and we don’t really talk much online, but whenever we get together to hang out we always have a great time.\n\nHe came home for the holidays this week. On Tuesday, me, my brother, my mom, and my dad scheduled some stuff to do today, Wednesday. We did have any dinner plans and we’re just planning on going somewhere on a whim.\n\nWhile we are still out and about, I get a call from one of my closest friends. Apparently they wanted to do literally the exact same thing this coming weekend. One thing that was different was they had a restaurant in mind they wanted to try (which just so happens to be the kind of restaurant my brother has been raving about). My brother overheard us talking about this restaurant and thinks it’s a good idea for us to go after we get finished with what ever it was we were doing. He told our parent and was really excited about it, much to my friends protest.\n\nI wasn’t sure what to do at this point. The way I saw it, I had two options:\n\n1- I would not say anything, piss off my friends for doing something without them, and end up feeling like shit because my friends are mad at me.\n\nOr \n\n2- Tell my family that we can’t go because my friends wanted to go later, thus ensuring we would probably never go there as a family. This would either do nothing at all because of how excited my brother was, making my friends mad, or it would it would work and I’d feel like shit for ruin my brothers day.\n\nThere didn’t seem like much I could do, so told my family about my friends plan and we went to eat there anyway. My brother decided it would be funny to taunt my friends with pictures  of the food there. I told him not to, that doing something like that would start something that I’d have to clean up, but it was too late.\n\nI got a bunch of angry texts after that, with one of my friends saying I “spoiled” the trip (even though she already told everyone where we were going). I tried to tell them there wasn’t anything I could do without sounding like a ridiculous asshole, but they didn’t care.\n\nI feel like an asshole, but I don’t know if that just me over thinking things, I’d really like some perspective on this. Thanks.\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for being pissed at the girl who ruined our choir concert recording?",
      "description": "Let's start with a preface. When someone ruins something you love, you get pissed off at them, right? I do. (TLDR at bottom)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sing in a choir at my community college. Let's call it Apples Community College, or ACC. I am in the most basic Choir I class offered, as it sounded like fun. I have since become very passionate about it, and would like to continue as long as I'm able. My choir goes to a city 2 hours away to join 4 other choirs to sing together, it's really fun and sounds amazing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my favorite things is listening to the recording of the performance for the first time, hearing what it all sounds like put together rather than just hearing the few people around me. I like listening for my parts, and showing it to anyone who couldn't make it live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to this big concert. Our ACC choir was singing 2 songs on our own, then 3 songs as a megachoir, with everyone from all the attending choirs all singing together. That's about 140ish people, all singing together, having a good time, and it always sounds beautiful. It sure did during practice, and live, according to the audience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever. I would not be here posting without a however. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a girl in my choir. I do not know much about her, so these statements are from my observations and educated guesses. Let's call her Tara. Tara has a severe speech impediment, does not know how to read, and is entirely unable to follow directions or basic social cues. I assume she has autism. Regardless, she can't sing. She sticks out like a sore thumb audibly, and it makes it hard for everyone around her to sing because she's mumbling off-pitch nonsense, occasionally getting a word right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sympathize. I do. A close family member of mine is also severely autistic, and I am accustomed to interacting with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut does that mean she should be able to ruin the video recording of our concert by sitting next to the microphone and overshadowing all the beautiful singing with her own cringe-worthy 'singing'? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was almost in tears listening to the recording the first time I listened to it earlier today. Every single person on that stage worked SO hard to make this performance exceptional, and the parts where Tara wasn't saying anything sounded beautiful enough to tug at your heartstrings... But then she'd open her mouth again, and you couldn't hardly listen to it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add insult to injury, the recording was broadcasted live on television, meaning everyone who was listening heard only the bad singing from her. A lot of people tuned in live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am furious and upset and kind of heartbroken. I put so much time and work into learning to sing as best as I could, and in one fell swoop it was ruined. How can I not be furious?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, people I've spoken to say I shouldn't be upset with her, she doesn't know any better, she can't be excluded like that, etc... But does her (potential) disability really exempt her from any potential consequences or blame? Why does she get a free ticket to do whatever the hell she wants? So as not to upset her? As cold as it may sound, how the hell is that my problem?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe I'm a bit bitter and prejudiced. My cousin who suffers similarly has always escaped any consequences and is given anything it takes to get her to stay quiet and to behave. She once kicked me in the throat and when I ran inside choking and crying, she was the one comforted because she was upset about it. I was left standing there, unable to breathe, 13 years old. And I was recently informed that when everyone else dies, it'll be my job to take care of her because \"she's family\". So maybe I'm just bitter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't think I am. I think I have every right to be quietly upset. Will I do anything about it? No. Barring complaining to a few close people to me, I'm not gonna do a damn thing. But I am upset. And I think I have every right to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Autistic girl who can't sing ruins the recording of our beautiful concert, people say I shouldn't blame her because of her disability, I think that's a bullshit cop-out. She still has fucking ears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to give back my school laptop?",
      "description": "So to start with background here: I am currently a first year college student studying information technology, and recently I had to pull money out of my school account to buy a laptop that was compatible with my computer programs for school (so a PC, not a mac, which is what I had) \n\nI am incredibly lucky to have two great grandparents on my father's side that were both doctors, and they have set aside a large amount of money in a bank account that my grandparents have control over that is specifically for me to go to school. Tuition, books, supplies. This fund has been available to me since I was in high school, but due to a long struggle with my mental health, I am just now going back to school at the age of 24. \n\nI want to make sure anyone reading knows that I recognize that I am super lucky, and privileged to have great grandparents that are willing to help me get through school. They chose to do this because we are the black sheep - my immediate family has a bad history of drug abuse, mental illness, and lots of drama. All my other family members are picture perfect Christians who did things by the book - school, house, marriage, kids, stable careers, etc. They gave me a way to work towards a better future without putting myself into debt, they are allowing me to have a really great start to my future now that I'm stable and have found medications that will allow me to lead a normal life. If I graduate, I will be the first in my immediate family to have a degree since my great grandparents. \n\nHowever, it sucks that my grandparents are in charge of the account. They are notorious for taking advantage of my great grandparents money, from new cars whenever they \"need\" it to vacations and more. When they got older and were physically unable to work, my great grandparents set them up with a retirement fund of over $100,000. If it helps to have the info, my grandparents are 65 and 72. I know it doesn't sound like it, but my little black sheep side of the family isn't used to seeing that kind of money. My grandmother was a waitress all her life and my grandpa was a cook, together they might have made $20,000 a year... $30 max. I have been a retail store manager for around seven years, and in the last year I considered myself lucky to make around $30,000. \n\nAnyways, here is the situation -\nA few weeks ago I realized that my macbook (that I've had since I was 16 and is a little outdated lol) was not compatible with the computer programs I needed to run for school.\n\nI am no longer working so that I can focus on school, and my super amazing boyfriend of six years is working and taking care of finances. Our goal is to switch once I'm done, so I will work and he will go to school. It might be odd, but it's what is working for us. Considering we don't have a lot of extra money these days, I went to my grandparents in the hopes that they would be willing to get me a cheap laptop using my school money, because I am really only using it for school. My grandpa and I went to Best Buy, and I picked out the lowest price full laptop we could find - $250. Afterwards, he casually mentioned that he expected me to give the laptop to my grandmother once I was done with school. \n\nWhile I haven't flat out refused, I plan to when he asks for it back, and I want to know if I'm being selfish/immature/spoiled in thinking this is right. \n\nHere are my reasons \n1) As previously mentioned in this post, I am hoping that my boyfriend will be able to go to school when I am done. Realistically it would be super beneficial for us to keep the laptop so that my boyfriend can have a school computer too when I'm done. Most people would say \"well it isn't the responsibility of your grandparents to help your boyfriend through school\" which is true but brings me to #2 \n2) Also previously mentioned, my grandparents have a bank account with $100,000 sitting in it and I can't help but feel it wouldn't be that big of a financial burden for them to spend $250 of their $100,000 if my grandma wants a new laptop that bad. \n3) My grandmother has destroyed over 5 different laptops with viruses and she honestly shouldn't have a computer. The last one she had, an ad popped up for a $500 computer program that would eliminate viruses from her computer and she was gullible enough to put her card info in and lose $500 to an internet scam... then her laptop crashed from viruses. \n4) Personally my most important point, is that they have been up my ass for YEARS about how that fund is for nothing but school. When I was younger and struggling, I had asked them for help financially a couple times through this giant bank account that I wasn't even sure I was ever going to use. This would result in giant lectures about how it wasn't their money and they didn't want to go against my great grandparents wishes by using it for anything other than school. It feels hypocritical to me for them to say \"no you can't use this money for anything other than school\" but then say \"when you're done with your school supplies I'll take them and download farmville\". \n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for wanting to hang on to a computer that I didn't buy with my own money, and not wanting to give it to someone else who didn't buy it? \n \n\nTLDR : Great grandparents on my grandpa's side pay for my schooling, and recently bought me a school computer. My grandpa expects me to give said school computer to my grandma when I'm done with school and I don't think I should have to because they didn't pay for it, she breaks every laptop she's ever had, they have more than enough money to buy a laptop if they really want one (money they got from my great grandparents), I am hoping my boyfriend can use it as a school computer when I'm done, and they are constantly lecturing me about how my great grandparents money that they gave me is only for school, not farmville and Facebook - AITA for wanting to say no? \n",

      "description": "*Context:*\n\nAfter talking with a girl for a few weeks, we mutually decided to get sexual. We explicitly agreed to only give each other oral for the first time and save penetration for a later time. Both of our schedules were busy so we actually scheduled the oral-only session for last night (this also made both of us anticipate it more). \n\n*My Actions/Point of View:*\n\nI decided to pick up some condoms and bring them to our session, so that if, on the off chance we changed our minds, we had the option. I hid them in my bag and didn’t announce that I had them so that the girl didn’t think that I was trying to pressure her at all. I truly had no intention of using them last night, but I wanted to be responsible if, in the heat of the moment, we had a change of heart. After our oral-only session, as I was leaving, the condoms fell out of my bag and she saw them.\n\n**Her Point of View:**\n\nAfter seeing them, she felt as if I was trying to deceive her and wasn’t honest with what I wanted. She said that bringing the condoms demonstrated I didn’t intend to abide by our terms and was disrespectful to her.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

(My mom is a vegetarian) and my brother lives with my mom. He's recently gotten into baking, which is great, but he always wants me to have some and he doesn't always make it vegan. \"A little butter wont kill you Kelsey\" well I understand that, but I also didnt ask for Pie. \n\nI didnt say \"make me a pie bitch\". But my brother is insisting that I need to eat is pie, cookies, cakes, loaves, etc. This is like a weekly conversation. \n\nMy mom is very loosey-goosey with veganism, she'll eat dairy sometimes so he thinks I'm the same. But the thing is, she has vegan butter in the house so why did he have to go out of his way to use dairy? It's just frustrating.\n\nI know my Vegan Card wont be revoked if I have a slice of pie, but I just feel like its mean to pressure me into eating dairy when he knows damn well I 👏dont👏 eat 👏dairy 👏. I've never pressured him to eat vegan. Nothing of the sort. \n\nHe's my brother and I'd love to have some of his pie to make him happy, I just don't want to be made out to be the bad vegan sister. I just feel like if he WANTS me to eat his food, it should be something I can eat. And if he makes something non-vegan I shouldn't be expected to eat it.

In doing so, I developed an aversion to junk food like a former alcoholic would to beer. I track everything and don't cheat because I know if I let myself eat cake once ( from experience ) I will keep eating junk at increasingly more frequent times in till I'm back to where I was. So instead, I just don't eat it ever. \n\nThis often leads to social problems. For some reason, every American event revolves around garbage food. Office meeting? Pizza, Co-workers birthday? Cake, Family reunion? Deep-fried pasta. It's not hard for me to resist these things but I get a lot of comments. \"Oh /u/Better_MixMaster, you know there is pizza right?\". I can deal with one or two but sometimes it's literally everyone I talk to. Or the even worse situation where someone just hands you food and assumes you want it. I often just throw it away when no one is looking. \n\nThis works because it's junk food for large groups and someone else would just eat my serving but it wouldn't work if someone specifically made something for me.

      "description": "I got my car serviced at my usual [brand] dealership yesterday. They offer to drop you off/pick you up from somewhere while your car is being serviced. I've had them drop me/pick me up from my house at least two or three times before without issue. In the past the guy who drove me was older (past middle-age? married with older kids etc.) but this time it was a guy who looked a bit younger than me (I'm late 20s).\n\n\nSo that same afternoon, after I'd collected my car and everything was done with, I notice I have a friend request on Facebook. I don't recognise the name but when I look at the profile I recognise the guy from the photo and his workplace is listed there. It's the young guy from the car dealership who dropped me off/picked me up for my car service. This makes me a bit uncomfortable. \n\n\nWe only made small talk while he was driving me, about the weather etc. and I told him where I worked. I'm a quiet and introverted person so I would have been happy to sit in silence but maybe the guys who do this job are told to make small talk or just naturally want to chat, I don't know. I wasn't being overly friendly or at all flirty. I told him my first name and he knows where I live because that's where he dropped me/picked me up from. (I'm assuming he was told or got my surname as part of his job, that specific detail I don't care about.)\n\n\nIn a scenario where the employee and the customer were getting on really well and one of them asked the other about hanging out or a friend request and the other person said yes - fine. That doesn't seem out of bounds.\n\n\nBut like I said, I feel a bit uncomfortable with this. I don't think he's a murderer or anything and I don't think this is bad enough that he deserves to be fired, but I think someone should tell him that this isn't okay.\n\n\nI saw this as a normal customer interaction. WIBTA? Am I overreacting? Usually they call after the service to make sure the customer is happy and I assume that will happen on Monday since it's the weekend and I believe they're currently closed. I tried looking for an email address but the only ones I could find were generic and for higher up in the company. ",

      "description": "Obviously, I am divorced from my ex-husband. We have been separated since 2009 but the divorce wasn’t final until 2017. \n\n\nWe have two children together a boy who is almost 25 and a girl who is 14. Our son is married with a child and is in charge of whatever contact with his father he has. \n\n\nOur daughter, on the other hand, lives with me. He has not seen her in three years but he calls her every single night. I have no problem with him calling her. (Personally, I wish he would actually try to see her but she says he never offers &amp; when she invited him to school functions he declines). However he will call her at anywhere from 7 pm on.  One night it was 1 AM because he woke up in the recliner(according to her) and realized he had not talked to her yet that night. He then called her repeatedly until he woke us both up from the phone ringing. There have been many occasions when she has been asleep and he has woken her up when he calls, not to mention the night she was at a friends house watching a movie and when she got finished, she had 27 missed calls from her dad. \n\n\n\n\n\nI want to know if I would be the asshole for telling him ”Look, 9:30 pm is the limit. Do not call any later. She has school and activities and if she does not answer wait 15 minutes to call back. If she does not answer then, she will call you the next day. “\n\n\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nI hated to do it but I actually ended up putting him on DND on her phone from 10 pm to 6 am this morning after asking him nicely to stop then asking a few weeks ago not so nicely and him calling at midnite last night. Repeatedly. Because she was asleep. ",

      "description": "So, background is my sister has severe special needs that cause her to need constant care &amp; it will be like that for the rest of her life.\n\nThe other day I told my mom I didn’t want to give birth to kids in fear of them being special needs, and she lowkey freaked out saying how it wasn’t genetic and how it shouldn’t matter to me. \nNow, I have nothing against people with special needs, and I don’t hate my sister, however if I had the choice I would obviously choose for her to be normal. Not just to ease her suffering but also mine &amp; the rest of my family’s.\n\nIt might be selfish for me to call it ‘suffering’, but the truth is that throughout my childhood I had severe feelings of resentment &amp; jealousy because I felt my mom just didn’t love me as much.\nI’m old enough now to look at the situation differently, but as a young child all I could see was my mother spending more time with her &amp; her being less available to participate in my life, before I understood what her disability really meant.\n\nThere was also a lot of embarrassment, in public &amp; especially when she would come to my school &amp; other kids would ask questions. I just didn’t want to answer &amp; have to explain everything because I just wanted to be seen as normal. My early teens were probably the worst in terms of embarrassment, I didn’t want to stand out and I hated being looked at. Even today, if I meet someone who I know I won’t have to see again and they’re making small talk, I’ll just tell them I’m an only child because I still don’t like explaining that my sister doesn’t have a job, she doesn’t have kids, and she never will. It’s not meant to disrespect her, but it just is easier for me.\n\nIt took me a long time to work out all of these feelings &amp; emotions and it had been a huge struggle in my life, especially to get over the feelings of resentment. I know my childhood would have been a lot easier &amp; better if I didn’t have my sister (not saying I would want that, but it’s just a fact).\n\nNow that I’m older, and am considering the idea of kids, I am terrified to give birth. Again, I might be being selfish here, but I would not want to sacrifice the rest of my life to my child. Constant care of someone who needs the care of a 1 year old baby for the rest of my life is something I never want to go through. I also believe that if I had a disabled child and a typical child, it would be unfair to the typical child, especially since I’m well aware of all the negative emotions I experienced throughout childhood. In general, my family is happy and I believe that growing up with a sibling with special needs has helped me in many different ways and can be a beneficial experience, but it’s the emotional struggle that I went through that affected me a lot.\n\nIf I do, in fact, decide to have kids, I will definitely move towards adoption. I don’t really understand why my mom would get upset about me telling her that, because it was in no way meant to offend her or my sister. I may be selfish in this situation but it’s my life, and I believe you need to be somewhat selfish to be happy. \n\nOverall, if I ever have kids I will love them no matter what, but is it wrong of me to not want to give birth for this specific reason? \n\n",

      "title": "AItA for reserving a seat for my girlfriend at the library?",
      "description": "Hey there,\n\nso, just a couple of hours ago I got into a little argument with a fellow student about a workdesk in our university's library. It's a common place to study for a lot of students as it's very quiet and most of the literature that we need is concentrated there. There's six \"seats\" or workdesks per large table, and there's about 40 large tables in the library, so if there's no exams immediately ahead, there's always a lot more free seats than occupied seats.\n\nAnyways, my girlfriend and I like to sit opposite from each other at the window side of the table (the tables are 3x2 seats: 2 seats at the window, 2 middle seats, 2 aisle seats). Normally, we enter together when the library opens at 8 am, sit down and study. This morning, however, my girlfriend needed to get to an early appointment, so I went alone, sat down at the window desk, and put some books on the desk opposite from mine, to \"reserve\" her workdesk. I put that in quoation marks, because apart from those two desks, there's virtually no other that is occupied. I just wanted to prevent someone to randomly pick that desk over any other random desk.\n\nSo then, at maybe 8.30 am, this guy comes to my table, sits down at the desk opposite from me, and puts the books at the desk next to him. Mind you, apart from those two desks, I can see literally no other occupied. The guy has not only 4 other desks to sit down, but also 12 at the tables next to ours (including 4 other window seats).\n\nSo I say: Excuse me, I put the books there for my girlfriend, who's coming any minute now.\n\nHe replies: So? I want to sit at the windows and you can't reserve seats for people.\n\nMe: I realize that, but would it be so bad if you just chose one of the other window seats?\n\nHe: Yes.\n\nMe: Well, ok.\n\nYes, you actually shouldn't save seats for people, but this is something a lot of people do at our library when there's plenty of space and no one gets denied a desk and it's something no one normally has a problem with. I got the feeling that for him it wasn't so much about where he sits, but about him wanting to show me I couldn't reserve seats, no matter how many other seats were available (really, I felt a bit like the guy in this pic [https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1031966-urinal-etiquette](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1031966-urinal-etiquette)). It's also that everytime I see a \"reserved\" seat like this, I just pick another one and don't think about it further. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, who's right here?",

      "description": "My aunt and uncle (60s) normally visit once I week. I(F22) live with and take care of my grandma. I haven’t been able to stand my aunts behavior anymore. They live about 30 minutes away and they’ll call asking if they can come over and show up about 5 minutes later. After they arrive my aunt comes in doesn’t even acknowledge anyone in the house, makes herself something from the fridge eats it, doesn’t clean up, then drinks the rest of my grandmas coffee, eats whatever candy or chips she can find and again doesn’t clean up. She recently gotten into a really bad habit of going into my grandmas bed, sheets and all, and going to sleep for maybe 30min-1hr. I normally just ignore them and leave but I had to let me puppy out to go to the bathroom and my aunt had left a piece of chocolate cake on the couch and he ate it. Not on a plate or a napkin just on the couch. So I just asked if it’s really that difficult for us to clean up after ourselves. And he was saying your dog will be fine. So I started arguing with him saying I need to call the vet and take him in now and cancel everything I had because I have to take care of my dog because my aunt can’t clean up anything. He told me again to get over it. I told him no I won’t because if people are going to be careless when they come and leave a mess and have no disregard for anyone in this house I’m not putting up with it. He then mumbled something to me and I asked what he said and he did the whole “U HEARD EXACTLY WHAT I SAID” to where I just responded no I did not hear you I’m on the phone with the vet to make sure my dog won’t get sick. After this happened they haven’t  visited again for about a month. I think a lot of this has been building up for quite some time because they both just come over to eat. They barely talk, sometimes they both just fall asleep after eating.  I would just like to know AITA? ",

      "description": "During my first year of university I met a girl. She was a friend of my flatmate and we got closer and began hanging out, I had feelings for her but she had a boyfriend at the time so I squashed my feelings away. As we got closer she trusted me enough to tell me that she works as an escort,  and thats how she's funding her uni tuitions. I didn't really care much about it I guess, just made sure she was safe.\n\nAfter graduating I moved away and we lost contact but a few years later I moved back to my hometown and she still lives here so we reconnected and it was like I never left. She had broken up and was single for a while, and she stopped escorting once she finished uni and found a job. She also revealed she had feelings for me and asked if we could try , and I will not lie in saying I definitely would have wanted to try, but i just couldn't get her past off my mind. Just imagining her having sex with some random guys just kind of pulled everything else down. I didn't want to hurt her but I didn't want to lead her on so in exact words I said, \"I'm sorry but I don't think i can get over your past.\" I kind of instantly regret saying that but yeah things went very downhill from there.\n\nI got lots of messages from her best friend(I think one of the only others who knows her past) calling me a \"disgusting piece of shit\" and that I don't deserve her, going as far as telling me to kill myself essentially.  I tried sending her messages but  she  ignores me, maybe I can apologise somehow?\n\nAITA for what I did?",

I try to stay on top of it, but sometimes either forget or put it off until later to watch youtube videos/play video games. Whenever my dad gets annoyed by work he'll come home, see something I haven't gotten done, and yell about how he has to do everything himself and how I wouldn't last a day in his life because I'm only interested in my computer.

He will always give me money if I ask, but that's just not in my nature.\n\nHe works for a large corporation where he has awesome insurance, and unfortunately they do not allow domestic partners to be on their health insurance plans. I, on the other hand, have very shitty insurance and have to mostly pay out of pocket for medical and dental bills (I had to take out a private loan just to pay for dental work, ain't America grand?). I also have an older car that I keep having to pump money into to keep it alive. \n\nI also want to mention I do 90% of the housework, I always feel that because he pays a little more in rent and has a high stress job that I want to contribute more around the house. Today we got into a big fight over it because he made food late last night and didn't clean ANYTHING- there was food left out, the stove had caked on sauce and the sink was full of dirty dishes. I, of course, cleaned up after him this morning. \n\nMy question is, would I be the asshole if I were to ask him to pay more of the rent or contribute more financially since he makes so much more than me?

He completely threw the rug underneath me at the end of last month and said he was going to sign the lease for another year.  It's been the cause of a lot of fights since then.\n\nWe are always having money issues.  He works at a hardware store and makes a little over min wage.  I've tried to talk to him about getting a second job before and it's 50/50 on if he's open to it or just tells me that he likes things the way they are.\n\nI'm so frustrated that he signed a lease in this dump for another whole year.   I have to keep most of my things at my mother's just because there's no space here.  I feel claustrophobic being there.  He accused me of being over dramatic about it and minimized my feelings.\n\nHe claims he is happy with the way things are, but we still have to penny pinch in between his paychecks.

      "description": "Throwaway account as subject follows my main account.\n\nA friend of mine and I have a weekend golf trip planned for August for the second year in a row.  Last year we had 8 guys total (and a great time) and this year based on interest from numerous other friends and acquaintances we increased the number of spots we planned for to 16.  We the two organizers plan far in advance and asked, just like last year, for interested parties to put a deposit of $150 which covers the three night cost of accommodation per person (we rent large condos in the area for the trip and split the total cost) and let everyone know that spots are on a first-come first-served basis.  The reason for the deposit is that with larger groups people can be flaky and the other organizer and I a) don't want to be out money if someone cancels last-minute and b) allow us to book the needed number of tee times.\n\nAnother really good friend of mine (call him Trevor) who was on the trip last year and said he would be in for this year's trip was included on the general email sent out.  The email detailed the trip itinerary and the request to e-transfer the deposit if you wanted a spot.  This was a month ago.  We had a rush of deposits initially up to 13 confirmed, then quiet for a week.  I sent Trevor a couple of reminders to send the deposit via email and text, which he said that yes he's in for the trip and would be sending the money that day (which he didn't).  About a week later we hung out and I asked Trevor  again in person if he could send the money in soon as there were other people considering spots and he said again that yes, he'd send the money that day (which again he did not).  Last week I sent him another email reminder, to which he replied \"thanks dear, haha\", without sending the deposit.\n\nBy this point I was annoyed because I don't enjoy tracking people down for money.  Two more people booked to bring us up to 15, and at this point the other organizer texted me and said another buddy of his was interested and asked if I wanted to let Trevor know.  I said nope and told the other organizer to let his other friend to send the deposit in, which he did which filled up the trip, which admittedly was somewhat passive-aggressive on my part.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday and Trevor texted me asking for the course list we were going to play on the trip, and I replied that the trip was full now and that if someone dropped out he could rotate in.  He send me a text \"thanks, you dick\", and then told me that I should've held a spot for him because I know he'd be good for the money (n fairness to Trevor he's never displayed any cheap behavior before or been bad for money).  I replied that I had sent him multiple reminders and that it wasn't my problem, to which replied \"whatever\", and we haven't spoken since.  AITA?\n\nTLDR:  Should I have held a spot on a trip for a good friend even after sending multiple reminders about money.",

      "description": "So my neighbor is having a yardsale and he inherited a bunch of antiques from his dead parents. I never really liked this guy as he catcalls my girlfriend and makes rude comments about my other neighbors and is constantly blasting loud music in the middle of the night keeping us up even after us repeatedly telling him to stop. We've frankly had enough with him. In his yardsale i see a couple of 1944 wheat pennies in almost mint condition in plastic protection containers and 2 1870 3 cent nickels also in fairly good condition. Total combined value is around 300-500 dollars but I'm not exactly sure as I'm not too familiar with these types of coins and it could possibly be worth in the thousands.  I will check it out at a coin star soon.He sold me these coins for 30 bucks and i heard him whispering to his friends how he just ripped off a dumbass. He also has a bunch of ration card booklets from WW2 which he sold to me for a few dollars. I have absolutely no idea how valuable these are but its sure as hell worth a lot more than a few dollars. He also sold me a 1940 M1 garand (rifle) that he inherited from his grandfather for only  200 USD and honestly it's probably worth at least 3000 according to listings I've seen online for it.. This whole time he and his friends are snickering and whispering about how much I'm getting ripped off. I just ignore it. All my buddies think this is hilarious and they love using my gun and are really envious about my coins. I get a week later from my neighbor basically telling me how i ripped him off and i need to pay him more money or return the items. I tell him to fuck off. His uncle is furious at him because of how badly he was ripped off and he wanted to get the M1 garand. His uncle nonstop calls me demanding i give him the M1 and i also tell him to fuck off. My neighbor tells me he'll get the attorney involved and i tell him to stop being immature and that he was a jackass for selling these at such a low price. I also remind him of the catcalling and the partying and i basically tell all his other family members about his comments and they start to turn on him. ",

I also contacted the HSE and the local council because of practices that went on in that store which aren’t acceptable and put the public at risk. \n\nFor me, this wasn’t enough. So, on our small town Facebook page I wrote a very well worded review of my experience there, effectively whistleblowing the mal practices in that store (selling out of date food, cross contamination of dairy and non-dairy and more things) and within an hour, half of the town had seen it and it was taken down due to it being reported, presumably by current employees of said coffee shop. \n\nI’ve since been threatened with legal action (thankfully I’m protected by the law) and I’ve had the manager moan to me that they’ve taken a massive financial hit as a result, and my urge to choose local cafes over said chain was heard by all; as every cafe in town was packed. Am I the asshole for publishing the mal practices in that store? I had made management aware of the issues and I was met “we don’t do that here” or “it’s easier for us” but I feel guilty for potentially ruining a stores future in our small town. ",

      "description": "**Hoo boy, this is a long one.**\n\nAround the end of September time, my girlfriend and I wanted a dog. My Dad told me that his friend was breeding Shar Pei puppies. \n\nWe went to the breeder, asked him how much he would want for one of the puppies. He said £800. I said £800 was a bit too much to give all at once with it being so close to Christmas time and he ensured me that I could pay £200 a month until I pay £800.\n\nAbout a month or so into it, my Dad says to me that I should be paying for KC registered papers for the dog. I had no idea about them. I thought they were for breeding the dog, where I had no interest. The breeder said to me that I'm going to receive the papers once he receives payment in full. \n\nI asked the breeder about microchipping and injections for the dog and he said to me that I am to pay for it and he will take it from the final bill. It ended up costing £50 and the breeder put the bill for the dog down to £750.\n\nThe dog ended up having a case of Shar Pei fever where his legs swelled and he had a high temperature. \nWe ended up paying £65 from my own pocket for him to get better with antibiotics. I told the breeder the next day about it and he told me that he's had no problems with the mother and I'm probably just overreacting.\n\nA week before Christmas, the dog had an eye infection. I understand his breed is prone to a lot of medical problems and I told the breeder about it and tried to get some information and help on what needed to be done. He told me that I'm being a hypochondriac and I should stop worrying. I got frustrated. We purchased pet insurance for the dog and we bought some eye drops. He's much better. \n\nI noticed in my January pay that I got underpaid from work by a lot. I thought it would be the right thing to do to tell the breeder that I will be short this month. \n\nI have to pay £250 more and the dog is paid off. I wanted to give him something rather than nothing. \n\n&gt;Hey mate. Would it be possible for me to pay you £50 this month then £200 next month? Things are really tight for me just after Christmas. I know it's a bit inconvenient but next month I will be able to give you £200. Thanks.\n\n\n\nHe said \n\n&gt; I was relying on that money, to be honest. £50 is no good to me. Can you sort something out?\n\n\n\nI explained that I can't ask family or friends for £150 after Christmas, no one has any money.\n\n&gt; So you're telling me that I have to wait until February to get paid? That's not my problem, to be honest. I have kids to feed.\n\nHe texts me back two minutes after that.\n\n&gt; Just try and sort something out. It is what it is, no worries.\n\n___________\n\nThe next day, my uncle facetimes me from another city and asks to see the dog and how his eyes are doing. I show him.\n\n&gt; Looks a lot better than they used to. Say, have you got papers for this dog?\n\nIt didn't cross my mind to be honest, I forgot all about it.\n\n&gt; No, I don't, really. The breeder said that he wants the money first then he can have the papers.\n\nMy Uncle laughed for 5 straight minutes.\n\n&gt; You're meant to get the papers from him FIRST. He's meant to give you them.\n\nI explained that I offered the breeder £50 but he doesn't want the money and that he wants £200.\n\n&gt; Don't give him another penny until you get those papers. I'm fucking serious. He's bullying you. Go see what your Dad thinks about it because he's a friend of his.\n\nI call my Dad and explain the same thing to him that I told my uncle.\n\n&gt; Yeah, don't give him a fucking penny. If he keeps bullying you, I will sort him out. You obviously don't have the money so I will pay it for you. I won't pay him until I get those papers though. They're really important. Text the breeder and tell him that you've passed the debt onto me. \n\n\nI text the breeder telling him not to talk to me anymore but to talk to my Dad, my £50 isn't good enough but my Dad is willing to pay the full £250 on receipt of the papers for the dog.\n\nThe breeder texts me back\n\n&gt; Are you fucking with me? There's fucking no need to get your Dad involved about the fucking dog. It's been me and you. You're a fucking grown man. You can deal with this yourself. There's no point in threatening me with your Dad because I'm not fucking scared of him. \n\nMy Dad calls him afterwards. After some back and forth, he said\n\n&gt; Keep the fucking £250 but you're not having the papers for the dog. Happy New Year.\n\nI thought okay, case closed. I keep the dog, the £250, no papers but no worries.\n___________\n\nNext day, I go to the shop for some milk and bread. Come back towards by front gate and I see the breeder walking towards me aggressively. I drop my shopping on the floor.\n\n&gt; Yo, I want my fucking money now! £200 I want or I'm taking the dog back! You're taking food from my kids mouths!\n\nI said that I told him last night that he can have the money if I have the papers for the dog from him.\n\n&gt; You're being a cunt! I want the fucking money as agreed and you will get the papers once I get the £250 off you! I'm taking the dog back otherwise and I'll give you £200 a month for it!\n\nI said that you're blowing this out of proportion and I said he can have the money, in full, if I have the papers from him. \n\nI want to keep the dog.\n\nHe starts walking away from me, I follow him\n\n&gt; You're such a cunt just like your old man! You've got a day to make up £200 or I'm fucking having the dog back from you!\n\nI asked him if we could talk like adults and if he could stop walking away while I'm trying to speak to him, I would appreciate it.\n\nI follow him all the way home, he lives like two streets away from me.\n\nHis girlfriend comes out of the house.\n\n&gt; Look, we just want the money for the dog and you will have the papers. We shouldn't have given you the dog in the first place because honestly, you're causing the most grief for us both. There's no need to get your Dad involved.\n\nI tried to explain to her that I didn't have the money and my Dad offered to pay for it but she kept on talking over me, she wouldn't let me speak.\n\nShe gave me a piece of paper, saying it's the fathers papers but when I go to read it, she snatches it back off of me.\n\n&gt; Just keep the dog, we're not getting £250 and you're not getting the papers so..\n\nShe slammed the door. \n\nTold my Dad what happened. He sent the breeder a text saying that if he comes up with the papers by Friday, he'll have his £250. No reply. \n\n**AM I THE ASSHOLE?**\n\n_______\n\n**TL;DR - Purchased dog from breeder in instalments. I want everything that comes with the dog. He's threatening me because I can't pay and when I get someone else to give the money, he doesn't want it and he doesn't give me what comes with the dog.**\n\n",

And then he opened it and spilt it everywhere. He got even more mad and stormed off banging shit. I cleaned up that horrific mess. Why I was doing so he came back and said next time I say beer mug it better be a fucking beer mug. And I told him to do it himself if he has such problems and he told me to fuck off and I told him he’s an asshole and since then he’s been ignoring me. It’s been a day and a half and he has not spoken a word. I asked him a couple of times but he just told me to go away. I literally don’t even know what to do anymore. I’ve just been here. I’d like to add that my period started this morning and I’ve been really patient but what on earth are you supposed to do when your husband literally ignores your existence?

She tends to not do much on her time off work. Now she does work a lot but her work isn't always physical. I sometimes bring it up and she tends to get mad and makes it seem like im the worst bf for even asking. My questions are, am I wrong for asking her to loose weight and changing her lifestyle? Am I wrong for feeling as if im not worth impressing? In the sense, that my friends gf worry about how they look for their partner and I don't get a partner that cares about her image or enough to even dress up etc to impress me.",

      "description": "This year all but one of my friends will have a date for Valentine’s Day. This friend always gets depressed around the holidays because he doesn’t have a girlfriend to spend them with. He texted us basically pleading with us to hangout with him and not let him spend Valentine’s Day alone. I’ve already made plans with my girlfriend and I feel it’s not fair to her for me to cancel. He wants to go to a singles mixer that’s being hosted on Valentine’s Day and talk to girls and due to his social anxiety he can’t do it without someone being there with him. Now me being seen at a singles mixer when I have a girlfriend is bad enough but even if we go with him he’s probably going to leave disappointed. His argument is that we can go out with our girlfriends whenever we want but he only has one day to attend the mixer. We told him we’re happy to hang out any time as long as we don’t have plans but he pointed out that we always have plans when he needs us most, during holidays. We saw him at school today and he began to tear up when he heard an announcement about the mixer. ",

Anyway, I have never been one to just ignore people who seem genuine and nice so I thought that I would go along with it and initiation conversation with the girl. We spoke quite a lot for the next few weeks, up until the start of december. When I noticed a change of tone from her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe started replying less, she seemed less chirpy, she was very cryptic about her past expereinces, and whilst i tried to help as much as I could, she would never get further than just telling me \"It doesn't matter, Its only me\" or \"I'm not worth your time.\" and while I kept on trying because the way I am is to put the welfare of others before myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have previously had mental health issues and have been working through depression to a point where I feel comfortable in myself after a 4 year battle, but every day now this girl is constantly trying to make me feel bad, and then apologising and saying shit like \"I'm sorry I can't be better\" or \"I'll try get better again.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not the sort of person to give up on anyone, however this has pushed me to my limit, I feel like the girl wants more than just a friendship (which she has admitted to me on multiple occasions) and this may be a ploy to get me to stay. I feel like im being made to feel bad for putting my own mental health and self worth first. I have told myself this year, that I need to stop letting people walk all over me, and take my own initiative and know when enough is enough. I know she may be in need of support, but I have directed her to where she can get the proper support. I just left because I dont want to go back, considering how far I've come. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks Guys \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: My first ever post to reddit so I apologise if I did something wrong! and apologies for any grammatical errors.",

      "description": "Let me start by saying I realize how ridiculous this is and I know I am going to catch a lot of flak about it. I feel trapped though.  \n\nI need a different car. My old one is falling apart. I likely need my father to cosign with me. I am okay with this because it gives me the chance to prove myself to both creditors and my parents. \n\nMy father is dead-set on a new car. I am uncomfortable with a new car for many reasons and my attempts to explain to him why have gone the opposite direction I intended. By opposite, I mean that this has slowly gone from helping with the down payment and cosigning on a cheap base model, to my father calling this morning and all but begging me to let them pay for a new Honda Insight. \n\nHe went and got preapproval and everything. He says all I have to do is pay the insurance. He says they WANT me to have a new car, over and over and over. He says they want me to be safe and that I wanted a hybrid. If I have this new car they wont have to worry about me commuting every day to and from work.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n**Some Context:**\n\nI am a 28 year old, only child of retired parents well into their 70s (yes, your math is right, lets not get into why I exist, it’s a whole thing…). My mother likely has dementia and is so stubborn she will probably die before being diagnosed with something. They don't go on vacation. They don't have hobbies. Their excitement is feeding the deer, turkeys birds etc. in their yard.\n\n\nA while back I spent a whole day making an excel sheet to help us talk about what the best decision is financially when factoring in things like used vs new, expected repair costs, and fuel mileage etc. I was proud of this and sure it would help us see eye to eye. It seems like this only had the effect of making it seem like money is tight for me. Its not. \n_____________________________________________________\n**I get the impression that my choices here are:**\n\n1.\tLet my parents basically buy me a brand new car (or half of one at least) so they can be happy. Have to look the salespeople in the eye and somehow not feel like a shmuck.\n\n2.\tMake my father disappointed and my mother confused (realistically, she has dementia, confused is her natural state now) when I say NO and tell them about how this whole thing is making me feel (guilty, overprivileged, terrified, pressured, etc.) \n",

      "description": "So my mom and I have a... complicated relationship. When I was a kid I was her favorite child and it was pretty obvious. We would watch Gilmore girls together, she loved to take me shopping with her, she called me her “mini-me”, and never failed to point out how we were exactly alike.\n\nAs I grew up, I became my own person and got into different things, which seemed to bum her out a bit, especially since she had emphasized our closeness for years. But things got worse when I came out as trans to her, and this is where our relationship really started to fall apart. She told me I was “becoming a new person” and was resistant to any steps towards my social or physical transition. She fluctuated from seeming angry/uncomfortable with it to totally ignoring it and pretending it wasn’t happening. I won’t get into it all, but there are some especially painful things she said/did that are seared into my memory. And this was during a time where I was actually starting to feel like myself for the very first time. Of course I know it could have been much worse, and I’m lucky I live in a time and place where I was comfortable enough to come out, but it still hurt a lot.\n\nThen in my senior year of high school she moved 5 hours away to live with my stepdad. They got married the year before and had been together for 8 years, and the reason she didn’t move in with him sooner was because I was still in high school and she didn’t want to make me move (although she did hold this fact against me at any opportunity.) Their relationship is... strained. It always has been, and I’ve noticed that for the most part she’s focused on appeasing him even if that ends up hurting my brother and me.\n\nAfter she left, my brother (20 at the time) and I (barely 18) were alone in the house we grew up in, taking care of ourselves and our pets (2 dogs, 3 cats). My brother and I both have anxiety and depression, and his is more severe than mine. We struggled to keep the place clean (a common problem with depression) and it only got worse when I moved into my dorm for college. This started causing problems between us and our mom because our stepdad still needed a place to stay when he was in town for work. And I’ll be honest- the place was gross. But instead of finding new solutions she doubled down on criticizing my brother who she saw as responsible for it, which only worsened his depression and anxiety.\n\nAs time went on my mom and I grew more and more distant. It became easier for me to just avoid contact with her rather than risk her being hurtful.\n\nThen this year she started seeing a therapist and decided she wanted to fix our relationship. I was pretty cautious and honestly didn’t think it would be worth it. Any time in the past I had brought up how she had hurt me, she would say “I didn’t do that” or “You’re making me the bad guy” instead of actually acknowledging the fact that she had hurt me. Which is how the start of our conversation went until I told her I wouldn’t talk to her at all until she agreed to listen to me. I was at a point where I was tired of being gaslit and blamed, and ready to give up any relationship with her to stop it.\n\nTo her credit, she did listen and I do think she’s trying harder to listen and respect my brother and me. She’s also working on getting my pronouns and name right, and seems to be more accepting of my transition.\n\nI genuinely want to forgive her. But I’m still angry that she put us in that situation and just left (leaving me with some serious commitment and abandonment issues), I’m angry that there’s been a pattern over the past 5 years of her putting her husband before her kids, and I’m angry that she doesn’t seem to understand how deep our damage is. I’m trying to let these things go and rebuild my relationship with her because I do think she’s trying to change, but it’s hard. I just don’t know how to get rid of this anger towards her.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: AITA for still being angry at my mother for several years of problems between us, even after she’s apologized?",

      "description": "I know, upon reading the title, the answer would be that yes, I'm the asshole, but let me explain.\n\nTLDR: A very close friend of mine, who has said they love me, and would want to date in the future, consistently ghosts me when she's back in town and makes little effort to communicate or hang out. I want to say \"If you actually loved me you'd make an effort\". At the same time I realize this'll come off as manipulative but I feel I need to make a point.\n\nAfter highschool, this girl and I (who I've been friends with and very close to since childhood) kissed and made up for a strained friendship over the past few years. Basically, I love her, and she loves me too, though both of us have had bad experiences with long distance relationships, so while we're going to college, we wouldn't be dating. (Three hours is a while to drive, especially for two people who's love language is based on physical touch.)\n\nTo me, this is a fine arrangement, it's not the issue here. I was willing to wait to date her. She said that while we were home on our respective breaks, we'd hang out a lot and have a good time when we can. \n\nThis winter break, we were talking a bit before she got back, and made plans to meet a bit after Christmas. Those didn't pan out, her father made last minute plans for the morning of. That's fine, her dad can be like that sometimes. What the problem was, was that I was reaching out and trying to make new plans, but I got no response back for a week or so. New years rolls around, and, while she had a party to go to, she said she'd stop by to see me for a bit.\n\nSimilar story. She messed up her time management and couldn't see me, and showed up late to the party she was going to. (It was a small gathering with a few mutual friends. I'm not exactly the closest with them so I understood not being invited. It's not a big deal.)\n\nLittle communication for 2 weeks, before I made plans with her to go see a show in a neighboring town. She said she could meet at 2, and we could hang around until 6, when we'd have to leave for the show. Well, she wakes up late, says she has a lot of work to do (which she did), and ends up showing up around 5. I give her her Christmas present, and we catch up a bit, before going to the show.\n\nI could tell something was off, she didn't seem like she wanted to be intimate or close. Which, is also okay, I'm going to respect her boundaries. Another friend was the stage manager for this show, and even though I'd seen her around 2 weeks before, she seemed so much more excited to see me. \n\nI'm upset, to say the least. I had sent her a few messages communicating this (I feel kinda unloved, we should communicate better, etc), but they haven't been talked about. I want to say that \"Hey, I'm feeling pretty unimportant in your eyes, and I feel if you actually loved me, you'd try to communicate, reach out, and make things work\", or something among those lines.\n\nAt the same time though that seems like a *horrendously manipulative* idea. I'm not a \"nice guy\", and I'd feel horrible for doing it. She's a fragile person, and isn't the best at communicating or following through in the first place, but I've been really patient for a long time and I don't like feeling burned over and over again.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I said that? What would be a better wording, because I *know* this is very problematic.",

      "description": "Firstly, I normally wouldn't have an issue with it but there are certain circumstances this time. Also worth noting, smoking is prohibited in and at my apartment complex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's finals week right now and I had my last final today that happened to be for the class I've been struggling in all quarter. All of my housemates knew about this final as well. This morning, I woke up to a really strong smell of weed. I knew it was the smell of weed because my body reacts very negatively towards it i.e. I get extremely nauseous and a pounding headache. This happened right before (half an hour) my final. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew which housemate it was coming from because the smell was coming from her room. Earlier this school year, she told me that her girlfriend smokes weed for health reasons, but said she would never do it in the apartment, only in her car or outside. She has done it 4-5 times inside now since January, and each time I just left for a while. This housemate, however, has known for a while how my body reacts to the smell. I slightly confronted her by asking if she knew why our apartment smelled of weed, and she immediately got defensive saying she doesn't smoke weed. I never insinuated that she did; merely just wanted to know if she knew who was smoking it or if anyone cooked something that resembles the smell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe nausea and headache affected my performance on the final today as I was unable to focus as much as I wanted to. I messaged the group chat of my housemates, excluding the suspected housemate because she doesn't want another housemate having her number, and stated that it smells of weed in our apartment and that I would really appreciate it if whoever it was smoking it would refrain from doing it inside our apartment as it makes me physically ill. No one acknowledged it so I emailed the resident manager, who deals with apartment issues. I didn't ask him to confront the housemates, I didn't even state who I thought was doing it. I just stated the situation, how it affects me, and asked if he knew how I should personally handle the situation (callback to the strict no-smoking policy). When I told my parents what I did, they freaked out and said I was being a complete asshole and that I should've just ignored it and let it go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

If it were a Friday or Saturday night, I wouldn’t mind but it’s every day of the week. I finally couldn’t take it anymore and told her my issue and asked her to not stay out later than 12-1 on weekdays and that if she needed to stay up late doing work or whatever it is she does, she could do it in the room.

      "description": "First time poster.... let me know if I mess something up. \n\nI'll try to make a long story as short as possible, but I've been told I can't tell a short story.\n\nSo my SO (42M)  and I (41F) were high school sweethearts that broke up, married other people, got divorced, and rekindled our relationship.  There was a 15 year gap, and we both have children with our prior spouses.  We reconnected over social media and our relationship was long distance for the first 2 years as we lived in different states.  Eventually, he moved to the town I lived in, but we didn't live together (his choice).  We were talking about marriage and having more kids together when he moved, but we were trying to \"do things in the right order\" and set an example for my children who were 5 and 7 at the time. \n\nAt some point we decided to get married, and we planned a small formal wedding.  This is where the trouble started for me.  SO starts dropping the ball on every wedding related task he offers to do.  Such as contacting an officiant.  His mother is very involved in her church, and she is able to perform ceremonies legally.  However, he didn't want to ask his mother so that she could enjoy the day.... but he couldn't seem to get ahold of anyone else that his mother knew.  This went on for months.  Eventually I googled officiants in our area and called around until I found someone... a week before the wedding.  This is one example of a pattern that started.  He would volunteer to do a wedding task, and then give lots of reasons why he couldn't do it until I took it over.\n\nThe last item on our list was to get the marriage license.  In my state it's a 3 day wait, and we applied a week in advance. He went to pick it up without me, so I don't know exactly what was said, but SO says he was told we couldn't get a license. The reason according to SO was that his ex wife had sealed the divorce papers and there would have to be a court hearing in his previous state to request a copy and prove the divorce was finalized.\n\nAt this point I've paid for the entire wedding and the whole family is coming.  I have been preparing my children for this day for months.  I didn't feel that calling it off was an option.  I also discovered on the day before the wedding that I am pregnant.  And since the whole point of a formal wedding is to set a good example for the kids, now I'm really stuck.  So, we have a sham wedding.  Everything looks official, but no legal documents signed.\n\nSO tells me he will fix this quickly, however it takes over a year to get his divorce paperwork.  In the meantime, I awkwardly explain to people why I kept my ex husband's last name.  He never does tell me when he finally gets the paperwork.  It just happened to be a topic I bring up in an arguement a month or so after he get them.  They are currently in his mother's safe deposit box.  \n\nIt's now been 6 years and we have 2 kids together.  He never brings it up, and the times that I mention it he says \"yeah.... I got to fix that one of these days\"....  Pretty much the same thing he says about the leaky bathroom faucet.\n\nSo.... I'm getting the message that he doesn't really care about being married, but I do.  And at first, he was the one who didn't want to move in until we were officially married.  WIBTA if I gave him a deadline?  Have I waited so long that its ridiculous to complain now?  ",

      "description": "So around 2 weeks ago my girlfriend of nearly 3 years broke up with me. When we broke up she told me that she wanted to be alone because were going off to college next year. I accepted the breakup and tried to be friends with her, sitting next to her in class and talking to her in only that class. \nAround a week ago I get a text from a good friend of mine, one that I probably hang out with once a month outside of class and is also friends with my other good friends. He texts me that he is, “talking to my ex and does not know where this would end up”. At first I was totally cool with this as I knew they were friends and I was actually kinda happy that he would tell me this. However, word came out that they were hanging out more and more and then they officially started dating a few days ago (2 weeks after I broke up with her). I just felt so hurt in all of this and couldn’t help but feel so angry at both of them. \nMy other friends and I talked about this and they agreed that it was a super shitty thing to do and that we no longer wanted to hang out with the one who is now dating my ex. \nSo just recently I texted my ex because I needed something back and I confronted her on what she did (I know this probably wasn’t the right thing to do but I wanted to hear her side). She admitted that the real reason that she broke up with me was that she no longer loved me, not that she liked anyone else or wanted to be alone for college. The only real apology was for not telling the “real” truth about why we broke up. When she talked about dating my friend she said that she no longer had to care about my feelings and that it was her life. \nAm I the asshole for being furious at both my friend and my ex? ",

      "description": "Background:\nI had to deploy recently for a month to a place that is a 15 hour difference in time from my home station. I am AD military Air force. The place they sent me was a big waste of time and all around stressful. To make a long story short, while i was deployed three times I had to tell my GF off due to her being selfish or saying things she shouldn't say. \n1. She blatantly try to say I chose to get deployed, when that was false\n2. She drove my car without telling me, when I told her to just turn it on(NOT drive it) 1-2times a week. \n3. She got mad, that I did not tell her about a movie I was forced to go to as a Unit morale event were i was deployed. So she posted on her SC a bunch of quotes(She has a history of posting relationship issues, on social media and she constantly says she is going to stop doing that because she knows it annoys me and I don't like it) \n\nSo now that I am back in the states and trying to recover from the 15hour flights and being back in my regular timezone, i have been trying to relax and be stress free. We were all good and having fun because we missed each other so much, but then she goes back into her ways. A few days ago we were having a normal conversation on SC, but she tells me she has to show me something. It ends up being a post by her friend who is in the military and was cheated on by her husband. Now this obviously has an affect on my GF who begins a 180 turn in the conversation and just starts being a \"man hater\" and just going in on me. So instead of arguing back with her, i try to calm her down and talk to her and ask what is wrong. After she calmed down she tried to blame it on work being stressful, but i could tell this was a lie because she would've told me that a long time ago in the week. So keep in mind she never apologizes for her outburst. Later in the week I end up doing an outburst on her for saying I was going on a date, when this was false. She told me I needed to apologize and that I was wrong for my outburst. So for me, I did not want to apologize because she still did not apologize herself and has been doing things to add to my stress. \n\nAm I the asshole for my outburst? ",

We all came to an understanding and I trusted him.\n\nMonths later,he was being increasingly lewd to my then-girlfriend and I think he drew something else of her. I talked to him about it and we again came to an understanding. Things were fine for a while afterwards. I trusted him again.\n\nA while later, he was moving forward with his feminine guy process. But, he told then-GF that if her and I don't work out, then he'd basically be a girl with a dick, knowing she likes that, and to consider trying him out. I'm essentially quoting him with that statement. This came unprompted. I was absolutely livid. He defended himself by saying that he didn't mean it, and it felt weird as soon as he said it. He tried to take it back.\n\nI laid into him for how shitty of a thing that was. We didn't come to an understanding. He couldn't remember the past two times after I brought them up because of his shitty memory. We resolved the situation eventually, sort of.\n\nIt's been years since that. Maybe two or three. We still talk nearly every day, and I fucking hate him most of the time. Other times, I feel conflicted. Sometimes, I feel fine around him. But, if I could choose, I wouldn't be his friend. But that would mean causing a huge rift in the friend group. I don't want to do that to them. Especially when I feel like I should have gotten over it by now.\n\nI am genuinely mean to him.  I know it's absolutely unfair and shitty to do. I can't help how I feel about him and I know I should control myself. But it's really damn difficult. I still haven't let it go. I've apologized to him multiple times for this.\n\nI can't stop making connections to \"being basically a girl with a dick\" to who he is. These connections make it terrible to hear his voice. It's difficult to hear him laugh. And I feel like an absolute monster because of it.\n\nI am afraid to talk to him again about this. Nothing he can say to me will change how I feel, as made evident by his attempt at apologizing after I tried to talk to him about this earlier.\n\nReddit, AITA? What the hell should I do?",
