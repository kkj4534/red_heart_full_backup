      "description": "Had a hard time coming up for a title here. Some background info, I'm 19, F, and in a relationship with someone who is 20, M. \n\nMy boyfriend is pretty old fashioned, conservative, and there is nothing wrong with that and it's part of what made me want to be with him in the first place. We've been dating for a little over a year and a half. I work and go to school so my schedule is pretty tight, I spend almost all of my free time with my boyfriend. I rarely go out and drink, and when I do it's usually with my family or my bestfriend. \n\nJust last night, my bestfriend and another girl were hanging out just the 3 of us, when someone they work with invited us over to his house. He is 17 and in high school, and he had a few girls and guys at his house all in high school. Probably 10 of us in total. So I figured sure why not. I didnt see this as a big thing, I literally went over in my pjs. I honestly would have rather stayed in and drank with my friend, but I didnt want to just ditch her. \n\nWe went over and I sat on the couch for most of the night and drank bud light with my friend. At some point my friend got everyone together on the couch and snapped a pic of us and put it on her snapchat story. This morning I woke up to a text from my boyfriend asking me what that was on her story. He said, \"what is that, where were you\". So I told him exactly what I just wrote here. And boy is he pissed off. He told my I would be crazy if I didnt think he was mad, now were in a HUGE argument and he is saying stuff like, \"If you dont like my values, you can leave\" \"I have really strong values when it comes to drinking and those values arent going to budge and if you dont like it, I don't see us lasting\" I am so upset! I have never ever ever done anything suspicious or unfaithful. \n\nJust about a month ago he got upset with me when he found out I was drinking with my mom and dad in the city on new years day. He has gotten upset when I'm with my bestfriend at her house having a few glasses of wine. Should I be sorry for this, or do we have vastly different values that I just dont understand? Someone please help me understand this. Also I wrote this in an upset fury because this fight is still happening, so this post is probably riddled with typos.\n\n",

      "description": "My wife and I are expecting, and my mother has been the happiest I have ever seen her, and she has been quite depressed for a while.  For my whole adult life she has been looking forward to being a grandmother the most.  My wife and I told her several weeks ago that we were expecting, and I have never seen her so excited.  Honestly, I am happy that she's happy.\n\nWe recently announced it to the world, and my mother asked if she could share on her facebook wall and I said yes.  She goes fucking nuts and posts dozens of status updates while responding to my family publicly and tagging me and my wife with messages like \"OMG ARE YOU EXCITED YOU ARE GOING TO BE AN UNCLE/NEW COUSIN/AUNT/GREAT AUNT/etc\", or \"OMG CAN YOU BELIEVE I AM GOING TO BE A NANA!?\"  While I find this more than a little excessive, it makes her happy so I've stayed out of it.\n\nYesterday she asks if she can post our ultrasound pictures, but we haven't made them public yet and I don't think we plan to.  I told her politely, \"I would rather you didn't, we haven't shared them yet and it's a little creepy. Also, I understand you are super excited about this, but please temper your posts on facebook.\"\n\nInitially I thought she took it well, but I get a frantic call from my brother that our mother is crying and that I should let her do what she wants because she has never been this happy.\n\nI honestly don't think I am being unreasonable here.  Maybe you guys can play devils advocate.",

      "description": "Alright I'm going to keep this post brief but still throw a TL;DR at the bottom for the lazier folks. \n\nI live on the second floor of a building with my girlfriend, roommate, and dog. My downstairs neighbors are front office workers for the apartments. They are also inconsiderate with their door slamming. Door slamming that causes my dog to shake uncontrollably out of fear and knocks my picture frames down. I've asked multiple times to keep it down with the door slams, and eventually reported them to the front office. Doesn't matter because like I said they work for the front office. \n\nSo at my wits end, I decided that every time they slam that door, I'm going to slam back. Now, I take my dog and hide her in the bathroom far away, remove a couple pictures off the wall, and slam my front door with the might of Thor. Extensive process but I don't know what else to do.\n\nAnd you know what? They haven't slammed the door in over a week. New record. Thankfully I move out soon. \n\nTL;DR AITA for slamming my own front door every time my downstairs neighbor does the same? I've asked them to stop dozens of times and reported them multiple times to the front desk. The slamming scares my dog and knocks over pictures. ",

      "description": "Throwaway because of reasons. A little backstory first, my ex (Rose) and I were together for 5 years, from the ages 18-23. She was my first everything and I was young and stupid. Rose is also the most toxic, self-absorbed and spiteful person I have ever met. I made so many sacrifices for her during our relationship like dropping out of college my sophomore year because she had threatened to leave me for someone who would spend more time with her. Now our break up was messy, she left me for my best friend/ our roommate and they kicked me out of the house we lived in. I ended up having to live out of my car for a few weeks because she had spread lies about to our group of friends saying I had been violent towards and no one would let me stay with them when I had no where to go. During this time of living out of my car she would call me almost every screaming at me to get my stuff out of the house. When I finally found a place to live, I went to the house to get my stuff they called the cops on me saying that I had broken in. which was a huge ordeal where I had to show them messages from her telling me to come over at any time to get my stuff and the lease that I was still on. After 6 months of being alienated and isolated from everyone I had been close to for the last 5 years I moved back in with my mom 3 states away and went back to school.\n\tI am 32 now and, in that time, I graduated college, met an amazing woman, got married and had a kid. I have had no contact Rose since I moved away. From what I’ve gathered through people I know she and the roommate she left me for got really into drugs and partying and broke up less than a year after they started seeing each other. The roommate was never able to quit the drugs and ended up overdosing a few years ago. A few of my old friends eventually apologized for the way they treated me after realizing what type of person Rose really was. She just uses people until they of are no use to her and then she moves on. Last year they even warned me when Rose’s new boyfriend got a job in the city I live in and they were going to move here. I didn’t really worry too much its a huge city and the chances of running into her were very low. \n\ta couple days ago a received a phone from Rose, I have no idea who would give my number to her. In the phone call she was hysterical saying her boyfriend was abusive and she was scared she had no one here and she knows that I hate her but I’m the only person she knows that lives here. I told her she need to call the police or woman’s shelter and to never contact me again, then I blocked the number she called me from. I had decided a long time ago that I would never let this person back into my life. I also haven’t told my wife about this because she is a such a kind and caring person that she would insist that help her and I don’t want Rose anywhere near my family. So am I the asshole for not helping my ex when she had an emergency?\n",

      "description": "Sorry for my poor grammar, English isn't my first language. \n\nThere's a girl I've known ever since we were both in my country's equivalent of 1st grade, let's call her A. While in elementary school, me and A were never BEST friends, but we were friends and we spent time together at school, and sometimes outside of school, but usually through other friends. When we moved up to secondary school, most friends went to a different school than the one me and A went to and we didn't see them as much or as often, so me and A ended up becoming closer friends than before.\n\n I made friends on my own at the secondary school but A was very shy and quiet and socially awkward (I think she has autism), so it was harder for her to make friends. She couldn't figure out how to start a friendship on her own, so other people always had to be the ones who started it by talking to her. After I had made my own friends, I introduced A to them, and I also helped defend her from bullies and assholes.\n\nMy friends liked A, so we stayed friendly throughout secondary school. but as we got older and grew up the things we liked and our personalities changed. She always liked to watch films and cartoons and read books, and she liked 'nerdy' things like Harry Potter and superheroes and animes a lot, and she liked to stay in rather than go out. My friends and me didn't really like things like that when we got older, as we preferred to have more active fun out and about at parties or on day trips, which A didn't like very much because of her shy personality and her self-consciousness. I was seeing less and less of A and now I barely see her once twice a month, and I actually talk to her even less. I asked my friends about the possibility of inviting her out on a trip, or spending time with her doing something she liked or at the very least reaching out to her, but they didn't want to, with a few of them even saying they didn't like her anymore. \n\nI brushed it off and forgot about it, but recently I did see her again at a restaurant, and she was alone and she looked really sad. I feel like a piece of shit for forgetting how shy she was and how she couldn't make friends on her own, and then I, the one who helped her to make new friends in the first place, took off with the rest of her friends and left her to be lonely. I brought it up to my friends, saying that I wanted to invite her to something we were planning or spend time with her, but they all said that they didn't like her or they didn't want to, and that it was A's own fault that we didn't spend any time together anymore. Am I an asshole for leaving her to be alone? I definitely feel like reaching out for her but would my friends be upset or angry that I was choosing her over them? Am I over thinking all of this? I just feel really shitty for abandoning her like I did.\n\nTL;DR I, along with all of my other friends, stopped talking to my shy, introverted friend and now I'm worried she's sad and lonely. Am I an asshole?",

I have told the teachers and they don't do anything. I have ignored it and he doesn't leave me alone. I even tried telling the principle and he didn't do anything either.

      "description": "It all started last year. We started off as a group of friends that were there for each other, that had each others backs - and were just all in all very supportive.  \n\n\nA few months in and most of them went off to join respective organizations inside the university. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, though - but it sure could have a major influence on how they 'socialize' with people, so to speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, since then, I've noticed that a few of you changed your attitudes - nothing major, I think. But it's just that most of you have been more abrasive in conversations, picking on others inabilities to do certain things. You're more harsh with words, throwing insults around like they mean nothing, not picking up on the possibility that said insult might hurt the person being insulted, even if the insult was said in a jesting manner.  \n\n\nSo, I'm starting to pull away, from all of you, slowly - just until I get my head on straight. I've set our group conversations to ignore, muting some of you on social media. I've started to spend time with other people, too - the people who aren't currently part of our friend group. They're less toxic and way less exhausting to be around these days.  \n\n\nI'm sorry to all of you, I really am.

      "description": "Happened a few hours ago. I don't think I will be talking to him for the next few months at least.\nAlso he was kind of my best friend, not the best friend but a good friend.\n\nToday I wasn't feeling well and had a headache since the morning, I woke up and started playing games in the hope that they will distract me from the pain.\n\nAt that time I didn't know what was about to come.\n\nSo I play a few games with this guy, and he says he won't be playing for the rest of the day. I just shrug and carry on with my day.\n\nThat evening, I had a fight with my sister who I love to death.\n\nThe headache was also not gone but it stopped being so effective after a while.\n\nThe headache basically reappeared at the time I has the fight with my sis. \n\nSo yeah already a shitty day and it gets worse.\n\nAt night I messaged my friend if he wanted to play a challenge which we were hyped for.\n\nHe refused but instead of just saying no, he continues to say that he wasn't as free as I was and I had no work to do.\n\nOkay, good but next he says that it's why I have no friends and I'm a piece of worthless shit.\n\nThis leaves me in a pretty terrible mood so I block him.\n\nAfter a few minutes of that, I had an anxiety attack, with my breathing rate increasing and me freaking out very badly to the point that I was legit shaking on the floor crying because of all the shitty things that had happened today.\n\nI have in the past tried to tell me 'friend' about this anxiety thing I have and he either doesn't believe it or laughs it off. It never really bothered me so I laughed with him, dying inside since not even a person I knew well believed me.\n\nSo there you have it, I have ghosted him on every thing that we communicate on and he can't talk with me in school either.\n\nHe basically gave me a middle finger when i needed a hand and I know he follows me on Reddit and may read this comment.\n\nIf you do, then from the bottom of my heart, \n\nFuck you and I never want to see your face again. \n\nSo Reddit, Am I The Asshole?

      "description": " \n\nAs part of a scheme I'm working on to try and not want to blow my brains out, I keep my interactions with my mother to a bare minimum. After realizing that a lot of fucked up stuff that happened during my childhood and early twenties was inexcusable, borderline sociopathic behavior and realizing that she relentlessly attacks her children's self esteem so that they will never grow out of their fucked up co-dependent relationship with her, I actively pursued the juuust right amount of Mom in my life: as little as possible without causing a whole thing with my siblings. She gets a call on Thanksgiving and Christmas and a card on Mother's Day and her Birthday. End of list.\n\nIt was a good system while it lasted, but that all went up in smoke when my husband and I had to take in my nine year old nephew. It's a long story and the why isn't super relevant to the AITA question. My husband and I are indefinitely raising my nephew. He's a really great kid and we both consider it a privilege to get to be there for him. Obviously, this means I can't continue to freeze out my mom without keeping her from her grandson which isn't something I'm willing to do. My nephew is really fond of his grandma and she's never demonstrated the kind of psychologically abusive behavior I remember from my childhood towards him (although I keep my head on a swivel for it). She's now regularly around my house to visit my nephew. I'm polite to her but keep it very all-business. Any personal questions are met with vague, noncommittal answers and I always steer the conversation back to logistics around visiting/babysitting/going out with my nephew. I'm committed to not letting her use my nephew as a shoe in the door to my life.\n\nMy husband, on the other hand, doesn't seem to share my commitment. His parents are very religious and more or less disowned him when he came out of the closet and we've always been supportive of each other's family baggage, but that seems to have all went out the window when he met her and she was suddenly around the house a lot. They will call each other 'just to catch up', go out to lunch, see a play, ect. I've made it very clear that I do not like this, but he always laughs it off like I'm fucking Lorelei Gilmore and not liking my mother is some fun \"quirk\" of mine that can just be waved off. I lost it when I found out he was telling her stories about me in college, dating, and just generally gossiping about my life in ways he knows I actively try to keep her in the dark about.  We had a tiff where I said I felt disrespected by him having such an informal relationship with my abuser and he said I was being controlling and if she's going to be in our house all the time, he should be free to do what he wants to make their relationship work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

Because of that I feel like me getting married and having kids would be a disservice on a future spouse and kids and I would much rather do my work then spend time with a wife and kids. They also want the future spouse to be someone they find from back home which I don't agree with(arranged marriage from Pakistan).

      "description": "First time posting here but genuinely curious if I'm the asshole.\n\nMy grandmother sadly passed away in December. She was the best grandmother of 13 grandchildren and I lived with her for most of my life before moving to the United States. I visited my home country once a year or so and it was really sad seeing her become more and more fragile. Unfortunately, she passed away before I could visit one more time to say goodbye but oh well. \n\nIn mid-December we heard the news and my immediate family instantly bought tickets to fly there the following day. I had final exams and projects and work but I just had to go and be there for my family, which I never ever see since we moved away. I thought, my grandmother was the reason I even have a family so not going to her funeral was never an option.\n\nWe get there and I see an aunt and uncle who live in the same country but a 2-hour flight from where the funeral was. I asked where my cousins were and they said they couldn't come because reasons. Work, whatever. They say this to the person who flew in from a different country to be there.\n\nThe thing is, my cousins (4 of them) had been slowly drifting apart from the rest of us. There was no reason for this, just time and distance. But I thought, this is the funeral of their grandmother and not one of them bothered to show up! I was speechless. Over the next few days, some other cousins and I talked about this and they agreed. None of the 4 who didn't show up even sent a text of support or condolences. Absolutely nothing. I was livid. But when I talked to my mom and sister they didn't feel the same way. They said \"what if it's the money or time or they maybe have other reasons\". Nope. They're a wealthy family and they could've been there for a day. There were no other reasons other that they didn't feel like saying goodbye to our grandma or being there for the rest of us.\n\nAnyway, one of the cousins is getting married this month. I've known about this for several months (not actually from my cousin-I was never formally invited by the bride and groom). The invitations were open \"to everyone in the family\" which didn't compel me to visit another country to the wedding of who is basically a stranger. I was already on the fence about going but after the lack of cousins at my grandmother's funeral, I never even want to see them again.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for being petty and resentful? My mom and sister insist that I should go because they're still family. Well, the one chance they had to prove they were still part of the family, they didn't show up so I don't want to be bothered to celebrate a wedding to which I wasn't even personally invited. They also say I don't know the reasons why they didn't show up to the funeral and that I can't hold a grudge forever but I missed school, work, final exams, and almost had to take an incomplete for my classes but I thought there are important things in life that are worth missing a day or two of work for.

      "description": "I've been friends with this girl for about 7 years. She and I are close but the biggest difference between us is she is a social butterfly, knows everyone in town, and loves to go out. I enjoy socializing but I love my down time and I love coming home every night. I've been in a healthy relationship for the past 2 years and we are becoming more serious. \n\nThis friend and I now come to this point of extreme opposites, when she tells me she cheated on her husband on a work trip. She felt guilty about it but also very excited to talk about this new flame. She tells me about her ongoing marriage problems and how he suppresses her, hates going out or spending money, doesn't want to be social, gets mad at her for going out all the time. I lent an ear and tried to be there for her. I messaged her over the weeks checking on her. \n\nPrior to the separation and during, she was partying heavily. Out every night til 3. Drinking with new people I had never met before. A month later she and husband are separating and he's moving out. She's upset about a few details but definitely wants to chat up her new flame(s) and what she's been up to. The relationship quickly becomes one sided. Every time I see her, we ONLY talk about her. Her drama. Her ex. Her current fuck. Time passed and the conversation was ONLY about her. It pissed me off but also hurt me badly. I wasnt available to go out with her much anymore. The drama was too much. I have anxiety and depression and this only made me spiral. Some of the friend group were already peacing out on the friendship after she told them \"Go choke on a bag of dicks and drown in a puddle of cum.\" She legit raged at them and others if anyone questioned her marriage. \n\nI decided to talk with her on her drinking &amp; hard partying. We had a long discussion and I genuinely thought things were going to get better. This past weekend, she ditches me &amp; another friend for an event we had to pay to get in to. \n\nI'm to the point that I want to go off on this girl. When I've talked about this with others close to me, they say I shouldn't judge her and need to consider what she's going through. It's been hard because I can understand WHY shes doing what she's doing, but I can't participate or relate to it because I feel we are at different stages in our lives. She wants to party, hook up, (she now claims polyamorous) and has the attitude that no one can tell her what to do. And I'm very much enjoying building my career, setting with my boyfriend, and playing games at home. Is this me judging her? Is this me not supporting her in her alcoholism? Am I the asshole?",

There’s just a couple things that are...off. He never leaves his house other than to go to school, run basic errands and hang out with me. He spends HOURS on his computer. Ik this is typical teenage behavior but it’s getting to a point where i don’t know whether or not i should be concerned. \n\nHe has an attachment to the people he meets online. Not just internet friends but grown adults who are in their 30s-40s. He calls them his “internet moms” and goes on about how he wants to get a job and move to those (alleged) women’s state to support them. Other than that he doesn’t really associate with people irl, rather decides to interact with strangers online. I recently found out he used to be in those weird furry RP discord chat rooms and did all this weird stuff there. \n\nHe has a bit of a superiority complex over everyone irl because he was homeschooled with a “higher level curriculum”. This is his first time in high school and he’s sort of douchey towards others. Idk if I should say something or just leave it. Is it an asshole move to think something like this towards my SO?? ",

      "description": "I bought my friend a plane ticket on miles a while back because we were taking a trip together. A family discovery came up that made him want to push his trip until after I go on the 30th of this month - we discussed it and it seemed like the best plan. I felt a little used by this, but he was going to be spending time there after I left, and he didn't ask for this to happen. Annoying, but fine. (That full story is in another post on my profile if you really care to read it).\n\nThen his grandfather died. I got radio silence for a day and then he came back and has been pretty sparse with communication. I keep calling him because if he doesn’t want to come on this trip we need to cancel the flight or move it asap. If we’re going to move it, I need dates to move his flight to because I'm not trying to pay the fees twice, and he can't afford to. He gave me a range of dates that he'd been looking at, but I asked if he’d be willing to come to a big event with me a few days after (and push the flight a few days) and then, radio silence. I fly out tomorrow and need to move this flight. WIBTA if I just canceled his ticket and took the miles back? ",

I asked her to send me a picture and one side of box is literally wide open (not sure how she missed that). She sent a photo of the contents and lo and behold something is actually missing.

      "description": "My wife has a horrible habit of talking during shows. Most of the time she comes in halfway through whatever it is and immediately starts asking to be debriefed on the entire half she missed, then asks follow-up questions about details you have to piece together through watching. Other times we'll watch things together, and every 30 seconds she'll go into what I like to call review mode, where she explains at length her opinions on what happened in those past 30 seconds and talks over the program which makes it absolutely impossible for me to follow. \n\nI've brought this up gently multiple times including offering to pause and catch her up on things or discuss it during commercials, telling her I'd love to talk about it more in depth after the program ends and she says sure but immediately starts talking again. Over the course of our marriage it's started to wear on my nerves to the point where when I sleep I dream of mini versions of her circling my head saying \"so what's happening now?\" over and over. I find myself getting a bit shorter with her and saying \"shh\" or \"let's listen to the show\" more often. \n\nThe other day we were watching Interstellar. It's a movie where the experience is really important. We came to an important part in the film, the mood was great and I was totally immersed and at outdoor volume she started talking over the movie about what was going on and how she'd feel if she were the characters. Went on uninterrupted for a good minute which completely ruined an important scene.\n\nI was so frustrated I just paused the movie. She asked what I was doing and I told her I don't find it enjoyable to watch things together anymore. She got upset and asked why and I told her that I've been asking her for years to stop talking during programs yet she keeps doing it, and it ruins the experience for me. She said that talking was how she enjoyed the movies, and that she liked being able to talk to me during the shows to spend time together and that asking questions was part of the experience for her. I countered that it felt like she didn't care about my experience at all, and that there were other ways to talk about the programs that didn't interrupt them and even quick comments would be better.\n\nShe's been really down since last night and I caught her watching one of our shows alone and crying. I sat with her and she said she just felt really bad that she ruined my experience. We're looking at compromises now but I feel like a fucking asshole. I never meant to upset her or make her feel guilty, I just wanted her to see my frustration. If I was an asshole here I want to know so I can re-evaluate how I express myself going forward.",

I don’t keen in contact with anyone anymore. Reason being, my good friends Mum also died of cancer about 4 months later and almost everyone was there to support her.

Nobody would believe that he raped me but he did and we both know it.\n\nHe still goes to family functions and i see him way more than i should. This is not the point of the post though.\n\nBecause of my rape I cannot allow people to get close to me or touch me. It is very difficult to have relationships because of this.\n\nWhenever im on a couch or at a packed table and someone sits near me, i get quiet and angry and walk away. This is very noticeable and off putting to people. However, if I am blocked in and dont feel i can leave i react aggressively.\n\nAt new years, my grandmother came and sat next to me on the couch and placed her hand on my thigh. I was even more on edge because my rapist cousin was there. \n\nI removed her hand and got up, but as I did she asked me where I was going. I was stopped by my uncle who said im being disrespectful to my grandma. His son is the one who raped me.

      "description": "It’s my Grandpas birthday today, and my Grandma’s hosting a dinner for my family to attend. We’re a small family, one of each except for a sister (Grandma (moms side), Grandpa (moms side), Father, Brother, Me). Let me give you some background really quick: I think it’s safe to say that every single dinner I’ve ever attended (around 100) has consisted of fighting or concluded in some kind of fight. I don’t want to go because I don’t want to be around it. I’m currently a pre-med student taking an extremely heavy course-load while working so excelling is a priority. Lately, my anxiety and depression have gotten worse but I’m trying to stay level headed so I can do well in my classes. Going to these dinners ruins my week every time I go. They activate these really deep depression episodes that last about a week. They completely disrupt the flow of my studies and me trying to achieve a mental health status worthy of being deemed “healthy”. My family puts a pressure on me of “keeping the family together” and tells me I’m an asshole if I don’t go but my brother is absent all the time while also leaving me to take care of my father since my mom moved out a couple years ago. My father suffers from Parkinson’s (tremor), Glaucoma, Chronic Pain, and Dementia. He’s an old guy (71), he had me when he was 50 (I’m 21), and I’m okay with that. My mom on the other hand, can’t stand the man or the disabilities we all cope with. As a result, it’s constant fighting, yelling, &amp; hurrduur shit. I can’t be around it anymore, I feel like I’m going crazy, as if I stuck in a hole that just gets deeper and deeper. Obviously I love my father, and will take care of him until the day he’s no longer with us. I just thought I’d be taking care of my pops at 30-40, not 21. \n\nReddit please tell me if I’m the fucking asshole. \n\nTLDR: Family dinners are a constant shit-show and send me into depressive episodes every time I attend one. I can’t keep being around it for the sake of my mental health. ",

My boss and I have been going since before I started working for him and everyone generally gets on very well.\n\nI have a tendency to get frustrated at football as sometimes I don't play as well as I would like, nothing drastic, I might punch my leg or curse but nothing loud or at anyone.\n\nToday I was having a poor day and while I wasn't playing great I was trying my best, but I had missed a couple of shots and was obviously a tad annoyed.\n\nWhile I was other players had the ball my boss came up behind me and said 'come on!', in what I deemed to be an unnecessary comment. Looking back it was not a provocative tone, but not kind either.\n\nEither way, I let out a 'fuck off' under my breath at him. Loud enough that he could hear it, but not loud enough for anyone else to hear.\n\nHe naturally did not take it great and returned the favour, replying 'no you fuck off', and at the end of the game he expressed that he did not appreciate me telling him to fuck off when he was 'just trying to help'.\n\nSo guys, AITA?",

      "description": "So the other day I went to a Korean BBQ place that is super popular where I live. There a little expensive but honestly really good. There always busy so the crew is in a rush to push people through as fast as possible. Well, when I went I ordered my usual. When I got to the cashier I asked for  medium drink with it. I payed and was handed my food. I asked for my drink and he told me that I didn't order one even though it did. He misheard me and added something else to my order that I did not want. When I corrected him he did not apologize and only told me that they gave me what I had payed for and if I wanted a drink I would have to pay for it. I told him that I didn't want what was added and did not ask for it but he did not budge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a little mad but I payed for a drink and left. The place uses square so I left negative feedback on both purchases and said I was charged for something I didn't want and was not offered and compensation. Well, today the owner reached out to me. He refunded my drink and the added thing to my order and apologized. He said he talked to the cashier and that \"the problem had been dealt with\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do kind of feel bad that I raised a fuss over only like 5 dollars but still, I did not order what was given to me and feel like this is fair in a way.

      "description": "A month ago, I was sitting down with my gf, and her best friend. My girlfriend and her friend were watching some Korean Drama, which was unexpectedly very amusing. My gf and her friend were reminiscing about old K-pop groups, and I just kinda noped out of the conversation, since I had no background knowledge about this subject. They eventually go on youtube and look up so old and new K-pop bands. While I was cleaning up after dinner. at a certain point friend ask me which K-pop group I like the best of all of them, I wasn't paying attention, so I slip out \"I don't really know, I really can't tell the difference between them, which is odd for me, because some of the K-pop group look way too much like clones of each other.\" I might have royal fucked up there, because my gf's best friend is Chinese. She did not take it well, and told me that I was being racist. I understood her point of view, if you took my sentence without context. I apologized for my sentence, and told her that there were no racial innuendos within my sentence.  but in all honesty, I've been telling my gf for years that a lot of K-pop artist confuse me, because most often the only way I can discern them is by name, or hair. But I'm really bad at remembering the band names, and music style. There is something about their facial structure, that makes me almost believe that K-pop artist either had the same surgeon, or there might actually be something very wrong with my eyes. I felt bad for my behavior so I reached out to her, to amend for the damage that I did. We've talked about it, I apologized for my not so thoughtful behavior, and she forgave me, but it's been a few weeks now, and she acts very awkward around me, and tries to avoid my presence as much as possible. I asked her once if everything was alright, and if there something we needed to discuss, she replied with \"no everything is fine.\" But things don't seem that fine to me.  \nAITA for making a slip up like this? and if so should I just give her space for now, or should I have another talk with her?

      "description": "This has been something I constantly ask myself and I’m sure other people have felt the same so hopefully this can be relatable to some people. \n\nI’ll start with how I know I’m a generous person because I love my friends and family and am always looking for ways to help the people in my life. I constantly want to give to everyone so they can be happy and also I just love gift giving. I don’t really have to buy friendships, so it doesn’t feel like that. It’s more of like when I want to buy drinks for a friend or give a person I care about a small gift or just simple little things. Sometimes though, I tend to draw myself back because I feel like people notice this and want to take advantage of it.\n\nOne time in particular, a friend had came in from out of town and gotten his car towed. He expressed how he’d be in so much debt and wouldn’t be able to get it out so I offered to help find other solutions. The easiest and quickest solution was to bail his car out then and there, so I told him not to worry about it right away and just pay me back when he can. It’s been almost 8 months and I don’t think I’m gonna see that $300 ever again.\n\nAnother is more recently and slightly different, I’ve let a friend stay at my house for about a half week since they’ve been in a difficult situation. They also don’t have a car so I had to drive them to work for a few days as well. I didn’t mind this and they said they’d pay me back in any way they can (buying me drinks or giving me cigs) which was totally okay with me. But when I asked for those things (for instance, just asking if they could buy me a drink when I see them out) they acted like I would owe THEM for it now.\n\nSo in conclusion, should I feel bad for asking for my money back? Should I feel like a dick because, even though I give a lot, people never want to return it? \n\nI know the simple answer here is stop being nice to people that don’t deserve it. But sometimes it’s more difficult than that. I just want to not feel like I owe people things after all that I’ve given them.\n\nI hope some people can relate to this in some way, and thanks in advance to anyone reading ",

She were raised in Africa and African culture is still a huge part of her morals and way of life. Where she lived the children were expected to take care of their parents both financially and physically when they got a job, so my mother wants me to do the same for her.\n\nHowever not so long ago she told me that she's planning on moving back to Africa with my two younger sisters when I become financially independent. she also told me that I will have to pay for their expenses as well as my sisters's educations on a private international school in the country she is moving back to. \n\nI understand that taking care of your parents is a huge part of the culture where she comes from, but there is a difference between letting your mother live with you when she gets old and paying for both of your sisters's private school education and paying for your family's food and expenses. \n\nSo my question is: am I the asshole for not wanting to pay for my family's expenses when they willingly move back to Africa?",

I love them both to death, but almost every time I hang out with them, they argue and one of them, usually B, ends up storming off and not speaking to me or the other friend. \n\nB acts the same way I did last year (angry all the time, lashes out, isolates himself) and refuses to get help because every source he’s gone to hasn’t helped him at all. \n\nFast forward to today. A and B had another major argument and B was taking it out pretty hard on A. Both of them were in the wrong, but B said some really mean stuff, so I took A’s side. B ended up storming off.\n\nI met up with B and told him he needed to get his act together and apologize to A. He texted me in class (last period of the day) telling me he tried to talk to A, but she didn’t want to speak, because she was doing work.\n\nI went to their class and asked them to come to the hall. I tried to get them to talk it out and resolve the issue. B believes that their issues get solved within the day, but they don’t, as admitted by A. Usually it ends with A giving in and not bothering to defend herself.\n\nB told me he doesn’t need a mediator and he can solve his issues on his own. This is evidently not true, considering this has been going on since I’ve known him and it’s evident A and B are both hurt by this. B then told me that I act like I’m better than everyone else and that I believe I have a moral high ground. I don’t believe I’m better than anyone (far from it) but I understood where he was coming from, which I said to him. \n\nThe conversation was a bunch of arguing ending with B and I both in tears. I was frustrated and upset and I ended up texting him “fuck you” and then blocking his number. I regret it deeply.\n\nCurrently, I’m on the bus on my way home and I feel torn. I sent B a message telling him I’m sorry for how I reacted. Internally I feel conflicted because I just want my friends to stop fighting, but I feel horrible because my attempts to help only caused more conflict, according to B (and I agree). \n\n(TL;DR two of my friends fight a lot, I interfered, ended up causing more trouble, everythings gone to shit.)\n\nAITA?

I am also 17 years old and no one close to my age is coming , and even if there was I still wouldn't wanna stay to socialize. I'm with 2 nieces, 1 nephew, 2 much older brothers and their wives, sister , aunt , and grandma. I don't fit in neither of these groups and I'm just in the living room with the kids, while I browse Reddit . They seem to be enjoying themselves in the dining room , and the kids are fine , so I think I should be fine to go to the gym, but when I proposed this idea with one of my Bros and mom, they both said it was disrespectful . AITA? Oh and the family party was to celebrate both my Bros', and sister's birthday . I also see most of the ppl here on almost a weekly basis . ",

      "description": "To begin, he doesn't actually ask my permission to have guests over or even warn me or the other tenant. I signed the lease with him and my best friend of 6 years (31M) 1/1/2019. Since then we have lived 5 full weeks with his girlfriend and his male friend who do not pay rent (aren't on the lease) or help around the house. Me and the other tenant want to talk to him but don't know how to approach it since his guests are still around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little context, we are not perfect roommates either. He has complained to me about dishes not being done. Totally understandable! No problem! and we have immediately cleaned them if he is cooking and often times its just a dish or two my friend or I have overlooked but still should not be an on going thing. During this cleaning session he passive aggressively told us that if he complains to management about us 3 times we will be kicked out even though we pay $2,600 a month and he pays $1,200. My fear is bringing up this issue to him and having our living space become uncomfortable. So far we have not used the kitchen in 6 weeks out of fear of his complaints.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlong with this he throws parties. Loud weekday parties. I work at 7 am and have to wake up at 5 am every day on the weekdays. I get the sense that he is lonely. I want him to feel free to do as he pleases but I am quiet and have to go to bed at 7-8 pm (i have a hard time sleeping a full 8 hours). I told him this before signing the lease with him and he told us this wasn't an issue because he worked \"nights\". This turned out to be untrue. Since then he has taken vacation from work for some reason, gotten hair plugs and stays home all day complaining to us about how loud we shut our doors because his ears are sensitive to sound due to the hair plug procedure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do NOT want to get a lawyer or do something crazy or hostile until I can figure out how to approach this. I just want to have a discussion about it with him. In fact, if I haven't already expressed it the other tenant isn't okay with it either and has had multiple discussions with me about his girlfriend blocking the driveway, basically living with us with out paying any rent and finding random strangers just walking about. I'd like to note that he makes close to 100k which is much more than what I or my friend/other tenant make separately. We pay rent each month on time and have no issue paying but the reason I mention this is because we know he doesn't need financial support from his friends/gf to split his portion of the rent. He just likes having guests over. My theory is its a cultural thing, he is Indian and moved to America about 8 years ago. idk? \n\nWhat should I do? AITA\n\nShould I be okay with this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I want to be an artist/animator (I’ve been drawing for about 2 years now, so I’m still an amateur) and to get better, I usually post on social media for feedback. One of my favorite sites to use is Amino, since there are a lot of artists who are around my age (I’m high school/college age) and who are around my skill set, so I feel more comfortable there. \n\nWhile browsing posts on there, I saw a post/comment saying something about them being down, so I replied asking if they wanted to talk. They immediately PMed me, and I consoled them the best I could. After we talked a bit and got to know each other (they mentioned that they had depression and anxiety), they asked me if I could draw them a new profile pic.\n\nThis should have been the first red flag, but since it was a small drawing and they asked so nicely and I wanted to cheer them up, I agreed, and finished it in a few hours. I sent it the next day, and they seemed really happy with it. However, directly afterwards they asked for two more art pieces. These were much larger scale drawings, and they wanted them to be in a style I wasn’t very comfortable drawing in. Additionally, they wanted the drawings done by the following week so that they could impress their friends.\n\nI agreed, even though I wasn’t sure if I would be able to do these in time, because I didn’t want to upset them.\n\nFor the next few days, they would constantly pester me about the drawing. Due to schoolwork and other life-related stuff, I couldn’t get a lot done, and soon it became clear that I wouldn’t finish it in time. In hindsight, I should have told them sooner that I couldn’t finish it, but I felt horrible and kept putting it off, telling myself I’ll get it done somehow.\n\nEventually, it was two days before they wanted it, and I STILL haven’t started it. I had had an extremely stressful day, and when they once again started to ask me about it, I snapped and said I wouldn’t be able to finish it, and that I was sorry but that they should probably find someone else. They seemed really upset, and started freaking out. They talk about how depressed they were and how they just wanted something to impress their friends and was that too much to ask? I told them that I wasn’t a therapist and that maybe they should talk to someone, since there was only so much I could do and that I couldn’t help them from where they were. They were sounding increasingly aggressive and said that they had started crying, and by that point I was becoming extremely distressed and (I’ll admit that this was an asshole more) I left the conversation and blocked them.\n\nAbout a day later (it may have been a few hours, but I don’t remember exactly how long) I regretted what I did and tried to unblock them and apologize, but I couldn’t find them again and I think maybe they blocked me back, but I don’t know for sure.\n\nI definitely feel like one, but really AITA?",

We had an event happen with another friend in high school, we’ll call that friend H.\nH was doing the long investment work with a girl, a girl that mostly “friend-zoned” H. H was absolutely all over this girl, and determined to win her over! It was well known to all of our friends. Well sometime after that H had plans with this girl and she totally bailed on him, to find out that she made plans with S. Few days after that we find out the two are now an item. In a sense S knowingly started romantic interests even though they knew H was interested. \nWell S did this not once, but TWICE to our friend H. 2 different girls, where H believed he had a shot and S swooped in and “Mister Steal Yo Girl’ed” him. The first time H accepted his apology and they made up after a snarky text, the second time H was mad at him for about 2 weeks and they got over it. \nFast forward, outside of high school in college. S and I work for the same company but different locations. S is having a bday celebration at Buffalo Wild Wings. S’s long term work crush is going to be there, a girl who has placed S in the oh-so fabled “friend-zone”. You might see where this goes...\nHis crush and I hit it off, meetup a couple days later. We hookup, have a great time, and promise each other we won’t tell S. Well, I happened to have told that information to a mutual friend, which in hindsight I regret. That mutual friend of ours informs S. S completely cuts the girl out of his life saying “I’m only going to be professional at work and that’s it to her” after being friends for months. To me the last thing he said was “Fuck off you’re the last person I want to talk to” my response being “I’m ready to talk whenever you are.”\n\nSo am I the asshole for what I did? Do I owe my friend an apology or need to make it up to him?\n\nTL;DR\nFriend steals another friends crush 2x. Without the victim doing much in retaliation. I do it to that person and they completely cut me out of their life. ",

      "description": "The question here isn’t really whether I’m an asshole or not, but whether I’m “the worst fucking person in the world” as my friend put it. \n\nSo, one of my friends (Friend A) recently got involved in DoTerra. My other friend and roommate, B, and I make fun of people who get involved in MLMs. For me, I think that’s it’s just funny but B thinks MLMs are the scum of the Earth. She especially HATES the essential oils that A sells, and will always be really over dramatic about how much the oils irritate her lungs. \n\nSo for April Fools, I bought a bunch of peppermint oil from A and sprayed them in B’s room. I knew essential oils could be harmful to cats, so I took her cat out of her room. I waited, and after B came back from work she IMMEDIATELY smelled the oils from the door. It got stronger as she got closer to her room, but to my surprise, she started having a legit asthma attack. The worst part is her inhaler is in her room, so I had to run in and get it for her. \n\nNow, B can’t stay in her room and her cat won’t even go near it. The cat’s litter-box and food were in the room as well, which makes it even worse. \n\nTo top it all off, A hates me and B now because she realized that we think her “business” is a joke, and can’t believe I only bought it for a prank. She found out through snapchat, and blocked us both. \n\nI promised B I’d de-oil her room and wash her sheets, open windows, replace everything for her cat, etc. But B is SOOOO mad she said she is going to sublet her room and find someone else to live with. Reddit, I couldn’t have possibly predicted this reaction. I just thought we’d have some good laughs; I didn’t even know B had asthma. AITA here? I know my prank ended up being bad, but I didn’t have bad intentions. And I sorta feel bad for mocking A’s oils, but not really. ",

      "description": "I'm Canadian and my mom was born in Newfoundland. However, she had lived in Ontario most of her life, where I live now. When my brothers and I met with my mom's husband to discuss her will he let us know that my mom wanted to be buried on her home soil near her own parents. My stepdad told us that he would cover the cost of all our flights and accommodations so that we could attend the funeral. At that point I was already feeling like a funeral outside the province (a 3-4 hour flight) was kind of a lot to ask considering I have two small children now. But, since he's paying for it - fine, I guess.\n\nThis past weekend, my one brother begins to discuss flight costs and accommodations. He mentions it would be cheaper for me if I only come with the baby and leave my older child and husband behind. I'm confused because I was under the impression my stepdad would be paying for this but I tell him I'll get back to him about it. I needed a few hours to let that idea settle, talk to my other brother and my husband about it. My other brother then emails stepdad to clarify about flight costs because he remembers the same as I do - he said he would cover it. My husband is not okay with me taking the baby by myself somewhere far away from him (my older child is from another relationship). I agree, because I wouldn't feel comfortable if it were the other way around and after all, we are a unit.\n\nMy stepdad responds to my brother's email that he will not in fact be paying for flights OR funeral because of the drama that was stirred up by my mom's family regarding the grave plot. He then says that the will says that the \"estate is responsible for funeral costs\". This is not at all what is stated in the will. It very clearly says that the executor (stepdad) of the estate shall be responsible for all funeral costs etc.\n\nHe drops this bomb only weeks after I have already spent my share of the estate on purchasing a car. (An 07 Camry - the inheritance wasn't much). This was no secret to my brothers or my stepfather as they both helped me arrange the whole process of purchasing a vehicle.\nSo now I have no inheritance left, which I now found out should be used to pay for my own shit and help cover funeral costs? And he throws the \"If any of you have a problem with this you can take it up with my lawyer.\" Shit at us.\n\nSo now my brothers and I were trying to figure out how to afford an out of province funeral, which, by the way isn't in her will. And was also, her dying wish with the intention of moving back to her hometown to retire after her husband died. (Things, obviously didn't happen in that order). \nI've tried to explain that it is too much for me to afford, I'm not coming alone with the baby and that I've been blindsided and it's not right. As well, there will be a funeral here, near home. I will go to that one. But of course, my one brother is making me feel like an asshole for even considering not going.\nBut, am I really the asshole?",

      "description": "New here so if I haven’t understood one of the rules please let me know!\n\nI have a tricky situation I’m going through as of late.  I’m in a long term relationship.  We aren’t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We’ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She’s 19. \n\nMy “stepdaughter” and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn’t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  \n\nAfter that I’ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I’m still kind when I’m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  \n\nI thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I’ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fiancé loves having her here, but I’ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fiancé and I.   \n\nI really feel like I’ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it’s time to push her out of the nest.  I’m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don’t really care how she takes it.   My fiancé will probably be a little upset, but hopefully once the dust clears she will see that it’s for the best.  ",

When it was finished no one ate together, my dad was outside with his neighbors drinking, my step mom went down stairs for who knows what, my sister and I ate together with my daughter and my brother kept playing video games. After that I went to my old room where me and my daughter were going to sleep. We went down there to talk to my daughters dad who is deployed and go to bed. My parents get all upset that we went to bed early. That was whatever, then the next morning, my step mom decided she is going shopping and I was supposed to go with, I said HELL NO! I am not bringing my 3 month old out the day after Black Friday. No thank you. So her and my younger sister left and have been gone all day. My dad has been asleep majority of the day and has just now woken up cracked a beer and is in the garage with the neighbors again. I told my step mom I did not drive 140 miles with an infant on my own to sit alone in there house and we are leaving. Now my parents are throwing a fit and texting and Calling, telling me I can’t just leave and take their grand baby.  Me and my daughter are now at my aunts one town over ignoring their calls. ",

      "description": "Hello all, first time poster here. I will start with some history of my family. \nMy Grandfather married my step grandmother (sgm) years before I was married, and with that my goal already had two children (my mom and my aunt) of which sgm basically ignored and mistreated them ( my actually grandmother abused my mom and aunt while also keeping their house looking like one of those you see on Hoarders ) and always only cared about her own sons and loved them (seemingly) more than she did my own grandfather. \nWhen I was born, I was the only grandson of the sgm and was pretty much loved as much as my step uncles. Because of my father's poor financial skills, we usually ended up in horrible parts of town or on the streets. Sgm usually took me in and eventually took me in until I graduated from high school a year ago.\nNow with that, I will mention why I despise most of my family. For sgm she basically brushed her aside but also a few years ago she became very... I guess verbally abusive. While I lived with my grandparents, she would always argue with me, call me names, and use me as a live in maid/chef ( I get that I am young and could do alot, but I also had AP classes to study for, a job, and for most of highschool a girlfriend ) when she could easily have gotten off her butt and cleaned and cooked. There was even one time I was called a monster by her because I only wanted to go out and have a birthday dinner with my grandparents and best friend but not my cousin ( simple reason I do not like my cousin is because she is extremely entitled, a liar, and always likes to be the center of attention. Even at my graduation she tried to take the attention away from my graduation ). \nMy grandfather I have no problem with besides that he does not stand up for his own family when it comes to arguments between sgm and say my mother or I. \nAs for one of my uncles ( The other I had no problem with, in fact I he was my favorite. After he passed I was given his ring and I wear it to this day ) he yelled at me because his ex wife ( who also is entitled and a liar ) yelled at me because I wouldn't share food with the entitled mom's heathens as well as let them keep some of my things. He also gossips quite a bit with sgm and spreads lies, but oh well. \nNow for my aunt, surprisingly enough. When my actual grandmother died, she tried to take all of her possessions when it was suppose to be split between my mother and her. I believe she is a liar, gold digger, and many other words. Aunt and my cousin have also tried to start stuff between my fiancee and I, as well as tried starting problems with just my fiancee. \nAnyway, aita?",

      "description": "Before I start I would like to explain that my English is not that good as it's not my first language and I'm pretty tired and nauseous rn.\n\nSo my parents are divorced, they were never a very good relationship, they had lots of fight throughout the entire time they were together mostly due to the very different ways they took on with life, my father being a very laid back kinda of guy (went though 5 College courses, never finished one) and my mother being the type of person that always finds something work related to do in the house in her very small free time (she works in a hospital), but anyways their love life ended when my father discovered that she was cheating on him with a guy (a married one with kids). \n\nAfter the reveal, my father moved out of his house (it was his father's old apartment that he gave as a gift to my pa) and left with my mom until she could she find a place to live, lots of stuff happened during this time. My father locked himself in a bathroom with a blade crying while talking with my mother as she ignored him leaving me (a 12 year old boy, it was one day prior to my birthday aswell) to deal with this crap, she started checking up some places t rent, my father started seeing other people, some time later they tried again, didn't work, When my father found someone that he really clicked with my mother threatened her saying he was \"her man\". My father went to the apartment and they fought I can't quite point what happened as I wasn't there (and I'm glad I wasn't) but the outcome was my mother taking lots of my father's stuff from the house without his agreement, she simply took what she wanted and left, oh, and I almost forgot she broke my father's aquarium with a hammer killing all but 2 fish which are still alive (after I had to save them the following day). I lived a storm which I didn't understand at the time, I was always switching sides (As if there were sides) and probably got some unresolved issues from this shitload of shitty shit. \n\nSo years went by and nowadays my father has my guard but I have to see my mother everytime she wants to, our relationship is quite weird, I think I have lots of resentment towards her, but she says she loves me, she always tries to get me to do some random activity with her, but she's very toxic sometimes, for example our last huge fight was due to her saying my father was a bad influence on my personal growth due to him being autistic some dumb shit was said and I ended up dropping the FU bomb. I dunno it's very weird like one day she says stuff like \"You are the only reason for me to still be alive\" (she is depressive) and the next day she treats me like the useless dumb piece of shit that I am. \n\nI ended up writing this because she wanted to see me today while I had the birthday of one my friends later this night and she told me to reschedule it.\n\nI probably explained this in a bad way but I don't know what to feel towards this strange maternal figure of mine.

      "description": "This situation happens repeatedly, even though I've told her I don't like it on multiple occasions. An example below:\n \nSo it's Sunday and we had originally planned to go across town around 1pm for both of us to run some errands that should only take an hour or so. At night we were supposed to have dinner with her parents. I drive both of us to the place I need to go and she takes the car and goes to do her own thing. On the way there, we pass by a mall and she askes if we can stop by on the way backfor her to pick up some sneakers for work. I happily agree because it's on the way.\n\nSo we finish our errands and go to the mall. Once we get there she tells me she now wants to go to another store to see if she can pick up a wallet for her uncle. I agree again, since we're already here. Well first place didn't have the wallet, so we go and get the sneakers. Now she wants 3 pairs of sneakers, 2 for herself and 1 for her mom. So we stand in a long ass line and wait 30 minutes to check out. While we were waiting, she called her parents to chat and then informed me her parents' friend would also be coming to dinner. This is someone I've only met twice and did not really know. I reluctantly said okay, whatever. So we finally leave the shoe store and she tells me her uncle said to check another store to see if they have the wallet. So we go to that store to look and they still don't have it. She calls her parents again and now she wants to go back to the shoe store to get another pair of sneakers for her dad.\n\nAt this point my patience is wearing thin. I had planned on checking the brakes on her car when we got home because it was squeaking. Was going to take it apart and clean it. Now I don't have enough time to do that before we have to go to her parents.\n\nSo I tell her she's doing it again, and how we talked about not spontaneously adding things to our schedule already. She gets upset and I ask her if it would be okay for me to skip dinner with her parents tonight because I'm not feeling like it anymore. We have dinner very frequently anyways, it's not a once in a while thing. Well now she's pissed because her parents have already started preparing dinner.\n\nSo the question is, am I wrong to get upset over something like this?",

      "description": "I'm autistic, and 15. Which trust me, is a lovely combination that never gets in the way of life. So for the past year, I've felt it's been my job to hunt down people and ask \"when am I being assessed for extra time/separate room?\" \"Will I be allowed these things in my final exams?\" or when that received a stupidly vague answer I'd basically beg my parents to ring the doctors or whoever your supposed to ring. The doctors haven't gotten back to us yet.\n\nI feel like it shouldn't be my responsibility and I should've automatically been put down for assessment when I got my diagnosis, over two years ago. So when I was told yesterday that I had to do my statistics mock in the exam hall, surrounded by people, nowhere near a door, I was pissed the hell off.\n\nI told the teachers it was not acceptable and that they should have this sorted by now. Over the past two years they've been letting me do my tests in other rooms, no questions asked. I may have overacted and told one teacher that this was all of their faults and she had to take responsibility, which seemed to annoy her. I got really mad at a load of them and honestly I'm not sorry.\n\nI understand that as a teacher, your life is busy and you don't have time for every student as much as I get that legally I had to be in there. But I feel almost  like after two years, something should've been done. I did do the exam in the hall, though I could have done way better.\n\nI do actually want to hear what you have to say, as I know I'm not always the best judge of my actions. Thanks in advance",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I were going to a cute date at one of those places where you drink wine and paint. On the way there (she was driving) we hit bumper-to-bumper traffic in the slow lane. She drives a sedan and we were behind a big pickup truck, the kind with the super high suspensions, so we couldn’t see anything in front of us other than that monstrosity. \n\nSuddenly, Mr. Monster Truck switches lanes without a blinker, cutting someone off in the right lane but narrowly avoiding what was now in front of us. You see, the stretch of highway was under construction, which meant that the shoulder was extremely narrow, hardly wide enough to pull over. Unfortunately, a car had apparently broken down, and was in the middle of being towed away. All fine and good, but the problem lay in the fact of the tow truck driver, now known as TD. He was morbidly obese, probably 400-450 lbs, and, I shit you not, he was taking up half the lane. \n\nNow Mr. Monster Truck had, unlike us, the capacity to see what was coming and decided to switch lanes at the last second. But now, we couldn’t switch over and we didn’t have time to stop, so we just kept going. Upon seeing that we didn’t plan on moving over, TD fucking loses it. He starts gesturing to his flashing lights and screaming, exactly what idk, but I made out the words “move over you stupid bitch” from reading his lips. \n\nAt that point, I yell “Hey fuck you guy!” \n\nWe just kinda scooted around him, but he clearly made out what I said, or he’s just a dick, because he punched the side of my gfs car. \n\nIf I had been driving, I would’ve pulled over, so thank god I wasn’t.\n\nNow, thinking back, it definitely wasn’t the best thing to do, but was it at least warranted?",

      "description": "Currently, it’s 10:30pm. She is cooking and she is very loud. She likes to play music or podcasts while she cooks, or talk on the phone. She is usually in the kitchen for several hours. I’d be lying if I said we got along. She’s repeatedly ignored my attempts at conversation and friendship. Anyway, we don’t like each other much, I don’t think. That being said, I’ve always done my best to be considerate in my noise levels. I am sometimes out in the living space later at night but I am always very quiet. I try to be on a pretty strict schedule for work reasons, and I need my body to be used to being asleep and awake at certain times. The noise (primarily the music/podcasts/phone calls, and the banging of pots and pans) prevent me from sleeping. Would it be terribly unreasonable of me to ask her to quiet down?\n",

      "description": "I have been dating this girl for about half a year. While she was sleeping I went through her phone and found out she has been having intimate conversations with her ex (from the text it actually seemed like they didn't really break up). Her ex was an international student whom she dated for 4 years. They \"separated\" when he left but based on the texts they were still in love. One night I was helping her charge her phone and there was a message from \"Habibi\". I knew her ex was Arabic so this got me suspicious. She had trusted me with her phone's password too so it was easy for me to just take a look. I confronted her about it the next day. She said she didn't want to hurt me but she just fell for me really fast. I was about to cry so I said that I was leaving. She hugged me really hard and held me in place and said \"no you can't I won't let you\" as she started crying. She told me that she was raped 4 years and her host family and friends abandoned her. She said that she can't just ignore him cause he helped her go through it and everything. I started feeling really bad so I stayed for the night. She was cried a lot and had a few panic attacks. I woke up before her in the morning and snuck out. She was the first to say \"I love you\" and I loved her too but this seemed too much for me to handle. I still miss her. Am I the asshole here?",

      "title": "AITA for telling my leasing office I’m considering calling the (non emergency) police over noise complaints against my neighbors? Or for making so many complaints in general?",
      "description": "at this point I’ve made 4 separate complaints to my leasing office about the family directly above me. Two were written formal complaints. It started with their 4 year old spending quite literally 4 hours one day and 6 hours the next day sprinting back and forth across the floor, stomping as hard as he can, and what sounded like him jumping off furniture and landing hard on the floor. It was literally nonstop for hours each time, and the second time it went on until after midnight. That was the first informal email complaint. Then one day they started playing music so loud it drowned out my television 10 feet in front of me and after a while was turned up loud enough to be heard over headphones. It went on for around 3-4 hours in the middle of the day, and was loud enough that I could hear every lyric. So I made the first written formal complaint. \nThe second formal complaint was a few days ago, when we came home the woman who lives up there was also getting out of her car at the same time as us. She flipped us the middle finger and then proceeded to stomp up the second flight of stairs as we were directly under her on the first flight. She’s a small girl, so it took a lot of effort to stomp as hard as she was stomping. Ten minutes later they were playing more loud music, even louder than the last time, and I went immediately to the leasing office to put in a complaint. The property manager not only tried to tell us it was probably the maintenance employees playing loud music outside (as if that’s acceptable anyway?) and she was definitely speaking down to us as tho she is positive we’re lying about this. She sent a maintenance guy to stand in our apartment and see if he could hear the music but by the time we’d gotten back they had already stopped playing music. \nThen today they’ve twice played loud bass thumping music for over an hour each time. By the second time the leasing office was already closed so I sent another email, telling them I didn’t feel like anyone was handling this situation professionally. I told them if it keeps happening I’m going to make a noise complaint with the police department, and I also sent the same email to the area manager above the on-site property manager mainly because it derailed that it’s still happening and I brought up the property managers attitude with us as well. \n\nTLDR; I’ve made 4 noise complaint, 2 formal written ones against the neighbors above us. Nothing has changed, so I emailed my last complaint to the area manager as well as told them I’m going to call the police because I don’t think I’m being taken seriously\n\nAITA for both the threat about the police and for making so many complaints against one family? Is this something I should just live with? We’ve tried talking to the neighbors directly, that just resulted in their animosity and then lying to the leasing office claiming my boyfriend screamed a bunch of curse words at their child which absolutely did not happen. The manager told us to not go up their anymore and to take all of our complaints to the office in the future. ",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and three months. We were best friends before we started dating, and it really makes all this harder. \nMy boyfriend has a really bad relationship with his mother and that’s kind of put me in the “mom” role. Therefore, he pretty much depends on me to support his emotions. \nI’ve been witness to many panic attacks and random fits of anger and tears. I have a hard time talking to him about our relationship and working things out, because he gets upset and has to hang up the phone. \nHe’s also very physically ill. He’s severely underweighted and we don’t know why and now has a ton of dietary restrictions. This also makes me his part time nurse because he’s in pain a lot. \nHe’s also pretty unmotivated, which effects us a lot. We are recently out of high school and I’ve managed to hold a job and go to college, while he still doesn’t have a job and hasn’t signed up for school because of his depression. \nI’ve stayed with him because I’m still in love with him, but there isn’t much romance and I rarely feel like I want to be intimate with him. \n\nI’ve expressed all these feelings to him, but it seems like he honestly can’t make the changes that I need him to, in order for our relationship to work. \n\nIt’s hard because a lot of this isn’t his fault, he’s just sick. He recently got on an anxiety and depression medication and it has slightly helped but not by much. Im at a loss as of what to do except take a break from him and see if he can get himself together apart from me. I truly want him to get better but I feel like the fact that he uses me as a crutch is holding him back. ",

(He has already said he would prefer the get the ring and ask me with that than us shop together, so I was just being helpful with some ideas)\n\nBut when I showed him, he asked me “what about if it was a family heirloom, like my grandmothers ring?” and I didn’t want to offend so I just said yes, that would still be nice because the idea is lovely.\n\nI have a feeling that he already has the ring (if I’m correct he got it last month) and that’s why he was checking with me, but I already know it won’t be of my taste because I’m just not into vintage things. \n\nI was married 12 years ago and the ring picked for me then was awful but I wore it anyway. I don’t want to have to do that again. I feel like just once I should be allowed to have something I like. \n\nHe’s really not a family oriented guy, so I was very shocked by his question, but it must mean a lot to him to suggest it. (Unless his mum just gave it to him when he told her he was asking me, she’s big on regifting)\n\nAITA for wanting something new that fits my style and tastes? \n\nPs: we are quite well off and the ring I want is less than $500, so it’s not like it’s a $10K diamond I’m asking for.

I tend work for 2 weeks straight through and if I come home I'll grab foods I have made or bought and then head out again. This week I have worked 168 hours (every hour of the week) by being on location.\n\nSo the story goes like this I came home one day where my week wasn't busy and noticed some of my smoothies were missing. They're little ones from Costco. I had put them in a drawer in the fridge and asked 2 of my three roommates to let me have that drawer. They did not protest. So in come home and notice a few are missing. I'm calk and ask and it comes to my attention two of them have drank my smoothies. I explained that it's a major violation of my trust to do that without asking. They apologize and say they'll replace the smoothies. I decline their offer and say, just dont do it again. \n\nA week later I come home and my feta cheese has been opened from whole foods and 4 beers from a 6 pack I bought are gone. The two roommates again admit to eating some of my feta. I again reiterate it's not okay to do that. \n\nHowever I asked 2 of my 3 roommates about the the beer. The 1st one said it wasn't her. So I texted the next roommate. She said it wasn't her either but, she texts the first roommate saying how shitty I am for accusing her of drinking my beers. \n\nNow the 3rd roommate is a real POS. Hes jobless, a past domestic abuser, and thankfully moving out. I didnt ask him if he drank my beer but at this point I'm fairly sure it was him or one of my roommates shithead entitled friends. \n\nSo I bring up the notion how can I trust them to stay out of my room (I own guns and camera gear) and respect my belongings (motorcycle etc). The issue is they are really nice most of the time and watch my dog when I am on my hitch which means a lot because I love him. How should I approach the situation without being explosive or angry? \n\nAlso AITA for not addressing the issue in a group setting? Did my actions warrant feeling accused...",

      "description": "On mobile, sorry for formatting. Also sorry for how long and kinda petty the whole thing is\n\nSo I'm a 22 year old male. My boyfriend is 25. I've worked at this call center for a few months, and as such I've made a couple work friends. One of my friends, let's call her Emily, soon after we met decided to give me the nickname Cinnamon Roll, saying I'm too pure. I get the meme, I'm hip, and I like the nickname. \n\nAfter a while I get around to mentioning it to my boyfriend. I wasn't trying to hide it, I had no reason to, we just hadn't really discussed my every conversation and it didn't come up. When I mention it to him though, he immediately went on the defensive \"who is this girl, why does she call you that, what does she look like, etc\". This catches me off guard, I'm very gay and I'm shocked he seemed so jealous of a girl when he knows theres no chance anything would happen. \n\nI answer his questions, try to explain the meme, list a handfull of fictional characters I would consider Cinnamon Rolls, and he just didn't seem to get it. He insists that she's \"an eagle trying to swoop in on his bunny\" and that she must die. I realize he's kidding, but it becomes an almost nightly conversation. He makes jokes about all my work friends, but Emily definitely gets the most of it over the name.\n\nToday the conversation came to a bit of a head. We're texting and he jokes about her requiring death over it again, and I'm kinda sick of the joke at this point, and say that if Emily has to die so does his friend Teresa. She does everything Emily does but they've known each other longer. If Emily is that big a threat to him then Teresa is one to me. He says that's different, she's like his sister. I say Emily is like a sister to me, just a much newer one.\n\nHe doesn't like that and asks why it's suddenly an issue now. I tell him I've always been a bit annoyed by his joke, and he just laughed it off whenever I mentioned it to him. I have a hard enough time making friends as it is, I don't need his constant \"jokes\" weighing on me every time I meet someone.\n\nEventually he agrees to stop making the joke. I thank him, and then he says \"If the joke has to stop, so does the name\". To which I say no, if my friend wants to give me a nickname I like they're allowed to.\n\nHe says that's hypocritical which kinda floors me, cause I don't see how. I tell him Cinnamon Roll is no worse than Chocolate Chip, a nickname his friends gave him. He claims thats different cause he knew his friends more than a couple months. I say that's arbitrary and ask what the time requirement is on nickname giving, 6 months, 3 years, a certain percentage of my age? I tell him I love him, but he's trying to control how I talk and to who, and it makes me feel like he doesn't trust me and that hurts.\n\nHe says that I obviously dont care about his feelings. He's proud I made a friend, good for me, but why does SHE get to be a Cinnomon Roll and HE doesn't, I've said I have more than one. Now he's simply confused on the facts of the situation because I dont call her that, just the other way around.\n\nEventually he says that he isn't mad he isn't a cinnamon roll, he's mad that her one name seems more important to me than any of the petnames he calls me. It must be because I let her call me her name but not any of the handful he gave me. I tell him it's apples and oranges and just because I'm not gonna kill a name I like just because he says so doesnt make his less important to me.\n\nHe told me to stop digging my already deep hole, and now he isn't talking to me.\n\nSo that's where I'm at. Him ignoring me telling him I love him and I don't get off work for several more hours. I feel like he made something out of nothing weeks ago when he started making the \"joke\", and I draw a line at him trying to control how I talk with my friends and him trting to make me control how they talk to me. But Idk. Am I the Asshole here?",

      "title": "AITA for not staying in contact with my drug addicted friend?",
      "description": "I'll begin this post with the initial problem and then back track to give some background information. \n\nA little more than a year ago I kicked my friend who was visiting me because he had gotten drunk and took a bunch of Xanax and almost overdosed as far as I could tell. I told him to seek out nearby family and sort his life out (at three time he was a graduate student and facing some legal trouble.) I told him to get sober and straight before contacting me ever again. Since then he's been sending me random aggressive messages and acting like I'm in the wrong. I'm currently not aware of his location or situation, but I'm pretty positive he is in jail. \n\nI want to help him but my priority is to take care of myself and my girlfriend and life is a hustle enough without taking on the weight of my friend's problems. I also think there are underlying psychological issues that no one is addressing that are causing him problems.\n\nI met my friend, we'll call him Dan, in college. He had already had issues with many different hard drugs including meth, heroin, and crack. By the time we met him it really seemed like all that was behind him. While we disagreed on a lot of social/political philosophies, Dan was a great friend to have around. Fast forward a few years and we all graduate college except for Dan (same age as me) who was a few years behind us due to his timeline.\n\nAround this time we started to notice changes in Dan. For lack of a better description he simply seemed like he was going crazy, probably due to not having his friends around who he could be himself around. Dan is a rather self conscious person and has a lot of social anxiety. After he graduates he immediately went out west to graduate school. We believe he never made any friends there and drifted into solitude and alcoholism which are very dangerous things for someone with underlying mental health issues.\n\nWe started receiving texts in our group chats from Dan that made no sense, were riddled with simple spelling errors, were aggressive. They seemed like they were coming from someone who entirely lost their mind, basically. \n\nIt wasn't long after this time that I had to kick him out of my apartment. I was honestly very scared of him. There was no way to tell if he was going to turn violent at any moment (he's a big, big dude).\n\nI told him to give me a year before trying to contact me and to get his shit together. By that time he was facing multiple felonies in a western state, had gotten a DUI in New York, etc. He ended up getting sent to a rehab clinic close to where I live and kept sending me messages, which I either ignored or didn't respond to. He had been ignoring the rules to his legal sentences and was buying weed (allegedly from undercover cops), cooking meth in his apartment, etc. At one point he skipped town and then came back to finish his rehab and now he is gone again and most likely in jail. \n\nAm I the asshole for shutting him out? My life is chaotic as it is and I don't have the time or strength to deal with other people's problems but I also feel like me and my friends were keeping him sane for a little bit. \n\nSorry if this is all disjointed and unclear, the details of his life fern the past two years or so are so shrouded in mystery and meth smoke that I don't think anyone could quite put together a reasonable timeline of events, not us, not his parents or family and definitely not him.",

She was moved because of her attitude and lack of motivation to work.\n\nSince she moved, she has been disappearing on us for 20 minute Starbucks runs multiple times a day (we are only supposed to have two 10 minute breaks and a lunch). M lies about where she is going, then goes to Starbucks. We've been busy, so sometimes it's a big problem.\n\nShe has been consistently not listening to our instructions and training, making things wrong, and ignoring customers. I had already talked to M multiple times about it before two days ago when we got a customer complaint. The department head came to us and told us about it, and we both got in trouble. I talked to M again about it, because my other coworkers are friendly and prompt with customers, and she did the exact same thing yesterday and got another complaint.\n\nI went to our manager and told her about how M had been working, and after I went on my lunch, she apparently got moved back onto the dishwasher in the very back corner of the bakery.\n\nTL;DR: I went to my manager about my coworker after she had gotten multiple customer complaints about her attitude, and she got put on dish duty permanently.

      "description": "Ok, so I've had a rough 18 or so hours.  Last night right before bed I got told that my sister, her husband and my 5 week old niece had been in an accident on the highway (thankfully everyone looks to be ok).  They live 3500km away so I was pretty torn up that I couldn't be there for them, and the fact that I have my own 8 month old made me feel for them and how worried they must have been for their daughter.  When I finally fell asleep around 1 in the morning I didn't sleep long because my son woke me up at 4:30 and again at 7.  He usually sleeps 8 til 8 but because we're getting rid of the pacifier he has been up multiple times a night for the last few nights.  Needless to say I didn't sleep well and am pretty exhausted.  \n\nWhen we headed downstairs for the day, around 8:30, I could immediately smell shit.  My dog who is totally housebroken had one of the largest shits I have ever seen.....right in the middle of my son's play yard and on his play mat.  So now I couldn't put him in there to clean it, so I had to put him in his jumper, he was not having any of it and not having his pacifier just added to the crying.  So here I am, trying to clean, disinfect, take care of baby, feed baby breakfast...fun times!  Finally time for his nap and I thought I'd have an hour to finish cleaning and disinfect his toys.  Nope, 20 minutes and he was back awake, play yard still not ready for him, so it was just a repeat of the morning.  Finally done cleaning so I had to go take care of the daycare payment registration that had to be done today because it starts Apr 1.   \n\nNew problem, couldn't find my keys.  I looked everywhere.  I was starting to stress out, I had about 2 hours before the closed.  After half an hour looking for them I texted my husband to ask if he had seen them.  He calls and asks if I checked X, Y. and Z places, which I had.  I definitely sound stressed and a little worked up but I didn't yell or swear....at the beginning (we both have call recorders on our phone and listened after and agree to this fact).  He kept cutting me off and telling me to relax which just made me more stressed out, he hung up twice, at the end of the third call I was livid and yelling.  \n\nTurns out the keys were locked in my car, he came home to get them for me (he has my spare).  He opened the door, didn't say a word to me, dropped the keys on the floor and left....leaving the door wide open while I'm breastfeeding my son.   I admitted to fucking up and locking my keys in the car but now he expects an apology for \"yelling at him\".  I said I wasn't yelling at him, but yes I was stressed and yelling.  He says that because he was on the other end of the phone that he considers it being yelled at.  I tried to tell him that telling me to relax didn't help the situation, he says it's on me for not being able to control my emotions.\n\nSo, AITA for getting more angry every time I'm told to relax?  I don't feel I'm the one that needs to apologize.",

      "description": "I'm a cocktail of mental illness -- depression and insomnia being the factors in this specific issue. I still do function well enough in life, but I feel like I put an incredible amount of stress on my SO.\n\nOften, I cannot sleep, so I tend to head off on my own at unusual times in the night. My outings are nothing eventful. Sometimes, it's a walk at a nearby park. Sometimes, it's a visit to the grocery store (for nothing in particular). Sometimes, it's a highway drive.\n\nThis usually calms me down, and by the time I come back home, I'm in a much better state mentally.\n\nThe problem is that my SO worries *immensely.* My outings are mostly unpredictable, and when I'm in a bad mental state, I isolate myself. I don't want to be touched. I don't talk to anyone or look at anyone. I don't check my phone, usually leaving it behind or silencing it and putting it aside.\n\nThere are many times when I need the quiet and to be away from other people, just for a while. Whenever I have these episodes, I block out a lot of external stimuli in order to cope.\n\nSo when I leave, I don't say anything. He doesn't know where I'll be or how long I'll be gone, until I come back home and am back to my normal self.\n\nOne night in particular, he asked me not to go, and to come back to bed. But instead, I told him that this was something that I needed to do and that I would be back very soon. I left. When I came back -- sometime around 2 or 3 am -- I saw that he'd been crying while I was gone.\n\nI was shocked and felt extremely guilty. So I apologized as much as I could, gave him a hug, and went right back to bed.\n\nI feel like during my \"episodes,\" I can be incredibly cold. I reject any physical contact. I don't want to talk. Essentially, I become unresponsive, and this hurts my SO a lot.\n\nWhen I'm my normal self, all is good. It's great actually. We have fun, talk plenty about everything, run errands together, and go out. Or we spend nights in, reading, studying, watching videos, etc. -- just generally living and enjoying life together.\n\nIt's just that, in order to be normal, I need these night outings to myself. That time alone keeps me sane. However, every time I leave, reject a hug, or become unresponsive, it upsets him -- immensely. Yet it's difficult for me not to be this way. This is my coping mechanism.\n\nAm I the asshole for constantly leaving my SO at night for alone time?",

We leave at 7:35 so hitting the snooze button twice (7minutes each) leaves her with 35 minutes to get ready, which has never been enough.\nSo every morning I wake up, set her alarm ahead 13 minutes, leaving me 2 minutes to get the coffee running. She wakes up, gets in the shower. While she is in the shower I go back and set the alarm back to the correct time. For the past 8 or so months she has believed showering, getting dressed and putting on make-up takes her about 15 minutes.\nEvery now and then she comments on how much she has improved with being late. I smile and say yes love you really have.\nSometimes a little white lie can be a good thing. \n\nA lot of people called it controlling/manipulative etc. am I the asshole for doing this? ",

      "description": "So I had this friend that was heavy into drugs. He went to rehab and nothing changed, his mother did everything she could and I did too. I had frequent interventions with him discussing his worrisome behaviour (some heated and some cool/collected). Regardless, nothing worked.\n\nPersonally, I'm very aware that I am the average of the 5 people I hang around. I choose my friends wisely and I voice my opinion if they fuck up, and I expect the same from them (always trying to be better).\n\nI was friends with this dude since the 6th grade and we ended up moving in together when we turned 18. He was pretty fresh out of rehab and his drug use was minimal (much better than what it was, seemed under control). He started going on binges. After the first one we had an intervention. Then the binges became more and more frequent.\n\nIt became clear to me that if this pattern continued, eventually he was going to die. I cut him off, pretty harshly, because it was clear that being around him was not good for me, and I wasn't helping him effectively. Eventually he moved out and we stopped talking. He went back to rehab for a couple of years, and when he returned he overdosed after a month and died from a mix of Hydrocodone and Oxytocin. My original hopes were that I cut him off, he gets his shit straight, and then we become friends again in time like we always have. I attended his funeral more pissed off because he couldn't change for the better than I was sad for his death. So the thing is...\n\nAm I The Asshole For cutting my best friend out of my life, when i knew he was going to eventually die from drugs, instead of enjoying the good parts about him and accepting his faults? I feel like this is a huge grey area. On one hand I did what i thought was best, but even if i thought that way it might've been less painful just sticking with him till the end... Is accepting someones toxicity the final devotion to your family? (I did consider him a brother).",

She gets all mad over something, I don’t think, she should have that hard of a say for.\n\nAnother one: on my graduation for my BA in college, i only had 7 tickets for the event and was deciding who to invite. I wrote it in the family chat that I was still deciding. She took it as she had to assign who was going and thus did so and invited those individuals while doing it. \n\nSo ughh, I’m trying to get over these things but I’m afraid of these kind of moments when I’m interacting with my mom.

      "description": "This happened several months ago. Sorry for language problems as English isn't my first language.\n\nMy wife, our three children and myself own a house with a garden. In the garden, there are two bungalows that, while owned by me and my wife, my parents-in-law have \"life estate\". They have the right to live there and use these as long as one of them is alive. This was agreed upon when buying the house because my in-laws generously gave a lot of money. They are also free to use one of our four basements rooms for storage.\n\nMy MIL is very helpful. She's only there every other week for a couple days as she's still working, but whenever she's there, she helps cleaning up the house, tending the garden, doing the laundry and so on. I have mixed feelings about it, since we don't ask for her help and while I enjoy having some tasks off our plate, she sometimes misplaces stuff while tidying up or rearranging our place.\n\nSo once I was taking out the trash and I found some of my stuff in the garbage. I have a small box of memorabilia (personal stuff from my past like letters, my class ring and letters from my mother from the time I spent in the US as a student, a worry stone my first gf gave me, old pictures and so on) that is in one of our rooms in the basement. I found some of this box' contents in the garbage. I went through all our garbage cans and sure found the box itself and all its contents. I was furious. I rescued the stuff - except for some moisture it seemed unharmed - and confronted my MIL, while the family as having dinner. I was really angry for her to throw away my stuff.\n\nShe claimed the box was standing next to other boxes that my wife had told her to throw away. As far as I could tell, those boxes were in front of a shelf, while my box were in the shelf. So I told her with so many a little louder than normal words that I do not want her to go through my things.\n\nShe cut her stay at our house short and left the next day. A couple days later my FIL lets me know that she's angry at me for yelling at her in front of her grandchildren and my wife kind of wants me to apologize. While I didn't agree, I did apologize, because I like my peace and quite and don't need to fume about stuff like this and if it helps to say words in order for others to feel better, it doesn't hurt me to say words. (I think I did point out that I don't think it's bad for the children to witness an argument, especially because I made sure I explained to my children why I was angry at my MIL as neutral as I could.\n\nSo, AITA?",

I’ve always been the primary earner in our household (I work in a high-paying field, while my wife didn’t even attend college), so it wasn’t a big transition. A year ago, we started the process of relocating to a rural area where I commute to my job every other week (I stay in an apartment while I’m there and spend every other week at home). We both love the outdoors and were happy to raise our family away from the chaos of the city. We have lived here in our new house for six months.\n\nMy wife recently began complaining that she felt isolated. I suggested that she try making friends in the town where we live, but she said that it’s too small and mostly old people (it is small, less than 500 people, but it’s not just old people). Now she’s saying that she wants to go back to work. This is ridiculous for a multitude of reasons. First of all, the closest town where she could realistically get a job is over an hour away. There’s also literally no childcare anywhere near here. I told her my concerns, and she said that this was important enough to her that she wants me to consider moving.\n\nI’m furious at her for so quickly wanting to give up the life we built together. I put a lot of money into buying this property and building the house. We both agreed that raising our kids in the country was the best thing for our family. I want her to be happy, but I feel betrayed.",

My friends get along well with her and we all hang out often. However, I have hardly hung out with her friends. I wanna say I have hung out with her friends about 5 times total (over 7 months), compared to multiple times a week with my friends. I have only been with her friends at parties. (She used to not invite me to any, giving me some lame reason, until I confronted her. Now its more common). We have argued about it a couple of times now, so I wanna know what you guys think. \n\nAnother AITA question. Her guy friends are all part of the same group for the most part. The issue I have is that she has hooked up (just making out, high school hook up) with most of them once or multiple times. Shes had a thing with most of them, asking them to dances and such. Also gave me some TMI about past hookups. She dated one of them too for less than a month. There is this guy who she was gonna have a thing with, but didnt because her and I got together. My friend said that they are always talking, and the guy always gets up to go talk to her. AITA for being worried about it? \n\n",

      "description": "For context into the situation, I'm an 18 y/o AFAB living in the yeehaw state. Texas is all I've ever known. In May, I'll be moving out to California to live with my boyfriend of four years. We have plans to get an apartment and just live life. However, one of the things that I've been conflicted about is my mother. \n\n I was born into a family of nine kids. My dad ended up being diagnosed with cancer when I was eight and died shortly after my ninth birthday. So, my mom had to step up. She started working while my older sister took care of us at home. Later down the line, my mom met my (now ex) stepdad, and they got married. The problem? He was an abusive prick. And something about his presence made my mom just as terrible to be around. After an incident that my sister reported to the police, I was put into the foster care system. After a year, I was placed back under my mother's care. This is where things get grey for me. \n\n Ever since then (2013), life with my mother has been a mixture of heaven and hell. She doesn't hit me anymore, but I feel like I'm being emotionally abused. Except I don't know if I am or not because I've always been really sensitive. Any little thing can set her off, from a comment that was meant to be a joke to a sigh to one of the bowls not being washed correctly. And believe me when I say that when my mom gets mad, she gets MAD. Yelling, name-calling, threatening to kick me out- the works.\n\n That aside, she's not all bad. She's still letting me live here until I graduate. She bought me new clothes for when I move out to California. She was the one who stood up for me when it came to bullies when I was little. When I attempted to move out this past December, she let me come back when it didn't work out. \n\n I told one of my sisters two years ago that I was considering cutting off contact with my mom. I had just come out to her and she handled it like most conservative Christian moms. I was hurt and wanted to leave. But my sister just stared at me and said,\"You can't do that to her.\" \n\n My mom's getting up there in terms of age and she's in bad health. My sister reminded me that she had been put through almost all of the same things, and she still kept her in her life. And ever since then, I've felt guilty about the idea of cutting her off. I've done some things I'm not proud of over the years, like running away and keeping in contact with people online when she said not to. Most recently I quit my job (boss made inappropriate comments about me taking antidepressants) and now I can't give her my paycheck to help financially like I used to. She's stressed. And I can't help but to feel like maybe if I changed, we could have a normal relationship. Like maybe I'm just blowing things out of proportion. Like maybe I'm the asshole in the situation. \n\n So, I gotta know. Do y'all think I'm the asshole? ",

So really we're all a tight friend group but I feel much closer to Jon and my wife is much closer to May. I don't dislike her at all, but if I had a gun and had to shoot one of them.. I know where my bullet's going.\n\n\n  On to the story, last night May calls my wife and tells her she found out Jon has been having an affair. My wife invites her to our house to spend the night. I call Jon and he confirms it, I tell him he's a moron and hang up. I'm fine with May being here, we get along but it's definetly awkward considering she was cheated on by my best friend.\n\n\n  While I was ready to get to bed my wife turns to me and asks me what's going to happen between Jon and I. I say nothing's going to change. Obviously the friend group is over and unless they fix their problems. She says she expects me to drop Jon which I am absolutely NOT going to do. He's an idiot for cheating in the 1st place and May did nothing wrong but I'm not going to drop my closest friend because of an affair. I tell her that and she says it's immoral of me to continue supporting Jon while May is the victim here. I'm not going to cut contact with May, she's still a friend, but I am also not going to cut off Jon. She says it's asshole-ish of me to do but I disagree. Aita? \n",

      "description": "Tl;dr at the bottom, long time lurker first time poster, I’m on mobile etc etc\n\nI’ve been feeling really about about how I treated this girl recently and I’m turning to reddit for advice. We had known each other for over a year and had started talking pretty consistently for roughly 6 months. I was in high school at the time and have retained the social awkwardness I portrayed back then. I tried to make up ways to hang out with her because we weren’t part of the same friend group. I would come up with things like asking if she wanted to play narrative based video games together (which I know she was interested in) via streams and discord. She said that she would love that and so we said we’d do it that weekend. She then proceeded to be busy for the entire weekend. She was never quite specific on what it was so I’m pretty sure it was made up. I thought it wasn’t a big deal and asked if she wanted to do it the coming weekend instead. She agreed and once again she forgot all about it despite being active and friendly during the week. I tried to take no offense to this but I had trouble after two really suspicious weekends. \n\nMonths passed and we never played those games, but we were still talking consistently. I then in my infinite stupidity chose to face my social anxiety and ask her on a date to the movies, to which she replied the classic “....as friends.” I asked her if she actually wanted to go as friends or if it was just social niceties, and she replied the former. So I take the time to plan everything and invite extra friends so it wouldn’t be weird and she cancels and then doesn’t talk to me for two months straight. She used to say hi in the hallways and now walks right past without so much as a glance. I was extremely hurt by this and I was extremely confused as I saw no logical reason for her to act this way. \n\nAfter these two months of ghosting she asks me for help with a writing piece of hers. I basically blow up on her and tell her that she actually has to cultivate relationships with people for them to want to help her, and that she shouldn’t except me to turn around from being rejected and promptly ghosted with a smile on my face and that she needed to find somebody else. I used specific details of how she was upset some of her friends chose to stop hanging around with her, and I said that if she treated them the same she treated me then they have every right to leave.\n\nShe later tells me she only ghosted me in an attempt to not lead me on. I feel justified in how I felt but I’m regretful of how I acted. What do you think, Reddit, AITA?\n\nTl;dr: I liked a girl and asked her out, she ghosted me and then asked for my help and I blew up",

      "description": "TLDR: My ex wanted to go to a movie with his friends. I told him no. He kept pushing because I'd be awake all night resetting my sleep schedule so I could watch her. This led to an argument. AITA?\n\n;;\n\nMy ex and I are not together, but we cohabit and coparent. I'm in the process of looking for my own place and figuring out childcare and custody.\n\nDuring March, I have to do an externship with one of the major hospitals nearby. The commute can range from 45 minutes to an hour and a half one way. Shifts are 8 1/2 or 10 1/2 hours long. My preceptor has me on a hectic rotation for this month so I can meet my hour requirement. \n\nI've let my ex know about this in advance. He was fine with the schedule,  but mostly upset because it meant he wouldn't see his friends for a month. He goes out dancing Fridays and Saturdays. Sunday through Thursday nights, he'll walk over to one of the houses of his friends and stay drinking with them until 2 in the morning. I'm always the one who watchs our kid during those times.\n\nYesterday, I had just come home after finishing the morning shift. After he finished telling me about his day, I told him how I wasn't looking forward to resetting my sleep schedule with so little time. (I have the midnight shift tonight.)\n\nA few hours later, I'm helping our kid clean up her room to get ready for a bath. He comes in and tells me his friends are going to see Captain Marvel and asks if he can go. I say no. He asks why and I was planning on getting groceries shortly after I put our kid down for bed. I said was already really tired and I didn't trust that I wouldn't crash at some point. He leaves then comes back a few minutes later. He says he can be home by 9:45.\n\nI asked him if this was going to be a reoccurring issue when I moved out amd we had split custody. He told me that he wasn't going to see his friends in over a month and this was the only time he could. He said he had already told them he'd ask me when I got home. He asked me what the big deal was since I was going to be up all night anyways so I could shopping at any point.\n\nI got mad and repeated that I was tired and I wanted to get the task of having to drive somewhere over with first thing. I reminded him of how often he goes to see his friends.\n\nOur kid hears our voices raising and she hugs me and hides her face in my leg. It kinda deflated the argument. I tell my ex that I didn't want to talk about it at the moment. He agreed but said that we will talk about it. Our kid asked if I mad at him. At the same time, he said no and I said yes. \n\nAfter I put her down for the night, I sat on the couch with him to see if he'd want to finish our talk. He didn't say anything or look my away, but was furiously messaging people on Snapchat.\n\nAfter I came back from shopping, he told me he was going to walk over to one of his friend's house. I told him okay. He came back at almost 1 and went straight to bed. AIAA?",

He also got married to this girl he’d been seeing for only 3 months and I told him that probably wasn’t the best idea and he should wait, which he took offense to and only ended up escalating our tensions.\n\nHe works for his dad’s general contracting company as a 1099 employee, and I know for a fact he doesn’t pay taxes. He flexes his new truck, his new apartment, and that he bought his girlfriend a car. He’s changed and been so toxic since he’s been with this girl, she want as far as trying to uninvite my girlfriend from their wedding.

I figure, if he’s going to be audited eventually why not try to get an incentive for it. He makes 60,000+ annually, which adds up to be a lot of taxes after three years.

      "description": "AITA? June 1st, ’15, my bf of 6 weeks had a heart attack (I had known him for 3 yrs at that point). We were living in Central America and just getting him to the first hospital for a diagnosis was a crazy trip (he was diagnosed there as having a massive heart attack) . Then he had to be transported through the Central American mountains to the other side of the country to a different hospital so he could be stabilized for 5 days so he can (hopefully) be safely transported to the US for heart surgery.\nI took him (it was against his will, I had to fight him) to the first hospital and followed him to the second hospital and stayed in a hostel for 4 days. I went back to where we were living to clean up and pack our luggage for the trip back to the US. I texted him when I got back saying I was so fucking exhausted I could barely stand up, could I please have one night to sleep. He texted me back saying I had to clean and pack and if I wasn’t on the 9am flight to Panama City the next morning, I will be responsible for his death. So I stayed up and did what I had to do and was on the 9am flight.\nWhile we were on the plane I asked him where his daughter was picking us up at, Harrisburg or Philly? He said she’s picking us up in Tampa and she’s driving us to a resort in Orlando bcs that is where she is on vacation with his grandkids.\nI thought he was fucking joking. He told me his daughter is a nurse. No nurse would pick someone up in Tampa and drive them all the way to fucking Orlando knowing they were being stabilized after a massive heart attack (his left ventricle was completely blocked, it’s called a Widow Maker). Well, that is exactly what she did. She had him singing karaoke, took him to the Golden Corral…for 3 fucking dayssss. I won’t get into the horrific craziness we had to go through getting him from Philly to central PA.\nWe make it to central PA at 4am on a Monday morning, I wake him up at 8am and ask him what he wants to do. Im completely lost at that point, I’ve spent 4 days with a family that just didn’t care about him. He says he wants to go to a clinic, I should’ve demanded a hospital but I didn’t, I don’t know why. We go to the clinic and they book him an appointment for Wednesday, why I didn’t walk up to that counter and demand an ambulance, I don’t know why. \nWe get back to her house at 10:30 am, everyone is still sleeping, not one of those people got up to see if their Dad/Pappy went to a Dr/hospital/clinic, nothing, they left it to a perfect stranger to do.\nWhen she did get up and was informed about a Wednesday appt, it didn’t bother her, remember, she is a nurse, I am not.\nWhat did bother her was her DISGUSTING neon green outdoor pool and her DISGUSTING backyard, so she walked her dad and I around her backyard pointing out all the crap that needs to be done bcs she’s having a pool party on Friday. I thought she was fucking joking, she wasn’t, she was serious about me and her dad getting her pool and yard clean.\nI went and laid on one of his granddaughter’s beds and “internetted” while he spent 2 days cleaning the pool and the yard. Wednesday rolls around, I get him back to the clinic and when they realized what his situation really was, there was an ambulance there in less than 10 minutes. He went into emergency heart surgery and 2 stents were placed in him.\nThey let him out the next day after informing us everything he was to do. So the next couple days I have him outside on little walks and car drives, but his phone won’t stop blowing up. It’s his daughter and she is PISSED we’re not in the house. These people watch TV all day. It doesn’t matter if it’s nice out, they don’t go out. So Im thinking maybe she thinks Im over exercising her dad?\nThird morning after heart surgery I wake up to banging. I walk down the hall and there he is in one of his granddaughter’s bedrooms knocking down a wall. I’ll never forget looking into that room and seeing his daughter’s gigantic ass standing behind him with her hands on her hips while he’s bent over and about to pick up 2, 20-30lb buckets of drywall and walk them down a narrow, one and a half story set of stairs, through the foyer, heave the buckets shoulder height into the bed of a truck and then go repeat it about 50xs!!! I pushed her giant ass aside, grabbed the fucking buckets and did it all myself. I didn’t know those people, I shouldn’t have to labor for them. I’ve done practically everything in my power to keep her dad alive and she’s doing her best to fucking kill him.\nWhen we finally left, I was so angry and they all knew it.\nA year and a half later he needs to go back for shoulder surgery, I go with him bcs I don’t trust any of those people to take care of him properly. While I was there, things were better. His grandchildren weren’t demanding sandwiches; “Pappy, make me a sandwich Im hungry”. No please, no thank you, nothing and Im Canadian, this shit doesn’t fly with me. I  told him that he needs to stop his granddaughters from talking to him like that, they need to use their manners, especially with their grandfather!!! He told me that wasn’t his job, his job was to spoil them. That first visit I finally had enough and I confronted them, told them if they don’t stop demanding things from him and if they want something they better use their manners or they’ll be dealing with me, not him. So the girls were amazing the second visit/stay, please and thank you’s every time, I was (and still am) very proud of them. I even started feeling better about his daughter.\nFlash forward 6 months and we’re getting married (I’m still hoping I did the right thing, ugh). The day before the wedding his daughter starts to apologize and then explain her outrageous and dangerous behaviors from the first visit. I stop her and tell her it’s ok and gave her a hug. I did it only bcs it was the day before my wedding and there would’ve been nothing she could’ve said to make what she did better, in fact there was a huge chance she’d just piss me off more and I didn’t want to risk it.\nSo everything is going pretty great, we buy an RV and moved back to North America last spring. We agreed to help his daughter put in a second bathroom and clean and rebuild their nasty backyard. On our way there she sends us pics of the area they want the bathroom, they’ve already knocked down the walls and starting the reno. We were so proud they were finally taking the initiative themselves. We get there and….she knocked down half her fucking house. She knew no one agreed to that, you could see it on her face when she led us through her house.We had plans, we had an important wedding to go to, we were supposed to go to Maine, what we agreed to would’ve taken a month, at the most 6 weeks. He labored 6 days a week, 6-10hr days for 4 MONTHS. I didn’t go, I didn’t agree to any of that shit and I wasn’t doing it. He couldn’t let his grandchildren live in that and I understood.\nI made it clear to the children that I adore them (they know their mom is a pyscho, they’ve made that very clear to me) and they know and believe it. But I will not speak to his daughter anymore, not casually, there needs to be a definitive reason why she needs to speak with me. I will also not go back to PA with him. They are all invited here, even her, our RV is huge with 2 bathrooms and it sleeps eight comfortably. But Im not going near her on her turf ever again.\nNow my husband and his daughter think I am an outrageous asshole, there is even talk of divorce (from him, not me).",

      "title": "AITA for not desiring marriage with my SO of 10 years?",
      "description": "Posting on my throwaway because I don't want to risk this getting found by my SO.\n\nA little backstory which may or may not be relevant to your judgment.  Every single member of my extended family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc) has had at least one divorce.  My own mother married three times, each marriage lasting no longer than a few years.  We had to uproot our lives each time a marriage went sour and move to a new school district.  I'm a little disenchanted (and bitter) with the idea of marriage.  From my perspective, marriage just represents the beginning of the long drawn out process of death of a relationship, and potentially the ruin of lives.\n\nSee, my mom and my dad were perfectly happy before getting married, from the stories I've heard it was the best time of either one's lives.  Then they got married, had me, and split.  I don't know the full story of why this happened, and I don't really want to know, it's not my business. I was still a baby when they broke it off, so I never even got to develop the memory of a happy, whole family.  My earliest memories are of being handed off for visitation with my dad once every two weekends. After the divorce, my father was a broken man.  He was never truly happy again.  He remarried and stayed in that marriage for around 20 years but was never actually happy with his life.  Eventually he hit rock bottom, developed a meth habit, his wife left him, and he died penniless and a broken man.\n\nNow I'm a grown man, I've been with my SO for about a decade.  She has been dropping heavy hints (read: basically demanding) that she wants to get married.  I can't really blame her.  In the time that we've been together, I know several couples who have met, gotten married, and had children.  Her parents are still together and she didn't have the bitter experience I did growing up, so the idea of marriage is still sacred and magical to her.  Her mom recently was diagnosed with leukemia, which is under control, but it has really kindled my SO's desire to get married, so her mom can be present at the wedding.  Despite this, I'm still dragging my feet because it feels like I now have a time limit to do something I really don't see the point of.  I mean, does our relationship really mean anything less than a married couple's, just because they got the state to recognize their union?  We've been together 10 years, many (most?) marriages last way less than that.\n\nI haven't really opened up to her about how I feel about marriage, because I know it would probably break her heart to find out that I'm 100% apathetic to the idea.  So does this make me an asshole?",

      "description": "Bit long so skip to the tl:dr if you want.\n\nSo me (22) and my gf (21) were chilling in the living room watching TV and she initiated sex - recently I had lost attraction to her because of her weight gain so I just wasn't in the mood for it at that moment.\n\nThe loss of attraction was because she wouldn't make an honest effort to work on it and ignored my advice (only given when she asked). It was a constant cycle of:\n\n**Her**: \"I need to lose weight\"\n\n**Me**: \"Why don't you try this?\" (said in a nice sincere way)\n\n**Her**: \"Ok\" and then she wouldn't try, and she would gain more - doing obvious things she know's or I have said isn't helpful (again, I would mention these things only when she asked and in a gentle way) like constant snacking.\n\nAt the start, she wasn't like this and it's been a noticeable difference: maybe 40 lbs gained. She constantly mentioned it to the point where I started influencing the way I saw her: at first I wasn't bothered, then I started to notice and be bothered more and more. Even so, I always said honest positive comments where I could and never negative ones.\n\nSo back to when we were chilling watching TV, she then says \"I know I don't look how I used to so I get it if the attraction isn't the same or you've lost some to me\" to which I replied: \"Yeah I guess things have changed, but that's not why though I'm just not in the mood, and regardless I want you to know I still love you and will always support you, you're still beautiful\". In my head I was like, she's opening up and being honest and we can work through it.\n\nNope, the next few days she literally shut down and started blaming me for making her feel bad, saying she can't believe I said that to her, and how sick she felt that I would say that. How she feels horrible now looking at herself and thinks I've told everyone I know that she's fat. How it's mean as she's trying her best. I apologized again and reiterated how much I love her and I'm still attracted just like she said it's changed a bit. This happened months ago and she still brings it up and says it was really hurtful I said that and still affects her.\n\nI believe that honesty is important in a relationship and I didn't want to lie about something that I knew we both realized. Am I the asshole in this situation?\n\n**tl:dr:** My girlfriend brought up that she knows the attraction between us has changed because she's put on weight, I agreed with her in a sincere way still saying I loved her and she's still beautiful and now she's blaming me for saying that and saying it's hurt her really bad and she feels awful now looking at herself despite me always supporting her, never mentioning her weight and trying my best to help her lose weight when she asked me for advice (which she ignored).

      "description": "This is a pretty long story so I’ll try and make it short. \n\nGirlfriend of three years, things are cool til she cheats and we take a break. After awhile and a lot of talking, we get back together. \n\nThree months in, she loses her job and is doing grubhub and uber, but barely because she is kind of lazy and won’t do anything unless schedules. Behind on rent, owing 5k to her car that is on the repo list, asking me for all the kind of help that I can give.\n\nI eventually get her a job at my pizza place as a driver/cook. She is now able to pay rent and can afford to live because she works a livable schedule. \n\nTwo months in she starts seriously turning her bipolar to 11, including mental and physical abuse to me. This is not new to me but never had I seen it this bad and I hadn’t don’t anything to provoke her. She is like this for a month and then flips it on me and tells me I am not loving her the same, when I am truly trying my hardest and trying to get her to a stable place in life but anytime I am near her or try and ask her what is wrong, it only seemed to fuel some fire. I got three black eyes in one month just from being near her during these manic moods. \n\nShe starts closing and getting home really late, not telling me where she is, and showing the obvious signs. Through some light PI work I asked my coworkers what was up, and they said she was leaving with one of the other drivers. One look at texts on her front screen confirmed that she was seeing a guy from our work. \n\nI have worked there for a year and got her the job because she would ask me for money and help, and figured it would be easy enough to keep her stable. Little did I know she would flip it on me that hard. \n\nI politely asked her to please transfer to a different store because this is not okay, and she said she would file for harassment and get me fired if I tried to do anything to get her transferred (I know she can’t tho like wtf). It took me all of my restraint to not call her repo company then. \n\nRecently, she decided to blow my phone up about how she wants aderall from my friend who she knows it is prescribed to. I told her he didn’t sell it or give any away and that she was referring to a one time thing where he shared with us. \n\nAfter telling her no a few times, she starts endlessly calling me and texting me, threatening to go to my house to break my windows, find my car, go to my parents house, etc whatever she can do to fuck my life up or my family’s life up because she “knows I am holding it from her” when this is the most out-of-left-field shit I have ever heard. \n\nAfter calling the nonemergency number, asking them to check on my house because I was at work, I realized it was a scare tactic. But I was at work actually freaking out having to run around calling the cops to make sure my house was okay. \n\nAfter asking her one last time to please leave the job that I got her to another store in the franchise (which is very simple) and her refusing and threatening me once more, I have decided to call the repo company update her address. They have been to my parents house and my house looking for her so it will not take long for her car to be gone. \n\nThanks for hearing me out and I really just need some peer evaluation to know whether or not I’m a prick. I would wait until after Christmas too lol. \n\n\nAlso, I would move stores myself but I am a driver also and the tips in my area are astronomically higher (I know through experience) than other areas so moving is basically a demotion.

      "description": "During this winter, a friend of mine and I talked about how we both love playing volleyball and we should go play when it gets warmer on several occasions.\n\nLast week, I saw her playing with other people from school on her Ig story, she actually had called me that day to see me at school but I was already at home, so she knew I was free.\nShe casually mentioned this event afterwards, saying this is the 2nd time she played with them and intending to do so again. I somehow got the sense that she only mentions this bc I already saw it on Ig and there is no way of hiding. These are the people I know of so she could have invited me with no problem. \n\nI got upset but figured no one ows me anything and this person showed me she is a good friend on different occasions before so I will let it go. \nBut natually, I can't act the same way I used to with her. Last week I didn't see her at all, it's not diffucult to avoid since our schedules are different and when I see her I can't help but feel cold to her and she realizes something is off. AITA for feeling and behaving this way? ",

      "description": "I met someone who seems to have a messiah complex. Every conversation with him turns into how much they help people, and they brag about how much he does help. One time they texted me just to say he’s tired because he’s been fixing the relationship of a couple and talked about how good he is at helping. It’s getting annoying as fuck. Yesterday I asked why he doesn’t just become a psychologist or a therapist but they went on about how those people don’t care like he does and they’re just in it for a pay check. He also criticized anti depressants and how they just give them to anyone that walks in. And that’s when I snapped and argued how they do help and how anti depressants save lives. That went on for a while with him just making things up and I guess he didn’t realize I’ve studied this topic as well as have gone through the process. After a while he gave up and said “well I asked for a note and they said I’m severely depressed when I was only kinda sad so they gave me pills without asking more questions” which I called out since he said before that he was depressed a while back and got on meds that helped. Which annoyed me even more. \n\nTLDR a guy with a messiah complex claimed to be better than professionals educated in psychotherapy, I finally snapped and called him out so AITA",

      "description": "Me and my gf live together.  She is going on a work trip out of state.  She leaves Sunday and returns Wednesday. We were talking about her travel plans as I was anticipating I would be driving her to the airport. The airport is about 75mins from our home. \n\nShe told me her flight back on Wednesday would arrive at 4:00pm. That means I would have to leave work a couple hours early to be there to pick her up. I wasn’t sure of my schedule on Wednesday and if I had anything that would prevent me from leaving early. As I was thinking about it, I realized that this is a work trip for her. So she could expense any overnight parking expenses. So I asked her why she doesn’t drive herself, because it wouldn’t cost her anything and then I don’t have to worry about leaving work early. \n\nThis upset her. I could tell she did not like that idea.  It was one of the few times we have had a disagreements where we think the other person is being totally unreasonable. She said that driving herself and figuring out parking and trying to time it out causes her anxiety. It’s obviously easier for her if I drive her and can drop her off right at the terminal. She also knows that I would probably be able to adjust my work schedule without much effort. \n\nI think it’s unreasonable to ask me to drive 2.5 hrs round trip each day and leave work early when she can drive herself and park for free.  I’ve driven her to the airport numerous times but those were always personal trips. It makes sense to me to drive her to save $100+ dollars on parking.  Asking me to inconvenience myself in this way just doesn’t make sense.  She is not a particularly anxious person, so I understand it would cause her some stress, but it’s not going to cause a panic attack or serious distress. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? ",

When we get home, I help her to carry all (Or most) of the shopping upstairs to the kitchen for her.\n\nThis time however, instead of quickly dumping my school bag and other things inside and going back outside to help, I walked inside and put my stuff away (maybe took half a minute).

      "description": "So I am an Aupair in Germany from the Texas and the family I work for is having me use one of their very expensive bikes (almost $2000) to get around. I haven't used bikes much before because my hometown was unbikeable and unwalkable. The most my bike has cost was around $150 from Target and we always left ours out because we lived a safe rural area. I knew the bike I was using was expensive and was trying to be careful with it. I always made sure to lock ect. I also made it clear to my host parents that I knew how to ride a bike but had not used bikes much because of the hometown situation. I never learned that locking a bike around the front tire was one of the worst places to lock a bike. Generally I do lock around the body of the bike but there was very little room to park my bike in the rack and I could only fit in the front tire and locked it. We came back to the busy street where it was parked only to find the tire left behind and I freaked out. Luckily my friend spotted two sketchy guys down the road and I ran towards them. They quickly biked off and I found the rest of the bike left hidden behind the wall. We made it back home safe and with the bike. My host dad seemed understanding and didn't blame me because he told me to take that bike and the area is generally safe. Others in the family were very upset with me and treating me like I was an idiot and that it was all my fault because I locked the bike around the front tire as if this is knowledge everyone has. No one ever told me how to properly lock it. I have learned not to do that again, but I feel like they are upset with me and putting a lot of the blame on me. My friend who is also a nanny with the family was with me when I locked it and didn't say anything. I don't know what do you guys think?",

      "description": "So, I've been seeing this person for over a month and I've noticed several red flags in terms of her laughing AT me when I say something dumb and brushing me off in favor of friends. Last night, we had plans to see each other at 7:30 PM. When I showed up at her place, she was talking on the phone with her friend. After giving her a kiss, I sat on the couch and read a book as she washed dishes in the kitchen with her friend on speaker phone. I sat on the sidelines for a little over 30 minutes, getting gradually more and more annoyed that I was being ignored, but also telling myself that it's okay because my girlfriend was just being a good friend, etc.\n\nFinally, after 30 minutes, my girlfriend tells her friend, \"I've got to let you go because I've got some company over.\" I'm happy because at last she acknowledged me, but then I hear her side of the conversation go like this, \"Don't worry about it. It's okay. Ha, bros before...what's the female equivalent...AHAHAHAHAHAHA (loud laughter that seems to go on forever).\n\nThen she finally hangs up and comes over to sit by me on the couch and I tell her that I thought her comment (basically saying, 'bros before hos' and laughing about it) to her friend was rude and she tells me that it's just an expression and proceeds to say that SHE is the one who should be offended because I would take her words so personally and think that she was trying to belittle me and that she was just trying to have some fun with her friend who was going through relationship problems.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I have a really rocky relationship with my mom. She left when I was 6, married another guy and moved to a different country and left me with my dad. As you can probably tell, this messed me up for a long time and I’m only now starting to get over it (i’m 20 now).\n\nI don’t want to have anything to do with my mom, she basically abandoned me for a man and only talked to me once every few years. The last time we talked (2 years ago) we got into a big argument and I told her to never call or message me again. I consider my stepmom that my dad married shortly after she left as more than a mom than her. \n\nRecently I had a cousin around my age on my mom’s side (her sisters daughter) that lives in America contact me on Facebook. I thought this was strange since I never met her before and am unsure of how she found my Facebook, but I accepted her request. She said she wanted to get to know me since I was one of the only cousins on our side that was around her age. We added each other on Snapchat, instagram etc. and she seemed okay, I didn’t initially really have much reason to worry.\n\nThe other day I thought about it all and I figured that maybe she was acting on behalf of my mom and it pissed me off. Of course I don’t have proof but I feel like that’s how she got my Facebook, and that’s why she’s trying to get to know me. I got scared that she was saying everything that I told her to my mom. I blocked her off every social media platform on a whim but now I’m wondering if I made the right choice. I didn’t even ask for an explanation or let her her know that I don’t want her to contact me, I just blocked her. But at the same time I really don’t want anything to do with my mom and if that means I have no contact with everyone on her side then I guess that’s what it’ll have to be. But AITA?\n\n\n",

      "description": "I'm a 23 year old mom to a five year old daughter. I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.",

The expiration of the Groupon is 180 days after purchase, so there's no rush to book the event, in my mind.

And, due to work and other small responsibilities of life, I haven't brought it up with her again yet in order to figure out a day (she runs a restaurant and is generally always busy with something, juggling a dozen things - I'm not so keen on that, and prefer to tackle one thing at a time, or at least not juggle multiple things if I don't have to). \n\nFive days after the email, she forwarded me an email that she sent to them, asking about what other availability they had. About a half hour after that, she forwarded another one saying they called her and so she tentatively booked the day for the Friday after this coming one. She asked if that day worked for me and I said yes. In her response, she tossed a passive aggressive \"Great. Although you were supposed to book this.\" \n\nAnd, for the rest of the evening, she's been cold and dismissive. My attempts to call her (just to ask how her evening was) were ignored, and when she finally texted me at midnight (when she goes to bed), she said let's talk tomorrow. I said okay, love you. She responded \"OK thanks\". I then asked her what was wrong, and over an hour later she said she'd call me after a party she's attending tomorrow. \n\nSo, am I an asshole for not immediately booking an event that didn't need to be booked immediately, and that we wouldn't have even been able to attend for weeks? I said I would take care of it and I absolutely would have, except I feel she didn't give me a reasonable amount of time to do so, and didn't state any expectations in regards to how quickly she wanted me to book it. \n\n**TL;DR** Girlfriend asked me to book an event for a Friday that worked for me. Five days later, she booked it herself and got upset with me since this was something I was supposed to do. She feels I didn't do what I said I would, and I feel she didn't give me enough time, especially since there wasn't a need to rush to book the event.",

My husband thinks she is gonna go bananas when she sees it as nobody else in the family would get her stuff like this.\n\nI was waiting to get paid to buy it but my aunt called me yesterday and said “I know you so if you’re spending on your cousin please buy her something useful”... \n\nWIBTA if I get my cousin the record player anyways?

After not talking for a week or two she gave him my number and he texted me. We got along okay and decided to meet up while he was at work. He works as a security guard at a hotel at night so he doesnt do much but sit in the car and sorta monitor the area. \n       Basically he keeps texting me to drive over (mind you this is a bit far up in my city front where I live). He knew I also wasnt entirely enthused to do so because of my nosey grandparents, but I went anyway.\n       So I get there and text him 5 times; where I am and that I'm there. Absolutely nothing. I had to get home before my grandparents got suspicious (yes I'm over 18) and he knew that but still no reply. So after 10 to 15 minutes I left. And of course halfway through my drive he starts calling and texting me and asking if I'm still there. \n       I know circumstantially something could of happened but why wouldnt he tell me? On top of that he knew that this was time sensitive and the 5 times I text him while I'm there he didnt respond! Was he wrong to not text me the reason as to why he left me hanging for succ a long while knowing I couldnt stay long, or am I the asshole who just left too early?",

She does laundry and not even lying has the audacity to tell me Happy Birthday while texting on her phone and leaves without ever saying Hi or bye. I gotta tell you my biggest pet peeve is people not being polite. She leaves and before she does I tell her she is a rude and disgusting human being. I work at a computer store and she comes in and tells me she needs a cpu for her work computer. She doesn't even acknowledge her rude behavior and I refuse to give her service and ask a coworker to give her service. I was told by my brother that this is bad and immature behavior.

      "description": "I'm writing this on a throwaway bc I'm pretty sure my main account is pretty easy to trace back to me, which I'd rather not happen. Also I'm on mobile so apologies for any formatting mistakes. TLDR at the end. \n\nI'm one of seven kids, and my mum walked out on the family shortly after my youngest sister was  born 18 years ago. Mum was very young herself at this point, only in her mid 20s and her reasoning for walking out was that being a mother was holding her back from achieving her full potential - by which she apparently meant kids were an inconvenience to her desired party lifestyle of heavy drinking and drug use almost daily. During my childhood she constantly flipped between relatively regular visits and contact with us to us not hearing a word from her for weeks or even months on end. My dad is far too nice for his own good and never made any attempt to block us from seeing her, even encouraging us to give her a chance every time she pretended she wanted to get sober because \"she's your mother guys, at least let her try.\" \n\nThing is, even when she was present, she was a terrible mother. She was constantly either drunk or high when \"caring\" for us and was incredibly manipulative and emotionally abusive. She was also occasionally physically abusive and regularly dated men who were incredibly violent, both towards her and towards us. One guy even put one of my brothers in the hospital - and mum went on to marry him not even a year later. \n\nThe thing that really broke any semblance of a bond for me was what happened when I was a young teen. Between the ages of 11-13, my brother and I pretty much lived at her place about 80% of the time - back then she insisted it was because she just wanted us there but looking back it was more likely so she could claim child benefit. At this time she was in a houseshare with some family friends who were a married couple. Over the course of my time living there, this couple pretty horrendously sexually abused me. This would happen every night that mum was not at the house (read: Almost every single night). When I finally got the courage to tell about it, my mother sided with my abusers, her reasoning being that a) she knew them very well and *she* didn't think they'd do that, b) my brother wasn't abused by them and she couldn't see why they would only do it to me and not also him and c) they said they didn't and they'd never lied to her before and I had - by which she meant there were a couple occasions in the past I had said that I felt unwell to get the day off school when I really felt fine. She even went so far as to defend this couple in court. \n\nUnsurprisingly this whole ordeal really screwed me up and my teenage years were a mess of alcoholism, crimes and heroin addiction. I cleaned myself up around 20-21 because I couldn't go on hurting my dad and grandparents the way I was. I'm now 25, have been fully sober for almost four years and haven't spoken to my mother in six. I'm happy now, in a very healthy long term relationship with the man of my dreams and on the right path to having my dream job.\n\n However, at the start of December my mum started trying to get involved with my siblings and I again. I informed her through my sister that I had no intention of ever having anything to do with her again and, aside from a few failed attempts to reach me through my boyfriend, she seemed to accept it at first. All three of my sisters and one of my brothers seemed willing to forgive her and forget what she did right away. Of my two other brothers, one was cautiously optimistic and treading lightly in approaching a potential new relationship with her. The other was the one who was hospitalised by her husband and was on the same page as me with staunchly refusing to have anything to do with her. \n\nHowever, around three weeks ago, my mother revealed she has lung cancer and has been informed that she's unlikely to see the end of this year. She said she wants to rebuild a relationship with all of her children while she still has the time and even the brother who was on my side seems to be giving her a chance. She has repeatedly acknowledged that she \"wasn't the best mother\", however she refuses to actually apologise and won't acknowledge that she was in the wrong for siding with my abusers. She still insists that I \"blew it all out of proportion\", though she admits she no longer thinks I made it up completely. To be honest, even if she did apologise - while I would definitely be grateful and would accept the apology - I don't think I could ever forgive her for turning her back on me like that, and I have no interest in having any kind of relationship with her or attending her funeral when she does pass away. \n\nMy siblings and some other family members are starting to get fed up with my refusal to have anything to do with my mum and are insisting I'm in the wrong for denying a dying woman her last wish. AITA for not wanting to repair something that's beyond broken? \n\n*TLDR: my mother - who was emotionally abusive throughout my childhood and sided with a couple who raped me on multiple occasions - has lung cancer with a very short prognosis and wants to repair her relationship with me and my siblings. I have no interest in doing so and am being made to feel like the bad guy for it.*\n",

My Dad re-married to a woman who's not outright terrible but is very preachy and tries hard to bring up things. Lacks tact really. She'll ask you why you're not having any more kids in the middle of Christmas dinner.  \n\n\nI've been going to family functions for my entire life thus far and I was hoping my family would abandon a lot of the less desirable aspects of both my own and our family's past, and not bring up a few of my own shortcomings in life; but every family function on either side devolves into discussion on the past and shortcomings. It doesn't feel healthy to me.  \n\n\nSo this Christmas I consciously decided not to go to any Christmas functions with my family. I already have had a stressful year and just feeling like I would have to contend with these things just made me anxious and uncomfortable.  \n\n\nThey all took this as I expected. I've been picked apart for not going and they're calling me an asshole. I explained in a more polite way that I didn't want to be in a situation where these things would be brought up, but they don't seem to understand.

      "description": "This happened a little over a week ago. I've been seeing a woman I met on tinder for casual sex. This has been going on and off, for five months. She is not my girlfriend, and she knows that. I am not her boyfriend. I see other women besides her.\n\nEarly on, she kept trying to lead us into a relationship by asking me to attend dinners or visit her recital or come to a friends art show. None of this interests me, I explain that to her. She is very competent at sex, and in addition to having a great body she is also very submissive which I enjoy since I am dominant.\n\nHowever, despite me laying down these ground rules, she introduced me as her boyfriend when I arrived to pick her up at a friends house. Not wanting to embarrass her and ruin the sex later on I don't protest, but then I confront her after the fact. She said she didn't know what to call me.\n\nI let it go, but I start seeing her less and less frequently, and she texts me that shes misses me. I ignore it.\n\nThree weeks ago I started to officially date my bosses daughter. She is motivated, classy, attractive, and it doesn't hurt to have an in with your boss. I announce this on my facebook which she ((the tinder girl) sees.\n\nShe texts me asking why I told her a few weeks before that I wasn't interested in a relationship, and why I'm ignoring her. I tell her honestly that she has made me upset with her clinginess, and that she is not a \"girlfriend\" type to me. I then told her not to contact me again, and that I would contact her if I wanted to get back in touch.\n\nShe said ok, but that I was being very mean to her and that I'm being abusive. Why would you want to fuck me if im abusive? Why call me if im abusive? She says to please call her as she misses me.\n\nFor now I'm cutting her off.\n\nAm I the asshole.",

      "description": "My friend and I went out last night to meet our usual friends. I usually pick him up and drop him off whenever we go anywhere because his car is broken. I dont mind it, he lives close by anyway. Not once have I asked him to pay for gas or pay for anything of mine. This time I asked for gas money because I was borrowing my dads car and he wanted me to pay him for gas and he offered 5 bucks which didnt even pay for the gas we used, but I was cool with it.\n\nWe went out and discovered that we had to pay for parking which was 5 bucks. I didnt have cash or debit card on me to get out cash and it's a cash lot. If I did have cash on me I would pay it no problem, you got gas, I'll get parking. So I told him to get it and he goes \"no that is not what was agreed upon. I'm sorry but I didnt agree to pay for this. If I'm getting gas you have to get parking.\" Well neither did I, and if I knew we had to pay for parking I would have bought cash, but I didnt. So I told him that I dont have cash or a debit card so I cant pay. He doesnt have cash on him but does have a debit card, but he reiterates adding he has bills to pay. \n\nThis dude makes 53k a year, and I never ask him for anything but this one time I asked him to spot me, he tells me no. Anyway I tell him \"dude it's not like this is an everyday thing. If I had the money I would pay it, but I dont so either we drive home and you give me gas money or you pay for parking and we meet our friends.\" Its like literally 10 bucks total that I'm asking him to pay, literally not breaking the bank. \n\nAnyway he refuses so we look around and we find street parking and we park there, and I'm a little tense and keep worrying about my car because I'm not 100% sure if were able to park there, I actually went to check on the car while we went from one bar to another to make sure I didnt get a ticket. (Btw while we were at the club he bought a drink. I think its oddly suspicious if you throw such a fit over 5 bucks because you dont have the funds, but buy yourself a 10 dollar drink. That made me realize that he did have money but he didnt want to help me out even though I needed it). \n\nI never do favors to get anything back, and had I had the cash, I would have paid for parking myself no problem no questions asked because that's just how I am. But the one time I asked him to spot me he says he can't because \"he didnt agree to this\". It makes me realize that if he could help me out, he wouldn't, meanwhile, I go out of my way to help him out. Now that hes done this I'm rethinking the limits of my friendship with him, and I want to stop giving him rides because of what I realized. \n\nNow redditors, am I the asshole for asking a friend to pay for parking and gas? And would I be the asshole if I stopped giving him rides because of this? ",

I’m still pretty young (high school) and I don’t believe there are “serious relationships” at my age\n\nSo a quick backstory. The night before of this I was going through a really bad breakdown so I decided to text him. He skipped over my texts and said he really tired and wanted to sleep. I felt a little bit hurt that he didn’t seem to care so I talked to my friend who I call my brother ( this is important later). He made me feel better enough to get it together and calm down. \n\n  Anyway the next day my bf apologizes for falling asleep. I was still a bit mad at him so I brushed him off for a while but finally caved in and talked to him. He asked me if I was ok and I told him I was fine and that I talked it out with my brother. He got really mad at me for calling my friend that. He said something about my friend that was just messed up so I snapped. I broke up with him on the spot and left to go home. He later texted me apologizing and sending me pity texts so I just ignored him.  Now he’s just threatening both of us and accusing me of cheating (which I didn’t do). Am I the asshole for dumping him?",

      "description": "I’ve know my friend [F15] four three years now and have in the past year been distancing myself. I love her, but she gets me really down.\n\nTo start off, let’s call her Jen. She’s always struggled with mental health and depression, but has gotten worse with time. She goes to the psychologist, but doesn’t have much support from family and isn’t having much progress.\n\nShe doesn’t really have any friends except for me and can get really clingy. The thing is, I struggle with my own mental health issues and try to surround myself with as much positivity as possible. Jen is a very negative person. Whenever I go to talk to her she’ll start talking about her problems at home or how she hates life and everything is horrible. It’s all she talks about. She complains about being ignored by the rest of the class, but when people try talking to her she’s always on her phone and gets pissed off with them. Being around her really drains me mentally because it’s constant complaining.\n\nThe breaking point was at my quinceañera (15th birthday) last march. As a Latina, it’s supposed to be one of the most important days of my life and my family had spent lots of money planning the party. Jen managed to ruin the night for me. She continuously complained about the music, criticizing the genre (salsa, merengue, etc), said it was boring and insisted I stayed at her side the whole night. She sat with a group of friends from school at one table and I was at another with my family. She spoke with none of the girls and several of them told me she was acting weird. I tried dancing several times in the night, but she’d start glooming. Towards the end, when most guest had left and she was still present because she’d be sleeping over at my house, she asked my sister “when are we leaving this hellhole.”  I ended up crying. To this day, I get so angry when I think back to that night. My parents know I didn’t enjoy what was supposed to be a great party  and they think it’s because it wasn’t big enough and they should’ve spent more money. \n\nThe reason I continue trying is because she often says I’m her only true friend and I don’t want to leave someone who’s struggling with depression. People say it’s important to support them and to turn your back on them in their darkest times is wrong. But, she’s affecting my own mental state. I don’t know what to do. \n",

The first friend is someone I used to smoke weed with all the time. Ever since I stopped smoking, we barely hang out. He recently started to get into cocaine, and has become very toxic, angry, and critical. We used to be really good frinds, but I don't really want anything to do with him at this point. I've made it very clear that I don't think he should be doing coke, but he seems to think there's nothing wrong with it.\n\nThe second friend is someone I used to play video games with almost every day. Online, not in person. We started playing about 2 years ago. He used to tell me things like \"oh it's so nice to have someone to game with\". But ever since he found other friends to game, he literally never does anything with me. He still texts me stupid video game news and whatnot though. I recently blocked his number and deleted him off my friends list. I did this because I actually get really angry when I see him playing with other people. Only because he never plays with me anymore. But part of me feels really bad for doing this. AITA for doing this?\n\nThe third friend is someone I've known my entire life. He really is a nice guy, but about a year ago he started streaming on twitch. Now he barely does anything with me. I definitely let it get to me way too much, but it's like pulling teeth to get him to hang out. He clearly cares about streaming more than our friendship, even though we've been best friends our entire life. AITA for wanting to give up and just not talk to him anymore. If I do this I'm not gonna have any friends.\n\nSorry if the formatting is bad. I'm typing this out on my phone",

Given my shitty day, I vow to myself then and there that I’m not giving up my seats to these two shit heads.\n\nI start asking to see their tickets, while standing in the middle of the theatre. They are pretending to be really confused. They say there are still seats left. But I’m not letting up. My friends are suggesting that we just go see another movie.\n\nI’m making a scene now and this guy is now swearing at me, telling me to fuck off. I keep asking to see his ticket so we can dispel this confusion, all while giant robots are being torn apart by awesome fucking Kaijus.

      "description": "Tl;dr My bf won't talk to me after I became hurt that he was frustrated with me for leaving our front door unlocked. It's been two hours. AITA?\n\n\nYou all do such good work here, so maybe you can help me out in seeing this situation clearly.\n\n\nThe details: \n\n\nMy bf (of five years and we're both early 30s) had a rough day at work today, everything seemed to be going wrong for him, and he lost money because of it. He called me while he was on his way home and we talked it out for a while. He seemed upset and disappointed, but this sort of thing has happened before and he usually bounces back, so I assumed our chat had done all that it could to support him in the situation and everything would be okay after some time had passed.\n\n\nBefore work I planned all of our meals for the week, then I went to work, and went grocery shopping after work, and then made dinner for us. My bf is struggling for cash right now, and as I have a steady job, I've been pretty much paying for everything for the last couple of months.\n\n\nAnyway, my bf came home and got frustrated with me for leaving our door unlocked and leaving some things out, and didn't want to eat the dinner I made him. I felt a little hurt by his snapping frustrations, but didn't initially say anything because I knew he was having a rough day, and me being upset would make it worse. We then got into a slight disagreement about how he handled some of his work things. He could tell I was a bit annoyed so he repeatedly asked what was up, and I eventually burst into tears and told him I was hurt that he didn't eat and that he was frustrated about me leaving the door unlocked etc. (Crying about something as small as this is somewhat typical for me, because I'm overly sensitive and confrontation pretty much always overwhelms me, but it's usually like a burst of tears and then I'm okay again. I'm working on this.)\n\n\nHe scoffed at me, went into another room, closed the door, and essentially hasn't talked to me since. I tried to tell him I totally get that his day sucked and that I wasn't like, super upset, just a little hurt and that it's not a big deal, and he still hasn't said anything despite me trying to explain myself. It's been two hours now. He's obviously mad at me, but AITA here? ",

We have had him for about 16 years since he was a kitten, my parents are divorced but he has always stayed with my mom. He’s got this stomach thing so he’s prone to throwing up if you feed him wrong but he rarely does now (every now and then he’ll have a really bad week and it’s an issue) but he’s had this for 90% of the time we’ve had him at the least. He also does normal cat things like being in birds and other small animals occasionally. Also he’s terrified of other people/animals. \n\nMy mom hates him, and much prefers her dog (that attacks me for trying to walk him. Every night. For the past 6 years... and she’s done nothing about... but that’s another thing) and while I’m gone visiting my dad in another state for 5 days she wants to board my. He is terrified of other people/animals and I feel that this is going to be unnecessarily stressful for him and it’s a waists of money that they (my mom and grandma) want me to pay for (that’s another post). She doesn’t want to deal with him and has said as much. But he’s really simple. If he’s being annoying just feed him and if he doesn’t want food check that the pet door is open and if it is just pet him for a few minutes and he’ll be fine. She doesn’t interact with him because she hates that he vomits and brings in dead things which is normal for cats. And she’s lived with him for 16 years. AITA for not wanting her to board him?",

      "description": "I'm 18 and I live on my own currently. I've been wanting to leave this state for a long time because it's not for me and I have disliked it since we moved here, and my mom fully supports that. \n\nShe says she \"wants me to do what makes me happy\" and that she'll love me no matter what. My dad was an asshole to her and he's also an alcoholic and a prescription addict so there's a lot of bad blood there and he's not been the greatest parent to me for the most part\n\nBut for a long time I've been talking about moving to Colorado and my mom hates that. My dad is originally from Littleton, Colorado(Denver area) and I've been there once with him. When I was 16, just me and my dad went for a father/son trip, and it was great. I was very depressed at the time and having a lot of problems but when I was just hanging out with my dad in Colorado and doing all kinds of fun shit, I forgot about it and I felt happy. \n\nMy mom insists that the Colorado trip was a bad memory, not a good one, because it was with my dad and he's a \"degenerate.\" Yeah my dad treated her badly and I don't like that. He wasn't there for me as much as he should've been and we don't see each other much now. I don't know how I feel about him but I'd like to go back and I don't consider the trip to be a bad memory at all, he acted like the dad I wished he could've been the rest of the time.\n\nShe also told me if I moved there, it would be the \"ultimate slap in the face\" to her because my dad almost didn't marry her since he was considering going back to Colorado to work as a ski instructor. All of her associations with the state are bad and she says \"don't expect me to ever visit you.\"\n\nIf I didn't move to Colorado, then I would move to Wyoming which is another place I really like. My mom's opposed to that too because \"funnily\" enough my dad lived there for a while. \n\nI'm not interested in these places just because of my dad and I'm not doing anything to spite my mother, I love her very much. I just want to live my own life but she's overprotective of me still, she feels like she has to over-manage me to make up for my dad.",

We are to toss it at the end of the week/ when it expires if we can't give it away. (We can't resell it, it's already been sold once.\n\nHere's the thing the give take can get over loaded. In one week we can have three bins heaping. It takes up space in the fridge we need and I am running short of bins to cook with. (Multi purpose bins that fit on a steam table.) Also my boss has been riding me about temps, making sure hot is hot and cold stays cold.\n\nAll this together means lately I've been dumping more into the trash rather than keeping it all. Anything not cool to the touch goes in the trash, most of the milks, and any cartons that have gone soggy with foreign moisture or sticky. I have been trying to keep it down to one bin. \n\nYesterday was a busy day, we are understaffed and I was already behind. It was a full bin, I rooted around to see if the cartons were warm came back with a sticky hand and just dumped the bin. I should have gone through it better but i was in a hurry. My boss texted after work asking about the bin and before I could answer my coworker tossed me under the bus with a series of texts that she wouldn't have sent if she knew it was a group message. Basically 'She dumped the whole thing, I was going to take some of the xxx out of it too but she just dumped it before I could get to it. Shed beed dumping them everyday lately, thought you knew.\"\n\nAm i the asshole here? My anxiety is through the roof over having to go to work and deal with this issue.",

He’s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it’s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He’s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He’s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it’s a completely different story. He’s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He’s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl’s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he’s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat’s worse is that I don’t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he’s not angry,so maybe that’s intimidating. But with me, it’s just a nightmare. I’ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he’s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn’t last long. He’s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it’s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI’m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don’t consider what I’m considering. I’ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI’m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I’m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. ",

      "description": "I have a close friend, who has been dating this guy  for about a year. They just recently moved in together and it's not all smooth sailing. Without going into too much personal detail, let's say there are some valid concerns she has about his behavior; in my opinion, he needs to address that to be a better boyfriend. Recently, they went away together on a trip, and he proposed! She accepted. We are meeting soon and I know that she WILL ask me my opinion on the whole thing. She always asks for my advice in such matters. I honestly think they are getting engaged too early into the relationship and that he wants to make sure she doesn't leave him while he has no intention to change those behaviors that she is not happy with. He is an ok guy overall (not an abuser, cheater, addict or any other awful thing that would warrant her dumping him). I do not want to rain on her parade, and I am not sure it's appropriate for me to tell her my real opinion. What do y'all think? Should I just not tell her anything that is on my mind? I don't want her to get offended or mad at me, but I am also used to being honest. Thanks in advance. ",

Nobody tried to help me out, and anytime I brought it up it was swept under the rug/the subject was changed. Occasionally my friends and boyfriend would say \"sorry, wish I could help\".

I stay up late to help him fall asleep, I wake up early to make sure he's eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I encouraged him to go to the doctor.\n\nHere's the thing though. I really resent all four of them. I hate that I had to battle through all of my depression and anxiety by myself while he's getting help from all of us.

      "description": "So awhile back, I met this guy while working at a local Red Lobster. As his waitress, we had small conversations but it was obvious that he was flirting with me. I'm not gonna lie, he was pretty cute so I decided to flirt back. He even left me a $30 tip with his number written on a small piece of paper. Now normally I'd ignore guys like him, but he seemed sort of interesting at the time. I gave the number a call, we talked for a bit and that was that. It took awhile, but eventually he asked me out. It was about a month into the relationship, he wants me to meet his family. They were lovely people, and this is how I ended becoming friends with his sister. I don't think we were ever close, but she was a really fun person to hang out with. Whenever I went on dates with my boyfriend, she'd tag along sometimes. He didn't seem to mind at all, and things were pretty sweet. Now, I won't go into too much detail of the abuse I experienced, but he did hit me. I still have the bruises on my back. He would call me constantly, wanting to know where I was and etc. Typical behavior of an abuser basically. I attempted to let his sister know, but he threatened to take my life if I did. So for a few months, I was trapped in this relationship, unable to escape. Me and his sister were still on good terms, but I slowly felt unsafe around her. I still don't know exactly why, but I'm guessing its because she was constantly around him. I felt like I couldn't talk to her without feeling like he was there. My mental health suffered drastically, and every time she asked what was wrong I'd just say that I wasn't feeling well. Eventually, I got a really good job offer from my dad. He lived about 2 states over from where I lived. I decided that that was my chance to get away from him, so I packed up my apartment while keeping up the facade with him. 2 hours before I left, I called his sister to let her know that I didn't want to be friends with her anymore, asking her to never contact me again. She asked me if it had something to do with her brother, but I hung up. I've settled down a bit now, even managed up the courage to bring this to the attention of my family. I started seeing a counselor too. So far, I haven't had any trouble with him or his sister but I can't help but feel like I did the wrong thing. My family says I should have let his sister and family know, but at the moment I just wanted to get away. I refuse to take any legal action because I want it to be over with. Still, should I have let his sister know?  Was I an asshole for ending the friendship just because she was related to him? This has been on my mind for awhile now.\n\nLet me know please.",

      "description": "Some notes:\n- this bus fare was $60 for an adult and $33 for a child (me) while a plane ticket usually averages $80 but are frequentl on sale for $60. Reason why I chose to take a bus is because I paid for the trip and I don’t get paid very much from work to afford the luxury to fly just as yet.\n\n- I’m 17 years old and this lady seems like she’s 35-45 years old (in other words she might seem like she has some sort of authority over me because I’m young and she’s older)\n\n- I am travelling by myself\n\n\nSo picture this: monday morning at 9:15am 2/3rds of a bus gets filled with people to drive from Melbourne to Adelaide (~800km/500mi). I’m on this bus trip for two main reasons: I have a car in Adelaide that I need to drive back to Melbourne and I also haven’t seen my dad in 4 months aswell (he’s the one who helped me buy the car aswell).\n\nNow up until this point, I have been trying to get in contact with my dad so I can plan this little mini-holiday and how everything will work from registering the car to discussing and fixing all the problems with the car (its an old car).  Notice how I said I was ‘trying’ to get in contact with my dad - being that he’d lost his phone and hasn’t been able to call me (didn’t know my phone number).\nNow this was all until I called my grandparents who live in the same city as my dad. As it turned out, my father went to his parents house to use their phone to call me, right as I was about to call him. So fair enough, I was on the phone with my dad and we talked.\n\nSoon enough, we’d planned our week ahead and eventually got onto other personal topics because we don’t really call very often. By the time I say goodbye, it was about 11:35am. I was tired from the night before and try to get some rest.\n\nNo more than 15 minutes later, I get a call from my best friend. She was calling to tell me about how she and her parents got into a massive argument over the holiday we’re going on in 9 days. To celebrate our passing of highschool, its tradition for students to go on a holiday somwhere in groups with the main intention to get as drunk as physically possible.\n\nWell, her parents had said that they didn’t want her to go, although we’ve all already paid $1000+ and booked it 6 months ago. Plans were SET, and we were ready to leave. So naturally I spent the next 45 minutes discussing what our course of action was to get around this situation.\n\nNo less than 5 minutes before I’m saying bye to my friend on the phone, this lady sitting on the other side of the aisle to me raises her voice at me saying \n\n“are you going to stay on that fucking phone for the whole trip? You’re being so rude!”\n\n“Um hello? How am I rude? I’m talking to my friend and its only 12:30pm. That means daytime. That means people wont be sleeping”\n\nNow I know that there may be some people asleep on the bus. I should know, I almost had a nap before my friend called me. But I’m not sure how I was rude. If you didn’t want this, then you should have flown and not caught a bus.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I am member of a character fandom that exists for several years at this moment. There were several discussions to it, but after some time most of them were defined. One of these discussions was about giving a certain name to a character who doesn't have one; the fandom has soon come with a fitting name, had some time being happy over it, and that was that. In fact, I think of myself as the one who finished this discussion by articulating \"this headcanon is becoming generally accepted\", but I might exaggerate my merit in this.   \nSo, this discussion was basically over, and after some time, this headcanon was used where appropriate (i.e. this name is used in fanfiction almost exclusively when there is need in one), but not mentioned specifically; it was considered a general knowledge for fandom members.\n\nThat is, until one day I came across a post that said something like *\"Hey fandom, \\[name\\] is the best name for \\[character\\]!\"*  I don't claim these words to be exact, but I can't provide actual wording because I'm unable to see the actual post. \n\nBecause of my \"merit\" described earlier I was annoyed to see this rise up again but didn't want to argue with poster publicly, so I DM'd them, saying *\"The \\[character\\] fandom has somewhat agreed on this, like, year and a half ago, but thanks anyway.\"*   \nTheir reply was *\"Nice! I wasn't in the fandom back then, I have not seen one post calling \\[character\\] by that name, I have no idea who you are and considering the first thing you ever say to me is a sarcastic snark remark on a dumb \\[site\\] post i dont wanna know you! Bye!\"*   \nThen they immediately blocked me so I wasn't able to resolve this conflict.\n\nSo, in the end, what was it? Does my knowledge of fandom give me the right to tell people when their ideas are outtated? Did my ego push me into arrogance and desire to control what others are allowed to speak about? Or was it all a mere misunderstanding, making the newcomer respond aggressively when they saw aggression in my message?",

      "title": "AITA for fighting with my mom constantly?",
      "description": "Constantly is probably an exaggeration but let me explain:\n\nSo I (M/18) have a pretty explosive personality when I'm with my family. I am very friendly but I often say things that are a bit over the line and I rarely back down because when I see myself in the right ill stand by that.\n\nSometimes there's something I do/say that triggers a reaction from my parents. Usually its something I see as very mundane and unimportant but they will usually say that its really hurting them.\n\nI used to be quite depressed and getting out of that, together with validation through grades in school and a lot of friends who quite like me, I've come to like myself and see that I'm an intelligent, likable guy and when people tell me otherwise I'm quick to reject that idea.\n\nMy sister (F/15) is an incredibly fragile person. Shes in therapy because everything stresses her out so much and she really hates when we fight (we as in anyone in the family). However, she often has phases (not her period) where she is just exhausting, telling everyone off and being completely toxic. That behavior isn't recognized my mom and usually hits me. My sister sees these phases as completely justified and never apologizes, instead wants apologizes made to her most of the time.\n\nI sit in my room most of the time, studying or playing games. I listen to music a lot (speakers except when people are sleeping). I do sports 6/7 Days a week and do a little bit in the house (my room is always clean, emptying the dishwasher, bringing out the trash, basic chores).\n\nWhenever I have a rough day and say something even remotely hurtful or annoying, my family completely loses it, especially my sister, and I am first blamed, then punished and when I inevitably apologize, its back to normal.\n\nSo I have two examples that I remember really well here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst one we were on a 3 day holiday in London, my sister had had one of her bad days and we went out to eat. I was fine the entire time and didn't intentionally say/do anything to hurt someone. We went inside a traditional Chinese restaurant and having had Peking duck before, I said I want gonna eat anything and Id just have a drink. I said this while being calm since I didn't feel like it was a big situation. I just didn't want to eat Peking duck (what my family decided to order).\n\nThen my sister got up and went (quickly) out of the restaurant, followed by us. She then proceeded to run away, my mom following her and yelling at me to stay where I was and eat with my dad. My dad also went somewhere so I was alone in the street, confused.\n\nLater I was told (and am still being told) that it's my fault cause I made a scene and I should've just eaten and I knew my sister had a bad day. My mom yelled at me and I genuinely didn't see how anything was my fault but she guilt-tripped me for the remaining 2 days straight. (This is the situation where I am 100% sure I'm not the asshole, the other one is more intense so this post isn't baiting for validation.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then yesterday, my sister took my headphones out of a drawer downstairs (which I didn't know, I thought they were in my room) and studying for the midterms and having to look for them I was angry cause I wanted to hurry to the gym.\n\nWhen my sister arrived home shortly before I was gonna go (i was already in my car). I drove off, turned around, handed her the keys, took them back after the opened the door (took them back in an aggressive manner) and told her \"don't go through my shit, asshole\" which in German sounds like I told her she's a fucking asshole.\n\nSo when I got back, my mom greeted me by telling me that I am a terrible person and that I made my sister cry.\n\nWe then yelled at each other cause that's what we always do. I said she was like her mom (rly bad) and she told me I didn't fit the family, I am ungrateful and I should move out.\n\nApart from that situation: She constantly mentions that I should get a girlfriend, that I should move out, that I should get a job, that I'm ungrateful, that all my problems are caused by me and that I should \"just be nice.\" cause they are nice to me.\n\nI just feel like I can't express my emotions to them anymore and everything I say is always taken up as something more than it is. My mom says everything I say hurts her and she doesn't see any fault of her own.\n\nAnother example of why I have a problem with her is, that I want to eat better and lose weight (did it before, wanna do it again) and said that I would like for her to consider that when she's cooking. She says that I have no right to complain and if I don't like it, I don't have to eat it. I get around 30€ pocket money after gas and Spotify are paid for and I don't get compensated for buying my own food (which I already do, just not lunch every day). An argument she has is that she doesn't need to waste time cutting shit in the kitchen when I go out to McDonalds and subway on the weekends but I rarely do that and most of the time I just have a water and hang out with friends.\n\nI believe my family knows I like to lash out a little bit and they should accept that. If I do lash out, they can just tell me because I don't have bad intentions and id appreciate them stopping me right away. What usually happens is my mom or occasionally dad yelling back and then it gets really heated.\n\nMy mom has already made plans for me to move out. They support me generally but I can't have any complaints ever. My mom said that, if I do have a complaint, I should just suck it up.\n\nWe are relatively wealthy, my mom and dad have rough childhoods and I was incredibly difficult from ages 5 to 15.\n\nMy best friend (for 12 years, who knows my family well) agrees with me but I think that he's biased. What does Reddit think?   \n\n\nAlso: I am currently in the process of seeking professional help for myself and as a family therapy thing. I want to talk about the problems I and my mom have instead of just sucking it up and putting another fight off to another day. She doesn't think that I have any ground to stand on and says the problems are all with me.\n\nThe descriptions are all from my perspective obviously but I am generally pretty neutral and I really want to understand this better.

      "description": "Some backstory, about a year ago our roommate moves in with my fiancé and myself. Met him from Craig’s list seemed cool shared a lot of the same interests as us. We had a generous price for the room and utilities, about 40% of the total rent and utilities, and since he was struggling getting hours at work he really wanted the room. Problem was he had a cat and the complex has a strict no pets rule. Found he could claim the cat as an Emotional Support Animal then we would be fine to move in. Helped him get that sorted, I payed for his pet deposit which was 50$. Great all set to move in, he said he’s moving in on the 14 of the month. We didn’t care about the day but then he said he’s only paying half the months rent. Kinda annoyed but my fiancé and I do ok enough financially and we know what it’s like to struggle so we said ok half of the rent. We also smoke weed and he did as well, we smoked him out constantly and he never offered any back. Everything goes fine-ish for about 6 months complaints here and there about the dishes piling up which is 99% our fault since he doesn’t cook and was totally. He started looking for new jobs for better pay, found one and got fired, found another job and one that paid way more. He knocked on the door to my fiancé and I’s room crying with laughter excited for his new job. We were close at the time and he said “I was so excited I just wanted to tell someone”. After that he goes full ghost on us never says more than hi or sup. Won’t answer texts, discord, nothing. See him occasionally in the kitchen when he uses the microwave and that’s hit. Recently my fiancé left the stove on, and my roommate noticed and turned it off. Came to talked to me about he saying it was irresponsible and that the safety of his stuff and his cat could have burned away. I kinda shrugged it off this kind of thing happened occasionally I won’t lie. I had kinda a shit week (not saying this justifies it just giving details). I guess he didn’t like the way I reacted so he talked to my fiancé about it and I guess they got kinda heated. About a couple months ago he says that we need to be quiet by 11pm, we say we’ll try our best but we’re both night owls and play games late at night and shit get heated some times ya know? Tonight I was playing games with friends and my fiancé and I got too loud again and he sent my fiancé a text saying “I guess this isn’t going to end. I’m moving out”. We tried to be good roommates but you be the judge reddit AITA?\n\nTLDR: Tried to accommodate our roommate as much as possible financially and as a friend. Starts ghosting us when he gets a new job only talks to us when he has a complaint and is trying to set our bed time because his work schedule. \n\n\nTyping late at night on my phone apologize for the all the bad. Will fix tomorrow. ",

      "description": "Before I start this I should probably highlight for people that may not know that PCOS is an ovarian disorder that reduces fertility because of an absence of regular periods. \n\nSo ever since I started my period it has been incredibly irregular (I can go up to 5 months without one). This has been going on for a couple of years now and I contemplated getting out on the pill to try and regulate it but then I saw the side effects and was immediately put off. I did some googling and found this disorder that seemed to fit perfectly with my symptoms. I assumed that I had it for about a year before actually getting tested for it and being told that I didn't have it (this was back in September before I was dating this person). \n\nFast forward to the present day and I've been in a relationship for just over four months now. We had a discussion about contraceptives and my s/o asked if I was on the pill. I said no and that I didn't want to be on it because of the side effects. They said they were okay to use condoms but would have preferred that I was on the pill as they really didn't want a child. I felt bad about the whole thing and stupidly decided to tell them that I had this disorder. They were very supportive and said that it was completely fine that I didn't want to use contraception because it was already unlikely that I would get pregnant naturally. \n\nIn one sense I do have the main symptom that calls for a diagnosis of the disorder which is irregular periods but I didn't have issues with my ovaries visible via the ultrasound I had. So technically I am less fertile than most but I don't have the disorder that I told my s/o that I had. \n\nConsidering all of this, AITA? \n",

      "description": "Long story, but I'll try to make it shorter. I work with a woman who legitimately is going through a very rough time right now. Single mom, no child support, car crapped out on her. I do understand why she's stressed. My issue is her attitude, and all the things she does/doesn't do that make her life harder. \n\nShe is constantly blaming everything on someone or something other than herself. Some of it really isn't within her control, but there are many things she could do to at least make things better. Making a budget, for example. That i can tell she doesn't have one. She will run out of money for diapers or milk or whatever, but I know she spends money on things she doesn't need. (We work retail, i sell them to her.) She always seems to have money for weed. She complains to me often, both about not having money and about her family giving her crap for it.\n\nAnother big issue is her child's father. She still sleeps with him, but he doesn't come around much, never takes the baby, and doesn't pay child support. She seems almost obsessed with the guy, and says she won't involve the state for child support basically because she doesn't want him to endure the financial burden. If he helped out at all i would understand that, but from what she says he doesn't.\n\nHer family and friends try to talk to her about these things, but she either gets mad, ignores it, or guilts them about not understanding what it's like to be a single mom. At one point I considered her a friend, but I'm pretty done at this point. There's more, but this is getting too long. Basically I'm just wanting to know if I'm being too hard on her. I understand that long term stress can turn a person into something they're not, but this seems like more than that to me.",

      "description": "So this happened some hours ago but I'm still thinking about it. Today I had a very important test and I wanted to be sure to arrive early and study some more at school so I went out to take the bus one and a half hour before the test. Unfortunately it seems that this morning was particularly busy because it took ONE HOUR for the bus to pass. So there I was, waiting for the transport without the opportunity to study because I might get distracted and miss it (there weren't any benches either, I had to stand still). About five minutes before the bus arrived, a pregnant woman and her friend left their house (which means they didn't had to wait an hour in the heat like me) and took the same bus I was waiting for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis bus was particularly full of people (and I mean full, there were persons standing) but for some reason two seats were available (I think it was because the sun shined at full force directly on them, but I didn't care)  so I took one of them, put on my headphones without music to drown some sound and started studying. The pregnant woman also took seat besides me, chatting with her friend who was standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout five minutes in the route, the friend complained about her feet, so the pregnant one offered her the seat, which she happily accepted. Then it happened. The pregnant woman started complaining too. And instead of giving back the seat to her pregnant friend, the other woman asked me if I would give up my seat for her. I had my headphones so I pretended I didn't hear anything. After asking me two more times, the friend pulled out one headphone off my ear and, with a less-than-friendly tone, asked me again. I, of course, refused, arguing that the one who should give up the seat was her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe went nuts and harassed me for the entire ride. Called me names, put her hand on my notebook so I couldn't see anything and refused to give my headphone back unless I gave up my seat, while the pregnant woman only stared at me with the deadliest glare ever. I also heard the passengers talking about me, though some of them saw what happened and defended me. Still, that was one hell of a ride and I can't stop thinking about if I did the correct thing. So, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So here’s the thing, my grandpa is pretty old (around 75 I believe, not really sure). He lives in a nursing home and has been over the years getting some pretty serious Alzheimer’s and Dementia. I’m a junior in college, pretty busy as a music major. When I DO get some free weekends (which isn’t very often), I go home to my parents. I think I’ve only visited him literally twice in the past year and I really want to see him more because he’s getting pretty close to dying, I think. It’s just, I have to split the time between my parents because they’re divorced and have new partners. Am I the asshole for not seeing my grandpa more often? I love him dearly, but it’s just hard to find time to visit him.",

My dad works long hours so a lot of the time it’s me, my siblings and my mom.  As I started to stay out later my mom would always stay up unless we were all home. \n\nThis particular night I went to visit a friend in NJ for his birthday. I live in NYC so the drive isn’t that bad. I told my parents I was taking the family car and they were reluctant but agreed. They made it clear they wanted me home around 11 but I told them that was too early and that I’d be home later. By the end of the party one of my friends that came with me was extremely drunk. I offered her a ride back and naturally it took her over an hour to get out. After a tedious and long drive I finally make it home and of course my mom is waiting for me, furious. She starts yelling at me and arguing about how I’m a terrible son and all that. I really do feel bad because she’s my mom and I don’t want her to be up all night worrying about me, but at the same time I don’t want to be couped up just living my life at home.",

      "description": "My Grandfather is close to the 90 year mark, and he sure is burnt out. We visit him a couple times a year, and his currently 80 year old wife is still as excited and energetic as always.\n\nI can't say the same for my grandfather. Since about a year ago, he's been saying that he's done living, and wouldn't hesitate to be put asleep if he had the oppurtunity.\n\nWhen he first said it people (my parents, family) were shocked. Nowadays they laugh it off. To me however this is totally different.\n\nThe poor man is constantly suffering. He can't see properly, his speech is flawed, he was barely able to hold a pen today. When we had to leave to go back home I said goodbye to him, and since I've been wanting to tell him how much I praise him, I did.\n\nWhat he said after was brutally honest. After naming a ton of disadvantages in his current life, like not being able to perform standard movements and not even being able to function on his own, he said: \"I won't be able to see my wife anymore.\"\n\nHis vision is close to becoming ruined. Hearing this poor man say with a sad undertone that he would not be able to see his dear wife, who he married over 60 years ago, struck me. Whenever I leave their house, I keep thinking: Let the poor man leave this world.\n\nI love my grandfather. He is a hero to me. He was strong, built his own house, defended the dutch shores with hard work and labour, got a lovely wife and stood strong for 90 years, surviving world war 2, but I don't think he deserves to go through his pains.\n\nHe's got his wife, yes, but he's lonely. All he can do is listen to classical music and play a little bit of harmonica before he starts to hyperventilate or lose his breath. Right now I just feel like my parents keep wanting him to live out of desperacy.\n\nNow, to clear it up: euthanasia is not legal in these circumstances, but even if it was, my parents would not agree to it, even though my grandfather has directly stated his life was over.\n\nI would, though. If I could, I would let him fall asleep peacefully and let him wake up in the place where he wants to be. I'm not religious, but he is, so I shall follow his traditions.\n\nIs it wrong for me to pretty much want my grandfather to die? Since I'm the only one with this opinion, I get the feeling like I'm missing something..\n\n\nTL;DR: My grandfather is old and worn out, and wishes to leave this world. My parents do not approve, but I feel like he deserves to stop his suffering. Am I wrong for wanting his peaceful end? ",

      "description": "I was talking with a friend of mine about something that I saw on Reddit today which turned into me being \"defensive\" and basically being told I was being as asshole.\n\nI was reading a thread today on global warming here on Reddit and someone had made a comment about global warming not being as serious an issue as science says it is.  The comments went something like this:\n\nPoster 1: \"While global warming may be real, it is not nearly as serious as scientists make it out to be\"\n\nPoster 2\" Read the article posted above dude, I think its pretty clear the severity of what's going on here\"\n\nPoster 1: \"Fuck you, dont call me dude.  I do not identify as a man and its completely inconsiderate and fucked up for you to say some dumb shit like that.  You ignorant dumb fuck\"\n\nPoster 1: apologized and said that they had no idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friends response to his apologizing was \"When you apologize profusely you make it all about you it comes from a place of ego\" and then said \"I'm glad you have the luxury to believe like men are generally good\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to note that this idea that I believe men are generally good came out of nowhere, and I dont think men are generally good, I also dont think they are generally bad.  There are both good and bad people stemming from any variety of genders or identities.  I can't believe I am even having to say that because it is obvious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis thread had absolutely was not even CLOSE to the realm of having anything to do with gender, pronouns, anything.  The poster who went off on the guy hadn't said anything in the thread (as far as I could tell) about their gender or preferred pronouns.  And why would they?  The whole thing just made no sense to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI brought this up to my friend essentially making the observation that this seems to be counterproductive, and if gender identity and pronouns mean that much to you, maybe take this as an opportunity to simply point out that fact. Or without cursing this person out just saying \"hey id appreciate it if you referred to me using \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ pronouns.\"  \n\n\nMy friend proceeded to tell me, in not so many words, that I was being an asshole and an idiot and that women and minorities and other marginalized cross sections of society have tried to teach people things for ages and that nobody listens and it isn't worth their time.  That this person should've gone online and looked up gender identity and pronoun information.  The thing is - this came out of nowhere! How is a person supposed to do that when they are attacked out of nowhere?  I said that I thought the person yelling at this guy was being counter productive, and I think they were being really cruel and frankly pretty ignorant.  With absolutely no mention or any previous discussion - this person attacked this guy....and somehow I am the asshole for thinking that this was inappropriate or not the best way to handle this situation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for bringing this up? for thinking that this person was really cruel and did a disservice to someone who maybe felt really bad about what happened even though they would've had no idea this was coming? I just dont get it.  Sometimes it baffles me how you are supposed to give support.  I disagree on the way this person handled this and it felt like all of a sudden I was NOT an ally and that I was being ignorant and rude and borderline abusive for bringing it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI seriously want to know, because I care about people and I hate mean stuff and I try to support everyone as best I can and so this made me feel crummy even though I dont think I did anything wrong, ",

A month in I told her I wanted to make this an official relationship. She said she couldn’t commit because she didn’t want it to turn out how her last relationship ended and was “terrified of breaking up with me”. After that, any time I would try to put it on the table (I didn’t force it) she would say something like *i can’t do that because my ex would do that*. Whenever there was an even minor issue between us, she refused to talk about it over anything but text because “My ex would want me to talk and I would cave into what he wanted if it wasn’t over text”. This obviously pissed me off a LOT as I don’t want to be associated with an emotional abuser. I told her that if this was going to stay where she refused to hear me out on anything and never go into a relationship, I can’t trust her and I would like to stop talking. She then told me that I really hurt her healing from her ex and that I’m evil and blocked me.\n\nNote: She 1000000% had feelings(she told me), she was just scared to commit because of her ex.",

      "description": "A little backstory: The other month we had some relatives over and my cousin has recently picked up violin. She is 8 years old as of current. I have a childhood violin that I used to play but I eventually moved to guitar and stayed with it. Im currently in college and havent played my violin in over 3 years. Ive been looking to sell it for some money. Take into account I wasnt looking for much. I had bought the thing with saved up birthday money and it probably costed around 300$. Too long ago to remember exactly. The thing is in amazing condition, considering I never got into violin and switched to guitar. I was planning on selling it for 100 dollars flat. Now heres where the story starts. My uncle offers to take it off my hands for 100 dollars since his daughter(my cousin) wants to learn to play. I say what a deal and am about to make the transaction. Heres where my father comes in. He tells me you shouldnt sell to family members like that and insists I give it to my uncle for free and in exchange for doing this my dad would personaly pay me 225 dollars the next week. Being me I said hey that sounds even better. We keep the money between me and my dad. I get paid. My cousin gets a free violin. Everybody wins. So I give them the violin. Fast forward two weeks, I still havent seen my money and I ask my father about it. He then gets defensive saying how I should be patient and wait till he can save up. I say fine. Fast forward two months I bring it up again. At this point im pissed because I know damn well he has had the money multiple times, but he just wants to avoid paying me. He gets pissed at me for remembering that and says my christmas present should be enough.(100$ and a card). It was nice but I still feel he cant pawn his debt off to a holiday. And even if he could there is still another 125$ we agreed on. He always is fast to change the topic and Im scared to bring it up because he gets so pissed. Am I the asshole? Should I just drop it? I really need advice.",

      "description": "This might sound stupid, but it's annoying me to no end and causing problems and tension in our relationship. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and we don't technically live together but I stay at his apartment every night. We spend a lot of time together and hang out, but he will stay up until 5am drinking with his roommate while I go to bed around 2ish or whenever I get tired. You might wonder what the problem is.\n\nWell, I feel like going to bed together is a special time and he just completely disregards how I feel and chooses his roommate over me. I also feel like it's unnecessary to stay up until 5 am drinking??? It's not like he has insomnia, works late, or has some reason why he needs to stay up. It's literally alcohol fueled. We are all at home by 8-9 pm and have plenty of time to hang out together and have no reason to stay up until 5am. When I bring this up to him, his reply is always \"you can always hang out with us but you CHOOSE to go to bed at 2am and leave us.\" Um yeah because a fucking normal person gets tired and wants to go to bed?? Like am I the crazy one here? \n\nAlso, I'll go to bed when I'm tired and I just expect to wake up and him be in bed which would be fine but nope. I'll wake up at 5, sometimes 6, and he's still out in the living room 12 shots of vodka deep just watching tv and chilling with his roommate. It annoys me to no end and at first I tried to nicely talk to him but now I just explode. I've said to him if I wanted to sleep alone and be alone, I can just stay home at my own apartment. We got into a major fight about this a few days ago just straight up screaming at each other because I just can't deal with it anymore. And what does he do the very next day? Stay up til 5am. Am I being the asshole here? ",

      "description": "Multiple different owners have been walking their dogs behind my building because it’s on of only a couple where the back is facing a tall fence (golf course behind it) and is completely hidden from view of the leasing office. They let their dogs poop everywhere and leave it there. They’re doing this like ten feet from the porch of the people who live below us, who also walk their puppy back there and they along with other tenants have talked about how they stepped in it a few times as well as they’ve had to pick it up themselves because their dogs tries to eat it and obviously they have no idea if the dog that left it has worms or some other poop transferable issues. Literally 100 feet away is a fenced off dog park area with dog poop bags readily available. \nThe woman in the leasing office who takes my rent checks asked about us having seen one of these people and asked us to email a description of anyone we see doing this along with pet descriptions (the office has pictures of all pets tenants have registered with the office)\nToday I recorded a girl walking two dogs, got her on camera letting them both poop and then after she looks around to see if anyone saw, she walks away from it. I tried to go outside to confront her before taking it to the office, but she was already gone by the time I got dressed and went outside. \nTried to email the video to my leasing office, and afterwards was talking to a few different people about it and got wildly different reactions. Some people said I should’ve sent it and that it was justified, and others said I was an asshole for trying to mess up her lease and potentially get her evicted if she has lease violations already just because she left poop in nature where it belongs. Then I found out the video file was too large to email, and now I’m hesitant to email screenshots I took of her and her dogs due to the things people said about it being a bad idea. \nSo, would I be an asshole for getting this woman in trouble with our leasing office just over dog poop? Is dog poop even that much of an issue that it should result in a lease violation?",

He tells me that my dad is taking him to eat to a nearby town. So im all thinking that it will be a relatively short thing, like as in we eat lunch and come back. Anyway while in the car I am informed that they are also getting some “quick” massages at a mall. So im thinking “alright i guess thats fine, a quick massages is like what? 10-20 minutes maybe?” So we get there and it turns out they are getting hour long massages. Anyways im pretty pissed because i assumed we would not be there for very long, and that i was maybe looking at an hour total, meal included. When Im actually looking at a two to two and a half hour deal. I told my dad how pissed off I was because I dont have very much money right now (which he knows) because they cut my hours at work for the winter season since business has slowed down. I would have driven separately also, but didnt this time to save some gas. Anyway he flipped out on me and got really pissed at me, and called me “selfish” and this and that, because all i cared about was myself.\n\nSo now im stranded in a mall, in a different town, with no money, no ride, and now me and my dad are pissed, and my half day off was just pissed down the sink. He also threatened to send me back to live with my mom (she lives in another state). \n\nSo am I the asshole for informing him that he kinda really pissed me off?\n\n",

      "description": "My daughter (4) had her school concert this morning. The kids have prepared their play for weeks, 45 minutes of show with more than 100 preschoolers, a “big thing”.  There is space for about 200 parents in the sports hall, a flat floor (not a cinema), the kids play elevated on a stage, but naturally the view isn’t that great. The school insists in written that no video recordings from the audience are being made, and they provides a professionally recorded DVD of the whole play at an OK price (10-15$) afterwards.\n\nOf course people still take photos, and I get it: you want to watch (or show it to grandma) before the DVD comes out. Most raise their phones to shoulder height and that only shortly. Fine. It’s a kindergarten...\n\nBut 30 minutes into the play when a new group shows up, about 6 parents raise their bright phones high above their heads and keep filming for 1, 2, 3 minutes and don’t stop. They sit in the middle rows and basically you cannot see anything when you sit behind them. I’m seated quite at the back, my daughter was already on stage, but I watch and clap for each of the kids and I feel they all deserve respect for their play. And the parents in the back deserve a chance to see the 10 seconds fame of their little ones without it being blocked by someone’s smartphone.\n\nWithout thinking I yell a quick and loud “Put your phones down, please!!” into the play. Most phones disappear or move down. (Mind you, this is not a quiet, classical concert, there were babies crying, a few people going in and out, parents talking, even phones ringing.) My wife is furious afterwards and tells me she was sick of embarrassment. I am sorry she feels like this because of me, but I think it’s better than accepting people ruining the rest of the show. I also think not many people realized who actually shouted anyway. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for getting into an argument with my friend’s mom?",
      "description": "A little backstory: my friend M and her sister S were put up for adoption by their biological mom. Her mom had been adopted by this old lady, so the old lady adopted her two kids. A year later, the mom got pregnant again with a son and kept him for awhile. She had two more kids, both girls, after that and kept them. Fast forward 13 years or so, her son is living with his dad, but the dad doesn’t want to care for him anymore and asked the mom to take him. She said no, so the old lady had to take in yet another kid. That kid sleeps in a tent in the living room, since they have no space in their house. Recently, the old lady had a stroke and can’t even move much. The mom moved into their house for the time being. \n\nAlright, now onto the issue. Her mom took her kids (16 and 15) out of high school to “homeschool” them, which she wasn’t. She just didn’t want to be deal with their school schedule, and they were happy to stay home and do whatever they wanted all day. Their house became disgusting. The mom would drive back and forth an hour sometimes daily to just bring M and S places. CPS was called by someone, we’re not sure who, but CPS was threatening to take the girls away. The mom didn’t care.\n\n (Background facts: her mom knew the eldest daughter was snoring herself out on Snapchat for money, and was having her daughter buy the whole family food. The mom took the old lady’s car, even though she had her own car, so the girls had nothing to do until their mom came, and the mom would frequently get her own kids drunk.) \n\nI told S, who I’m sort of friend’s with, that I don’t agree with her decisions as of late, that I don’t like her mom because her mom didn’t seem to care for them. I even called out her mom on abandoning her son when he needed a place to stay because she didn’t want to deal with his “anger issues” aka, his mild spectrum autism and his anger towards her for abandoning him, that she left untreated. S gave the phone to the mom and she started telling me to “hush” and that “u shuldn’t judge me, u don’t no anything.” I stayed silent because I was embarrassed S would give her mom the phone.\n\nLater that day, she told my friend that she didn’t want either of them, but if she had to take one of them, she’s take S and put M into the system. I got into an argument with the mom, telling her that it’s disgusting that she would tell her own kids that she didn’t want them, when they already grew up knowing that they were unwanted by her when she put them up for adoption. Her other kids, the 2 girls and her son, have speaking issues and need speech therapy because she didn’t teach them to speak properly, which has led to them being bullied.\n\nFor the week following, anytime S was talking to me, she’d tell me “(mom’s name) told you to kiss her ass” and would send me photos of her mom flipping me off.\n\nI’ve known the sisters for 6 years, 1/3 of my life. They rarely see their mom, and usually just call her by her name because they don’t see her as a mom. I think I’m allowed to defend them, as I’ve known them for so long, and because she ignores M’s extreme depression. AITA for butting into their personal situation, or is the mom in the wrong? \n\nTl;dr - my friends’ mom neglects her kids and tells her she doesn’t want them, so I defended them, judged the mom’s life decisions, and the mom got very mad at me.

      "description": "For some context, I am 18 years old, going to college in the fall, and am getting back into cooking. My late grandma, god rest her soul, was a home ec teacher, and started teaching me how to cook and bake at a young age. Therefore, I have a big appreciation for food. After she died a few years ago, I kinda stopped cooking as much because of a depressive episode. I’m now getting back into it, and while there’s a few things I have to re-learn, I think I’m halfway decent. The problem is my stepmom. She cannot cook at all. Her food is dry, under-seasoned, and either undercooked or burnt, no middle ground. I eat it to be polite, but lately I’ve been preparing my own dinners, just so I don’t have to go to bed hungry. I usually just eat my dinner before she gets home, and then say I’m not hungry when she prepares dinner. The problem arose when my brother came home for spring break a couple days ago. I was making pasta, and he asked if he could have some. Since I had to double the recipe suddenly, this threw me off schedule, and my stepmom came home when we were eating. She flipped out about how it’s so disrespectful that I don’t appreciate what she does for this family and that she slaves away making food for me. My brother pointed out that we never ask her to make food, she just does, and she went off in to her room and hasn’t spoken to us since. AITA for making my own food?",

      "description": "The story starts about a year and a half ago when I was out of state for work. My wife 3 month old daughter were going to visit my family out of state on their way to visiting me on my work trip. A couple of days before the trip my mom tells my wife that during her visit they are going to visit my grandparents. My grandmother is a huge chain smoker, and to make matters worse she smokes indoors. My daughter has recently recovered from pneumonia and croup, so my wife was not on board with being stuck in a smoker’s house for several hours. (It was early winter, so going outside to hang out was not an option). \n\nThis started a big shit show between my parents and my wife. My mom (who has asthma btw) claimed that she grew up in a smokers house so it shouldn’t be a problem. My step dad and mom claimed that my wife was “a new mother” and that she was being overprotective. My wife tried to explain to them the dangers of secondhand smoke over the phone and through shared articles, but they took it as here acting snobby. While it sucked being in the middle of this, I sided with my wife. Long story short she didn’t visit them that winter, and as far as I know my parents never told my grandparents why. \n\nFast forward to this week. My daughter is 19 months old, and still has issues. We actually have an appointment to see a pediatric pulmonologist this month. Oh and my wife is 20 weeks pregnant. We are planning a trip to visit my family. My grandparents are in a new house, but grandma still smokes indoors. This time my parents said they “don’t want to get in the middle of things,” because they know my grandparents are gonna invite us over. They want to leave it up to me to tell them why we won’t. Which is fine I guess. \n\nWIBTA if I tell my grandparents that we aren’t going to visit their house but they can come see us at my parents? I have a feeling that even when I explain to them why, they are still gonna be hurt and pissed off. \n\nJust looking for an outside perspective. Thanks in advance.

      "description": "A few months ago I broke up with my partner of two years. Lets call him Greg. It was not a smooth  break up  (as most go) and was sudden as I had begun to realize that I was not happy with the relationship. I started to notice reasons why we were not compatible and that we would fight a lot. I told my partner (Greg) these things and we followed it by fighting about our compatibility and whether or not we fight a lot (a very ironic fight)\n\n Following the break up I would receive up to ~20 messages a day about how I destroyed them and they wanted to hurt/kill themselves. Most of the messages were about how I was a selfish and awful human for breaking up with Greg (I can attach screenshots if requested).  I tried to help as much as I can, but it's difficult to be both the villain and the hero. So I started to reach out to his friends to ask them to be there for him. \n\nCurrently the situation stands that I slept with my best friends ex (I very much know that IATA for this; it's not the point of the discussion). Their ex also happens to be acquaintances of Greg. My friend (ex friend?) posted the situation all over social media. So it's become a social issue. \n\nAfter word got out that I had slept with said human, Greg sent the following message to all of our mutual friends: \n \n\"\"This message is for mutal friends of my ex,_____. It sucks I have to do this but _____ has recently displayed narcissistic and abusive tendencies within my friend group to a point that I can't ignore, my personal abuse aside. People are evidently objects to be used until she's done with them. I can explain further if nescessary, but I would reccomend cutting her out of your circle if you don't support abusive behavior. Sorry for the drama but I can't let this type of behavior within my circle. Thanks.\"\" \n\nAITA? \n\nTl;dr: I broke up with my partner and a few months later slept with my best friends ex. This resulted in /my/ ex sending a message to all our friends calling me abusive.",

      "description": "I have been with my husband for 13 years, we have 2 beautiful children. We live near my family but about an hour away from my husbands family, so we usually see them on holidays or weekends stopovers. I used to have a good relationship with my mother in law, she has 5 sons and I was her “first daughter”. Things got slightly frosty after she took offence to something I said innocently and she called my husband to complain about it. We are nice enough to each other now and she would dote on my children whenever we came over. 2 years ago, her youngest (favourite) son met a girl. After just 2 months she moved into the family home with them. A month later she was pregnant but unfortunately lost the baby. A few months later they bought a house together around the corner from my mil and became pregnant again. They have since become engaged. Since my sister in law came on the scene, I don’t really have much contact with my mother in law anymore, but I am subjected to daily photos on social media of them doing things together. My BIL’s baby is 1 and is at my mother in laws most days (from what I can see on social media). When we stayed there for Christmas, my BIL &amp; SIL stayed over too, even though they live around the corner, meaning we had no time quality with my husbands parents and my children hardly saw their grandmother as she was always fussing over the 1 year old. Even if we were in one room and my SIL &amp; baby were in another, my MIL would stay with my SIL, ignoring my children. During the weekend, we asked if she would be able to look after our children (since she hardly sees them) so we could have a weekend away (our first in 10 years) but was told she couldn’t handle our 5 year old for a full weekend but would happily mind our 10 year old as they’re no bother. She then went on to say how much she looks after the 1 year old during the week so she was tired at the weekends. In the end, both myself and my husband felt uncomfortable with the exclusion and left a day early. Since then i feel I am bombarded with constant stories &amp; pictures of the fun things they do together. They even came to our home town to pick a wedding dress but didn’t come to see us. She no long FaceTimes my children &amp; whenever i get them to FaceTime her she brings my SIL or the 1 year old into the call with her. I have told my husband I will not force my children upon her if she so obviously has favourited the 1 year old, and therefore will not be visiting over Easter as we usually do. My husband thinks I’m being the a-hole and should let it go, even though he hardly ever wants to visit home and it’s usually me that pushes the visits. \nTL;DR AITA for feeling pushed out by my MIL to make way for my new SIL &amp; her baby ",

      "description": "So here's the story. I used to work at a kind of a new IT startup that struggled with some organizational issues. Recently a new CEO was hired and he arranged a meeting with everyone in a room where we all work. When I came to the meeting, I asked my superior colleague to get out of my table in a strict manner and he did. Yet the new CEO witnessed the scene, started arguing, saw huge disrespect in my doings (and yes my act was rude, emotional and inappropriate and I do regret it). As you might've guessed by the end of the day I was fired despite the fact that my \"offended\" superior colleague and others tried to protect me.\n\nYet I do understand that it was inapprorpriate and made without thinking, I'm surprised that this CEO did not ask about reason and didn't let me explain myself. I was responsible for processing big amounts of data and used to leave the laptop running for the night with launched code on it that did vast amount of work. And before the story happened, twice my laptop was taken away in the morning and my desk was occupied which ruined al the work overnight and forced me to start over. I'm confused I was not asked for an explanation, or it does not even matter?\n\nThe fun part is that now other colleagues ask me to help with the project since they do not really know the tecnology stack.",

A few days back we spent the day together and got fairly physical (no sex tho), but we spend a long time just holding eachother, and holdin hands. I fucked up, she caught me off guard and I regret that day. \n\nI met her again yesterday, and she was acting really odd, I think that day we spent together made a mark on her. Anyway, I started gettin annoyed with her right away, and just kind of stared at my phone to get her to stop talking to me.\n\nMy mind drew fucking blanks, I had nothing I wanted to say to her, I just wanted this meeting of ours to end. I had 0 interest in speaking to her, and I don't even bother with messages anymore. \n\nTo b honest I think its best if I just ignore her until she gets the hint, even when she approaches me in public. I dislike her company, but if I tell her that she's gonna go apeshit. Am I the asshole for essentially planning to stonewall her, even though we ad a really special day a few days bac?",

      "description": "18 year old gay guy here. I was at a party not too long ago. I was blackout drunk. I wake up the next day with a vague memory of touching a penis. I check my mystory (Mystory on snapchat is basically a timeline where when you put out something EVERYONE in your friend list can see it) where my friend and her boyfriend talk about how I gave him a handjob. She thought it was hilarious because I was gay and he didn't mind. I was ashamed and told her to apologize for me. he said it was alright\n\nSo the next day at school, we talk about what we did during our respective weekends. I show them the mystory, and one of my friends is like \"omg, I know that guy!\" She then proceeds to snitch on me, telling it to both of them, and my friend and her boyfriend tears me to shreds on messenger for an hour straight. The main problem here seems to be that ive began \"spreading rumors\" of what happened\". \n\nEventually her boyfriend admits that he overreacted and apologizes but she is still being a bitch. Like what the hell? Lets look at the facts here\n\n* I retold a story which she put out on MYSTORY for everyone to see\n* Her boyfriend was cool with it and apologized for being so angry\n* Since its her boyfriend that was the victim, why is she STILL angry when he said it was fine?\n\nThis is so shitty because she's told all of our mutual friends and i've been blocked by like 20 people on snapchat, which is basically half of all my friends. How am I possibly the asshole here? Are women always this dramatic?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Tl/dr at the end. \n\nBackground: I’m a grad student, I work, and I’m the “on-call” parent for our four month old. I do a lot of work from home, so I can divide my attention, for the most part, between everything. Sometimes, I need a hand when I have big projects or deadlines to meet. My husband usually works 60+ hours a week (for which I am eternally grateful, he’s amazing, and really busts his butt for us), getting up quite early, so I’m usually the one up with the baby at night, too. \n\nOnwards to today:\nMy husband took today off of work because I have midterms and a massive work project converging on Friday, and our usual sitter was unavailable. I was home and able to feed the baby, but my husband was in charge of entertainment etc. Kiddo’s been fussy for a bit (teething, yay.), but is typically easy going. \n\nAnyway, I finally get through all of the insanity of work, and my husband proceeds to start telling me, in detail, everything that he did with/for the baby. I smiled, told him that he did great, and took the kiddo for some cuddles. My husband looked hurt and said, “Hey, I did my best. I’m really trying.”, like I somehow hadn’t acknowledged him enough. I already thanked him profusely yesterday and this morning for staying home with our kid, and let him know he did awesome. \n\nI don’t really feel the need to kiss his feet and give him a gold star for doing what I do every day. I felt like I recognized his efforts in an acceptable manner. AITA?\n\nTl/dr: I usually split my time between work/school/baby. Husband stayed home today to be with the baby, then became hurt when I didn’t acknowledge his efforts enough. AITA?",

      "description": "To give context: I’m a teenage girl and I go to a pretty judgemental private Catholic  school where all the “popular” girls all secretly hate each other, and their families are pretty well off. These girls go to cotillion classes and all that jazz. The school is probably 80% white, 10% Vietnamese, 5% hispanic, and 5% other. Girls are very judgemental and you can’t really trust anyone because they do a lot of petty things. \n\nI’m Vietnamese, and my parents are immigrants from Vietnam. My mom owns a nail shop and my dad works as a full time employee at a grocery store. My father attended college, but had to drop out cause no one could afford his tuition even though it was $1200 a year and it was a community college. A lot of the kids that go to my school have parents that are lawyers, government workers, or military so I feel like they judge me when I tell them my parents’ occupations. \n\nMy family definitely isn’t poor now, but we definitely can’t afford to buy airpods, IPhone XR’s, and expensive sneakers like the other kids. I’m okay with that cause I like the concept of minimalism and I like the konmari method of living. I’d like to think I’m mature for my age but I sound cocky. Sometimes the other girls will tease me lightheartedly cause I don’y have airpods or cause my phone has a headphone jack. (I have an IPhone 6)\n\nAnyways, to make ends meet and afford non-necessities, my dad goes around to all the Home Depots in the area, buys the stuff that is on clearance (sometimes it’ll be stuff like a panini press or sink faucets for 1 cent) and he’ll resell them on Craigslist. \n\nI get annoyed because he’ll resell the items at the grocery store parking lot next to my school, and I’m embarrassed that everyone sees my dad doing “shady” business. The girls at my school are pretty judgemental and always talk about people behind their back. \n\nToday I went to a basketball game, and right afterwards my dad sold something right in the parking lot of the school while my friends were entering their cars. I’ve talked to him about how it embarrasses me, but he just doesn’t seem to listen. I started yelling at him cause I was embarrassed that my teammates would judge me or mock me behind my back. Or maybe spread rumors about me. \n\nI got into a pretty big fight with my dad and told him about how he embarrasses me. He also has a pretty big smoking habit, and none of the other girls’ parents smoke cigarettes.  I’ve had a girl come over to my house and mention my dad’s smoking habit with disgust since we had an empty coke bottle outside that my dad threw away his cigarettes in. Ever since then, I’ve been paranoid about having people over to the house. \n\nHe also works the night shift so that he can pick me up from school, so he’s always sleeping in the living room after we go home. I never have people come over after school either cause they don’t understand. I also don’t usually go out on the weekends because my parents are working. \n\nAnyways, the fight was pretty bad and he hasn’t talked to me in two days. This isn’t the first time we’ve had a fight due to his whole Craigslist thing. Idk what to do now cause I’m just tired of everything that’s been happening. \n\nSo am I an asshole for being a stuck up teenage girls who yells at her dad for trying to make ends meet?\n\n\n\nTLDR; my dad resells things he finds on clearance, and I’m embarrassed cause there’s a lot of judgemental girls at my school who probably make fun of me because of it. He also has a smoking habit and has an irregular sleep schedule. Got into a fight with him and told him he embarrasses me. ",

After enough nights of lost sleep I went to his house to try and see if there was any way to keep them quiet. Now this guy doesn't speak any english so he had one of his kids translate for me. He was very dismissive and just waved his hand in a \"shoo\" motion and his kid told me he wants me to leave. \n\n\nI called animal control because where I live it's illegal to keep chickens in your backyard. They did nothing, didn't even come out to investigate. After several calls they basically told me they didn't have time for my bullshit. \n\n\nSo since nobody is willing to compromise or help, i called immigration and told them there was an illegal immigrant living there and gave them his address. \n\n\nMy girlfriend thinks I'm an asshole and I'm \"harassing\" this \"poor family\" when all I want is to fucking sleep.",

I moved to a big American city now. I want to have a fish tank in my home, so I started looking online for tanks for sale.

Before going to the store I decided to check Craigslist for tanks for sale. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sent a few sellers messages about there stuff because I know most of the time not all the sellers respond. One texted me back asking about pick up dates and I told him where I was located. After that I asked \"Are you willing to negotiate on the price?\" because it was more expensive then what I could get a new tank for. The seller said yes so I told him how much the tank was new. He then told me he would be willing to match the price of a new tank and that I would be paying more at a store due to taxes. I told him I wasn't interested in a used tank for practically the same price as a new one and he called me a dick and an asshole for wasting his time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hi, I am a senior in high school. My school offers a retreat that has has been very productive for many kids, including me. I had already gone once and decided that I would go again as a leader. One of the main rules is that the students can't bring any type of electronics, such as phones or computers. As a leader, we were told to enforce these rules. This boy (Let's name him George) hid the phone from the teachers and brought it to the retreat. After the first night, George's roommate told us that he had brought his phone, as he was using it in bed. Me and a few other leaders decided to question him, and he denied having the phone several times. After a few hours, I entered Snapchat and saw George in the map (leaders could have phones), and I confronted him about it in front of the whole group of students. He again denies that he had the phone. When the students were eating, his roommate and I decided to go into the room to search for it. As he comes in, he gets extremely angry and throws a hard cover notebook and my face, and pushes me towards a night stand, breaking it into pieces. I stand up and agressively explain the reason for which he shouldn't have the phone. He then rushes towards me to push me against the broken night stand and I instinctively punch him with my weak hand in the face to defend myself. After that, I rushed out and told the teachers of the situation. Am I the asshole in this situation? Did I push too far? Thanks.",

My father on the other hand is rude, abusive and just a selfish, horrible person. I could be biased but, it's how he is.\n\nMy father messes with my mother mentally. He has physically and mentally abused two of my brothers (unsure of my other one, hes much older than I am), fucks with my mental state (I think abuse? I honestly dont know), and has actually hit one of my elder sisters friends a while back when she still lived with us. My father has accused my mother of cheating when she has no time and is currently traveling all the time for work. Currently, while mother is away, we have no money because of him quitting his job (this is like the 3rd or 4th time within 2 years), demands money from my mom and has added more stress on my mother, making her work two jobs while shes home.\n\nMy mother is not happy in the relationship. I know this for a fact because when we're in the car or alone, shes complaining about him. He never let's her go out with friends yet he does it all the time. He even leaves me alone at times. He does smoke marijuana as well, my mother absolutely despises it. At times he'll smoke with my 3 brothers. Its still illegal where I live.\n\nThey did try to get a divorce in 2010 (I think that was the year) but it completely wrecked my mom. It wasnt fun. At all. While they were separated, my dad was actually with another woman. They weren't even legally divorced yet. Though that stopped after a few months after they got back together. I really wish they hadn't. I tell my mom this all the time. It would probably be so much better for her to get away from him. Hes toxic and everyone in the family can see it. Even his own mother.\n\nAm I really an asshole for wishing this?",

      "description": "*This is a throwaway account yada yada. If I’m declared an asshole I’ll be sure to apologize as soon as he gets home.*\n\nBackground:\n\nMy [23] boyfriend is notorious amongst our friend group to take party planning pretty seriously. He’s thrown at least 2-4 parties per friend costing around $300-$500 a piece. I’m the polar opposite, I enjoy having a small party, which consists of ordering food and weed for everyone to have a chill time. But since I knew my birthday was coming up I decided to not plan my own party and just let my boyfriend do his thing.\n\nIncident:\n\nI wake up on my birthday and my boyfriend doesn’t even remember to say happy birthday to me. Quite frankly I was hurt, since I expected anything birthday related from him and he normally goes above and beyond for all his friends. I said the normal good morning and went to my garden to water it. He opens the sliding door and yells “babe!” to which I turn to look, he says “I have to help *Lauren* fix her fridge, do you think you could help me with a couple of things?” I reply “sure” but I think he can tell I’m pretty bummed because he says “don’t worry, I’ll pick up Panda Express on the way home.”\n\nI look at the list on the fridge and it’s an **assload** of stuff. Vacuum the floors, wash/put away the dishes, wipe down the dining tables and kitchen area and finally go drop off his aunts medicine to her. I was thinking that it would take at least 2-3 hours but I was fine with it because it was for our good mutual friend Lauren. \n\nAfter all the home related tasks were completed I hopped into my car and drove to his aunts house. Upon returning home, I hear a loud **”SURPRISE!”** and see my whole friend group and my boyfriend with tons of gifts and food. The party was pretty awesome, he even hired a local band I enjoy. I was happy, but also I was upset as hell that I did all of those chores essentially for my own party. I brought this up to him afterwards, to which he replied I had no respect for his time and consideration he put into my party and that those chores would have been needed to be done regardless. If it was up to me though, I’d rather spend my birthday chilling rather than doing chores for a big party.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

      "description": "Last week, my family went to a Vietnamese pho restaurant with my older sister, who lives in a seperate house. As we were finishing, we were talking about whether or not we were gonna get dessert. Someone suggested a local chain that had drinks like bubble tea. Someone mentioned that they didn't like going there, because they felt left out because usually everyone was Asian, and we were the odd ones out. My mom then said \"just show up with your eyes like this\" and proceeded to reach to my face and pulled on my eye so it looked slanted. I was shocked that she would say something like that not only in public, but in a restaurant that serves food from a race that she's mocking. I pulled her hand off and said \"No, don't touch me!\" As we were getting up to leave, my mom put her hand on my shoulder, and I shrugged it off and left out the door on my own. While my mom was at the cash register, my older sister stopped me and said that I should respect my mom more, not mentioning what just happened minutes ago. AITA?",

      "description": "     So I work at a restaurant 6 days out of the week. I work so much because I'm the only person who can host in the morning, and expo on Friday and Saturday nights so that leaves Sunday as my only day off every week. When I first started working there I only worked 3-4 days a week, but as they got short of staff they told me they needed me to start working on my days off or I would loose all my shifts, so I did. At first I was still getting 2 days off a week so it wasn't too bad but I've been working 6 days a week for months now and there is no end in sight. I miss out on a lot of things because of this but being a good employee is important to me so I try not to let it bother me too much.\n     As of late however, I have been completely burnt out over this to the point where I am getting depressed and my anxiety is through the roof at all times. I have collage classes, family responsibilities, and a couple personal things that take up a lot of my free time so even on my day off I don't get much time to myself.\n     One week ago exactly I was at the absolute breaking point so I went in and told one of my managers that I need Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday off from now on for personal reasons. She said that as long as I could pull off the last schedule we had out at the time I could take those days off starting this Monday.\n     I was at work tonight and I went to thank one of my more asshole-ish managers for allowing me to change my schedule despite the fact that I was the only one who could work certain days. She told me that my other manager had not informed her of this and that the manager who approved it didn't have the authority to make decisions like that. I explained that I needed the days off to her again and told her that if they couldn't give me them off I would understand but I would have to turn my two week notice in.\n     She told me to email her the schedule I wanted and she would take a look at it, so I did. This upcoming weeks schedule just came out and I am scheduled both Monday and Wednesday so I guess it wasn't approved. Im going in tomorrow at 3 with my notice in hand but I can't help but feel like I'm being unreasonable.\n    Am I the asshole for even asking for days off that I know they need me on?\n     ",

(Negligence that resulted in abuse.) I asked my mother about it and she blew up at me simply for asking. The convo (to a tee because I can't stop myself from replaying it in my head every now and then):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: \\*uncomfortable and visibly shaking from nerves\\* Mom, I need to talk with you about something.\n\nM (mother): \\*not realizing I know\\* Yes, Munchkin?\n\nMe: \\*deep inhale\\* Yesterday, SF (stepfather) took me to see GM (grandmother).\n\n\\*M's eyebrows raise as I say this.\\*\n\nMe: While I was there, she showed me a box. In it were a bunch of papers about the circumstances leading to me being put into foster care. I'm not sure how much of it to believe, though. I wanted to hear your side of the story before deciding who to believe.\n\nM: \\*the realization setting in as she clacks her mouse down hard enough on the tray that it's loudly audible over the tv in the background\\* What did you just say to me?\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but I needed to know and I just want to hear your side of what happened.\n\nM: You want to know *my side*?\n\nMe: \\*nods slowly\\*\n\nM: \\*voice raised\\* Have you ever considered how I feel? How I felt?\n\nMe: \\*deer in the headlights\\* I just want to hear your side so that I can understand.\n\nM: \\*actually yelling, because SF said he could hear this from the garage\\* Why would you make me go through that again? Being interrogated and having to answer for something I didn't do. If you saw the files, surely you must have seen the part where it said I took a polygraph which said I didn't know anything about it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turn and run to the garage, sobbing and apologizing for having even asked all the while, with her still yelling at me to \"come back here right now!\". I can still hear her yelling at me for a little bit while I'm sitting in the garage crying my eyes out. I had to be crying for a good 15 minutes at least, but when I eventually calm down, SF tries to comfort me with a Pepsi. I take a couple of my anti-migraine pills (I always carried them with me) since I can feel one coming. M comes in a little later takes my phone and tries to kick me out of the house in the literal middle of the night (all this happens around 11PM/Midnight) because of the fight, only for SF to tell her to BTFO and say he'll drive me to GM's in the morning. (I'm still crying a little, but acting \"tough.\") She concedes. (I am 18 at the time, though, so it's perfectly legal for her to kick me out when she tried.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep hearing from people how I need to let go of what happened and just call her up to talk.\n\n***Am I the Asshole for not wanting to make the first move and not wanting to listen to her if her first move is not an apology?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(Note: There's a lot to this story being cut out. Some makes me look worse. Some makes her look worse.)* ",

      "description": "I'm 23 and provided full time care for my 3 year old sister I am essentially her parent 90% percent of the time. I also have a 12 year old brother and a 10 year old sister whom I cook for as well.\n\n  \nMy Step-father is the provider for the family, he works construction 6 days a week for about 10 Hrs . My mom goes to the methadone clinic at 8:40AM and comes back between 11AM - 5PM, usually around 3PM.\n\n  \nNow on to what happened earlier today.  \nWhen I use a measuring cup I take it off the little ring that keeps them together so I don't need to wash them all out and this pisses her off to no end because it's \"not how she cooks in her kitchen\". However today I did not make anything and my dad was in the kitchen playing with my baby sister who took them out and left them on the table after they left. This blew her top and she started yelling at me saying I'm \"leaving messes for her to pick up\" (it was the only thing out in the kitchen) and then upon me groaning about her yelling it pissed her off more and she screamed about how I'm \"going through her room and messing with her shit\" (this stems from me and my dad having searched the room months ago and finding xanax). Now the previous day she came home dead tired to the extent of slurring her words and dropping her keys outside and leaving them there because she couldn't be bothered. Due to her being so tired she didn't remember leaving her make up bag in the car, her purse in the living room, or much of anything else. And when unable to find said things she yelled at me for moving her shit. Now I'm very tolerant when she is directing the shouts at me but we had also fought two nights before at 2 am and I asked her to be quite and I would too thus ending the argument, however she always need to get in a couple extra paragraphs.\n\nAgain today I asked her to do the same as I had just woke up, and as before she kept going on and on and on and on.  \nI snapped and yelled for her to \"Shut The Fuck Up\" this escalated quickly to her calling me a piece of shit and how she never would have talked to her mom like that (guess what she has) and then continued on by saying I was ungrateful and what kind of son I was. I ended up losing it and essentially said she's a shit mom who always has to have things her way and couldn't even take care of her own kid for 3 years and how she dropped me on my grandma so she could have a few extra dollars to buy her dope when I was a kid. And that when on for a good 30 minutes until my dad got back and stopped it.\n\nTL;DR I'm 23, dropped out of high school to care for mom after back surgery and stopped progress towards my GED due to fatigue as I've essentially been a full time parent for my baby sister (3) and 2 other siblings (12 &amp; 10) for the last 4 years. Got into a word war with my mom because of a measuring cup, it escalated, she called me a trash son and piece of shit and I called her a shit parent and a junkie.",

About a week ago James blamed it on our mother and sister and \"apologized\" briefly, then the next morning acted completely like he used to, like nothing happened(since the freakout James acted like I didnt exist then talked huge shit about me to our mom and sister every night).

Well can you at least give me a ride to (next town over)?\n\nMe:  (Spun around and yelled)  NO!  LEAVE ME ALONE!!\n\nI feel horrible, honestly, for having to yell at the poor guy.

I should add as it has been a point that they have two kids whom I always have fun hanging with when we see each other, and they are always excited to see me, I also have the same personality as her husband, which is my partner's best mate, go figure.\n\nSo I asked the doomed question \"I'm just concerned, have I done anything annoying or to make you dislike me?\"\n\nShe followed this up saying no, and was also letting things pan out after my partner lost his job. That was it, I responded with glad to hear (essentially), and how I value our friendship. Fast forward to two days later and I get this message at work: \n\"I'm just not the kind of person to do catch ups all the time I just enjoy the company of my family and just being by myself so definitely dont take it personally. We can still catch up every so often but most weekends (husband) and I like to spend it with the kids and ourselves\"\n\nI was shocked. This was not how our relationship worked before, and was news to me. There is not much room for a friendship amongst this, as she has two kids who go to school, and her partners job is full on. So I felt devastated. I must state I have doubts as this being the true reason, but I reacted according to her words. \n\nI responded: \"I had to mull this over, but I don't honestly see how our friendship will work. You're not interested in weekend hanging out, and I know (partner) is dead tired during the week. Also having to pick up both kids after school. Our friendship is not your priority. Personally I can't not take offence, I'm actually devastated. Those I have in my life, I make time for when possible, it's not on a roster, I respect you want to be alone, but I'm not disposable nor a means for passing the week by. I wish you all the best (her), sorry that I can't see eye to eye on this. I'm worth more.\"\n\nSo, AITA in this, what are your thoughts? I know it's hard to judge when a relationship is made up of a lot more. I have done a lot to help her out with her kids, her partner even wanted to make is godparents, but I'm sure she shot that down. She is a very self centred person, but I am still hurt. ",

      "description": "Some time ago, my girlfriend of 1 year and me went out for dinner and drinks afterwards and had a wonderful time. While sitting there with our beers, she asked me to tell her something really beautiful, so i did exactly that, that i love her with all my heart and how i love having her etc. I can directly tell in her reaction that what i said didn't suffice her.. As we're of different nationalities and speak in her language, she asked me whether the expression \"you're the love of my life\" would exist in my language.\n\nI told her yes it does and to be honest became a bit annoyed in my expression because i often have the feeling that i get tested whether i really love her. She then asks why i wouldn't tell her that, and i said \"i don't know, i want to say it when i want to say it and not when i'm kind of forced to do it\".\n\nShe: \"but am i the love of my life\"?\n\nMe: \"i don't know, i can't really say that right now, that's something so strong in my opinion, and that would be something i say when i or we want to marry and propose\" (sorry for my english, don't know how to word it)\n\nAfter that we went home in silence and she didn't want to sleep in the same bed. I was kind of lost and didn't really know what to do, i obviously felt bad for making her sad. \n\nThe rest of the night is kind of like a blur, in short we tried to talk, she said that she always thought we would love each other the same amount and that she feels like there is a discrepancy in the way we love (and i get where she is coming from and i also feel so bad that i can't just tell her that she is the love of my life..). i then say that i don't really compare our love, that i know that i love her, and i want our love to get deeper and to fall into it with the flow, and that i feel like this flow gets interrupted by her kind of often asking me how much i love her.. she says that i broke her heart and humiliated her. i don't know whether i describe it understandably,  sorry for that, i don't want her to seem like the bad guy, i really feel and care for her, but i also kind of think i'm in the right?\n\nAITA?",

She has a full time job and is able to pay her rent, however I am still in college and make less than $250 per week, and so I am staying with family close by. She has to move soon and we've been planning on getting a place together, however the only way I would be able to pay my half of the rent is to take out a loan to pay until I've graduated and get a job. She doesn't like the idea of living with roommates she doesn't know, even though getting a multi-bedroom place would be extremely cheap. I currently don't have any student debt, as my parents saved money to send me to school practically since the day I was born. I recently told her that I no longer want to take out the loan, as I don't think it's fair that I should have to go into debt for several years just so she doesn't have to live with strangers for a few months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My girlfriend wants me to take out a loan to pay for rent because she doesn't want to live with roommates, but I don't feel comfortable doing that, and I don't think it's fair.",

      "description": "A little about my personality and why I'm like this-- I'm an introverted, socially anxious person and going to work and dealing with coworkers alone is enough to completely exhaust me. I have a couple of close friends I talk to at least once a week, and I live with my boyfriend, but other than that, socializing, especially with acquaintances, makes me anxious and tired. I find more peace and happiness being alone than I do having a million casual friends. I also really hate the whole small talk thing.   \n\n\nWe live in close proximity to 3 other neighbors, in a duplex facing another duplex-- the other building is maybe 30 feet across from ours. Our neighbors are fine. The people next to us and catty-corner to us pretty much keep to themselves, work a lot, and I don't really see them much. The people directly across from us are more visible and more extroverted. They're two brothers, and I often run into them (usually at least once a day) when I go out to my car.  \n\n\nI generally avoid talking to them. Maybe a 'hi, how are you?' on occasion, but I always move on as quickly as possible, don't really share anything personal, and do it while actively going inside. Most of the time, I wear headphones and don't interact with them at all.   \n\n\nMy boyfriend, on the other hand, is very friendly and always says hi. He seems to think I'm being cold and unfriendly towards them and it makes me feel bad. I wonder if I'm being an asshole/am in the wrong for not trying to have an acquaintance/neighborly relationship with them. I don't want my neighbors to hate me or to think I don't like them in particular or something, I just don't enjoy small talk and I don't want to feel obligated to make it every time I go to my car.   \n\n\nI know my preferences for being left alone aren't the norm, especially being a mid-twenties female, as I'm expected to always be smiley and warm and welcoming, so I want to know from more \"normal\" people-- would you find my behavior rude?

      "description": "So I was thinking about making an alternate account to post this, but I’m just going to live up to it even if I am the asshole...tl;dr at bottom. \n\nA couple weeks ago, I attended a winter masquerade with a couple of friends and a girl (woman) I met on Bumble, a mobile dating app. The masquerade was a very elegant and classy event and tickets to it were $450/apiece; it was in a nice hotel/plaza next to the hotel. A lot of attendees were staying in the hotel afterwards, though I live within walking distance so I wasn’t planning on getting a room. I bought two tickets to it several months ago for my gf and myself, but  we broke up. I’ve gone on a few dates since then, but not many. As the masquerade got closer and my love life did not improve, I figured I would just scalp my extra ticket at the door. \n\nBut then “Regina” and I began chatting on Bumble and we really hit it off. We did go out a couple of times before the masquerade, but only for coffee and dinner. Neither of us had any alcoholic beverages on our dates. I invited Regina to go to the masquerade and she was definitely into it. On the night of, my friends and I met up with her for a drink (she looked beautiful) and headed back to my apt so we could walk over. \n\nAs soon as we got to the masquerade, Regina started drinking heavily. After she drank 3 gin and tonics in an hour and a half, I mentioned to her that she might want to slow it down. I mean, the masquerade isn’t a huge event - there were probably 100-150 people there. You could easily see that this isn’t some college level party where everyone is getting shit faced. There were people dancing, socializing, watching the performers, and bidding on items that were available (the whole thing was for charity). Regina got really angry with me and my bro’s gf told me I shouldn’t have mentioned it to her in case she has a drinking problem. To me, that’s all the more reason I would mention it, but I digress...\n\nOver the next couple of hours, Regina continued to drink a lot. I tried talking her down a couple of times, but she stopped talking to me after like the third time. She was definitely the drunkest one there, or at least the sloppiest drunk there. She was loud and she was dancing with random people. I could tell that some attendees were annoyed, but I didn’t want to lay claim to her at that point. My friend and I went to look for her when we were getting ready to leave and we found her in the bathroom hallway, passed out on a couch. \n\nI left her there. I definitely was not taking her to my place because I didn’t want her to wake up and accuse me of anything since she was pissed at me and I wasn’t going to drag her into an Uber since I didn’t know where to take her. I informed the hotel staff that one of the event guests was passed out on a couch in the bathroom hallway and then left.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR: left my date passed out on a hotel couch after she drank heavily all night",

This isn't usually a big deal as I'm home a lot of the time, although sometimes I have had to leave where I was at to unlock the door, and sometimes he calls late at night. \n\nI also suspect that he is purposefully leaving the main door unlocked when he leaves, because many times when I leave that door is unlocked, and I always make sure to lock that door. \n\nToday I almost just ignored his call to teach him a lesson, but then I gave in about 5 minutes later. When I got outside he wasn't there waiting for me, no, he was trying to break the window into his apartment so he could get in(not the first time he's done this).\n\nSo, WIBTA if I didn't let him in?",

      "description": "Some background info is that my husband (33 M) works A LOT, like well over 100 hours/ week and plays computer/video games about 1-3 times per week for about an hour at a time depending on that week. \n\nLast night, I, (28 F), was having a particularly difficult day with our children and just life stuff and at about 10 pm I was ready for bed and he said he was going to go play video games and I said that I would like for him to come to bed with me since most nights I go to bed alone and he comes home at around 1 am when I’m already asleep and leaves at around 6-7 am when I’m just waking up. \n\nSo, AITA for asking him to skip his video game and come to bed with me after I had a hard day?  His response was that he thought being with me meant I was okay with him playing games at night, and I am, but when I go to bed almost every night alone and have a tough day I’d like to be able fall asleep next to my spouse if his work permits, which last night it did. Anyway, I feel like I can’t say that to him because he gets defensive and says I am too clingy or that when we got together I told him his games and other things weren’t a problem with me and now it looks like I’m back tracking.

      "description": "So a little backstory: I was the first one to join my current team at work close to 2 years ago and we recently added 2 new members about 3 months ago, one external resource and one who moved internally from another group. Let's call the one who joined externally Sam - this one is about her.\n\nTo give some context, I am the youngest on this team (I am 24f while Sam is in her thirties), but I am usually in charge of training since I have joining seniority. I trained pretty much everyone on my team so far with no issues. There is a learning curve with the job so I prepare myself to be patient. Most took some time to adjust, but ended up being phenomenal additions to the team to the point I have developed a high respect for my manager's hiring ability.\n\nNow Sam joins and to be frank, I have no idea what prompted my boss to hire her. It has been months now and basic material is still going over her head. But it's not even just that she is plain bad at working because maybe she'll eventually get it, her mannerisms are that of a child's. For instance, I was nibbling on a snack as I was working when she grabbed it with her hands and said she wanted some and tore a piece of it to eat it without my consent. When she has an open cubicle to sit at (she doesn't have an assigned seat yet due to office reconstruction), she decides to sit with me in my cubicle because she wants to ask me questions about everything. When I ask her to work on something with me (another team member has complained that she isn't doing her share of work), she says she doesn't have the bandwidth because she's writing one email. Plus, she asks very personal questions, asking for photos of my family and boyfriend. I guess she's just being friendly, but it makes me uncomfortable in the workspace.\n\nWith all that being said, she is such a sweet lady and I know she does try her best to improve. But I'm starting to lose hope. These days, I think she can tell that I have an attitude change (I still try to help her when it's needed) and is even a bit intimidated to approach me. It's only a matter of time before my boss discusses with me on her progress and I don't think I have any positive things to say. As the senior member, I'm afraid my words may even cost her the job.\n\nSo, AITA for losing faith in my coworker and possibly about to express to my boss that she is terrible at her job?",

I am 5'0 and 98lbs. \nD: Dude\nMe: duh\nR1 and R2:girls hiding from forensics class\nT: best teacher \n\nProm is in April every year at our school and you have to buy tickets in advance, so people asked a few months earlier and not the day before. \n\nI have been in yearbook for 2 years. I sit next to this dude that I will call D. D had been hinting about going to prom with \"Did you buy a prom dress?\" and \"Have you bought a ticket?\" I had not because I did not plan to go. I had made plans to hang out with my dudes and play video games and eat Chinese food. It was cheaper and Chinese taste better than Walmart finger foods on a platter. I told him no for about 3 days until IT happened.\n\nMe: Come on guys! We have faces to tag and only a week to do it! (Book was due in a week and they procrastinated. A lot.)\nD and T are talking in the closet.\nD:(brings out a flat white box and everyone whips out their phones) So Sbp? Are you still not going to prom.\nMe: yep\nD: What about with me? (Opens the box with a cookie cake saying \"Sbp? Prom?\"\nMe: D. I told you already I have plans and no interest in prom. No.\nThe class breaks out in anger. They say stuff like \"You should just say yes!\" and \"Wow don't be so mean about it!\" \nHe knew I made these plans for months BECAUSE I INVITED HIM TO JOIN US! \nMe: T I am out! I am hiding in the bathroom, Good bye! \nI waved and walked out.\n\nI go into the bathroom across the school and find R1 and R2 hiding in there. We chat as I know them pretty well and they basically agree that I shouldn't go if I do not want to, but should maybe think about it. T walks in and tells me how D is \"heartbroken\" and that I should think about it and say yes. I say that I am not going with him; she says it is my decision and mine only.\n\nI pop my head in the door to find them talking about hair. Of all things why hair? So I listen to stories of fake hair and sit down.\n\nD: so did you change your mind?\nMe:No. I told you I had plans and you knew that.\nD: just cancel them and come to prom with me!\nMe: No, but you can join me.\nD: Why won't you just cancel your plans? You could hang out with them anyday but you can come to prom with me once!\nMe: I said no!\nD: Well girl said you are a horrible person for telling me no and your little sister said she was gonna hurt you.\nHe texted his friends and family I said no\nMe: I would love to see her try.\nD: and my mom said she won't buy bacon from you!\nMe: and (I was selling fundraisers for clubs) \nD: Just cancel your plans\n\nThe rest of the day is filled with evil glares and shoulder checks.\n\nOur last hour comes and I walk out of the class with my buddy and D is waiting at the door\nD: Did you change your mind?\n\nAITA",

      "description": "\nMy husband is in general a great guy. We both have times where we should be nicer to each other. Today he went fishing, which is really great because fishing is his chance to really have some time for himself. He has caught a fish before, but he usually doesn't. Today he got two really large, very heavy fish. He brought them into the house wet and dripping through the living room (we have wood floors) and put one in the sink. And took the other outside to clean. Our sink has dirty dishes so while he is walking in holding two giant fish one in each hand, he is telling me to take a picture and also to clean out the sink (which was full of dishes). I was annoyed that he came home dripping fish water everywhere. His clothes smell like fish, and now our living room and kitchen smell like fish. I asked him if he could clean out the sink and mop the floor. He said he would clean the sink and swiffer , and he would also throw his clothes in the laundry room. That was 3 hours ago. Now he is laying in bed, he didn't clean the sink or the floor or his clothes and our house still smells like fish. He has to work tomorrow and was already comfortable in bed and I told him I was upset that he didn't do that stuff and I was really annoyed that he brought in two fish dripping all over the place. He thinks I am over reacting and doesn't understand why I am so upset over the fish smell. He also says he did clean up the mess he made outside cutting up the fish, but he left the fish board in the sink. In his opinion he did clean up, but not to my standard. Also, I hate fish. AITA? ",

      "description": "A person at work, let’s call them Larry, was introduced to me so that I could share some tips and be a quasi mentor to the new guy. I saw a guy that was close in age and thought, “ok cool, maybe this could turn into an unfiltered work friendship” (I didn’t have any such relationships at this job). At first, we did share interests in going to presentations (especially those with free food) and could talk about anything not work related.\n\nLarry’s attitude was always sort of douchey and holier than thou but I gave it a pass because I enjoyed having someone to talk to and break away from work to do so. After awhile, it just became too much. At those meetings he would audibly grunt and grumble as soon as the food was off his plate and seem very anxious for the meeting to wrap up. He would even try to shit talk to me like jeez I wish they would just shut up and end this. \n\nLet me also point out that these aren’t mandatory meetings and while I was also drawn in by food, I would also listen to whatever the presentation topic would be about and some I would be genuinely interested in hearing. Also, they would be larger meetings (30-100 people) and you were free to leave at anytime. Some people would leave on the half hour so it seemed like they had another meeting to get to. \n\nI don’t want to be associated with someone with such a negative attitude as these presentations draw people in from high and low in the company. There have been times I have been somewhat stunned by the things he would say with others around at our table. I could go on, but it’s universally unaccepted type comments that I want nothing to do with. \n\nBefore I write a novel about what I don’t like about his attitude, let’s get to my possible asshole plan to distance myself. First step was to block him on instant messenger at work without warning. It was so liberating because this guy is so obnoxious. Can’t count the number of times he would send me 20 messages in a row, most being “sup” “yo” and the like. He seemed to be stalking me. As soon as I’d log on at work he would send a message or 6. I hate it because it’s usually pointless and it made me start ignoring the flashing icon which can be my boss or another employee with actual business chat. \n\nAfter discovering I blocked him, he just started sending chat like subject line emails or texting. These would also be mostly ignored. I’ll indulge a text every once in awhile because I’ll be honest, I don’t know how to go from entertaining his bullshit and seeming like a real friend to completely shutting it down and having no interaction without being super awkward. Even while trying to ice him out, this guy is relentless. He will try to invite me out to do things which I mostly ignore. I feel even more awkward that he doesn’t pick up on any social cues that I do not value his friendship anymore. Am I the Asshole?\n\nTL/DR: I became friends with a guy at work and have pulled a 180 after realizing how negative and obnoxious a person he is and am actively blocking/ignoring his communication. AITA. ",

      "description": "I hope this post fits in here\n\nI’ve had this tutoring job since December. My job was to help a girl around the age of 11-12 with her homework. I was not a teacher, just someone there to assist her if she ran into problems. Well it turns out she really struggled -a lot in all of her classes, and I practically had to tell her the answer in every math equation or write her essays. Meaning I would tell her what to write. It got better, especially in math. I was able to guide her to the right answers eventually and the past 2 months I’ve barely been there to help her. I have visited her twice this month ( 3 hours) and 3 times last month (5 hours). I took this as a good sign since she often told me “I can’t do the rest by myself” looked her in the eye and asked if she was sure. When she said yes, I had to take her word for it and went home. My point is, she seemed to be doing well and I’ve barely made an impact since January. \n\nI didn’t like her parents very much, they are controlling and would often force me to eat/drink very sugary things. When I told them no thanks or “I’m trying to lose weight” they would get really offended and told me not to be uptight. But the girl was really nice so I dealt with it.\n\n\nYesterday I received a long text from the mother about how they had been to a school meeting. The girl had apparently almost failed on a paper that we wrote together back in December. It was a “month paper” meaning she had 30 days to write it. They called me up the day before it was due and I had to sit for 4 hours practically writing it for her. I had a sense that it wasn’t very good, but the girl told me that this is how they were supposed to do. I guess not. She has also gone down in grades in several of her classes which I was shocked by. I was even more shocked that I got a scolding for it, since I’ve BARELY been there. And I sit with a calculator in math, to make sure everything is correct. In English I KNOW there’s been no mistakes. In danish, I’ve tried to guide her, but didn’t want to do the homework for her.\n\nAnyway she send a mean text and I politely and carefully questioned which classes and papers she was talking about. I had already been fired. Once again I got more dirt thrown in my face and she couldn’t tell me the exact errors/papers. I told her that her daughter seemed to do well and often told me she could do the homework herself. She turned this around on me and scolded me for not helping her when I was there.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Should I have contacted her mother and said she seemed to be doing better and tell her that she didn’t need my help as much? Or did they just want someone to blame for their daughter not being the brightest? I honestly don’t feel like I’m at fault here, but that her previous tutor might have done all the work for her and since that stopped, her grades are going down. ",

      "description": "Husband and I are both in our early thirties and fortunate enough to be in a financially comfortable place where we can quit our jobs in the next year. My husband works 12 hour shifts, 4 days a week and I work a regular 9-5. I recently sold some intellectual property and made mid-7 figures off of it. This puts in a place where we can pay off the remainder of our mortgage and live comfortably off the rest for quite a while. \n\nRight now, because of my husbands long hours and stressful job, he plays video games for hours on end as stress relief. I understand this, and it is sometimes mildly annoying when I would prefer we do interactive stuff together, but I understand the comfort he gets from it. My fear though is that when we both quit, he will just sit at home and play video games all day. I don't want to be an asshole and call all the shots because it was \"my money\" that is helping us retire, but at the same time, I want both of us to lead active lives so that we can live long and be healthy long into our retirement. \n\nI plan on taking up a bunch of home projects in the first couple years, maybe going back to school, and continuing to work on projects similar to the one I sold. I've asked my husband what he wants to do and he said he just wants to relax after 15+ years in the work force. So, I want to tell him that he has to have a plan for retirement before quitting, is this fair? ",

      "description": "Hi, first time poster, long time lurker, sorry beforehand for any mistakes, there's a **TL:DR** included below, also English isn’t my first language either.\n\nI (30M|Agnostic Jew) was introduced to this lady (30F|7th Day Adventist), and we had great chemistry from the start. We went on a lunch date, but she kept pushing the religion topic more and more during lunch, asking many questions, all of which I answered honestly. Despite finding her very charming and gorgeous, I could foresee religion becoming an issue down the line. Later that day, she asked me through text why we didn’t kiss, and I confessed. We talked and agreed that it would be best if we parted ways.\n\nI didn’t contact her after that, and focused on moving on, but after about a week, out of the blue, she texted me saying:\n\n\"Hi this is XYZ, remember me? :) How about we start over from scratch? I think we had great chemistry together and should give it a shot despite our last convo, what do you say?\"\n\nI was ecstatic, and agreed to see her. A couple of days later, she asked if I was willing to meet her community, to which I said: \"Sure!\". As we discussed this, it turned out that it wasn't a \"Meet&amp;Greet\", but a full-blown Bible Camp, to which I had to commit 3 days a week, every week\n\nSo, while I thought that she had found a compromise, and was willing to look beyond our differences regarding religion, what she actually meant was \" I want to date you, so you should adopt my religion\". After she confirmed this, things went sour pretty fast. She said two meanspirited things:\n\n1.\tIt was my fault for ending things and closing the door on \"us\", since I was unwilling to give her faith, and therefore our relationship, a shot, while stating I was asking too much of her to \"set aside her duty to her Lord and savior\" - that last bit was her answer when asked if she could not see herself beside a person who didn't share her religion, but would still support her\n\n2.\tImplied I was to blame for our mutual heart break, since I chose to interpret her message the way I saw it best, since she had always been forthcoming in the notion that I would have to adopt her faith, even in that specific text\n\nI'm not concerned about the first thing, because I made it abundantly clear I was not looking to embrace any faith, I merely reciprocated what to me was a beautiful gesture of hers. I am concerned about the second statement though.\n\n**AITA / WITA for interpreting her message in the way I wanted it to, or was it an honest mistake?**\n\n**TL:DR**: I (30's M - Agnostic Jew) met a lady (30's F - Adventist), but due to her beliefs we decided not to move forward with relationship, agreeing it was for the best. A week later, she text’s me out of the blue asking to “start from scratch”, but after a great date, things go sour, with her implying I was to blame for our heart break, because what she meant by “from scratch” is me converting to her beliefs, and not finding common ground through mutual respect and understanding",

      "description": "My ex wife is a perennial fuck up. She’s been to jail on numerous occasions, had several affairs, lost more jobs than I’ve ever had, and currently lives with her mother. I was a single dad for three years to three children, years where I learned to braid hair so I could care for my daughter. I’ve remarried, and my wife and I provide the children with everything. We pay for their healthcare. We help them with their school work. We sign them up for activities they are interested in and take them to those activities. We pay for those activities. We help them with their school projects. My son is almost 16, and we will buy his car. My eight year old daughter needs braces, and we will pay for them. I ask their mother for no child support because she can’t even support herself. I don’t wish to hurt her. In fact, I’ve forgiven her for who she is and what she’s done. \nFast forward to tonight: my daughter is entering a pageant. We’ve paid for the dress. We’ve paid the entrance fee. She gets me ask her questions she might be asked at the pageant. One was, “Who is your hero and why?” \nMy daughter says, “Do you think I should say, ‘my mom?’”\nI said, “ You realize you have family here? We provide for you. We registered you for this pageant. We attended the meeting. You live here full time. We care for you and love you. I know that you get to go to your mom’s every other weekend, and you have no chores there. You eat whatever you like (mom has food stamps), but it’s easy to be a parent two weekends a month. It’s harder to be a parent all the time.” \n\nI’ve never derogated their mother. I don’t want to cripple their image of her, but it’s frustrating as hell that they see her as this angel and don’t appreciate everything their stepmother and I do for them. ",

He seemed to have a preconceived idea of what I would be and what my interests would be and I was very different to that. He was also an alcoholic so wasn’t always able to support me and also he had a very quick temper so he shouted at me constantly even if I had done little to nothing wrong. He also began to say he would come and see me and then every single week something work related would come up and I understand that but then the work related inconveniences became hobby related inconveniences and it seemed that he would rather do his hobbies than see me. It wasn’t something I noticed as much when I was a kid but when I turned around 17 (now 21) I started thinking about it. Over those 4 years I’ve been more distant.\n\nHowever in the last year or so he has been trying to reconnect a little and become a better dad, like he started looking for the football results of my favourite team and he has shown an interest in my life. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate that a lot and I do give him something back. He’ll phone me once every couple of weeks when I’m at university and I’ll talk to him and ask him about how he’s been but that’s all I’ll give him.\n\nSo yeah, AITA and if I am what do I do about it?",

      "description": "It's pretty long but please bear with me.  \n\n\nAbout 6 weeks ago, I had a male friend (A) who I would usually take a bus with to home from school since I was unfamiliar with the direction in America ( I moved here 11 months ago and my sister stopped driving me a while back). He was kind, but we weren't close. The only time we would really talk much was on the bus. After 2 weeks of frequently taking buses with me, he asked me if I would be free on the weekend so we could go watch a movie, it was on him. I thought that was pretty nice of him to offer since he never seemed like a creep to me, it sounded like a friendly offer to me, so I said yes.   \n\n\nSo we went to see a movie together around 2PM, there was hardly anyone in the movie theater around this time, and the movie wasn't a too popular one neither so that explained. He chose the seats for us in the back. The whole line of seat was only us, and I felt sort of uncomfortable but I stopped thinking much about it. It was 15 minutes into the movie that he started asking if I was cold, which I replied \"I'm okay\", so he continue asking then why wouldn't I take off my jacket (red flag). I awkwardly smiled and ignored answering, with my jacket still on. Later on, he started to put his hand on my thigh and rub it, eventually he hand went up my skirt and I got super uncomfortable and knew he was up to no good. Fast forward, I tried to message my boyfriend to pick me up since we Uber'ed here, but he would constantly trying to look at my messages. I lied saying it was my friends bothering me with our project but my boyfriend didn't reply (he was asleep) and I ended up having to watch the whole movie with him with him fucking groping my body. I was too scared to walk away, I was dumb and I got the worst time in my life regretting coming with him.   \n\n\nI didn't tell that to anyone but my teacher but he never did anything about it so I just decided to let it go and learned a lesson. I stopped talking to A. Now a week ago, I saw my best friend was starting to talk a lot to A, I was worried about her so I after school, I decided to ask her what's up with her and A. She said he started messaging her for homework and they got closer, but she didn't like him in that way. Remembering what happened to me, I decided to tell her the whole story and she was disgusted (by what he did) and said she would stay away from him. But then she turned out to go out and tell people how I thought I was so special that someone would try to sexually harass me. A heard the story from her and decided to add more lies to make me completely looking like an attention seeker slut. The sad part was, everyone trusted them.   \n\n\nFast forward, my best friend decided to go on a date with A and the same thing happened: A sexually used her, and even took her photos without her consent to send them to his friends. My best friend is now depressed, A has been absent. AITA for not caring about what he did to her and that she's depressed? After all, I tried to warn her. ",

His house apparently smells very strong sometimes and he can see their eyes are glazed over/red. \n\nI am not against smoking weed at all, but for my uncle to do it while in the care of my brother seems very inappropriate. I again try to have a sidebar conversation and tell him that I don’t think it’s appropriate for your Uncle to be doing that while you’re visiting and that I don’t want my brother to be involved with weed/alcohol until he at least graduates high school. I explain to him that I didn’t partake until I graduated and explain that MY dad has had issues with alcoholism in the past so I am very cautious with myself when going out to bars. \n\nMy brothers dad had issues with drug abuse which ultimately led up to my mom and his divorce, so it was terrifying to me that he was being exposed to gateway drugs. \n\n\nI confronted my mom a few hours after dinner over text, which probably wasn’t the smartest but the thoughts couldn’t leave my head. \n\nShe actually got very upset with me and wouldn’t give me a definite answer as to: \nHow she found out\nWhy she never told me\nIs she still in contact with our Uncle \n\nShe threatened to head back to Chicago  and told me that I was the most disrespectful person for the way I was talking to her. \nShe started to push the topic back on me and falsely claim I drank in high school to which I kept denying because my first drink was weeks after I graduated and I clearly remember coming back home and puking out my second story bedroom window to which I never told her about. \n\nSo, am I the asshole? \n\n\nTL:DR\nI confronted my mom over claims my uncle gave my 12 yr old brother shots to which she stopped talking to me and claimed I was disrespectful. \n\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry if formatting is weird very solemn do I make posts on reddit. I would also like to TW for sexual harassment so if anyone's sensitive to that please be warned.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this is a really long story that starts in August I'm going to try to keep it short but here I go. I'm a first year in university and moving was a huge change and it took a huge emotional toll on me, for the first week I cried myself to sleep and I would text/call my mom nonstop, having anxiety and depression it was already hard enough for me to be able to open up and make new friends so I was already dealing with that situation. Anyways  I moved in with a girl (let's call her Sandy) I thought was super cool we had the same interests and she was nice and funny, a bit annoying but I still enjoyed her company nonetheless, we were getting along as well as roommates do until one day I came back from class and all hell broke loose. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walked into the dorm from class and we greeted each other I sat down at my desk and she turned off her TV and climbed into her bed, and started to masturbate right there in her bed for all of God's green earth to see. I started freaking out and I sat in shock as it happened afterward she went \"oh I have my bio lab\" and left I texted my sister and called my mom and ranted to her about it. After that I reported Sandy to my RA and we exchanged schedules and she said she wouldn't do it again but she \"didn't see the big deal.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll admit I got paranoid after the first encounter. I started spending less time in my room and started getting colder towards her. I was pissed off, I was gone for over an hour in class and she had the opportunity to deal with that then but instead she waited until I got back to the dorm, she greeted me and then she decided to touch herself. I started going to therapy over this because my mental health already was in a bad place and this triggered a spiral. Anyways there were two other instances when I thought she was masturbating while I was in the room and I reported her again she claims she didn't do it but who knows. She eventually moved out because she was mad that I had supposedly falsely accused her of touching herself in my presence again which I couldn't care less about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA while later I reported her to a mandated reporter and that person reported her to the Title IX office where an investigation was done, and they put her on probation. Basically, she's not in good standing with the university and if she does anything else to violate the policy the punishment would be more severe. But I can't help but think I've made a mountain out of a molehill, I just wanted her to face some sort of consequence for what she did but I'm worried I overreacted and ruined her future because of it. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Roommate masturbated while I was in the room I reported her and now she's on probation and I don't know if I overreacted.** ",

      "description": "AITA? My (28F) sister’s (31F) husband (31M) and I have a difficult relationship. When my sister and he started dating about 12 years ago he came on a family trip and got in the middle of a fight between my sister and me. After she struck me he put himself between her and me and being teenagers she continued to mock me behind his back. When I reached around him to push her he took my head and shoved me down into the bed I had been leaning on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings had been okay until last year while on a family trip to the Grand Canyon. He and my sister are married and have an infant daughter at this point which makes siteseeing challenging. After seeing a few lookout spots over a couple hours we were all in a van together coming up on another lookout. My father was driving and he gets overly dramatic if he doesn’t get clear instructions on whether to stop so we just told him to stop. Everyone decided to get out except my BIL who said he was going to wait with the baby and shut his eyes. At the time my niece was sleeping so it seemed fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father and I took the longest to return to the car (30 min). When we got there I could tell that my BIL was in a bad mood but I didn’t know why. I guess the baby had started to cry not long after we left the car so he was left to calm her down by himself. We pile back into the car and get on our way. My mother starts doing this profuse apologizing thing that always gets my dad irritated but she was directing it at my BIL. She was apologizing for stopping at the lookout. Not knowing what had happened I tried to deescalate like I’m used to with my parents. I said “it’s fine, if someone doesn’t want to stop they’ll say they don’t want to stop.” Within seconds my BIL was cussing me out. I tried to explain that I didn’t mean anything by it but he wouldn’t accept it. Admittedly I did end up telling him that he’s been a grouchy jerk the whole time, but I had no malicious intent with the original comment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to tonight, a year later on another family trip. We’re playing scattegories and he’s 20 points ahead of me and almost everyone else. Some of the answers are BS and I challenge a few regardless of who it is. I had a bad feeling that he was going to get mad because he’s competitive so I made sure to ask if anyone disagreed with my answers if they were a stretch. His answer for “Furniture” that start with F was “fan”, and “things associated with money” that start with H was “heap”. After challenging a few of his answers he freaked out on me again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I’m done coming on these trips. I adore my niece but I can’t stand acting friendly with him after he treats me so poorly. My boyfriend would never treat my sister that way and if he did I would take issue with it. So I’m cutting my trip short and leaving in the morning and don’t plan to participate in future trips with him. AITA?",

Mom's sister hated him for putting my mom through all of that, but tolerated him for the sake of us kids.

Father doesn't know yet, because it's not his business at this point. Her immediate family need time to process.\n\nI know that my uncle, aunt's husband, was somewhat friends with my father for a while, although their friendship has faded over the years. Uncle was there to support all of us, especially my father, when my half brothers died.\n\nI feel that if my father knows about my aunt's passing, he'll want to go to the funeral. This would be wildly inappropriate, given her feelings towards him but if he finds out on his own, or if my siblings and I wait to tell him until after the funeral, he'll throw a fit that no one tells him anything. He's also likely to throw a fit if we tell him not to go to the funeral.\n\nI don't know if it has any bearing, but he did not tell my mom about his brother passing a year ago, and my siblings and I informed her later, after any family events. She is okay with all of this, and even said the most she would have done is send her condolences to my other uncles.",

During my first few months of living here I would wash all the dishes just to keep the kitchen clean, however that was hopeless because they would just take advantage of me washing the dishes and leave all their stuff out for me to wash. I started to just separate the dishes and pots that I bought from the others and put them in a separate cabinet and put a sign up saying that if my roommates use them they need to wash and put them away immediately, I do not care what they do with their own dishes. This leads to tonight, I had a rough day and come home to make some dinner, to see that my roommates have used my pot and all my cups because all of theirs were dirty because they didn't wash them. My pot was in the fridge with someones left over mac and cheese so I texted the roommate who I thought it was and he didn't respond for over an hour so I threw out his mac and cheese and washed the pot and cooked my dinner. AITA for throwing his dishes away and being so stubborn about my dishes?  --- The roommate whose mac and cheese it was finally responded and said I should not have thrown it away because it was his dinner.",

To make matters worse, a guy who I had sort of a history with and now passionately hate, APPARENTLY likes her. I know for a fact that he doesn't, she used to like him while I still did and he was not interested in the slightest. A also casually brings this up even though she knows how upset I get whenever I hear even his name. But she has this idea in her head that every boy that talks to her has a crush on her. That's not how the world works.\n\nI'm seriously considering, however, that I'm the real asshole. Mainly because I was talking to one of our mutual friends who I actually trust, and sent some screenshots of our chats while blocking the name out. I made sure she knew that I wasn't there to talk bad about A because she's always fun to talk to and (sometimes) there for me, and that she was just currently pissing me off big time and I needed to rant. \n\nThoughts? Is she being conceited? Or am I just being a salty asshole that no one likes me and a bitch for talking to my other friend about her? \n\n(Sorry for probably many grammatical/spelling errors, typing on my phone and can't even be bothered to go back and reread.)",

      "description": "So there’s this song that I really love, and in it there’s a line that I’ve been obsessed with since I first heard it. I told myself that I would get it tattooed one day. I just never had the money, until now.\n\nWell a few months ago I met this girl who I quickly formed a friendship with. She was my first friend in this town since I moved here last new years. We’ve got a lot of shared interests and our personalities are compatible. Overall, I don’t think she’s a bad person or anything, I actually really like her. Anyway, when we were first becoming friends, I showed her the song and told her the tattoo idea because I was excited about it. Apparently that was a bad idea. She loved it. So much so that she got it tattooed herself a few weeks later, before I could.\n\nAt the time, I thought, “I guess I’ll just get another line from that song tattooed instead.” I was really upset but she had already gotten the tattoo so there wasn’t much I could do about it after that. \n\nHowever I now have the funds to get it tattooed. I decided to say fuck it and get the same lyrics tattooed, because it’s what I really wanted and I don’t want to compromise something important to me and permanent like this. \n\nI told her, and her reaction was “You’re gonna get that tatted???? Same thing as me??? they have like 500 songs isn’t there a different lyric you could get?” Which pissed me off, because it was my idea. She just had the resources to get it tattooed first. I told her that, and she’s being passive aggressive about it. Obviously, I know she can’t tell me what to do and that I can get those lyrics tattooed on me if I want. It’s not even gonna be in the same spot or in the same font.\n\nAm I being the asshole by still getting the tattoo instead of just letting it go or getting another lyric? This is upsetting me and I don’t want to get the tattoo if every time I look at it I just feel like I was an asshole in this situation. ",

      "description": "Right off the title it sounds like I’m an asshole lol. But hear me out, also this is my first post and on mobile so hope nothing formats weird \n\nAnyways, I’m a 20 year old male going to college in a big college town. I’ve been in the same apartment complex for a year or year and a half. It’s a 2 bedroom townhouse style because my little brother lives with our mom like 3ish hours away and sometimes likes to come visit. \n\nLike most college towns, there’s a pretty high amount of low income people in the area, my area included. As I’ve lived here, one of my neighbors, a single mom with 2 kids maybe 8 and 6 (I’m really bad at figuring out ages) have become pretty good friends. I walk to the local grocery store a lot and if the kids ever see me they ask if they can come, of course I say yes and they come and we talk about whatever is going on in their lives sometimes it’s pretty sad hearing about, I usually buy them a snack or treat or whatever, and they and their mom are really appreciative, usually once or twice a month they come with me. They’re super sweet kids and the mom is great, they got me a pack of cookies and a homemade card they made in school for Christmas and she always asks me over to dinner \n\nNow my mom is a single mother and I come from a pretty low income family myself. Now I have a great internship and a really nice job lined up and am making enough to be self sufficient. I’m curious if I would be an asshole or if it would be weird asking if her kids want to come over sometimes so she can have some time to herself. The older kid talks about not being able to play video games because they can’t afford to get all the stuff, and I have the things he wants to play and all that. I don’t want to act like “oh I’m better than you” and all that or be creepy asking them to come over. I just want to lend a helping hand because I know what that mom is going through",

      "description": "My mom was raised by her grandparents and always had a close relationship with them. So when I was 5 we moved into their house so my mom could help take care of them in their old age. By the time I was around 12 both of my great grandparents were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. My great grandpa passed away before he got too bad. My great grandma on the other hand was very sick. She had no short term memory anymore. She was in diapers. She forgot how to feed herself. She couldn’t even really walk anymore. For a while it was my mom and dad taking care of her, but shortly after my great grandmother reached this point in her illness, my mom got pregnant. As soon as my mom found out she was pregnant all of her responsibilities with my great grandmother fell on 13 year old me.\n\nI changed her diapers because it made my mom throw up, I fed her, I bathed her because my mom could t hold her up (all with some help from my siblings but it was for the most part all on me). My dad couldn’t help much because he worked a lot. So I was balancing middle/ high school and taking care of an 80 year old woman with Alzheimer’s. My grades started to slip and I became depressed. I couldn’t handle the stress of doing everything on my own but I had no choice. By freshman year I was suicidal. I’ve never admitted this out loud before but, as much as I loved my great grandmother, I was relieved when she passed away. This made me feel so guilty and added to my depression. I was actually hospitalized for a little while because I was suicidal. I never told my mom that my depression stemmed from this situation with my great grandparents. \n\nToday I am happy and have a great relationship with my mom, but I can’t help but have some resentment towards her for putting all of that responsibility on me at such a young age. AITA for resenting my mom? ",

      "description": "more like Who Is The Asshole (WITA), as it was a friend who asked me.\n\nSo a fight happened today. My best friend, lets call him Little, went head to head with an autistic kid today. We made a holographic pyramid in a different class for end of year fun, and this period we were chilling doing maths problems. Around the end of the period, we realised the autistic kid (who we will call Iron) had Little’s pyramid.\n\nHe started ripping it up and throwing it on the ground. Little went up to him and said for him to give him back his pyramid, but Iron just went\n\n“NO! I dont give a fucking shit whos it is, its mine now.”\n\nLittle persisted and asked him again if he could have it back where at this point Iron got up and grabbed his arm and screamed some gibberish in his face. Little said “get off me!” and pushed him off him. At this point everything exploded.\n\nNow let me get some things clear. Iron is a 6 foot kid, while Little is a 50kg 4’11” asian kid. Theyve had multiple confrontations, mostly over Iron destroying or stealing Littles property, and usually Little gets in trouble because the head of house has a bit of favouritism for Iron. He is around the ASd level 2 or 3 range, so it usually gets excused as a “incident” than something wrong.\n\nIron grapples Little, and Little does nothing, since he learned his lesson about hitting him before. It got to the point where 3 people were trying to pull Iron off Little and the fact that Little’s face was tomato red that he fought back. I pull him by the arms and hold him for a bit, then I let him go. He goes for a Goku kick to the hip, but im out of the class by the time he does it. He stomps around terrorising the other students for a bit while he and I are pulled out of class by a group of teachers, and then the day ends as normal.\n\nHe feels really bad and worried now so im posing the question to you:\n\nWITA?",

      "description": "Throwaway, but I lurk here. I posted about this in r/justnomil, but I wanted to post here to get some different opinions.\n\nI’m (30F) getting married to my fiancé (30M) in the fall. We’re both very independent people and are paying for this wedding on our own. I already have my dress, and we have the venue, colors, and other major details planned out. \n\nMy mother passed away a few years ago. My dad recently got remarried and my new stepmom has personally reached out to me to offer her help and will be helping with certain tasks. My other family members have also volunteered to do things.\n\nWe are not close to my fiancé’s side of the family. We rarely talk to his mother and don’t spend much time with her because she’s a very difficult person to be around.\n\nMy fiancé saw his mom earlier this week and she had a full on crying fit about the wedding. She’s hurt because she thought she would be going dress shopping with me and would do mother of the bride (MOB) stuff because my mom isn't around. She is threatening to not go because she feels so left out. \n\nShe hasn’t reached out to me to ask me any questions about planning at all. We also don’t talk. Also, traditionally, mothers of the groom (MOG) don’t do much. I don’t know why she expected to take on a central role in wedding planning when she isn’t a big part of either of our lives and she has made no effort to contact me.\n\nShe’s saying I should be the one the reach out to her and make her feel welcomed. I disagree. I don’t think the couple getting married should need to reach out to people, and that people that want to help should (and have) made that known. She also seems fixed on MOB tasks and doesn't seem interested in doing MOG stuff.\n\nWe’ve also decided that we can’t trust her any important tasks if she’s already threatening to not come. But I still feel bad that she’s apparently gutted over this.\n\nSo, AI/AWTA for not involving my fiancé’s mom in wedding planning?",

So I knew it would be a hit. \n\nIn Nov I found out he had been lying to me about his herpes status from the start of the relationship. He revealed that he was diagnosed a decade ago. (Even when I straight up asked that he get tested for everything before we had sex and talked about sexual health. He lied about his results.)\n\nAnd then the week before the game, I found out that he had been talking about our relationship, from day 1, with a friend of his with whom I work. I specifically asked him to please talk to anyone about us **except** that one friend because my work is a big gossip mill and I try to stay out of the grind as much as possible. Well, I’m definitely fodder now. \n\nObviously, I broke up with him after the herpes reveal but I lingered a little because I’m dumb. Even taking him to a fancy steak dinner for his bday the first week of December. \n\nThe day of the game I text him his ticket, thinking I’d just eat the costs of my ticket. He says thank you but I wanted to go with you. I can’t in good conscious use the ticket after everything I’ve done so “why don’t you try to sell them.”   \nI say, “You’re right you don’t deserve them I was just trying to keep a promise. I will try to sell them.”   \nThen I posted them up for resale. \n\nWe keep texting a bit, him saying he’s so sorry, he misses me, and me saying he’s such a jerk. The tickets sold in less than 30 mins. I severely underpriced them, just trying to get my money back. And I text him, “Sold. Thanks for telling me to sell them. Don’t know why I didn’t think of selling them. Nostalgic, I guess.”   \n\nSuddenly he’s pissed.   \n“I can’t believe you sold them just like that. I was trying to be humble and you sold them.”  \n“You must really hate me.”   \n“You only sent me one of the tickets.”  \n“I’m so pissed, I’ve wanted to go to that game for two years!”  \n\nI truly don’t understand. I sent him the stupid ticket without him even asking, no strings attached. He certainly wasn’t even expecting the ticket at that point. And he’s the one that suggested I sell them to try to get my money back. I actually didn’t realize what a hot commodity they were. And I kept them until the day of because I knew I might go with him because, like I said before, I’m dumb.   \nBut now he’s acting like l did something incredibly wrong, like kick a puppy or lie about herpes. AITA?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "My stepbrother and I have a very bad relationship. I don't want to go into details, but please understand I did cause some of the conflicts, and that it is not an entirely one sided ordeal. But basically, my stepbrother is extraordinarily hateful towards me, and has gone out of his way to act very childish towards me. The cause for this is that around 2 years ago, I used to be a massive bitch, essentially. I was the entitled, gossiping, bitchy sister who acted very narcissistic. I lost all my friends and realized it was my fault. Since then I have had a wake up call and since changed my behaviors radically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, my brother refuses to see that I've changed, and I don't know why. I've made peace with those I've wronged. I've apologized sincerely and made amends to anyone I hurt. But, despite it being years later, he goes out of his way to gossip and spread rumors about me that aren't true. For example, when I quit my job as a stocker at Walmart, half the town believed it was because they caught me using drugs due to him gossiping and lying about the real reason I quit, which was to upkeep my grades in school, since they were failing.\n\nNonetheless, Ive decided to share no mutual friends with him. My friend, who I'll call X, by some chance, have a class with my brother. About X, I want to be very clear I have no problems with her behavior, just not when it's with my stepbrother, who I have a bad relationship with. She catches feelings extremely easy and sleeps around quite a lot, especially if she likes the guy. I don't care and remind her always to be safe because she can be careless about it, i.e. not wearing condoms. I just don't want her to do it with my stepbrother.\n\nI told her of my past with him and explained that I do not care if she talks to him in the class, but if she befriends him, then I'll exit myself out of the picture because of the rule. I don't want to control who she's friends with (this is the only thing I ever threatened to end our friendship over) and that It's entirely her choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I said I don't care if she talks to him in the class, within a week, she took that as a green light and has a crush on him, sleeping with him, and going to partying with him.\n\nI cut her off and now her sister is calling me an asshole, and she's telling everyone I said it was okay and that I'm just a controlling bitch. BTW, she was my date to prom, and I'm getting called an asshole because I cancelled on her a week before prom, and that I was being controlling and jealous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Me and my brothers relationship is rocky, and I have a rule to not share mutual friends. My prom date, also best friend, has a class with him, I told her I don't care if they talk in that class, just don't become friends. Within a week she's his friend, sleeping with him, and partying with him. I ended the friendship with her a week before prom and now I'm being called the asshole by her sister. AITA?",

      "description": "Me (F32) and my BF(M32) have been together 4 years. Every year, his parents book a week long holiday in June, for my BF, his son, and the parents. I've never been invited and I'm okay with it of course because I always want to encourage him to go and spend time with his family. I should also note that his parents have never accepted me, whenever I see them his parents ignore me, they've never asked me anything about myself or tried to include me in anything. \n\nLast week, his mum told us that she's booked the holiday and gave us the dates theyd booked and they're over my birthday. My birthday is in June but it's never clashed with their holiday before. Originally my boyfriend assumed that because she told us while I was there, it meant I was invited but we've since discovered I'm not invited. \n\nHe said he won't go if he doesn't want me to, because it's my birthday, but I can tell he really wants to go. He also really wants them to invite me, but honestly even if I was I wouldn't want to go because I don't like the idea of spending my birthday with people who don't like me much. But I don't want to tell him not to go, because it's a week away with his parents and his son, and they always have a really lovely time. I've told my boyfriend a bit of how I feel but I feel really guilty like I'd be stopping him having a good time. I don't want to be a bitch, but I'm also frustrated because this could have been resolved if they just asked my boyfriend what dates would work instead of just booking them, and a bit hurt that after 4 years they still don't know when my birthday is (I don't expect them to know the exact date, but they could have at least learnt which month it was in)",

      "description": "I've been a part if a grop of adults that get together to play DND every week for about 3 years now. We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n",

He would tell me things like \"you're so retarded were gonna make you wear a helmet to school\" or when I would cry he would say \"you're acting like a girl you pussy.\" \n\nOne time at dinner I told him I wanted to kill myself and he told me I'm too much of a pussy to do it. All of this happened when I was 12. The list goes on and on. \n\nWhen I was younger he would toss me around, pin me against the wall. He even went as far as choking me once which I'm pretty sure he doesn't even remember because he was extremely drunk.\n\nIm 21 now and he seems to have changed now and he doesnt drink as much anymore and he doesnt get angry or does anything abusive to me anymore. My mother tells me he constantly asks how I'm doing and what's going on with me. When he tries to talk to me though or says hey I dont even look at him and barely muster anything out. I havent ever had an actual conversation with him.\n\nI feel no love or sympathy for him at all because of what hes done to me.

      "description": "I’m sorry for any mistakes, I’m not from an english speakibg country.\n\nMe and Zoe(not her real name) have been best friends since 10th grade with another girl, Ana. \nMe and Zoe moved to another city for college( different colleges but in the same city) and we’re actually roomates, while Ana went to college in another city. We still have our group chat where we keep in touch. \nSince the first months I’ve noticed that Zoe is starting to change a little bit but so was I because we met new people and had different experiences. However over the past like 6 months she’s been drinking heavily and goes clubbing all the time and comes home in the morning and she is really obsessed with impressing other people. She even started smoking occasionally which I know for sure we have agreed that we absolutely hate. \n\nShe also once tried some drugs and at that point i wasn’t even trying to say to her to be careful because she wouldn t listen anyway. Also she had a FWB situatioj with a boy that almost all her friends disagreed and she also slept with him while he had a girlfriend and she admitted she wasn’t feeling guilty at all. At this point i was unfortunately kind of disgusted with her because i absolutely hate cheating, but I havent expressed any of this feelings. \n\nAlso me and Ana the other friend from our trio have agreed that she has changed a lot and she feels that she s really kind of an aquintance rather than a friend. \n\nWhile i understant that in your 20s you grow up and kind of discover yourself but this seems like too much and a very drastic change and i really cant help but judge her and try to ignore when shes bragging about drinking and other stuff so that i dont encourage it. \n\nAlso our relationship kind of became sour and she definitely doesn’t really want to hang out with me and our other roomate (who is actually her cousin) even if we invite her. It feels like living with a stranger. \n\nSo AITA here? I cant help but feel like one because she was my bff and it feels like a too drastic change and i dont recognize this person she has became but at the same time i feel i should just shut up and support her like a real friend would do. \n\n\nTldr: my bff from highschool had a really drastic change in the first year of college and i feel like shit for judgeing her when maybe i should support her because maybe she s just discovering herself.

Now because even paragraphs are exhausting and painful to write I mostly type my progress, print, sign, and glue it into the notebook, which what my teacher told me to do. off. My partners have been giving me dirty looks when I refuse to write a long paragraph, well long to at me least, and type instead. The thing is, my handwriting speed and neatness is very bad and if I tried to write in the notebook and have it be readable, it would take forever and be extremely painful. I told them about my disability and they didn't to fully understand it but said I would still have to my share and I'm trying but it seems like I'm leaving them to more work while I just type and print.",

      "description": "This happened today and I’m still confused about whether or not I’ve actually done anything wrong.\n\nThis morning, I was supposed to go back to university about 2 hours away from my hometown. My mum asked me to be fully packed by 10am because she had a race to get to, and she wanted to leave in enough time.\n\nShe comes to talk to me at 9am, and tells me to start getting ready. I have a shower, get dressed, and start packing. Ordinarily, an hour would be plenty of time to do these tasks, but I have quite a lot of stuff to pack (suitcase of clothes, and two medium sized boxes of electronics and other stuff). I’ve packed most of my electronics ahead of time, so they’re not much of an issue. As I pack my suitcase, my mum comes to see how I’m doing and begins getting frustrated at how long I’m taking. Personally, I thought I was going a perfectly reasonable pace as I was trying to not to crease all my clothes, but whatever, I’ll pick up the pace a bit. \n\nAt about half past 9, I get called downstairs to say goodbye to my grandma, which takes up about 5 minutes. I’m aware that time is slipping away, so I try to get finished as quickly as possible. My mum comes to nag me twice more as I attempt to get everything packed.\n\nAt 9:50, she gives me an ultimatum: get everything downstairs and in the car in 5 minutes, or she’ll leave without me. At this point, I am almost completely packed, save for a few things still to round up. I try to tell her this to convince her to wait a little longer, but she just reiterates her ultimatum.\n\n9:55 comes around, and I have finished everything but the suitcase. My mum, however, has had enough and storms off. She leaves without me, leaving me feeling pretty pissed off that she couldn’t just wait a few more minutes for me, or help me take stuff downstairs instead of just standing at the door glaring at me, especially seeing as I finished packing at about 10 past 10.\n\nNow my mum is asking me to “apologise for my behaviour” before she’ll take me back to university tomorrow.\n\nAITA for not getting ready sooner, or am I right in thinking that I actually haven’t done anything wrong, much less anything worth apologising for?",

One of the saleswomen is a thirty six year old woman who ive grown close too over several years (ive been here since i was 19).\n\nShe is amazingly sexy, even for an older woman. She and myself have had an unspoken thing for a long time, but she was married and no lines were crossed. \n\nHer husband was the head mechanic at our work who recently died of a heart attack. He was in his late 50s and overweight with a history of health problems. He died in his bed.\n\nShe was broken up about it obviously and has been seeking me out for comfort. We were already very close and she asked me if i could make her \"feel good\" as shes been miserable.\n\nWe had sex in her home, in the same bed he died in. Idk im pointing that out, i didnt think about it at the time.\n\nWeve had sex two times after and im addicted to her. Ive told my best friend who sort of made a cringe face and said that its kinda odd and that he would never do it himself with a widow like that where her husband died after only 2 months.\n\nI think our history and me getting her through this time makes it deeper than that.

She’s a lot more warm with other significant other’s of the family. I’ve talked to my boyfriend about this and he generally agrees with me. I don’t dislike her, but I also can’t really say she’s my favorite person either.\n\nHer daughter’s birthday party is coming up, and initially my boyfriend said (not word for word), “eff her, she’s a bitch. I’m not going.” The party is on a Saturday, and I work on Saturdays so I wasn’t really planning on going anyways. I’m also not really close to the daughter.\n\nNow, today my boyfriend says that he’s going, and I was like, “oh, you’re going?” And he says, “yeah, I’m going for the food.” Then I proceeded to joke around and be all like, “if you hadn’t gone at least I would have *respected* you because  now you’ve gone back on your word” (kinda like that episode in Friends where Phoebe points out how Ross goes back on his beliefs on evolution). I even threw in a Naruto joke about how going back on your word isn’t “my ninja way.” So, I felt that with all these references, it was obviously a joke. He even laughed at the first one. And THEN he made a complete 180 and was like “quit shitting on me” and “why are you mad at me?” I just stopped talking after that.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole?",

So first I want to say that English isn't my first language and also this is my first post on here so feel free of correcting my grammar.\n\nOkay now my boyfriend and I have been living together for about a year and a half. I'm a person that enjoys sleeping but he seems like not having to sleep (always staying up till very late even tho he's waking up early) \nThe thing is that he's always waking me up with the noise of his phonr, at night, at 3 am or even at 6am and I always wake up and tell him to please lower the volume since I'm sleeping right next to him (sometimes even wen we're cuddling and I'm deeply asleep he puts a video on his phone (he usually fels asleep watching videos or series at night and most of the time I turn off the screen when he fels asleep so I can sleep) full volume right next to my ear at witch I wake up scared and tell him to lower the volume) \nBut this morning it annoyed me the most because:\n1-. Last night I feel asleep at 9:30pm as he was in the living room playing, came to the room aroun 11pm with a full volume video on his phone waking me up.\n2-. This morning he went to the bathroom around 6am and keept watching a video with full volume for over 20 minutes at witch I went to the bathroom told him to lower the volume and closed the bathroom door\n3-. When he came back to bed I told him again how annoyed I am with him waking me up every time he's watching a video like he can't even be considerated towards my sleep at witch he said \"you could wake up with me as well\" like??? No I'd rather sleep tru the night and rest properly for when I'm leaving the house to work\n4-. After that he kept watching videos next to me and telling me things like \"listen to this\" until like 7:30 am that I asked him what time it was and he COMPLAINED THAT I WAKED HIM FROM A DREAM\nI gave him a petty answer like \"oh what a shame right?\" And left for work and left him sleeping  (we both work and have really flexible schedules)\n\n\nSo how can I tell him that his bad sleeping is annoying me without being an asshole or without him brushing it off and satisfying that I'm just lazy??\n\nSorry it's too long I'm pretty frustrated\n\nTD;LR How do I tell my boyfriend he is disturbing my sleep waking me up at random moments of the night/morning with really loud Facebook videos or anime when I'm sleeping next to him or watching videos in bed until he fels asleep without being an asshole or coming across as lazy or overreacting?\n",

      "description": "I work in a public building as a receptionist/ cashier. We have a large number of disabled visitors on a daily basis, both physical and mentally disabled people, some with some without carers. We have several regulars who come in on the same days and times every week. For the past 2 years there has been one guy who's behaviour has slowly become creepier towards me and 1 other receptionist. \n\nHe comes in every day around 4pm, our dead period, often he is the only customer at the time. He pauses at the desk to wave at us, then walks in to the building. Walks around for 15mins. Then leaves, pausing briefly again to wave. \nThis is what he does to everyone. They just say \"hi\" \"goodbye\" and wave back. \n\nOver the year he started to act odd, until it reached the point where I felt so uncomfortable around him that I will leave the desk and hide if I see him coming. \n\nTo me, and one other girl, he will enter the building, stand and wave. If we are with another customer or on the phone, he will stand directly in front of us and wave, until we respond. \nThen he will stand there. Just stand there directly in front of us motionless like a statue not saying or doing anything except blow in our faces or open mouth cough. This will continue until we walk away, or someone else comes in to reception. \nIf we are not at the desk he actively hunts us down and stares at us. \n\nFor my coworker, he has gone a step further having seen her walk to work and has started appearing waiting at a corner then stepping in front of her and doing his stare thing. \n\nWe have reported it at every stage to our managers. They have found us hiding from him. We have told every staff member in the building how uncomfortable we where about the situation. It is even on camera. But at every step of the way we get the same response \"yes but he's got problems.\" \"He's clearly disabled. Be more patient\" \"he's just got some learning disabilities, it's fine\". Yes he is disabled, but his behaviour was becoming a worrying problem for us. How far will it go? \n\nEvery year we get customer service training, so decided to take the trainer aside to get some useful advice.  She specialised in dealing with difficult customers. She gave some excellent advice. \n\nSo for the last 6 months our interactions with him have gone like this. \n\nHe walks in waves, stands still. \n\nWe smile \"hello, do you have a question for me?\" \n\nHe says \"no\" and stares \n\nWe say \"if you don't have a question, you can go straight in\" and we physically point in the door. \n\nHe nods AND GOES AWAY! he looks round and leaves without problem. Amazing! Such an easy salutation. \n\nNope. One day. For the first time ever. He comes in with a carer. And this carer doesn't like how I speak to him. She puts in a corporate complaint about how I was rude and discriminatory to this disabled guy. Luckily my direct manager took my side, but is one of the only people who did. She has saved me from any formal reprimand, and has written a letter of apology to the guy. But I'm still getting comments about it from other people, that I did something wrong or should never have made a thing out of it all. I get told he was harmless, and now doesn't come in as much because of it.\n\nMy manager invited the carer to come in to discuss the situation, she never came in. This past month he has stopped coming in as much, which I'm not sad about. When he does he ignores use completely.  \n\nSo am I the shitty person I'm feeling made out to be, who discriminated against someone with learning disabilities and stoped them from visiting somewhere he enjoys daily.because, I feel like I was just trying to protect myself from creepy stalkerlike behaviour.

      "description": "This probably belongs here?? Idk where else this post would fit. This is my first time posting anywhere. \n\nThe gist of what happened: I entered to bathroom, locked the door and sat on the toilet to use it. Less than 10 seconds later my mom knocks on the door and tells me to open the door since she needed to get a comb. I told her that I would get it for her after I got up from the toilet. \n\nShe then started to rage about how it’s “disrespectful to make her wait for me to finish before she could get what she needed”, and that I should get up from the toilet to unlock the door for her. \n\nThe bathroom in my house is narrow. I can comfortably lie down with my head touching the door and my toes touching the base of the toilet and then some extra centimeters. (I’m 5’3 if that’s important.) So I couldn’t just lean over and open it, not to mention I’m still on the toilet. I calmly told her I would finish up as quickly as possible, but she got extremely angry when I said that and tried to yank open the door while ranting about how disrespectful I’m being. \n\nAfter I’m done and I exit the bathroom she complains again about how disrespectful I’m being and continued to rant about it for the next two hours. She didn’t even go inside the bathroom to get the comb she needed. \n\nWas I actually being disrespectful? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "This is going to be a long one, so please grab a snack and get ready.\n\nBefore I go into detail, I want to tell you some background information. A few months ago my brother (we'll call him B) was diagnosed with level 3 ASD. For those of you who don't know, level 3 is the most severe, but each case is different. \n\nHe's also completely non-verbal, along with having a condition known as Pica. Pica is a condition in which someone will try and eat non-edible objects such as paper, rocks, etc. B will try to chew/eat anything he can get into his mouth, at times its been so bad that he's coughed up a small paper ball from tiny scraps of paper. He also has incredible strength for his age and little to no fear of pain. This combination leads to a daredevil of a toddler. This of course means he pretty much needs constant supervision and attention. \n\nThe thing is however, watching him isn't really the problem. Watching my siblings is something I've done for years (albeit not by choice) so it really isn't a problem for me. I love my parents dearly, and I know they love me too, but I'm getting to my breaking point. Everytime I come home, I'm either watching B or getting my 6yo sister off of the bus while my mom takes a nap with B. There's been times where they've pulled me out of school early to watch him. Every time I ask if someone else can watch him I get the spiel:\n\n\"We don't trust anyone else with him\" \"we can't afford a babysitter like that\" \"they won't change him enough (he has very sensitive skin, sitting in a dirty diaper for more than a few minutes will result in a rash)\" \n\nI understand that they're worried about other people watching them, but why can't they? They always find a reason to leave me with him, and my dad in particular is the worst with this. If he has plans, he will ALWAYS leave early and come home late. A week ago my dad came home 2 hours late without telling me at all. Neither of them are good at communication, so whenever I call them 9/10 they won't answer. I'm worried for the day that there's an emergency and they don't respond. \n\nI've tried to explain this to them, and how it makes me feel used, but each time I'm essentially told that it's my \"familial duty\" to help them and that the reason I babysit so much is because they're working so they can feed me. That it's normal for people my age and in my circumstance to do what I do. At times it feels like they're trying to guilt trip me over them having to fo their jobs as parents, and like I'm some burden. They both had horrible childhoods, and I truly believe that they think that their parenting is normal.\n\nGood news however, is that I convinced them to pay me to do it, however I do not get payed Every time I babysit, and when I am payed, it's typically not much.\n\nAITA for feeling this way? Am I being selfish here like they say or do you think it's not my responsibility? There's much more I can say, but I maxed out the character limit, so feel free to ask for more information.\n",

      "description": "I currently live in a two bedroom apartment with two roommates (married couple). For a number of reasons, right now we are temporarily all sleeping in one room. I usually eat a late-night snack around 10 PM or so but regardless, I usually wake up around 2 or 3 AM pretty hungry. The way our situation works (again for a multitude of reasons), one of my roommates has all of the snacks and I don't have any direct/easy access to any food, so I have to wake her up to give me a snack. Usually I end up waking the guy up too since we are all in the same room.\n\nIf I don't eat at 3 AM and just wait until they get up around 6 or 7 (or later) I would be very hangry/cranky the entire half of the night and literally crying because I am so hungry. Currently, neither of my roommates is working so even if I wake them up for a snack, it's not like they have anything to do in the morning so they can sleep in. \n\nAITA for waking up my roommates for a 3 AM snack every night?\n\nEDIT: State is MA and I am a 6 week old newborn/baby.

We were at the mall and suddenly she basically shrieked and sat down on a bench with her head sideways and asked me to rub her neck.

So I did research, used the reddit dogs forum, gave him a huge document with training methods, information about the breed and their needs (I think it's unfair to have a working dog when you live in the city and work 12+ hour days), life enrichment, aggression minimisation, socialisation, you name it.\n\nThere were a few scuffles here and there but it didn't seem too bad, and can be expected with 4 dogs under 1 roof... \n\nBut then, almost a year after moving in together, I come home to find blood EVERYWHERE - she's attacked one of the dogs, cue huge vet bills and weeks of healing a punctured throat, antibiotics, wound washing, painkillers, pureed food etc.\n\nI do the research and book a specialist to come to the house, she gives us advice for how to attempt to fix it all, the biggest being to walk her more, train her more, enrich her life and keep them separate 100% of the time.\n\nIt's a huge undertaking but I agree to it all, so long as my fiance does her exercise - I have small dogs because constant walking and fetch just aren't for me. He walks her every few days still and does about 10% of the recommended training. I researched weighted vests do the walks would be more tiring - never bought one.\n\nNext week, while we were out, a door wasn't properly latched, came home to find blood everywhere, even up the walls, for a second time. She's attacked another of the dogs and I'm off to the vet again in a blubbering mess. Cue weeks of healing again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him that day that I was no longer happy living like that. Opening one door then shutting another and needing to do separate toilet breaks and alternate which dogs get cuddles, where to feed them, all the separation stuff! We are trying to home her with his brother. I love her dearly and I've been in tears over this but it's just making life too hard, I'm always scared I'll come home to a dead dog :'(\n\nSo many of his friends have told me off, \"she was here first\", \"how dare you\", \"if you expect him to get rid of his dog then you should get rid of yours\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for expecting her to be rehomed?

      "description": "I just got a seasonal job for the holidays (I should mention it’s retail). I’ll only be with them for three months or so, but I need the extra money.\n\nWhen I went in for the initial onboarding process, I informed my new manager that I would need to call a few days off—I did the math, and it was a total of 6 days. Two are for a job I already work and have already been scheduled for, and 4 were for family vacations that have been planned since the beginning of the year. I wanted to call them off before I was officially signed on so we wouldn’t have to talk about them again because I absolutely hate asking for days off.\n\nWhen I told her this, she essentially brushed me off and told me that she couldn’t take any day requests from me because I wasn’t in the system yet. She didn’t bother to take any notes or anything, and essentially acted like it wasn’t a big deal and that we’d deal with it when I came in for my first shift. Fair enough.\n\nI went in last Thursday and had a really great first day, but upon looking at the schedule, I discovered that she had scheduled me for one of the exact dates I needed to ask off—it was for one of the family vacations I mentioned; it had been planned since March. I told my manager that I had needed that day off and she basically told me “Sorry, it’s your problem now, find somebody to cover it.” Problem is, I didn’t know anybody to ask as it was my first day. I went into our storewide group chat and asked if anybody would be available and almost everybody has declined, even after I offered to buy whoever took it lunch and pay them an extra $50 for their troubles. No dice.\n\nThe girl who trained me is an angel on earth, and essentially told me that it would be okay if I called in sick for that day, being that the shift isn’t for another two weeks and that our manager has more than enough time to get somebody on it. She even told me she would stay past her shift to cover me if they needed. All in all, she told me it wasn’t a big deal. I felt better, but my fear is that being that I’m only a seasonal employee and I’ve barely worked, I feel like calling off without getting an official cover is wrong, and could be grounds to get me fired. I’ve never worked retail before, so I’m not entirely sure what the law of the land is.\n\nSo here poses the question, am I the asshole for wanting to call in sick that shift? ",

      "description": "I am pro life. I believe that abortion is taking away the life of another human. That being said, I don't think people who have abortions are bad people. I understand that they do not view an unborn child as a human life, and thus are not affected by abortion in the same way that I am.\n\nMy girlfriend and I had been together for 2 years. We both recently graduated from universities and were going to move in together. Neither of us were ready for a child quite yet. However, despite using many forms of contraception, my ex got pregnant.\n\nThough I did not want a child yet, I was in a place where I could financially support a child and give them a good life. I told my girlfriend that I wanted her to keep the baby. She told me she didn't. I told her that aborting a child goes against everything I stand for, and that if she went through with this I  wouldn't be able to stay with her. I understand that in the end, I can't stop her or force her to have the child, so I didn't try. I told her how I felt about it, and she told me she was going to abort it anyways.\n\nSo she did. I broke up with her, and she was devastated. She said she didn't think I was serious and that she should mean more to me than an unborn child. While I respect that she has the right to get an abortion if she so chooses, I just cannot be in a relationship with someone who would.",

There are people pan handling at every light, in front of every convenience store and liquor store. I never have cash on me and I am pretty damn poor myself. I don't have much to give away. But they have started to become very pushy.\n\nThey will ask you if you have spare change, you will say sorry you don't have any cash, they will say, well can you buy me some food and you will say you can't afford it and they will keep going with well it is only a dollar and keep pushing until someone else shows up for them to ask.\n\nSo this morning I was late for work and was rushing into 7-11 for my morning coffee. A homeless person asks for change and instead of engaging and having spend the time to reject him 50 times I just ignore him and keep walking. So he follows me and says, \"Please, I am just asking for a little help\" and I keep walking. I go inside and he rushes infront of me and tells me off. Something along the lines of, \"How can you ignore another human being? You could at least just tell me know. I am homeless but I am still a person, you are such a fucking asshole!\"\n\nI respond with, \"Dude, I got nothing for you, I am in a hurry to get to work, get the fuck out of my face!\" and I push past him. I ended up getting so many dirty ass looks that I just left without my coffee.\n\nSo am I an asshole for ignoring the homeless guy?",

      "description": "Hi Reddit! So I’m 18f and I’m a senior in high school right now. I’ve applied to a bunch of colleges and gotten accepted to a few that I really like (re: a tiny little college I got to visit and fell in love with and is also relatively cheap to go to on scholarship), but I DIDN’T apply for our local public university. It’s a great school, but I’ve been waiting my whole life to leave the state (and telling everyone I meet that I’m gonna move away ASAP), and I really would rather not.\n\nThe university is only about 45 min from my house, and my mom wants me to go there so that I can go to school and live at home to save me some money. But things have always been really tense with my mom (she has a tendency to blow up small things and then ignore me until I apologize even if I wasn’t in the wrong), and I’ve been looking forward to the idea of not having to be around her as often anymore. In fact, the best week of my life was probably when I was at a week long stayaway camp where I didn’t have to see her (ironically on the campus of the university I didn’t apply to). \n\nAnd even though I have a pretty good scholarship to my tiny little college I’m in love with, she’s still talking about how much I should stay at home, to save money while I get my degree, and how taxing it’ll be for me to travel home for holidays and summers.\n\nThe kickers here are that:\n1) My parents aren’t paying a single dime\nfor my college tuition, it’s all gonna be on me\n2) My mom constantly belittles me for even wanting to go to college. I want to study Psychology and eventually get a PhD, but she’s always making underhanded (or usually, loudly on the phone with her friends) comments about how I “won’t make it in college” and how I “should look into being a plumber, they make bank annually” (no hate on plumbers, their jobs are important af, but that’s not my path)\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for not wanting to stay with my mom anymore and for running to an out of state college ASAP?",

I know this is important to her to game with them and I know it's what she wants to do.\n\nThis issue arises when I spent some time with my family having a few drinks and playing a few games to usher in the new year. She felt that I wasent living upto my end of the deal and helping her celebrate the way she wanted to. I made sure that I split my time to game with her and friends and time with my family all up I believe I spent about 6 hours with her and 2-3 with family. \n\nShortly before midnight she got upset and went offline so it wasent until about 12:20 that we exchanged happy new year and I said happy birthday.\n\nSo am AITA for trying to keep everyone happy and splitting my time between them? I feel bad that I didn't game like she thought we would but I would have felt bad if I didn't spend time with family either.\n",

In my youth (late teens/early 20s) I wasn't very sexually active even though I *wanted* to be, and it did a bit of a number on me. The majority of people my age (girls and guys), had their sexual escapades and are either now settled down (married) or dating (looking for serious relationships). \n\nThey don't have the sexual insecurities that I have, because by and large, they ''had their fun'' so to speak. \n\nAs a result of this, I put a lot of effort into improving my looks and social skills so that I could stand a chance. Now my current girlfriend is 21 years old. My girlfriend before that, was also 21. And the hookups I have had (only had a few really, not many) over the last few years, were with girls in their 20's.\n\nBasically, I just refuse to date a woman my own age, because they are far more experienced than me sexually. They've got a good decade over me. As a result of this, I refuse to date them.\n\nNow I 100% recognize that I've got a lot of life experience over a 20 year old, but if I'm forced to choose between a 20 year old without that much life experience and who hasn't slept around for more than a decade, versus a 30 year old woman who has similar life experience but has had loads of sexual hookups and outnumbers me by far sexually, I'm always going to choose the latter.\n\nThere's just no way in hell I would ever entertain the idea of dating a woman my own age unless under very specific circumstances. **If I had slept around and had all my fun during my early 20s, THEN I would date women my own age, but because I didn't, I now refuse to even consider dating them. This doesn't mean I hate them though, I'm friends with many women my own age, but I'd never date them.**\n\nSome of my friends don't like the fact that I'm dating a 20 year old, but I think they sort of lose the right to object because it's easy for them to say ''Date a woman your own age'' when they all had their sexual fun, whereas I didn't. Why should they have the right to tell me that? I'd like to see how they would feel under my circumstances. AITA?",

      "description": "I take the subway to commute to and from work every day. This happened earlier this week and it's been bugging me ever since.\n\nAs the train comes to a stop, people generally stand on either side of the door to make room for people coming off the train. I was standing closest to the door on one side and this woman was on the other side, with who I'm assuming was her friend standing behind her. It was rush hour so there were a lot of people trying to get on/off the train. The woman and I get on at the same time and we both start walking toward a pair of empty seats. She sits down first and I sit next to her. I think her friend (behind us) was trying to nudge her way through but I got to the seat first. \n\nThey didn't say anything but I could tell they were annoyed and the woman who was standing kept complaining about how much stuff she was carrying (she just had a purse and a small lunch tote). I don't ever expect that I get a subway seat, especially when I'm riding during a weekday morning, so I didn't think I did anything wrong. Even though I got there before the second lady, they were saying passive aggressive things and I felt like they were expecting me to let her sit because they were together. If she was an older woman or someone with a child I would have definitely given them the seat. Otherwise I think subway seats are fair game, especially because I was feeling nauseous and definitely preferred to sit. AITA?\n\nThis is a pretty minor problem compared to some other problems here, but I appreciate any opinions about what I did/should have done.\n",

      "description": "TL;DR : A guy in my school class likes to let the trash bin make a lot of noise squeaking since 2 years, already tell him that's really annoying for my ears, doesn't care, so today, I simulate a punch in his belly, didn't like it and I've been reprimanded by the teacher because I shouldn't be violent or show violence in any case.\n\nI still feel bad for what I've done, but I still think that the guy (let's call him Mike) deserved it (I mean, I didn't knock him out or something like that, he even admit he wasn't hurt at all by my punch).\n\n---\n\nSo, not really more infos than in the TL;DR, that's if you want more details on the story\n\nFYI, We are 23 and on last year of a master degree, so there's no bully or victim thing, I'm not a bully and was actually a victim younger. Mike is also not a victim at all, nobody's a victim or a bully in our class.\n\nMike likes to be funny and when he found that the trash bin is making a lot of noise (you know, that's the [kind of trash bin where you have to push the top to throw in something](https://images.prod.meredith.com/product/cbaf68981fbe7608414c0e8e7daade24/1510946016901/l/umbra-mezzo-trash-can-rainbow)) and the top is doing like 10 going and comings if you push it strongly enough, he started to push it at the maximum to make a lot of noises.\n\nI don't exactly remember how frequent he does it, but it must be around 2 times per week.\n\nAs I am not a morning person at all, I ask him rudely to stop that every time he does it in the morning. I can ignore the afternoon, but that's still annoying to me\n\nThis morning, we start class at 8AM (for me, that's a 6AM wake up) and he did it again. That was really too much and I was already up. So I walked to him and simulate a punch in his belly (stop my punch when my fist touched his belly) because words don't work.\n\nMike was really annoyed, repeating \"not cool man, not the belly !\" so I started to think \"shit, is he kinda weak on this part ?\"\n\nBut I ignore him, because I was still fed up because of the noise.\n\nAfter maybe one minute, the teacher is calling me and asking me to come with him out of the class. Mike was outside, crying.\n\nThen the teacher ask me some explanations, telling him that it has been 2 years that he is making that irritating noise and this time, this was too much for me. He tell me something like \"It's just a noise, and what you show if violence, and you shoudn't be violent in any case\"\n\nAfter that, Mike explains that life has been tough for him recently, mostly because of the oral presentation of the thesis we made yesterday and that's why he is crying right now. I think my punch was more like a trigger for him.\n\nI said sorry, didn't thought my act would hurt him and go back to class.",

      "description": "I (22M) have been dating her (21F) for a few months now and we are students at a pretty large college in the United States. Let me start off by saying that she’s not an alcoholic, she only goes out 1-3 times a week which is a pretty normal amount for a social outgoing person in college. However, whenever we do go out she always gets black out. Like there’s no in between, happy buzzed - it’s either completely sober or straight blackout. \n\nA few weeks after we first met and started seeing each other I was out of town and she got blackout and kissed a guy. We’d only met two weeks before then and hadn’t defined anything so I told her how’d that make me feel in the future and we defined an exclusive relationship. \n\n\nSince then, to my knowledge, there’s been no reason for me to not trust her when she’s gone out. But obviously there are nights where they do a girls night out, or I’m busy or want to do something with my friends. And she will still go out and get blackout drunk which makes me uncomfortable. I brought it up and explained that I think the behavior isn’t healthy and it’s not that I don’t trust her, it’s that I don’t trust other people and I want her to be safe because I’m not always gonna be out with her to watch out for her. She proceeded to get really upset and say that I’m accusing her of being an alcoholic and that I’m coming across as controlling in her social life. I’m not trying to seem controlling and tell her she can’t go out, I’m just asking that she doesn’t get so fucked up and put herself in a spot to be taken advantage of or do something dumb. \n\nSo am I the asshole for telling her I don’t want her to get that drunk when I’m not around? Am I coming across as controlling? Because like I said she’s given me no reason to believe that she can’t handle herself after we defined things. \n\ntl;dr: girlfriend gets blackout when going out. I told her I’m not comfortable with it and she said I’m being controlling and I should be able to trust her. ",

Our paycheck for each of us in the class was around 2100 (its not US currency as i do not want to state what country i live in). I planned to spend this money for myself but it was at this time our annual retreat for the class was coming up and my mom, who is the one supposed to pay for it, hasn't paid for it yet and this basically costed me my paycheck. So i was pressured to pay for it as it was coming close.\n\nI had hoped my mom would pay me back soon but it has been months and she hasnt. I kept asking for months to no success. Though i now have found out that recently my family is going through alot and needed alot of money just for the hospital that my grandmother was staying in and now i dont want to keep asking about the money she owes me. Just to also make clear though from the stuff i have been hearing these bills costs milions (again not in US currency). So reddit answer me am i the asshole? ",

I love her dearly and she is my best friend but she is the most self absorbed person I have ever met.\n\n During our teens she was beyond horrible to me but that's a very long story. Most of this stuff I brushed off because at the time she was undiagnosed and therefore unmedicated, for bipolar disorder. The trouble was though that as soon as my family found out it became 'don't make her upset. Just do what she wants.' And this set a bad habit for the future.\n\nThen I met my husband and moved out. By now we were both adults and despite still being a spoiled bitch, she had calmed down a lot and had become happier, funnier,  and usually an honest delight to be around. We were finally best friends like I had always wanted. \n\nNow my sister has no close friends at all and cycles from one majorly abusive relationship to the next. (The most recent being a violent drug dealer with gang ties who would hit her, steal her money, and cheat on her). Because of her lack of healthy relationships she really clings to me and is super protective.\n\nShe HATES my husband and uses any chance she can to talk shit about him. She even tried to figuratively blow up our wedding (that's a way longer story) and has been trying to get me to divorce my husband ever since all because \"he's a selfish asshole\".\n\nNow to be fair my husband has admitted her is both selfish and that most people think he is an asshole. He is sarcastic, very guarded,  sometimes rude, but he is also funny, sweet, caring, a hard worker, so loving and just so much more. I love him so damn much.\n\nIt's frustrating to me because she can tear my husband down all while dating and angrily defending the absolutely horrible men she goes for.\n\nMy husband has and would never cheat, be abusive in any way. Sure you can argue he is an asshole but he isn't anything compared to these guys. But now that we have moved to another city he is the horrible man who stole her sister.\n\nIt's reached a point where I feel like my heart is absolutely being torn in half. I know my husband doesn't like her either but usually he keeps it to himself. That's all I have asked of her and she can't even do that. I don't feel like I can live with this amount of toxicity anymore, it's having horrible impacts of my physical and metal health.\n\nWIBTA to cut contact with her completely?",

      "description": "Throwaway, because my friend knows my other account. I’ll try to give as much context as I can and excuse the formatting, I’m on mobile. \n\nSo my best friend[19] met this man [35] fresh out of high school when she was still 17 and he was 33 at the time. She told me about him, how he was sweet and caring, but I wasn’t so fond of him considering the huge age gap and I also wondered what would a man like him want to do with a 17 year-old? She also told me he has a kid with an ex-gf, but he didn’t get  custody of his kid, I asked her why, but she never really explained to me what exactly went on besides saying that his ex-gf was pretty crazy, which I thought was weird. Fast forward, she moved in with him last year and she recently just found out she’s pregnant. I was honestly devastated. She’s my best friend and I do wish her the best and I’m trying to be really supportive, but I didn’t think she’d want to have a kid so soon. I told her I never thought she’d want to have a baby so soon, but she said she’s “changed” which I get people have different life goals, if this is hers then cool. (Btw it wasn’t a planned pregnancy) Anyway, eventually I’m gonna have to meet him because she plans to throw a gender reveal party, but ever since she’s told me about him I have this eerie feeling about him. I just can’t seem to like him even though I haven’t met him and I don’t know why. I just can’t brush aside the huge age gap difference I think it’s extremely weird, but she says he makes her happy so there’s that. Does it make me an asshole for not wanting to lowkey meet him because I find him creepy for seeking a girl fresh out of high school and the fact that he doesn’t make an effort to visit his kid. \n\nIt’s just so weird because he’s old enough to be our dad if he were to have had a kid at age 16. \n",

      "description": "tl;dr at the bottom. \n\nI've posted the first half of this before (see post history), but this time, I have additional info. \n\nI'm [18F] one of two girls in a seven person group. One of the guys, who we'll call David [18M], treats me differently from the other guys and the girl in our group in ways I won't elaborate on, but it does involve excessive staring, constant agreement, and general following around. David does not do this with other people in our group.\n\nI've known David since we were kids, but didn't interact from middle school until the beginning of this school year. After waiting several months to observe this, (approximately half a year) David's different treatment to me still hasn't changed and I generally feel uncomfortable around him.  I asked a person in our group if they knew anything about it and they essentially agreed with everything I said, saying they were afraid to make assumptions as well. \n\nI feel awful because David is a really nice guy. But I just can't help feeling uncomfortable around him. It really bothers me when I hang out with him one on one and it doesn't seem like the other group members have a problem with him because he really doesn't have anything wrong about him. \n\nNow here's the weird part. \n\nDavid is seemingly obsessed with me.\n\nAt first, I found out it was just an innocent crush. And that's fine. Then, he started hating on all of my guy friends. A little immature, but fine. But then, I found out he has a gaming account with a picture of my face and his name being my name. \n\nA profile picture with *my face* on a *public domain*. AND my name. That's bloody creepy. \n\nAnd apparently, my friends have been telling him to take it down. For several MONTHS. He refuses. He doesn't know that I know, but this is crazy and borderline obsessive. I don't want to see him around--ever. \n\ntl;dr: my friend has a crush on me and I want to cut all contact with him. He has a gaming profile (public domain) with my face and name on it. \n\nWIBTA for wanting to cut all contact? ",

      "description": "Formating on mobile, engilish is my first language just bad at writing and spelling.\n\nFor my whole life ive been nerdy and focus on school and not sports. My dad was the complete opposite, he was sporty, average/below average grades. He always wanted a athletic son. He says I have all the best things in an athlete, i'm tall and and well built, note i'm not saying this, he is. Any way, my mom raised me as a single mother since I was born till I was 6. She then got married to my current step dad. He has always been pretty open with how disapointment I am. I always brushed it off until I was around 12.(Last year) I started to voice how I don't like it. He never stopped and it only got worse when his girlfriend moved in. Since then ive felt like an outcast in my own family. We went to therapy sometime around August-November. We stopped going after he called me a waste of his time. I then ignored him for a while. He has seen me twice since then, on christmass with our family (which i ignored him the entire time.) And his birthday march 10th. He texted and called me multiple times a day, asking me to come over even after I told him to stop. It got to the point where I needed to say if he contacted me from that point further the police would be involved. He stopped contacting me. Yay, right? Nope. He twisted the story, and told our family some twisted version that clearly made him look like the victim. Family members i've never met were coming to tell me I needed to forget about it. I asked if they knew the whole story, they said yeah told me what they heard, shocker, it wasn't the real story. I told them about what he had done, constantaly putting me down and just everything he said and has done. When I finished they told me I was lying and had to get over myself. \n\nI said he could call and text me about a week ago.\n\nI dont talk to him unless he calls me, ive told him I dont want to see him.\n\nAITA for ghosting him?\n\nSorry about the post bouncing around i'm bad at formating and stuff like that.",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I are 'house sitting' his parents house while they're on a mission (Mormons) but we pay rent monthly. They're living less than an hour away for their assignment.\n\nNow we've been here for 3 months out of the 25 months they're away. They're giving us a great deal on rent and all but they come by every.single.weekend. There's been a few where they haven't but there's constantly a bullshit reason. I'm not \"allowed\" to watch anything on tv with sex or swearing or anything while they're here, can't play GTA, or walk around with a bra or pants on- ya know, being comfortable in my own home - because this is \"disrespectful\" according to my boyfriend/their beliefs.\n\nMy boyfriend cleans the house like mad or has me do all of it because having toys in the living room is 'messy' and his mom will be pissed. But we have a toddler and I'm currently pregnant.\n\nUsually they give me a warning they're coming but today I received NONE. I was walking around in a sexy robe with nothing underneath (maternity clothes in the wash)and making dinner. My boyfriend just had surgery so the house wasn't in stellar shape but no way dirty at all - just some toy boxes laying around and blankets on the couch with boyfriend.\n\nI'm pretty pissed. We can't have a single weekend to just relax and I feel entitled to it. I work from home so when he's home/baby naps it's my only off time. My boyfriend says that I'm not entitled to being pissed because they see this as their house (it's been paid off for 15 years) and it doesn't matter that I pay rent. I've tried to be understanding that they've lived in this house for 40 years   and may really need to grab more stuff but last visit his mom mentioned that \"[bfs dad] will be mad if I bring anything else home\" but there's really not much here of theirs besides beds and random kitchen stuff (plastic ware, pie pans, etc). Boyfriend says they're spying which is further supported by the fact that their random Mormon friends in the neighborhood keep stopping by even tho we don't know them. I went off today when they left about how fucking rude it is and I was told that we have to clean up before they come back later so his mom isn't pissed.\n\nTldr: am I an asshole for hating that I pay rent and can't use the home as my own because bfs parents/landlords have a key and walk in whenever they want?",

      "description": "My best friend will be moving to another country for at least 3 years to take his master's degree. He told us he is not sure when he will be able to go back because he also planning to get a job there to support his studies and eventually build a life (we are not demanding anything of him, especially just to visit us). So for at least 3 years, the only sure way we'll be seeing him is online.\n\nHe has been my best friend since high school. This is a big deal because I am a very antisocial and introvert person, and he is among the very few people who I feel really comfortable being myself with. He even told me himself he wanted me to be there because I am his closest friend.\n\nHowever, his farewell party coincides with my girlfriend's work event. It's like a super formal black tie mixer party for their current and potential clients, and she said she needs me to be her date. She has severe social anxiety, so I really want to be there for her (although I don't look forward to mingling with people because as I said, I'm antisocial as well). She is also one of the organizers of the event, so it's kind of a must to bring a date.\n\nMy best friend's farewell party has been set since last month, while my girlfriend only told me of her event last week. I have already confirmed to my best friend that I'd be going (I even told him I would bring my gf along), so I will essentially be canceling my attendance. I have also asked him if he could move the date of his party, but he said a lot of people have already confirmed, so I didn't push further.\n\nNow, I am faced with what I think is an impossible choice, but I am leaning toward being with my girlfriend that night because aside from the fact that we'll get to spend quality time together, I don't want her to have social anxiety (or at least face it alone). I am afraid I might turn into that guy who ditches his friends for his SO though.\n\nWould I be an asshole if I choose my gf's event over my best friend's farewell party?",

      "description": "I work at a tech company that recently established an \"Autism at work\" program. The company made a huge push to hire autistic folks as an \"untapped talent\", which I totally get and think that it's a great initiative.\n\n\"Johnny\" was hired onto our team as a QA tester through this program. The only experience with computers he's had is working as a repair tech at a previous job. He has no formal programming experience or experience with software development at all.\n\nI...can't stand him. The lack of experience isn't the issue, it's just the fact that he's just straight up bad at his job and obnoxious.\n\nWhen he was hired he worked with another QA tester who would basically hold his hand through everything and he was able to write QA tests and do the job.\n\nWell, management decided that he was so good at his job (that he wasn't actually doing on his own) that they'd promote him to full-time. Shortly thereafter, the other QA tester left on paternity leave for almost half a year.\n\nShit. Hit. The. Fan.\n\nEvery meeting we'd have to discuss the work for the next two weeks, we would talk about what needed to be done and always check that he would understand. He would nod his head enthusiastically and say that he did.\n\nWe'd meet a week later to review his test scenarios and most of them were just straight up irrelevant or showed a clear lack of understanding of the work. We'd explain why they were wrong, he'd say \"oh I get it now\", and then we'd check back a day later and his new tests were also wrong.\n\nEventually we got to the point where we would basically write the test scenarios for him as a team. That didn't fix anything either. He would complete the tests and claim the tests all looked good, then we'd roll our code to production and end up with major issues that should have been caught during testing.\n\nPast all this, he's just obnoxiously annoying. Constantly during serious business meetings he will say stupid \"jokes\" that take us off track and just annoy people (\"oh that doesn't work, must be because we're using Winblows rather than Linux\", \"oh our server went down, must be the damn Russians trying to get Hillary's emails\", “that task looks like it’ll take 246 years to finish, might as well just give up now”). When he has a question during testing he doesn't even attempt to be specific (\"yeah so there's a problem with the doohickey where the doohickey doesn't work\" is an actual quote I've been told many times)\n\nI brought this up with my mentor at work and was told \"he's autistic, you're being rude, he needs a lot of patience\" but I think it's a ridiculous standard to hold someone to. If he wasn't autistic he would have been fired months ago because he's just straight up incompetent at his job.\n\nI'm at my wit's end dealing with this, and I feel like I'm the only one that is at a breaking point dealing with it every day. AITA for not being able to stand this guy?",

      "description": "I'm not sure if it constitutes flirting and where the line is, so read on and let me know.\n\nThere is a girl I really started to like. So I started talking to her, we got closer. She was very friendly, and I thought she was interested too. This wasn't within a large time span. Maybe three weeks overall.\n\nAt some point, however, it slipped by that she's got a boyfriend. Now, within our common friend group this seems to have been common knowledge. I think she expected me to know too. At this time, he's working in a separate country. I don't know the details of their relationship, but it seems they've been together for a while. I have no particular reasons to suspect it's not going well, either.\n\nSince learning that, I haven't started seeing her less. I don't make any moves or anything like that, but we've seen a few films together, hang out in the evenings, etc, but there is some tension (and frequency) that I don't notice with my other female friends. Maybe it's my subjective perception. Overall, I'd say it's within casual flirting territory, but not too deep. I don't know how else to describe that.\n\nNow, by itself, this situation wouldn't warrant me to post here. \"Ok, sure - she hangs out with you - that her decision\", etc. My problem is that *I* know why I'm there. That I want to date her, that I like her, all that. That the eye contact, the shared laughs - what those things mean to me.\n\nAnd I'm unsure what to do - I don't want to stop being friends with her, I feel like there is a valuable connection that I don't have elsewhere. But I feel like a healthier thing to do would be to make some distance between us.\n\nAnd what I'm doing now, is keeping on with what I've been doing. I'm trying not to cross any lines, but I do think we're getting closer slowly, as time passes. Maybe that in of itself is a line.\n\nLet me know your opinion please. Thanks.\n\nPS: this is a throwaway account, if that matters.\n\n",

She said she couldn't as the other player who drives was staying on to referee another game and wouldn't be leaving until an hour later. \nThe trip for me is one hour and 20 minutes.\nI was in the middle of cooking so arranged a taxi for her and paid for it over the phone. She was collected on time and taken to her mother's house in a trip that took around 10 minutes.\nI've just had her ranting at me that I would pick up my girlfriend but not her etc...(my gf lives 6 minutes away and I would only pick her up if it were straight from work or similar, not 3 hours later).\nI then had her mother on the phone ranting at me that I've destroyed my relationship with my daughter and I should be picking her up whenever she asks etc...\nAll this despite it not being my night to have her and having arranged a taxi in my place to save time and hassle for all concerned.\n\nAm I the arsehole?",

      "description": "You will have to excuse the formatting I am doing this on mobile and it's my first post. Now this 'story' is a bit old but sometimes I still get caught up in wondering if I was an asshole or not and I figured I should get some unbiased views from the am I the asshole community.\n\nNow, my (f17) parents got divorced when I was 12 and custody of me and my two younger siblings (f15 and m13) was split 50 50 so we spend one week at one house and the next week at the other. \n\nMy dad has been dating this woman, let's call her Y for about three and a half years. This took place last summer so they had been dating for around 3 years. Y and I originally got on when my dad introduced us but as soon as she moved in to our house we started to butt heads more and more. (Just small things, ask me if curious)\n\nSorry for all this excess information and the way my story is jumping around, it's just hard to compose my thoughts. Let's get on to the actual incident \n\nAfter a holiday we were driving back home from the airport around 3 in the morning. My brother and my sister were quite hyper so were speaking quite loudly, with my brother being the loudest. Y was trying to sleep so kept telling my brother to 'shut up' in a rather harsh tone of voice. \n\nSoon we were nearly home and she told him to shut up again.I am quite protective over my siblings so I sat up looked her dead in the eye and said, \"how about you shut up for once huh?\" Not my best move I admit. After this, she did and we arrived home where we went to sleep.\n\nI was woken up maybe 4 hours later by a knock on the door and Y walked in. She then proceeded to say the following, I will try to write it as best as I remember. \n\n\"You are a horrible child you know, a right nasty piece of work. Evil even. You know that no one in your family likes you right? Even your grandma, they all think you are a horrible spoilt child.\" And so on.\n\nShe was basically screaming this at me and I was sitting crying. After, she left and my brother came in and gave me a hug before my dad came in to have a go at me for being rude to Y. (I would just like to say I love my dad and he is a wonderful dad but sometimes he can act without knowing the whole story).\n\nAfter he left I messaged my mum to try and go home to hers but I wasn't allowed as it was my dad's week. \n\nAnyway I will skip a bunch of other stuff like going for a walk with my mum ect to the main point because this is getting a bit long. \n\nThe next day I told my dad I never wanted to see Y again as she said some truly horrible stuff to me. He said okay and has kept his word (apart from a later incident which I may post later) but I know that it probably makes life difficult for him as she is his girlfriend and they haven't broken up. \n\nSo, AITA for still refusing to see my dad's girlfriend even though I know it makes my dad's life harder.

He told her they were in the freezer, to which she responded 'what?', causing him to speak louder and respond again. She responded 'what?' again causing him to raise his voice and repeat in much louder in an exasperated tone. 'They're in the freezer!' \nShe yelled at him to watch his tone and cut the attitude and that he shouldn't dare speak to his mother that way. He defended himself and said that he hadn't done anything wrong, she misheard him so he spoke louder. She tried to send him to his room but he argued that he'd only answered her question and that he wasn't trying to sound aggressive. He eventually caves after our mother took his phone and goes to his room.\n\nI hear all of this take place whilst I'm wrapping their christmas presents and when I go out to put them under the tree, my mother remarks 'you probably heard all of that.' I say yes, I did, and she says 'I bet you're on his side and think he did nothing wrong.' I say yes, I am. I told her I think he was just trying to speak loud enough for her to hear and that she responded a bit too angrily. \n\nShe then says 'but he sounded so mean' and starts crying. I don't think she deserves comforting since she was being so passive-aggressive and punishing my brother for a silly thing, so I just say 'he wasn't trying to be mean' and walk back to my room. As I leave the room she screams 'yeah, that's right, just do nothing, just leave your mother here. You have no compassion whatsoever do you MedicMoth?' I ignored her.\n\nAITA for walking away? I don't think I should be required to comfort her especially seeing as I'm the child and I disagree with her and think she's being childish, but I still feel really bad since she's been really stressed out with work and christmas stuff lately. She often says she doesn't deserve to be treated so badly by us children after everything we do for her and that the least she can expect is a hug, but last time she pushed me away and told me to leave her alone and stop touching her, so I'm not really willing to play that game.

His brother is a fantastic guy and a close friend, let's call him James.\n\nAmanda is exceptionally entitled and often rude.  We have known each other for 20 years, and have managed a civil relationship.\n\nMy husband and I were the first to have a child.  While several people in my husbands family insisted that they be invited to the baby shower, no one bothered to throw one.  I ended up not having a baby shower at all, which was a bit of a downer.\n\nSo the following year when Amanda was expecting, I did not throw a baby shower either.  She had three kids total (the last one only a month ago) and no one threw any baby showers that I am aware of.  I am not sure what my MILs excuse was, but no one held a party for me and I dislike Amanda, so I decided not to take the trouble.  \n\nNow James, in his late 30s, has finally found the love of his life, Carla.  We are over the moon happy for James as Carla is a lovely and outgoing lady.  They are expecting.  I want to throw a baby shower, and show Carla our love and support. \n\nBut is this a slap in Amanda's face?

      "description": "Backstory: My lifelong friend and I (both 24M) recently moved in together after some life changes on my end. I (verbally) agreed to do the dishes as he hates it and I have (or had) no issue with them. This was fine for a few months, no problems.\nRecently I've been dining out a lot or just not been at home often and therefore have not been dirtying up many dishes. Those that I do use (and they are few and far between) end up washed that day/night or the following night (we do not make use of our automated dishwasher. His decision). My roommate uses a lot of the dishes, probably 1-2 plates a day and 1-2 drinking glasses every 2 days.\n\nThe complaint: I do 100% of the dishes regardless of how often I am home or how many dishes I use. If I leave to visit family for the weekend, there will be a pile of dirty dishes waiting for me when I get back. This upsets me as I clean all that I use and he cleans nothing that he uses whilst I am absent.\n\nThe question: WIBTA if I brought this to his attention? Am I just being childish and should I suck it up and do all the dishes as was agreed?\n",

      "description": "So to start off my girlfriend and I share a dog. I work at a police department and saved him from the pound as a puppy despite living in a no-pets property. I pay for his food, vet bills, and half of his toys and equipment like leashes.\n\nMy girlfriend is in college and works part time. I pay for her meals when we are together, pay for gas, tutor her, and even do some of her schoolwork for her and teach her the concepts afterwards because she procrastinates a lot. In return, she takes care of our dog when she’s not in school, cleans my place up on occasion, and promises that she’ll get a good job when she’s out of school so I can work on my business and look into becoming an EMT (lower pay than my current job). We live separately.\n\nThis morning, following a 12 hour shift of bullshit and spring breakers,I stayed up for her to stop by and drop off Fido on her way to school. I called her on the way over and at some point she said something about she wanted to sell our dog yesterday. I asked why and she said to give it a better home than what I provide, and said she only refused to sell him because she (correctly) thought I’d be pissed. She then said she thought I was a bad dog owner. I exploded.\n\nEvery day Fido gets at least 20 minutes of play time no matter how tired or busy I am. He often gets more. Up until today, he had the whole yard to run in freely and was visited daily by my niece while I sleep in addition to our daily 20 minutes of play/walkies. He is going to have to spend some time in his 5x10 kennel the next few days as a pool is being put in and he cannot roam freely in the dig site without being supervised, and she cited this and the fact that I don’t take him to the dog park as reasons why I’m a bad owner. Apparently the dog park is leagues better for a dog’s mental health than walking, even if you’re nocturnal and can only go at times no other dogs are there. She also doesn’t accept the fact that I walk him or play with him daily despite the fact she’s never here to see it.\n\nI was triggered to say the least. I brought up the tutoring, the money I give her, called her an ungrateful smartass, everything in the book. I said something along the lines of “How can you even say that to me right now without realizing what a huge piece of shit it makes you”. She at some point said she didn’t care what I thought and now we’re not talking to each other.\n\nWe’re generally happy together but this is a recurring argument (she does not think I ever spend time with him for some reason) that I’m looking to put to rest. \n\nAm I the Asshole for going off on her so harshly?\n\nAm I the Asshole for giving insufficient care to Fido or is what I can give enough?\n",

I didn't flake on payments and end up behind like a deadbeat but I won't get into what happened as it's neither here nor there right now. The context is that I have to report to my PO once a month, and pay a fee every month for certain supervision supplied by the probation/parole officer. One of these fees is $50/month for drug screens. Yet I haven't been given a single drug screen in six months. So this past Thursday during my report I asked my PO if they would either screen me, or get rid of those fees. My purpose was that: \"I don't mind taking the drug screens, I don't do drugs so I have nothing to hide, but I'm paying for them monthly and could be using that money towards paying off my child support debt instead. Seems rather frivolous on my end and rather mundane on theirs.\" \nMy PO half understood and half got offended. As if I was telling her how to do her job. And it wasn't at all my agenda. I just thought it was a point to bring up. Either give me the screens so I'm paying for something legitimately or stop making me waste money.",

I clarified that I actually meant \"Nothing of importance\", to which he started yelling that he wanted to know exactly what I was doing right now. I eventually told him, but the disagreement escalated into an argument where he said, and has said previously before, that as I am a minor, I deserve no right to privacy and no respect from him or my mother.\n\nAm I being unreasonable or an asshole by wanting them to give me space and stop inserting themselves into my life, or am I just being a little emo bitch?",

      "description": "So I met this (male, 25) colleague around 6 months ago. I'm a 20 yo woman. We started getting close, but he told me from the beginning he wasn't looking for a relationship with me. I was totally fine with that, and still am.\n\nAs we started getting closer, he told me a story of how he was betrayed by someone who he immensely trusted, and that let to attachment issues from his side. Fine, I'll just be careful with you.\n\nSo he goes to bars sometimes with other colleagues, which is also fine by me. At one point all this drama starts at work, and he leaves and gets a job somewhere else. He said he will definitely stay in contact with the people he liked, which included me and those colleagues he went to bars with. We were pretty damn close at this point. \n\nSince he works someplace else, the contact has faded. I started to feel like I was always the one who kept conversations going. At one point i decided to put as much effort in our friendship as he did. The contact faded even more, and he started sending me bitmoji chats on snapchat or Facebook tags. That was the only way of contact.\n\nI see that he still sees the bar-friends at least 1 time every week (thanks snapchat), but he never invites me over or anything.. I'm not gonna ask to come over, because I already did a 1000 times, and he can put some effort in it too! When I don't say anything to him for a few days, he tags me in some shit on Facebook and starts with the bitmoji chats again, which just isn't a proper conversation IMO.\n\nSo I scolded him on WhatsApp today. I told him I was actually distancing myself from him because he just didn't put any effort in the friendship. He never wants to see me or have a nice convo with me. He answers that he is busy, also in the weekends (not true, I've seen him meet the bar-friends on snapchat in weekend AND weekdays..), and I live too far away compared to the bar-friends that live in the same town as him. I only live 15 minutes away from him, so that's bullshit.\n\nI think he's mad at me now. He hasn't answered yet. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? We were really close and it really sucks to see him getting more distant but still meeting the others.. But I also feel like I'm a psycho drama queen for making such a big deal of it. ",

It's what I've wanted to do for years now and I've made this very clear to friends and family. I've actually made a good plan for myself and what I'll do after high school, I'm very excited to get out into the world. My dad was hesitant to accept my career choice, and even less enthusiastic when I brought the Navy into it. He started by gently encouraging me to pick up welding or HVAC or some other trade. I understand where he's coming from with this, those jobs pay well but they're not what I want to do with my life. I think that the primary reason why he doesn't want me doing this is because he's afraid of the psychological toll it'll take on me, which I am well aware of.\n\nThis gentle encouragement has turned to what happened yesterday, which was him coming home claiming to have \"planned my life out for me.\" I was like, \"okay,\" and humored him. He proceeded to propose a plan that effectively cuts out the Navy, and a good portion of other things I plan on doing to advance a career in Emergency Services, in favor of doing HVAC part time until I can start my own business and do EMS/FF part time. Also proposing I join the Air Guard and do civil engineering. I felt insulted by this, for starters since I've been spending 95% of my time on this course, and am working hard to secure a job in this field. I already have certifications in the field that I also worked hard to get.\n\nI understand why he wants me to do trade work, like I said, they pay well but I don't have any interest in that field. I've explored Emergency Services for awhile and I genuinely love the work. So WIBTA for confronting him and saying flat out that I won't be doing HVAC, and that I'm insulted by what he said.",

      "description": "We used to be good friends. Now we share an apartment with two rooms with thin walls and there is a conflict brewing.\n\nYesterday I had a pretty long day. Wake up at 8:00, commute to work, work, commute back, do some uni work and arrive home at midnight. At this point I would just take a shower and go to sleep because I have to do this again tomorrow.\n\nBut he's having his girlfriend over and both are making noises so I stay up and play some shooters maybe they go to sleep at 1:00 of 1:30. They dont but I attempt to sleep anyways, however I keep waking up to them talking until 2:30 at which I point i shoot a message over on WhatsApp saying: \"could you guys be quiet plz\".\n\nThe response I get is: \"seriously \" but they did stay quiet and I only saw the reply in the morning.\n\nNow the reason I am asking this is because they were being relatively quiet already. The next stage would be straight up whispering. But when it comes to sleeping I tend to focus on these things, these tiny noises and spiral into this obsessive madness and need silence or white noise.\n\nAnother thing is that this is a university housing, might be relevant.",

      "description": "I dated a guy for \\~2.5-3 years and we have been done for 4-5 years. Here is just a small bit of what went down:\n\nHe cheated on me MULTIPLE times. I forgave and tried to forget and he went and did it again. When confronting him to ask why, he said it was because I \"wasn't a woman enough\" for not sucking his dick every time he asked or not being in the mood when he was sometimes.\n\nOnce when he was really pissed off at me he punched the wall next to my head.\n\nWhen I confronted him with SCREENSHOTS of messages he sent ex-girlfriends about how he missed fucking them and being with them, he denied it. Pure gaslighting.\n\nBrought cocaine into my dorm in college and when I found it and confronted him claimed it was my roommates. ??? Then later I found more at his apt and when I confronted him he said it was a friend's. I went to the bathroom and when I came back he had it in lines and was snorting it. (I do not condone coke use. I was not happy with this and made it clear.)\n\nThe kicker? He told me that I shouldn't get STD testing at my annual the same year I dumped him because I \"should trust him!\" And then later that year, after we broke up and I started seeing somebody new, I went to get tested and had \\*chlamydia.\\* So I sobbed and called him to tell him he had to go to a doctor and he BLATANTLY DENIED IT.\n\nI now see a therapist for all of the anxiety, insecurities, recurring nightmares, and absolute HATRED I have of this guy. (Yes, I probably had some form of anxiety/depression prior BUT it came to full fruition with this relationship.)\n\nI am happily taken. But there are emotional scars. He has been dating a new person for \\~1.5years and they are engaged. Good for them I guess? But I don't believe he has changed at all and feel bad for the girl.\n\nSOMEHOW, my sister, knowing all that I listed above, still has \"a blank slate\" on him. She's friends with the girl (she was a bridesmaid at my sister's wedding) and my sister is now going to be the maid of honor.\n\nI know that I can't control what she does and her relationship with the girl, but I still feel betrayed for her being in this position. I hate this person with all of my being and my TWIN sister is going to be a part of his wedding. I told her how I felt and she thinks I'm being judgemental of him. ???? AITA here? I'm not trying to get her to now be the maid of honor but she thinks I'm being ridiculous for being this angry and is mad.",

      "description": "So this post is inspired by the current top post on this sub.  I have a fairly similar situation and figured I will put mine out there. \n\nSo I have been dating this girl for a few months and for the most part things have been going really well, except for our dietary differences. I grew up hunting and fishing with a meat heavy diet and she grew up vegan and we have both carried those diets into our adulthoods. \n\nWhen I cook things seem to work out fine, I cook the dish without the meat, serve it for her then add the meat in for myself. Or I just make 2 entirely different dishes.\n\nBut occasionally she will cook for me and will want me to try her vegan dishes. But goddamn is it gross. I am not sure I will ever understand how people eat tofu.\n\nSo recently she said she wanted to try and make something new. I told her that I will happily try it but that I wanted to bring over a venison steak so I would have something to make if I didn't like it. Because up to this point I haven't liked any of the dishes she has made (I didn't say that last part but she knows it already).\n\nAfter typing that it sounds more dickish than I think it is so let me add that whenever I cook for her that I make sure to have an easy fall back dish that I can quickly throw together if she doesn't like what I made. Ultimately I think food is one of life's great pleasures and you should always enjoy what you eat.",

Now I'm a short guy about 5'5 and look pretty young but I don't look like a kid and I kind of found it insulting to be given a kids menu. She brought the normal menu and said she was just joking and she'll bring us some water. I asked for a beer and she ID'd me, perfectly fine I'm 21 so just legal to drink but look younger, she looks at my ID and was like ohhh you look so much younger like my little brother in highschool. I was just like ok and my date was just kinda laughing a bit but looked confused. As the night went on it was normal service and everything was ok, but when we got the bill I didn't tip because I felt like I was insulted and treated poorly. The girl I was with said I should of tip still because she was just joking and the service itself was fine and said it was a dick move not to tip her. I always tip above 15% usually because I used to wait tables and be a bus boy so I know it can be a tough job. But I never insulted anyone that way and if I did wouldn't accept a tip. The waitress didn't say anything to me though I just handed her the exact cash and we got up and left. So, AITA?",

      "description": "Some context, late last year I moved into a house with 2 other roommates and we decided to purchase a TV for the living room and we split the cost 3 ways. We found a model we liked and I ordered it under my Amazon Prime because it was discounted. We agreed whenever we move out or whatever we would sell the TV and split the profits 3 ways or sell it to the roommate that wanted it for whatever amount is decided on. Okay cool.\n\nFast forward to delivery day and Amazon dropped off **2 TVs**. The second TV is a different brand but identical the first one in features, a 55\" 4K smart TV so it cost us a pretty penny. With a free $600 TV we try think about what to do with it but not needing another I was quick to propose selling it, believing it was mine. For the next couple of months my one roommate was insistent on buying it from me, making multiple offers but I turned them down.\n\nEventually I did give away the TV to a third party and when my roommate who kept trying to buy the TV from me found out, she blew a gasket. Before getting any context but knowing the TV was gone she started furiously texting me demanding her cut of the money, that I was ethically and morally *obligated* to give her a portion of the money and quickly turned to calling me a selfish prick because she felt entitled to her cut. My other roommate had no issues.\n\nThe original TV was bought under my name, my roommate exclusively approached me in an attempt to purchase the TV indicating to me that she thought it was mine. AITA for claiming the bonus TV as mine and not considering my other roommates? I thought it would be a nice thing to do, but at no point in time did I think they were entitled to the TV or money I'd receive from selling it in any way.\n\n**Tl;dr** Bought a TV and split the cost between roommates, second TV showed up so I claimed it and sold it because the original purchase was under my name.",

Would I be the asshole if I told my friend about my situation?

I parked my car in a garage overnight so I thought there would be a parking ban and my neighborhood is all street parking. Well today when I got back from work there were several empty spaces between the snow banks, but people had “reserved” them by putting their trashcans, deck chairs, or even traffic cones out in the middle of them. \n\nLet me say this: I understand, it’s a lot of effort to dig out your car and I’m sure it would suck to spend that time and then come back and not be able to get a good spot, but the parking in this neighborhood has always been a free-for-all, and because of the snow banks people are reserving about 1.5 spaces to get in/out of the spot as well as the space they need for the car, so there would be less spots available even without people holding them. \n\nIn the end I had to park about 3 streets over from my apartment, which wouldn’t be too bad if the sidewalks were paved well but they’re not and I already have a sprained ankle. I was so tempted to just move some of the stuff and take a spot but it felt bad. \n\nSo my question is: would I be the asshole if I did this? ",

      "description": "I’ll try to keep this short and sweet.\n\nBit of background: I have a sister with a mental illness called misophonia. Basically, you know when someone chews really loud and you get annoyed by it? Imagine that on a much larger scale. It’s like Tourette’s from what I understand, when she hears one of her trigger sounds she can’t control herself and has a huge tantrum if the sound doesn’t stop. Unfortunately, I am her primary trigger. Things like tapping my fingers or shaking my leg or having my bare feet out (from what I understand it’s not just audible triggers) will cause her to explode. Because of this I basically live in a very restricted way, for the past ~5-6 years as well. I can barely do anything without triggering her. And as you might guess that can take a toll on a person. And on top of this illness, she’s also not very mature. She gets extremely (*extremely*) mad and defensive over things like doing her homework or taking her medication in the morning, or basically being called out on anything. It usually results in a screaming match, with her occasionally resulting to throwing things. After living like this for years, me and my parents are exhausted from it. And also, as a result of her low maturity, she also isn’t mature enough to find coping mechanisms for her illness outside of either going to a separate room or screaming at me to stop. My parents most of the time don’t discipline this behavior and let it happen, probably because they don’t want a screaming match with my sister. And recently I’ve been calling them out on this a lot. I’ve never said they’re bad parents or anything toxic or anything with the intention of insulting them, but sometimes we’ll get in a fight with me telling them stuff like “she’s never going to get better if you just let her run the house” (which comes with all this, most of what she says goes, or an intense fight follows). They, like me, are tired of all this too but they don’t want to fight. AITA for getting on their case for, in my opinion, not disciplining my sister? \n\nIf you feel like there’s anything I left out (I might’ve missed something but nothing comes to mind) ask me and I’ll let you know ",

I have so many fond memories of him and i am sad that i probably won't see him again... Actually... I don't even know if he is alive... Or if he still likes me...\n\nAnyway!\n\nSo my dad was basically never there for me and every time i tried to make contact with him or spend time with him he just brushed me off to his parents.\n\nMy breaking point was one day when he asked me what i wanted for my Birthday.\nI only had one wish, a picture of the whole family of his, but more importantly, a picture of my sister.\n\nWhat did i got?\nA letter telling me that i wouldn't be possible atm... He even signed it.\n\nThat wad it for me. That he couldn't get everyone together in time for a group photo i could have understood... But not being able to take a simple picture of my sister?!\n\nDays before i finished 10th grade as the best from my class (not impressive my class was the \"lazy class\" of our school) and i heard from my mother that my dad told everyone how proud he is of me.\nI didn't like it... He never was there for me in all this time... So why should he get to brag about something I don't even brag about myself?!\n\nAnd so i told him to shut up about it.\nI told him that he did nothing to be proud of and that he took no part in my \"success\".\nI told him that he couldn't do one simple thing right and that i was done with him.\n\n\nI do have a picture of my sister now.\nAnd i told him that i go to University now.\nBut i don't want him in my life any more than he is now.",

      "description": "I've had this friend since I was in second grade. We always had things in common and played with Transformers and Legos together, etc. I'm in my early 20s now and so is he and we managed to stay in contact and hang out occasionally in these recent years. He has a wife and a young daughter that I'm sure he loves dearly. \n\nA little background on myself, I'm currently on probation since last year for selling drugs. I know, not the best decision in the world but I'm trying to stick to the terms and make the best of it. My bail amount was high but my parents bailed me out the next day (I was lucky). Some people around me were supportive even though I put myself in that situation. However when I told him, he gave me a super sarcastic \"way to go\" along with a \"you're #1\" Bitmoji (this was Snapchat obviously). We didn't talk much after that but I still kept up with him on Facebook.\n\nFast forward March 27th, 2019. I work for a local news station and it was a total shock to me when his mugshot made it on the news. The worst part? He was charged with distribution of child p**n and s*****l abuse of a child under 14. I have no idea where this came from and want to tell myself it's some sort of mistake (I know it’s not his daughter because it would be a different charge). I don't know full details so maybe it isn't as bad as it seems. But deep down I know I'm lying to myself and that he was probably into some messed up stuff. I consulted with another friend that knew him and he already deleted/blocked him on everything and expressed he has no respect for him anymore. I can't say I feel the same way and I honestly feel a little guilty that I'm not pulling all my resources together to bail him out. I guess I feel conflicted because I was in jail for one night but wouldn't want to stay there any longer than I had to. But if he truly did these things then I do believe that messing with children is a line you never cross and there should be some sort of punishment. \n\nSo AITA for not bailing my friend out of jail? Because I’m kinda feeling like one.\n\nTL;DR My friend got charged with child s** crimes and I know it's wrong but feel guilty for not bailing him out.",

      "description": "Me and my sister have had a rocky relationship for a while. She suffers from BPD, a mental illness that can make healthy relationships tough. In the past I tried to sympathize with her in any way that I could, although recently it’s gotten much worse. \n\nI recently graduated and moved back in with our parents (temporarily), which always puts my sister in a bad mood. She doesn’t like it when she thinks I’m receiving more love and attention from my parents than she is, as she has this delusion that I’m the favourite child of the family. \n\nRecently it’s gotten to the point where she harnesses me constantly, calls me names and insults my character. She says I’m selfish, greedy, lazy, arrogant, the list goes on and on. \n\nRecently I had some friends over, and we were talking about how I was going to be moving to Europe in a couple of months, a big life change that I’m super excited for. She chimes in by saying how stupid the decision is, and how I’ll have a huge gap in my resume, yada yada. \n\nNow, I usually take these sorts of comments no problem, but I really didn’t appreciate them this time, especially in front of my friends and especially about something I was so excited for. \n\nI exploded on her. I said some mean spirited things I know I shouldn’t have. I told her that she was a rude and jealous person, that she will die alone because she ruins all relationships she has, etc. \n\nNow, I admit what I said was wrong, and I do want to apologize. The only issue is, I know she will never apologize for the verbal abuse she puts me through on a regular basis, as she historically has never taken responsibility for her actions at all. This puts me at a bit of a crossroads. Do I apologize and absolve her off all blame? There is no way she will accept any fault. Should I swallow my pride and just apologize? \n\nTL;DR: Am I the asshole for saying hurtful things to my sister in a moment of weakness, after suffering from verbal abuse on her part for an extended period of time?

      "description": "I'm comfortable with my actions in this situation just curious what others think. \n\nI was driving down a road going about 40kph, I had two full ice coffees in my passenger seat sitting in a tray (my cup holders are broken). I even remember thinking to myself what a disaster it would be if they spilt. \n\nAs im driving down this road the car infront of me pulls completely out of the lane into a parking space. As you should always be weary on the roads I slow down anyway but still continue travelling down the road. \n\nJust when I'm almost parellel with the back end of this car they pull directly back onto the road as to do a U-turn to start travelling the opposite direction. I immediately slam on my breaks and the coffees rocket into the footbed of my passenger side. I managed to avoid making any contact with their car but just barely. They wave sorry and continue the U-turn and travel the other way and park at a restaurant just there. \n\nI park close and walk towards them visibly upset but not aggressive or anything. It's a family going for dinner and the driver was a young kid maybe 16-18 learning to drive. I tell them they seriously need to be more careful and that my coffees are now covering the floor of my car. I tell them they gotta buy me new coffees and the kid and I walk into a coffee shop and I order and he pays.\n\nThe kid is visibly shaken and actually helps me clean my car awkwardly. I tell him accidents happen and to be more careful in the future. For context i live in western Australia and two ice coffees are like 11 dollars. I am 21 living out of home and thats not a negligible amount of money for me. Especially to buy two more. \n\nAITA for making this kid pay for my spilt coffees? ",

      "description": "Hopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we’ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like “I haven’t had sex with a guy in two years. I don’t know if I want to continue in this relationship.” I responded with “I know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can’t imagine my life without her. If you don’t feel like you can’t live without her, then you need to end it.” My wife took that as “she wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.” As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn’t having it. She basically told me she didn’t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn’t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I’m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can’t be and then going through my phone?",

      "title": "AITA For freaking out because I didn't have a seatbelt on in a cab",
      "description": "I have always wondered about this, and admittedly I already do feel like the asshole, so I'll spare you no detail and I want a good honest read (sorry it's a bit  lengthy)\n\n\nMy boyfriend's friends had a get together at one of their places for his birthday and I met a lot of his friends and their girlfriends. After the night of drinking and merriment we shared a cab home. I was pretty drunk, but not blackout drunk by any means. Less of a filter but still able to remember the next day. We all stuffed into the cab and I got into the back right seat, with someone in the middle, and my boyfriend on the left. \n\n\nI couldn't find my seatbelt and I was scrambling for it. I pleaded with the driver to wait, but I quickly realized I didn't actually have a seatbelt (the seat folds and the belt was in behind it, I know because my car does that). I remember calling attention to my situation and I was like \"HEY I NEED A SEATBELT DONT DRIVE\" and the other couple and my boyfriend were telling me to chill because it was only a few blocks. I asked my boyfriend to switch me seats but he stayed silent - just didn't say anything. Then the cabbie, who wasnt listening anyway, backed into a busy road and tore off like a bat out of hell.\n\n\nA couple of facts before I continue - one is I have some pretty bad anxiety that I see a therapist and am medicated for. So I'm already a nervous person. Plus, I am not laxidazy about seatbelts. I am terrified of being projected in an accident or even just getting knocked around like a ragdoll in a veichle. Also, this wasnt just a few blocks, we were literally driving across town, through major intersections, over the water etc. ALSO, this cab was literally barreling down the road, stepping on the gas to get through yellow lights (not making this up) and he had his headphones on and he was talking to someone on the phone while he drove (actually an offense here). To me this was a terrifying experience. \n\n\nSo here I was, drunk so with less of a filter, admittedly a whole different person because I was hyped up on fear, and feeling completely let down by my boyfriend who didn't say a word to help me and instead suggested that I should \"not worry\", I experienced a bout of anger. Rage even. I spewed out some \"what the fuck\"s and \"this guy is driving like a maniac SLOoOW DOoOWN AsShOle\"\" and even \"let me out in walking home!!!\" but he didn't stop, all I got were these \"friends\" who I barely know and was chumming with all night telling me that I should calm down and I'm overreacting, acting like I'm a monster. They even ignored me and started a conversation with my boyfriend. And my boyfriend ignores me too.\n\n\nOf course I was overreacting, but honestly guys I can't emphasize my specific fear of driving without a seatbelt enough. I haven't had any traumatizing experiences, it's just something I've fixated on and am scared of. Although it is an entirely rational fear, the way I acted was totally irrational and not exactly solution focused. Like if I was really that scared I would open the door and jump out. But I got angry because I felt backed into a corner. I felt like I had to choose between my safety (or at least piece of mind) and causing more of a scene by dramatically opening the door and stepping out of a cab (which did not come to a complete stop once). Anyway it does not give me an excuse to be an asshole but what I felt at the time was pure fear induced adrenaline.\n\n\nI was so mad (and truly relieved) when we pulled into the driveway, that I stormed out and slammed the door and went into the house without saying goodbye or anything. I then gave my boyfriend the silent treatment and he apologized the next day. Bit of a night ruiner for sure.\n\n\n**TL;DR** Shared a cab with my bf and another couple. Didn't have a seatbelt, and panicked because I'm a nervous person especially with seatbelts. I was a little drunk and made my discomfort known, loudly cursing and such. Boyfriend didn't switch seats with me and ignored me while I freaked out and embarrassed myself. Cabbie drove like an asshole the whole way.\n\n\nAITA? Thanks kindly in advance for your honesty.",

All is well now.  \n\n\nBut then I stop to think that I may have jumped the gun with my 'throw a d-bomb over your shoulder on the way out' advice because I might be taking one incident out of context.  \n\n\nSo I turn to the community that I so easily judged and ask, AITA?",

      "description": "We’ll call him Max for the sake of anonymity. I am in IGCSE 2 (equivalent of grade 11) and I’m 15. He is in A1 (grade 12) and is 19. When I first started speaking to him, it was because he would kind of just awkwardly hang around our friend group/sit next to me in math(he’s in my class) \n\nWhen we invited him to hang out with us, he told us that all the other people in his grade were making fun of him. I felt for him, and he seemed like an ok dude. After a few *days* he started telling me he “had a friend” who had a crush on me. Now, I knew this wasn’t true, as I knew who he hung out with, and none of those guys would even look at me. He made it preeetty clear he was talking about himself. Even my friends saw it. \n\nAt some point our birthdays came up in conversation. Now, keep in mind, the age of consent in my country is 16. I asked him how old he was, and he told me he was 19. When I told him I was 15, he looked visibly disappointed, and informed me that if I had been 16, his “friend” would have made a move. I kind of laughed it off.\n\nHe would go on to tell me that he had been watching me for a year and thinking how pretty I was. His words. Fine, w/e. But now he’s started being very sexually suggestive with my friend and I (we’re still both underage) e.g asking if we’re into choking, putting his hand on my thigh. He’ll run up behind me and grab me in a hug, which is fine except that I have anxiety and don’t like people coming up behind me. \n\nHe had started, in class, while I was doing work, whining about how I wasn’t paying enough attention to him and I probably hate him. He would bombard my phone, get jealous if I him out with guys, essentially act like a possessive boyfriend. He would also use sensitive topics to guilt trip me into talking to him. He’s stopped showing up to class, and only talks to us occasionally. \n\nI feel guilty sometimes, as he doesn’t really understand social cues and I was a bit of a bitch when he last blew up my phone. \n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "So this happened a few years back, but I'm curious. \n\nIt was my close friend's 22 bday and she was planning to go to a dinner and a club. I didn't know anyone else she invited because they're all a group and I'm just her friend and I couldn't go to the club because I was under 21. \n\nThe morning of I got a text from my boyfriend who lives four hours away asking me to drive to him because of a situation that came up. Now my boyfriend is very independent and I knew he wouldn't ask so last minute unless it was something important so I texted my friend explaining the situation and apologizing like hell and promising to take her on a full day out next week. I thought she would understand because she had done the same thing to me in the past and it wasn't a big issue. \n\nShe got really pissed off because I wasn't going to be there the day of, her birthday and that meant I didn't care to her. I had already given her the present and we had talked previously about the possibility that I won't come considering I don't know anyone and can't be there with them the whole night. I had a full day plan that I had sent to her before the day and she seemed down, but she was very adamant that I had to be there the actual day.  \n\nShe stopped talking to me because of this and we no longer talk period. I've tried to extend olive branches, but I don't think what I did is that horrible. ",

It's about dinner time here in my country and so my parents decided to eat outside. I told my Mother this is my last round, then we will go. Like 5 mins later, my dad comes down and starts grumbling at me and he said,\" Why are we waiting for him, we shouldn't be waiting for him because of a video game. Back in my day, when my father told me we had to go, I would stop immediately.\" He was super mad at THAT moment. At that point I just turned off my pc and decided to go change, then my father decides to leave by himself and it's my obviously my fault. My mother then just talked to me saying u could have just leave the game and that I'm selfish, I don't think about others . I think I kind of agree with her because I could have just left even though it was multiplayer, I feel pretty stupid that I didn't want to leave.\n\nBut, here's the thing, when my brother says this is his last round, they would just wait for him.  Why the fuck are u so mad at me when u aren't mad at my little bro when he does that? And it's like only 5-10 more mins...\n\n",

I get a call from my sister (while I was at work) who is 8 months pregnant (and trying to save as much money as possible as they've had major house repairs recently and won't be working for a while). She is close by and as she dropped her car off for repairs. The repair centre normally gives out free rental cars but they noticed her licence has expired so they couldn't give her one. She called me and asked for a lift home. I said better yet, I'll come get you and you can borrow the car for the day as we have two (an old manual one I paid for prior to meeting my wife and a newer one we paid for out of our joint account). I offered the newer one as it has more safety features. \n\n\nMy sister said suggested I check with my wife to make sure it's OK for her to borrow the car but assumed my wife would be ok with my sister taking the car to the licencing centre to renew her licence and do whatever else she needs since my wife is out of town anyway and we have an extra car.\n\n\nSister is not a good driver (about a major accident per year and a bump/scrape or two per year) but said she will cover any damages on the off chance she gets into an accident. I'm cool with that, plus I grew up in the type of family where you just help each other out. They ask for a hand and you give them an arm type deal. \n\n\nWife later tells me I'm an asshole for offering the car. Am I though? Thought I was just a good brother and if anything goes wrong, my sister will take car of it. Plus our third car comes tomorrow so we will have three cars until I can sell my old one. I don't see how this affects us negatively. ",

      "description": "So my friends fiancé is a lot to handle, even on good days. To sum it up, he smokes and drinks like there's no tomorrow (and sometimes drives after). He's preachy about Catholicism (in irrelevant moments), dominates conversations, one ups, is veeeryy competitive, and isn't great on social queues. He's kind of like a child, sees things in black and white, and has hinted at being homophobic. This is all relevant because of my diverse friend group (I am not Christian). He also has some self control problems. \n\nI was fine with fiancé coming to events at my house until my last birthday, where he made people uncomfortable. He wouldn't stop lecturing about why German cars are better, went on several one up sessions, and preached about religion to a bunch of Jews. Most of my friends and I are too tired of that sort of bullshit to be patient when he goes on some preach. I and others also have allergies or are sensitive to cig smoke, you can smell it on him all the time. He also whined about the lack of alcohol and insulted some people over not wanting hard liquor. He has these seemingly random or over the top outbursts, and often insults people in them. He often makes scenes over losing games. My friends outside the tiny group that have learned to put up with him, for now, are obviously on edge around him. A while ago, I stopped trusting her fiancé to not act like a 12 yr old if he loses a game, be preaching, one upping/dominate conversations, or make things awkward. My friend doesn't have the best control of him, and they sometimes causes scenes by arguing (on somewhat rare occasions they hit each other on the arm or shoulder). \n\nI was thinking of being nice and saying \"only close friends, no SO's\", but I'm not sure how long it would hold up. I'm generally open to SO's coming, since I trust my other friends judgement, and don't want to punish others over her fiance. I'm considering fading this friendship just because they'll likely get married and he'll be everywhere. I want to be honest and say, in a nice way, that he's just too much and kills it for everyone. It's not just about me, I don't want to subject my other friends to him. I'm pretty sure it would hurt her, I'm also scared of him ever finding out I said this. \n\nSo WIBTA if I straight up told her that, for events I control, I don't want her fiancé there at all? Not exactly sure how to be NTA in this situation, unless it means not inviting her. ",

      "description": "I’ll keep this short and sweet. My girlfriend and I (both mid twenties) have been dating for around a year. She’s still good friends with her ex as they have a lot of mutual friends and honestly it hasn’t been an issue at all until the other night.\n\nWe were all hanging out after a mutual friends birthday and he happened to be here. It was a work night so none of us had been smoking or drinking. The night was winding down and I was about to say I was heading home to the group when she started joking around with her ex. Before I know it they’re full on play fighting a metre in front of me. I mean, actual wrestling. Initially he wasn’t joining in but after a few minutes it was like he didn’t have a choice. It went on for about five minutes and to be honest it was the most awkward five minutes of my life.\n\nShe’s crossed the line with him before but *never* like this. We left shortly after and I told her I thought it was a complete dick move and disrespectful. She doesn’t agree. AITA here?\n\nUPDATE: I broke up with her, she reacted in a way that is pretty sickening to me. It’s clear that she’s been hiding a lot of her personality and really let rip when she realised I was serious about leaving her. Lots of accusations and selfish thinking throughout the brief conversation, after about fifteen minutes I decided I’d heard enough and left. I didn’t raise my voice or respond with nasty shit like she was flinging at me.\n\nShe’s been blowing up my phone since but I haven’t responded to anything. Our friends are on my side, a lot of them saw the ‘wrestling’ and thought the same as you guys. Really fucking inappropriate. So that’s where things stand, I’m bummed out so I probably won’t update again. Just wanted to say cheers to everyone for putting my head straight - I could be still going through this shit three years later if I hadn’t left her.\n\nGoing to get drunk and drown my sorrows, later asshole enthusiasts.",

      "description": "Using a throwaway as several of my co-workers also use Reddit and know my account.\n\nTo give some background on this story, I work for a government organisation in the UK part time around university. I have been working here for several years now and intend to leave when I graduate and get a job which should be within the next few months. Although the money I am paid is nice, now that I'm coming to the end of education it's not essential for my expenses. \n\nMy coworker, who this post is about is a full time agency staff member. This coworker, who I will call F, is normally quite nice and someone I get along with. F is also my manager when we work together as F is more experienced and is a full time worker. F is a middle aged adult, with 2 adult children and a grandchild who she helps supports financially. \n\nDue to several managers leaving within the last year, our department decided to bring in agency staff to manage the workload whilst recruiting full time staff. F applied for one of these mangerial positions but didn't get it due to not being experienced enough. As a result, F has been spending the last few months going over and above F's duties, to ensure F would get a managerial position if it came up again. \n\nAs an agency staff, F does not receive sick leave, annual leave or any other kind of benefits which permanent staff receive and so has been applying relentlessly to any position in our department which is advertised to benefit from these privileges. F also smokes like a chimney, usually 10+ a day. We work in a location which due to Health and Safety laws requires at least two staff on duty at any one time or else the building should be closed.\n\nEnd background.\n\nTo the story itself, I recently returned to work after 6 months off work due to medical issues. On my first day back, F was in charge and was very friendly and happy. Although not entirely comfortable around F, I enjoyed going back to work and had a good day in general. \n\nSeveral days later, our building was extremely cold, due to both cold weather and poor heating systems. I was wearing a hooded jumper on the day and pulled my hood over my head twice due to this cold. F told me twice to pull my hood down as customers could complain. Although I did pull my hood down both times I was asked to, the second time I made a off hand comment along the lines of \"I didn't come here to work, I came here to chill\". I remember laughing as I said this, and obviously intending it as a joke. I didn't think any more of it and didn't pull my hood up again for the rest of the day. \n\nUnfortunately, this week I was pulled into my line managers office alongside F. I was told that F had reported this hood issue alongside the comment I had made to my line manager, alongside some other issues my manager had picked up on. When I said it was obviously a joke, F pulled out a copy of the employee handbook and showed me the section where it says employees shouldn't make jokes about the job - obviously paraphrasing here, but that was the meaning of that part of it.\n\nI was chewed out for not taking my job seriously and making remarks which undermined the profession and so on. Obviously I was shocked that F had even reported these comments to my manager and although I defended myself but saying it was just a joke, my manager didn't think that was a good reason. I was warned about future conduct and so on - luckily no disciplinary proceedings were started. \n\nAs a punishment, I do have to work at a secondary, worse location for a few days as a result which I absolutely detest - both my line manager and F know this and no doubt planned it accordingly. After this meeting, my manager left for the day and only me and F were left in the building. Although I didn't bring it up with F, there was obvious tension between us and no conversation apart from work related talk. I did want to ask why F reported me but didn't do so - I won't be seeing F for a few weeks now due to being placed elsewhere so won't have the opportunity to ask till then.\n\nLater on that day, I noticed that F was doing several things which are absolutely prohibited by the Employee Conduct Code - playing on a phone, using work PCs for non work related issues, using printers to print off personal stuff. The kicker however came when F left the building for a quick cigarette break during a tea break. F also left tobacco, rolling papers and filters on a table which people use to eat - this is banned and other staff members have been given warnings due to doing this before. \n\nNow, not only is leaving the building with only one staff member against Health and Safety Laws, it left me alone in the building with around 5-6 customers inside, any of whom could have started trouble or had some issues which would require at least two members of staff on hand. My building also has a roof leakage at the moment, which has meant a portion of the building being sealed off as it's directly underneath the leakage and bins are placed to collect water - however it can easily be accessed and several customers have done so. Although F was stood just outside the back entrance of our building and was on a tea break at the time, leaving only one person inside is a big no no and something that should be taken very seriously.\n\nI should also note, this job is very relaxed. Although we have duties and responsibilities, these can usually be done within a couple of hours, leaving the rest of the day to relax and chill out. I have, on several occasions watched football games and completed uni work/revised for exams at work. F usually doesn't have a problem with this - if I was to report F and our relationship was to change as a result - F could make the job a lot harder and a lot more tedious, but still bearable. \n\nAltogether, this means if I reported this, whilst it wouldn't be enough to cause Fs removal, it would probably be enough to ensure F wouldn't get a permanent position if one came up. Even if it wasn't held against F,  it's enough to cause at least enough trouble for F as it caused me. \n\nWhilst on one hand I want to report F for the same violations of the Code I was reported for, the consequences will obviously be a lot worse for F then they were for me. This job, whilst a nice earner, isn't that important to me. For F however, it's the only source of income. The nature of our position and it's declining relevance to the World also means F would struggle to find a permanent job elsewhere.\n\nMy question therefore is:\n1) Would I be the asshole for reporting my coworker for violations of the same code which I was reported for?\n2) Is it worth me reporting F and potentially making my life harder when I'm going to most likely be leaving within the next 6/7 months?",

      "description": "I grew up in a small community and everyone from community was tight.\n\nRight after highschool I moved away for 5 years. When I moved back slightly closer about 5 friends who all lived in different cities, but all grew up together, decided to get together at least once a year (usually xmas). The first three of these were nostalgic and really fun after all paving our own ways. The three following years were not.\n\n2012\nThe best part about knowing people well for so many years is you can basically say anything to them and know everything about them. One of my friends we'll call her D is extremely outspoken (which for so many years I admired because I'm not) but I kept feeling uncomfortable with some of the things she was saying - she kept recounting our other friends sexual partners before she was married when she looked obviously uncomfortable.\n\n2013\nMy then boyfriend proposed and we got engaged. At the xmas meet up everyone was talking about the wedding, me included, and how we were all going to have so much fun. I felt uneasy but figured they had been my friends for so long I'd invite them.\n\n2014\nNext xmas get together another friend H is getting married and has set a date. Everyone is going and keeps nagging me about setting a date. I don't say anything about it and try not to mention it. I don't even enjoy the company of two of these people D,and A but feel guilty.\n\nGo to Hs wedding and D, and A are complaining about everything - the dj, the weather, how H is not paying attention to them. It was extremely disrespectful.\n\n2015\nSet my date decide I'm not going to invite D, and A but invite the other two friends (H and C). \n\nNow here is where I think I'm an asshole. I didn't tell D and A I wasn't inviting them. I read about it and from what I understand étiquette determines you don't have to let them know but we had talked about all attending the wedding so I'm at a loss.\n\nWhen they found out I didn't invite them D bad mouthed me to many people and blocked me on all social media. I have not spoken to either since.\n\nSo AITA?\n",

      "description": "This post is a bit long and mentions suicide. I thought I'd put this warning here.\n\nAbout a year and half ago I met a guy, call him Luke. He was friends with my friends and we got on really well even though he would constantly flirt with me, but I didn't reciprocate as I was in a relationship at the time.\n\nSo that summer news came out that he cheated on his gf, but I never really believed it (hear me out) mainly because she was still very good friends with him, they often hung out 1 on 1 in secret from her friends and shortly after, they got back together on the DL. This was very short lived and they broke up once more, mainly because her friends didn't like him.\n\nRegardless, all of his then friends left him, because they were all inclined to believe her and Luke became increasingly depressed and borderline suicidal. I felt bad for him and promised to be his friend. \n\nWe kept in touch and became really good friends. We had similar interests and hanging out was always fun. Sometimes when we hung out 1 on 1 he would flirt with me even though he knew I was taken, but it wasn't a big issue. Generally we would just laugh it off and continue on our way. If it became too much I would tell him to stop and he would, 100% of the time.\n\nThen Luke got a girlfriend, so we didnt talk as often. I was really happy for him, he stopped hitting on me and our friendship continued.\n\nA few weeks pass and I come home one night to a chat from Luke and to my surprise it was a d*ck pic. I was mortified. He claimed that it was meant for his gf and apologized profusely. I forgave him  although I couldn't forget what I saw. I told my boyfriend about it because I felt bad. Me and bf talked a while and he suggested that it might not have been an accident. This made me extremely uncomfortable because of the past flirting and I ended up blocking him and haven't spoken to him since.\n\n\nAITA for blocking him even though I forgave him and because I jumped to conclusions? \n",

      "description": "So this is pretty petty I guess but I need to know what people think. We decided to host a secret Santa, where we anonymously give gifts to each other. IMPORTANT: We decided on a price of around 15 dollars (converted for convenience) for a gift. So a week passes, I do my shopping and get this girl a pretty cool collection of candles, a big cookie, glass angel thing and a drawing of a character from a show she likes. She enjoys it and thanks me a lot. In hindsight, we're not very good at being anonymous...\nAnyway, I get handed my gift and it looks like a giant wrapped egg. I open it and it's a coconut. A coconut. I'm like \"Oh wow a coconut! Thanks...\" trying to hide my disappointment. These cost like 20 cents here... Also I couldn't open it so that was fun. Ended up shoving a protractor down in to try and get some juice. Didn't really work out. \nSo, am I being too triggered here and expecting too much? I feel like if he had a problem with the price range, he should've said something about it, and he's not in a bad situation. He's bought Red Dead a month back. Goes to a private school. Or maybe I'm too privileged?\nTL;DR I got a coconut and it came off as if he didn't put any effort in and came up way shorter on the decide price range.\nPs: I wouldn't have cared of he got me something cheap that I was interested in, like video game merch or whatever, but it was a coconut...",

We live together and now need to decide how things are separated, but the problem is she did not come with much whereas my parents helped us furnish our place and I brought some of my items. We already had an agreement on how the items were going to be separated but that was with the thinking we were going to still date and try to work things out, which we no longer are (her decision). We are separating on decent terms and I honestly don't want to leave her with nothing. On the other hand, she owes my parents hundreds in bills since \\~May and it really doesn't seem like she will pay so I don't think she should get anything. I have spoken with my parents and they pretty much left it to me, I just don't want to be a complete asshole when it isn't warranted but I also don't want someone to screw my family over more. In case it matters or anyone cares, here are the items:  \n\n\n\\- 2 flat screens, 1 was mine the other from my parents. She rarely watches TV and is more on her phone using YT or something so I am planning on taking both. I have multiple gaming consoles and also watch TV/sports more, I will get more use.\n\n\\- Bedroom set. The mattress/boxspring is hers but my parents bought everything else, I am letting her keep this.\n\n\\- Living room furniture, this is the big one. There is a couch and a chair set my parents bought us specifically for the apartment. I would really feel like an asshole taking this, BUT I would feel like we got screwed if she keeps this nice furniture and I now have to get second hand/cheap stuff.\n\n\\- Misc. like microwave, coffee pot, pots/pans, dishes, etc. This was a mix of my parents buying and us buying so I think she should keep it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to take these items back?

      "description": "I feel like I already know the answer to this, but I'm asking it anyways. Please hear me out first though.\n\nYour eyes/eyebrows and mouth are basically what make up your expression at any given time. The expression that you put off will sort of reflect onto whoever you are around and can affect their mood as well. Well I met this girl and have been talking to her for a short time. We've met a few times and she seems like a really cool person who shares some similar interests with me. She's also very beautiful but first thing I noticed about her was her eyebrows. They're arched really high (think St. Louis Arch) and then slant aggressively on the insides towards her nose. This being said, she has a permanent look of being surprised/angry/evil all the time. That's the best way I know how to describe it. I don't really know enough about eyebrows to know if hers just naturally look like that or if she styles them like that herself.\n\nAnyways, when I look at her, I can't help but feel like she's constantly surprised mixed with being mad/evil which ends up as me receiving a weird vibe although I know it's not anything she's doing intentionally. I've tried telling myself everything I know how to, like \"just look past it\" or that her looks shouldn't matter regardless. And looks don't matter necessarily, but I feel like other people's expressions play a big role on your mood and no matter how hard I try, I can't help but feel put off. Therefore I've been questioning if I should keep this going or not. I feel like I'd be the biggest shit head of all time for not wanting to be with someone because of their eyebrows (although I would never tell her or mention anything about it to her), but it really just throws me off more than most things could.\n\nI'm an asshole, right?",

I told him to meet me at 11, to which he agreed. I got there at 10:45 and waited until 11:30, when I called him and he said he still thought we were meeting at 6pm. I thought he maybe forgot, so we agreed to 1. I waited until 1:15 to which I messaged him and told him I'm leaving. He said okay and so I got in line for the bus. He calls me when my bus came and said to wait 5 minutes because he was on the way. I told him i was leaving and he said that was okay. My bus wouldn't come again for an hour and I didn't want to wait. So I said I'm sorry but I'm leaving. I blocked his number and hopped on the bus. He gets his friend to call me and tell me to come back. I said no I'm gone, I'm not coming back and that I have somewhere to be. He keeps pushing for me to come back to the point where I snapped for wasting my time and yelled F*CK OFF out loud on the bus and hung up. He called 1 more time and asked to reschedule (I should mention this is the 4th time he's asked that) I said no, you're wasting my time and I'm going to sell it to someone else. He started asking even more and I just broke. I told him I'm not selling to him and that he should leave me tf alone and some other swears before I told him to never contact me again. This happened 2 hours ago btw. AITA?",

This is my first relationship, and his second  We are very happy together, and we try to spend as much time together as possible. \n\nA few weeks back, the topic of becoming sexually active came up. We tried it a few times, but I was just never interested. I don't have any religious/moral objections to it, I just don't get anything out of it and it makes me slightly uncomfortable. \n\nHe, on the other hand, has a very high sex drive. He always wants it, especially after we had sex for the first time. It's to the point where he says that it affects his everyday life, like his sleep, concentration, etc. \n\nThe other day, he was talking about this situation a lot. He was sending me articles about the benefits of sex, saying how he wishes he could have sex with me so that he could sleep better, stuff like that. It felt to me very manipulative, and I asked him to stop trying to talk me into sex because it made me uncomfortable. He almost immediately apologized and backed off. He said he didn't intend for it to sound that way, but if it did then he would stop talking about it. Our conversation has been sparse since then.\n\nWe both have the day off today, and normally I would go straight to his house, but upon asking him if I was okay to head over (he sleeps in so I wait until he's awake) he said maybe I shouldn't today. \n\nI feel bad because it's affecting his life so much, and I want to help him with it, but it seems the only solution is me having sex with him regularly, and I don't want to do that. So am I the asshole for not having sex with him? What should I do? \n\nTL:DR I don't really care for sex and it makes me slightly uncomfortable, but my boyfriend has a super high sex drive and the lack of action is affecting his daily life. Am I the asshole for not having sex with him?",

      "description": "So me and my sister both like watching anime, and we have a spare room in our basement that we have as an anime room, I guess. A few months ago I had a small party and had two people come early (P1 and P2), mainly so I could show them the anime room (they watch anime too, and I thought I could trust them). My sister, but partially me don't want word to spread around school that we watch anime, or have an anime room in our house. I tell both people that this isn't something they can tell everyone, and they both agree to not say anything. \n\nThat I know of, P2 didn't tell anyone, but a month or two later P1 and I are walking in the hallway with someone and they, most likely on accident, mention the anime room. I elbow them to be quiet, but they keep talking. I thought it was on accident, so a few days later while I'm talking to them on discord I mention it and tell them that it's fine that he mentioned it, just don't tell anyone else, but P3 was in the call so before that I told them I would deafen then for a second to talk to P1. After I undeafen P3, P1 starts to talk about why I had to talk to them, and then, even after me saying \"don't tell them,\" tells P3 that I have an anime room. After that I just left the call, because I was really annoyed by P1 saying that.\n\nA few hours later, after I thought about it, I decided to join the call again. I explain to P1 that them telling wouldn't bother me, but it isn't fully my secret to tell. They mostly shrug it off and doesn't really seem like they care that much but I thought they understood I really just didn't want them to tell anyone, so I just let it go.\n\nA few months pass, and today I decide to text them to see if they want to help plan a party with me, and they tell me P4 will help, which I'm fine with. They make the conference call which I join, then I tell P4 about what we're doing. Out of nowhere, P1 goes \"can I tell P4 about the thing?\" After I realise what they were talking about, I say no because like I said, it isn't really my secret to tell. P1 just says to bad, and after that I left the call, because I didn't want to deal with that. It's been an hour and they haven't tried to message me or call back, and I know they  told P4 about the room after I left the call, that is just the type of person they are. AITA for being this mad about a stupid secret like watching anime, even though it isn't my secret to tell, and could possibly ruin my, or my sister's social lives?",

      "description": "Trying to not give away too much info - So I work in service and deal with guests a lot, mostly tourists so rude people are nothing new to me. I'm usually able to stay professional and keep my cool like nothing happened.\n\nAs one would expect, I often catch guests doing things they aren't supposed to, like trying to steal something or taking photos of things they shouldn't. Or sometimes have drunk guests acting inappropriately. It's pretty much a 50/50 the rate at which they cooperate when I tell them they can't do that.\n\nSo - one time, as usual, I had a run-in with a mother who was with her kid, noticed she was taking pictures of things she shouldn't be. As usual, I approached her and said \"sorry ma'am, you can't do that\" and tried to help by redirecting her to where she can. She stopped, said okay, but seemed to give me a death stare.\n\nFive minutes later I noticed the same woman trying to do the same thing while I wasn't looking, once again I approached her and said \"excuse me...\" and reminded her she can't do that. She then flipped out at me, don't remember the exact words but something along the lines of \"take your fucking thing I don't need it anyway, fuck off\". I was shocked, because although angry customers are nothing new to me, her kid was right there! This is where I may have crossed a line, I said \"seriously? In front of your kid?\" To which she replied \"Do you have kids? Nah, thought so, you don't understand!\" (I don't lol). After that I just walked away, didn't wanna escalate anything especially while on the clock, explained to my manager what happened.\n\nThe thing is, I know it's not my business to say that, but usually when someone angrily curses at me my go-to is to discreetly tell them there's kids around and to keep it down (which there usually is), so I guess that's the first thing that came to mind. Luckily I didn't get written up or anything but my manager did tell me that I 'can't go around criticizing people's parenting'.\n\nI guess I did overstep a bound a little bit but AITA?",

Then, he dropped out of school to work full-time. He makes $14.00 an hour, works about 60 hours a week, and pays us $100.00 a month in rent. \n\nToday,  I walked into his bedroom and discovered that he spilt yellow paint across the carpet in multiple places, and decided not to tell us. It is now dried and stained. It's not super noticeable,  but you can definitely see it - it's smeared into the carpet in a few places that are at least 6 square inches. His family owns a carpet cleaning company, and he worked for them growing up, so I know he knows that he should have cleaned it up right away AND that it's not coming out now. \n\nWIBTA for making him pay to recarpet the entire room? Certain family members have told me it's not fair, since I have toddlers who will likely destroy things anyway, and you \"can't really see it much\". I think I am justified that even though it would be pricy, it's his fault and that's part of living with us. ",

      "description": "Tl;Dr \n&gt;!Didn't laugh at any of the MC's jokes, got called out for not laughing and fake laughed to shut him up!&lt;\n\nI (31 M) went to a comedy night recently with some friends. It should be noted that because this was a gentleman's club, most of the people there were considerably older than us (I was one of the youngest there).\n\nAfter getting our drinks the MC (Master of Ceremonies) appears on stage and starts to do his warm up speech. Goes on a rant about how he used to be famous in the 90's for hosting a football breakfast radio show and another about how his photo wasn't on the Facebook poster advertising the night. I don't know if he was being serious but wouldn't stop harping on about this fact during the entire night. There were a few laughs from the back of the room but it was clear he was expecting a better reaction from the crowd. \n\nThe act he introduced finishes and there's a 15 minute interval to get drinks and stretch legs. Then the MC rants about how he used to be famous and that he should have been one of the main headline acts of the night but didn't have a picture on the poster that had been advertised on Facebook. There were a few sympathetic laughs but none from me who just wanted to see the next act.\n\nBefore the final act he came out to do a skit where he invited a guy on stage to dress in a cardboard cutout of a spoon and dance around to the jingle that used to play on the football radio show. This must have been hilarious because the party who sat infront of us who had been drinking alot were laughing their heads off. The MC seemed to know one of the people in that party as he had been calling their name after every \"joke\" to get a laugh from him.\n\nThe MC must have been looking at his mate while the poor guy on stage was dancing because the MC was clearly not happy about this.\n\nMC: Hey mate, what's the matter why aren't you having fun, you got a bug up your arse or something? Looks like we have a miser in the crowd. Must not be able to see you very well mate, go and show him a good time.\n\nThe MC leads the poor man right next to me and plays the jingle while the guy sadly grinds the air in front of me, closest thing I've ever had to a lap dance and I start laughing in a fake way just to appease the MC. He seems to be satisfied with the whole ordeal and gives the shamed guy a small box of biscuits as a prize as if that's going to make everything better.\n\nThe rest of the night carried on without incident but afterwards my friends and I went outside to wait for a taxi in the smoking area. A guy came up to me and asked me why I wasn't laughing at the MC and I told him that I didn't find him funny. He says that he didn't find him funny either but was laughing just to get in the mood and try to enjoy himself and that because the MC had pointed me out as someone who wasn't having fun, I had ruined his night.\n\nSo is he right? AITA for ruining this guy's night by not laughing at content I didn't find funny?",

      "description": "My (ex) boyfriend and I dated for over a year but were long distance the last 6 months of it. \n\n\nWe fought incessantly even before I moved. Like screaming at each other fighting, but we always managed to calm down and work it out, but I did try to break up with him on one prior occasion about two months after the move, but he convinced me to stay.\n\nHe is in the military and in order to move here with me he applied to get our early and move to the reserves. So he will be getting out and probably have to move to my city now regardless of our situation. He has a job lined up here both in the reserves and as a civilian, so he will be able to support himself. \n\nHere comes the big issue:\n\nHe has a fetish around watching his girlfriend have sex with other men. I told him from the start I wasn't interested, but he kept bringing it up constantly. I participated once, felt terrible, told him this, and he said he'd drop it because he didn't want it to ruin our relationship. He didn't and started bringing it up literally every time we got freaky, so a few months later I tried it again thinking maybe doing it one more time would make him drop it. I again felt terrible and was angry at him because even though it was my choice to do it, I felt like he kept applying pressure until I finally gave in. I told him that he either stopped with this fantasy or I was leaving. It took him less than a week to bring it up again. I got mad, we fought, and the next night I told him I was done with the relationship and stopped texting him back. \n\nI got on Tinder that night and was swiping. He kept texting me all night saying how sorry he was, how he has a lot of insecurities but he loves me and that it would be foolish to throw all of this away etc etc. The next morning I agreed to talk to him and told him I didn't really want to be with him anymore but if he could prove to me that he could drop the subject for good, then I would give him another chance. He asked me if I had downloaded any dating apps the night before and I told him yes I had. I didn't ask him if he had because I figured if he loved me as much as he was claiming all night and was so committed to me and fixing our relationship, then he obviously wouldn't have done any of that. \n\nLater that day my friend sent me a screenshot of him on Tinder. I sent it to him and told him we're done. He said it was from that night that I had gotten on Tinder too, so I was being hypocritical for being mad. Maybe he is right, but my opinion is if he was that invested in saving our relationship like he claimed to be when he begged me to try to make it work, he wouldn't have done it. \n\nSo I blocked him on everything. I don't know where that leaves him as far as hos military career or where he is going to live because he was going to live with me when he got here.\n\nSo, AITA for dumping him for the reason I did and when I did?

I've always thought she had a perfect body, beautiful face, and I love every part of the way she looks. \n\nLately, however, for whatever reason when she'll say something specific about herself (\"my chin/face /stomach /whatever\"), I've started to notice and see her perspective more. I'm not a fan of this and don't want to ruin the image I have. Today she started again and I told her that I need her to stop degrading herself because it's been impacting the way I see her.\n\nThis DID not go well. She told me I'm an asshole, I don't have her back, that I must be a child for letting my opinions be influenced by what she says.  She also said that because I told her that she's starting to influence my perspective that she questions If I've been lying the other times.

      "description": "I'm already beating myself up because even the title sounds childish, but please hear me out. My roommate copies every little thing about me. She copies my perfume and body wash to get the same \"scent\" as me,  same piercings with the same jewelry that she goes out of her way to find,  recently, she cut her hair the same length days after I cut mine and tries to curl it in the same manner mine naturally curls, even going out of her way to get a curling iron to achieve the \"same\" effect. She tries to go after guys that look a little like my boyfriend. She gets the exact same makeup products as me, and recently purchased a water bottle identical to mine. We adopted a cat together, that she neglects and I am OBSESSED with and she posts pics of her every time I do on social media- she doesn't even let the kitten into her room let alone feed her, EVER. She tries to talk like me and use the same phrases. I'm missing a lot more but I think you guys get the point and I don't wanna ramble. \n\nImitation is the highest form of flattery, I agree to an extent, but what really bothers me is that this girl does it all day every day.  My boyfriend and other roomates tease me about it  regularly. The kicker here though folks is that she always comes up to me so as to introduce to me for the first time, items I've always had and she's KNOWS I've had before. \nIt's almost like she gets defensive without me saying anything at all and outs herself as someone who watches my every move and tries to emulate it.  I really just wish she wouldn't say anything. \n\nAll this is more annoying than truly bothersome, I guess.  She constantly likes to joke that \"we are the same person\", which at first seemed lighthearted, but less and less now that she tries to adopt so much about me as her own. She admitted last night she \"wants to be me\", which was a first, but honestly still a little creepy. I never know how to approach the situation because she seldom acknowledges it and gets defensive if she even \"feels\" like I do, I don't liek confrontation so I literally never acknowledge her copying me.  I guess I wanna know if AITA for this even bothering me at all. ",

      "title": "AITA for \"stealing\" my girlfriend from her best friend?",
      "description": "Important information to start: my gf and I are both lesbians, her best friend is a straight girl. My gf and I have been together for about 3 months, and had been \"talking\" for about 4 months before that. We are all college students, I am 22 years old, my gf \"Katie\" is 21, and her best friend/roommate \"Ashley\" is 20. They have been friends since freshman year.\n\nI spend time in Katie's apartment a lot, since we're dating. We usually hang out in common areas, since they share a bedroom and I want to give Ashley the option to have privacy if she wants it. Mostly all we do is watch movies or play video games in the living room. I spend the night occasionally, but only when Ashley isn't home.\n\nAshley isn't terrible really. Or at least, I'm trying desperately to convince myself that she's not. Katie loves her, and often talks to me about how great she is. In all of my experiences with Ashley, both with Katie and one-on-one, she has done little more than lament her lack of a boyfriend. Seriously, not a day, or hell, even a conversation goes by without Ashley pouting and  whining, \"No boys love meeeeee, I'm so aloooooone, is it because I'm ugly? Why don't boys ask me out?\" She seems to think it's endearing. It's not.\n\nShe is very demanding of Katie's attention and affection, both verbal and physical, which would be fine, except that Katie is MY girlfriend and I don't really like it when I'm cuddling with her, only to have Ashley snuggle up on her other side. Every time I'm hanging out with Katie, Ashley will suddenly appear to show her something, or ask a question, or see if Katie will help her with something. The other day, Katie told me that she loved me, and Ashley called from across the house, \"What about me, babe? Do you love me?\" And Ashley doesn't seem to like me much. Last night when I was over, I overheard her complaining to Katie that she didn't like it when I played 1 player video games while Katie watched because it was boring for Ashley. She seems to resent me for \"taking\" Katie from her.\n\nI get that they have been friends for longer than Katie and I have been dating, but I feel that Ashley's behavior is troubling. Still, I'm not convinced that I'm not the asshole for being so irritated by Ashley's behavior. After all, it's probably hard to adjust to your best friend of four years suddenly spending a lot of time with a new girl who just showed up out of nowhere, and  the fact that we're both girls might make it harder for her to realize that we're in an actual relationship and not just friends (Ashley only found out that Katie was gay about six months before we started dating). I've been brooding over it lately, so I thought I'd ask about it here.\n\nTl;dr, I have been spending a lot of time with my girlfriend, and her best friend seems to feel that she's had her best friend stolen from her. AITA for not wanting her to be super cuddly with my girlfriend while I am actively cuddling her, or not giving us any time to be alone together?",

      "description": "(This is on mobile.)\n So a little info. My family currently has two dogs. They are the puppies of my old dog Zoey. She was my first pet and i loved her to death. I had her for two year, and then she got pregnant. See she was a pit/lab mix and the dad is a lab/retriever mix. We called around and found people to take all the puppies when they were born. When they were born there were nine. We managed to give away 7 of them to our close friends and family so they could still play together as they got older. We still had 2 puppies and Zoey, but Zoey was starting to get really  weak. When i took her to the vet, i found out that she had an issue with her heart and would due within the next month. So i took her home and told my parents and brother.\nMy brother then has the bright idea of keeping 2 of the puppies. One for him and my mom to share and the other one for me to keep when Zoey died.  I was pretty upset with him about that.  For the next month he would make snide comments about Zoey and how i should just have her put down early. We got into a fight and my mom told me to chill out because it's \"just a dog, your brother should be more important.\" So time passes, Zoey dies and i have one of her daughters as my new dog. The dog my brother kept was the largest of the litter. He also got a skin issue from Zoey because she was half pit. So my mom takes my brother and his dog to the vet to get special pills that will help his skin. After my mom was charged the bill she told my brother that he owed her for the pills ( it was around $88). He said he spent all of his money  on stuff for his wii u(lie). Then  my mom then tries to ask me for the money. I said no because 1. Its not my dog and 2. My brother does have the money, he just doesn't want to spend it on his own pet. She began to yell at me about how since im the oldest i have to pick up the slack from my younger brothers. I said that what he does is no longer my problem as he's old enough to know how he needs to take care of whats his (pet, consoles, shoes, etc) She then calls my dad to tell him i won't pay for my brother's vet bill. My dad thankfully told her that it's not my responsibility to pay for my brother's pet. So my brother was forced to pay up and says he hates me now. AITA?",

      "description": "This teacher in my school has been constantly giving me hell due to my views on feminism which I expressed in her English speech assessment. I’m a 15 yr old Male and when I did this speech I was 14. Ever since I did this speech my English teacher, who’s a feminist, has been clearly making my grades worse, been telling other female teachers to watch me and treat me worse, pick on me etc. And she’s been increasing pupils grades in my English class who share her views, just because of this one speech.\n\nShe has done so many bad things to me and my classmates so I just have to list them in some kind of chronological order.\n\nSpeeches start, I do anti-feminist/mens rights speech using facts.\nI get a decent grade on my written speech but my voiced speech grade was bad but admittedly that was my bad, when I had to answer questions the teacher just kept asking irrelevant questions which I couldn’t answer, she wouldn’t let anyone else ask questions, I got a good reception from the men but women were unhappy.\n\nFeminist speech by woman was pretty much the same quality written wise but was just not said in a good tone, generally just sounded liked she was whining and fake crying, yet she got way better grades then I did.\n\nInternational women’s day comes around, she does a whole lesson on it, tells us to pick our female role model in our life, feminist pupil says Hermione Granger, not Emma Watson but the character, teacher agrees. I then say my dog who was very old at the time and sickly but she kept powering through it, teacher says it was an unreasonable choice and disrespectful.\n\nNext written assessment comes around and we had to study articles, both articles were about feminism and women’s rights, absolutely nothing reasonable to write about them, yet again feminist pupils seem to get good grades.\n\nThroughout lessons afterwards teacher singled me out, calling me something similar to a nazi, can’t remember, saying I have strong opinions, just generally nothing kind about me. She seems to look at me strangely, she sits me far away from her in all seating plans for English, even though I would prefer to sit near the front so I don’t have to wear glasses.\n\nDuring all this females in my year start calling me sexist, racist, a pig, nazi, horrible person, telling me to delete socials etc.\n\nInternational men’s day comes along and the teacher does nothing about it, we just have a normal lesson studying a book, so with 5 mins till end of lesson I make a big deal of it. I start by asking her if she knew it was international men’s day that day, she said she didn’t no, I say it’s important to know, she says she didn’t know, I say she should’ve done something, she just keeps repeating herself. She threatens to send me to isolation for disruption if I don’t be quiet so I go quiet and carry on with my work. She makes me stay behind after lesson and talk to her, she tells me what I did was wrong and she says she would’ve done something if she knew about it but I know that’s total BS, head of English department walks in asking what happened, teacher shows me negatively, I have to say sorry to get no punishment. The head was quite clearly a SJW or a suck up if you looked at him, he seems quite privileged so probably the reason he thought I was the bad one.\n\nNon-school uniform comes around and the English teacher wears a “The future is FEMALE.” shirt so I avoid eye contact the whole lesson. I plan to buy “The future is MALE.” shirt for the next non-school uniform.\n\nAfter all this my science class gets a substitute for the rest of the term and the substitute is the other feminist teacher in our school who is quite high up in power and she seems to do similar things to my English teacher and tells me off for no reason at all and will keep shouting at me.\n\nTLDR: Feminist teacher targets me for my anti-feminist views, proceeds to target me with other teachers and become bias to people who share her political views, female classmates proceed to verbally harass me on social media and on school grounds.\n\nAITA for thinking this is all wrong and that she should be punished for it.\n\n\n",

      "description": "I moved into my apartment 6 years ago when my daughter was 1. I live on the second floor and the people who lived below me for the majority of my time here moved out about six months ago. New tenants moved in, four 21 year olds who just got out of college and moved to my city. My landlord lives above me. \n\nI have shared custody of my 7 year old daughter and she is only with me 50% of the time. She is in school full time and i would say during the week she is really only awake and moving about the apartment from 5:00pm to 8:00pm. That being said, she does run around the house, play with toys, laugh, etc. This past weekend, she had 5 friends over for her birthday party. While I tried to keep the kids quiet, they were excited and rowdy and I couldn't take them outside because it was too cold. The guests were at my house from 4-7pm and then left and during that time, the landlord who lives above me texted me and asked that the kids \"take it down a notch.\" I was very apologetic and explained that it was a birthday party and it would be over soon. Then I told the kids to calm down and it seemed to work pretty well. I haven't heard anything else from the landlord and I have never had any of the other people in the building complain. \n\nToday my daughter had 2 friends over after school and they were running around again but only from 6pm to 7:30pm. And I received this text from the neighbor downstairs: \n\nHi, this is your downstairs neighbor, I asked the landlord for your number because I didn't want to like bang on your door but I need you to know that the running around upstairs is really really loud down here. It seems to be happening a lot more often so I needed to say something. \n\nI was miffed as they tend to have people over late at night and also play music/video games pretty loudly. I have never complained because it's not that bad and I live in a big city where I expect noise. So I responded saying, \"I'm sorry it's loud. My daughter just got home from school and will be in bed in 2 hours.\"\n\nThis was the response: \"ok I get it but just keep in mind she is running and jumping on our ceiling. This isn't the first time and it's not appropriate.\"\n\nI haven't responded and I'm not sure if I will. But when the 3 kids were over I let them run around despite the text because I found it to be so obnoxious. I don't think she should tell me what is and isn't appropriate for my daughter to do in our private home. Until winter is over, we are stuck in this apartment and she is only here half of the time. I equally annoyed that the landlord gave her my number without permission. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "I had a really close-knit group of  internet friends about two years ago, and due to life events I gradually grew apart from them. No bad blood at all, just the flow of time  and me losing interest in our shared hobby. Lately  I've  been thinking about them a lot because I picked up our shared hobby again and I stumbled upon some old chat logs and while searching for a way to get back in touch I found a link to a small discord server (7 members) that we'd set up that was still active. Discord has 2 kinds of invite links- a temporary one that expires, and a permanent one, which this  must've been since it was made over a year ago.  In invite links it shows a status if people are online in the group, which 4 of my old friends are. This was a private server for just the few of us and wasn't really used by anyone else, but I'd left the server when I lost interest in our hobby and was cleaning up the list of servers I was in.\n\n  \nI'm not sure  if it'd be an asshole move, but it certainly might be rude or odd/creepy, to  rejoin with that  link to try and catch up. WIBTA or creep to click a year-old link and rejoin our old server? Or should I try and find some other way to get  back in touch?  ",

      "description": "Two weeks ago I applied for a job. The interview went great, and I even had a second interview in which I worked for a little and was able to interact with the team. I had another offer on the table from someone I am close with that I kept pushing back at the time so when the company told me they would get back to me the next week I said sounds great, I have another offer so as soon as a decision is made it would be awesome if you let me know. \n\nOn Tuesday of the following week they got back to me with an offer to which I asked if I could get back to them the next day and if I had any questions I would email them over. Both of these jobs are hourly, I just graduated college. I emailed them the next day asking if they had a policy in place for reviews for potential raises whether it be 60, 90, or 180 days from the start date. I only asked this because the other position I was considering offered a 60 day raise review. The boss responds and says they typically do yearly reviews other than for title changes. I respond back saying great thank you, is there anyway I could get back to you on Friday and sleep on the decision. I don’t get a response, so I email again asking if Friday is okay. I get an email later that night saying while they wanted to know today, after reading my email they wanted to further discuss my role and I could get back to them Friday. I was shocked and knew that this wasn’t good. The next day I get an email from them telling me I should accept the other job and that after reconsidering I am not a good fit for the company because I want to eventually leave the state (this was already discussed prior and okayed). I ask to call them so I could explain myself as my intentions were getting lost in translation and I get no answer. \n\nThe next day I call the office and am told I will be called back in an hour, again I am ghosted. So I send one final email apologizing for asking too forthcoming of questions and reiterating my desire to work for the company long term, accepting the position, and that again I would love to talk on the phone to sort this out. I get no response until past the end of the workday basically saying that while they respect my decision to ask for a pay raise and “my desire to sleep on working with them” they had other candidates more eager than me. \n\nI was honestly pretty shocked by all this, am I an asshole??

      "description": "My daughter is 3 years old, and her mother and I were divorced when she was a little less than a year old. mother had substance abuse issues, which was packaged with a ton of infidelity, which led to me having full custody (she gave this up voluntarily.)\n\nHer mother started straightening up little by little and requested 50/50 time with her (I still hold custody) and I agreed. We have been working this on a 2-2-3 schedule for the past 6 months. \n\nAbout 5 months ago, I got in to a relationship. Wasn’t really looking, but the woman and I clicked instantly. my family has fell for her just about as much as I have. \n\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago. The ex and I have been talking about changing the schedule. She now owns a Mobile Spray Tanning Buisiness. This has made it where my daughter is mainly with babysitters when she’s supposed to be with her mother. I’ve been the sole provider monetarily and emotionally since day one, so it’s bothered me immensely.  I can’t stand seeing her mother having her with random friends when she could be with me and spending time with a parent. This led to a discussion between us of changing the schedule.\n\nWe decided that I’ll have my daughter every Thursday Friday Saturday And Sunday. I’m off weekends, so this gives me a ton of time to spend with my daughter. And makes it hopefully unlikely she will be with a babysitter on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday because my ex works until 5pm and my daughter is usually asleep my 9pm. \n\nSo, the girl that’s been so great so far.. here we go. \n\nShe’s aware that I’ve been working on trying to make my daughters schedule better and the reasons behind it. Every second she has been off work for the last few months, I make sure she’s involved with whatever my daughter and I are doing. And if I don’t have my daughter, we’re constantly going out to do things together or having lazy movie days at the house. I call her to tell her that I’ve finally got my daughters schedule fixed, and the first thing that comes out of her mouth is “Well there’s goes our weekends!” I was shocked; so I replied with “what do you mean, you know my family is huge and they are always begging to spend time with her, you know my mother or grandmother (or a countless other amount of family) would be more than happy to come hang out with her whenever we want a day-date or date night.” \n\nShe hung up on me. I waited until the next day to let her calm down, and called again. I was knocked down before I could barely speak with “if you do this new schedule, our relationship is over. You’re showing that I’ll never be your top priority.”  Well no, I’m the only parent that’s ever going to put this little girl first. I can’t back up on that over a 6 month relationship. I don’t feel it should even be a completion, because I’ve always been persistent about making time for both of them.\n\nSo my wonderful friends at Reddit, am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I’m a 19 year old asian male and I just recently dropped out of college to enlist in the military. I just feel like college isn’t the right thing for me to do atm and the Army is something I’ve actually wanted to be a part of for a long time. \n\nNow here’s the thing: My 50 year old mother and literally my entire family are trying to guilt me out of joining. I live with my mom in the US, while the rest of the family is scattered around Canada and Asia. Mom and Dad divorced a decade ago, and I have no siblings so its just been me and her. After I told my mom that I’m joining the Army she went crazy and begged me not to. “WHAT?!?! How could you do this to me? You’re just going to leave me here all alone? Who is going to keep me company and take care of me as I grow old?” \n\nShe expects me to live at home with her and take care of her forever. I told her that I’m an adult and I am under no obligation to do that. I need to live my own life. She responded by telling me that I’m a horrible son that is ungrateful for the life she’s given me, while sobbing uncontrollably. What makes things even worse is that the rest of my family are on her side. \n\n“Your mom is going to be so lonely! Don’t you love her??” \n\n“She has no husband or any other kids, its your job to make sure she is okay.” \n\n“You’re a monster. She’ll most likely kill herself due to the loneliness, and it’ll be on you. All because you wanted to play soldier.” \n\nAll of this has been keeping me up at night, and I’m even starting to second guess my decision. I don’t want my mom to kill herself, but I can’t just have my entire life revolve around her and what SHE wants. AITA? ",

      "description": "Well.. my girlfriend is about to propose. We were talking about marriage, and have pretty much everything set, because of the legal issues around it. She is American, and I am European from a small country, one of few that are still not part of European Schengen Zone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, long story short. I know she is about to propose, and we were looking up for engagement rings. I wouldn't even think of it, 'cause in my country gay marriages are still not legal, and I never thought I'd be marrying for real, so this is my first time even browsing for rings. Now, coming from an entirely different culture, I was quite surprised by the fact that an engagement ring is something that people would pay so much money for. For instance, everything she was suggesting was approximately around 5000 USD. For me, that s quite a lot, considering that people in my country earn 500- 600 USD per month (with a college degree). But that was also not the issue. She asked me to show her something I'd like, 'cause at the end of the day, I'd be one wearing it. She feels strongly about her proposing to me and not other way around. And I did. I sent her tons of pictures of the rings I liked. We figured out what our wedding bands are going to look like, so I wanted my engagement ring to go along with it. We decided on yellow gold, but I wanted it to be simplistic, thin with a small rock or set of stones, just not to look bulky or to have a huge solitaire since I don't want two of the rings to cover my entire finger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must emphasize that I am person that dresses up really simple and clear cut, and I almost never ever wear jewelry, rings in particular. I have a promise ring at this point, and I've been wearing it every day, but it is a simple silver band with a little twist that I had had made for the two of us. So, the issue here is, whatever I sent to her, she found not good enough. Either the rock was to small, or the ring was too simple, or her family had a good laugh over it, 'cause those kind of rings are not what people in US would usually go for. And non of them would be able to cost much, because they are not diamonds, and they are really really simple. After a lot of talks we had on the subject I suggested we drop it, and that I would wear whatever she gets for me, even if I didn't like it. I just didn't care about the whole issue anymore, and I didn't want to argue over these kind of things. We don't argue over anything in general, we are really similar about almost everything and have same goals in life. I love my girlfriend, she' s a wonderful partner and friend in every possible aspect, and she is doing so much for us already, being that she needed to adopt my dogs, change the apartment for the house because of them, come visit me constantly since I cannot get tourist visa for US, and all these other things, and I am just so blessed to have her. She even promised that once we retire we'd come back to Europe to live, 'cause I had my heart set to Italy. She is beyond amazing, and I cannot wait to marry her, honestly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen yesterday, all of a sudden, she mentioned she found two rings and her grandma loved them, and she thinks that's it. They are yellow gold, raw diamond combination, beautiful, and simplistic, and even though I already asked to drop the subject, she was so happy about it, and I asked her to send me the pictures. Now, I was horrified. First of all, both of them had a huge rock, really thick band and the rock itself was literally surrounded by more gold, like it was in some sort of golden nest. I don't really know how to explain it, but they were neither simplistic, nor small. And I just lost it. I told her that I cannot believe she would even consider something that looks that way, taking into account every single picture I sent her, and that I do not understand why she even asked me to send her what I want if she's not taking any of the things I sent and said into consideration. And that I would have been happy with just about anything, even if I didn't like the ring, if she hadn't asked me to show her exactly what I want, and that now, instead of being just romantic and happy about the actual proposal, both of us will be stressing about how the other one is going to react. She was beyond mad yesterday, and just told me to drop the subject, and that she doesn't want to talk about the ring or the marriage again. She said that she is going to propose, of course, but she doesn't want to talk about it. I tried apologizing this morning as well, I've been crying the whole damn morning, 'cause I know I shouldn't have told her I hated them that much, but I actually did. And it's not just that, it hurts me to know that she's not considering what I like just because she thinks it's socially unacceptable and that everyone is going to laugh at her. She literally told me, I want everyone to see you are mine!?!? I don't think me being hers or less hers is at all proportionate with the size of the damn rock. I just don't get it. But, then again, I'm trying to understand her side of the story, and since she no longer wants to discuss it, I am interested what you other people have to say on the subject. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being completely out of the line here or it's just a cultural difference?

Now when I initially met him he seemed nice enough and I didn't really have an issue with him, until about 2 weeks after meeting him my gf had started telling me that they used to date and send explicit pictures to each other. Now this was very upsetting to me considering how much older he was and the fact that when they \"dated\" she was under aged.\n\nNow her and this guy we're still very close, as he drove her places she needed to go and bought her things she wanted. He also was very controlling of her. He had made her break up with a few previous boyfriend's because he didn't like them and he seemed very manipulative.\n\nA couple of days after she told me I confronted her and told her how uncomfortable it made me that they were still so close and that I felt like he was just trying to get in her pants. She told me that I can't control who her friends are and that i just have to deal with him. Her saying that made me feel like she didn't care about how I feel about him and I broke up with her.\n\nI'm sorry about how confusing this story is, I'm not really the best at this and was just looking for some input as I feel like a total douche for just dumping her on the spot. Also I know that I'm 2 years older than her but I didn't really seem to find an issue with it as we went to the same school and she was very mature.",

      "description": "Ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.\n\nMe and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which I pay for by myself, as I make enough money to afford it and I didn’t want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.\n \nWe also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn’t want to go through that again in this one.\n\nThe fact that I pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course I pay in part for). Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.\n\nAnyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.\n\nFirst I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be “discovering herself” on this trip, and when I asked why hadn’t she told me she said because I wouldn’t have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)\n\nWell an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: \n\nGf: “why can’t I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest”\n\nMe: “you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out”\n\nI believe it was the right thing to do as she didn’t pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn’t have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.\n\nThat night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house. \n\n",

      "description": "So my sister and her husband have been married for maybe 3 years, I’m not too sure, and they have baby that’s about a year and a half. \n\nA little backstory, they met online and this guy is significantly older than my sister. Sometimes that’s not an issue but my sister went to a special school and though she is by all means normal, she is mentally younger in age and is a slow learner. So what maybe a 13 year difference in real life, could be more mentally speaking. My sister is also easily persuaded into situations and believing things. Which is a real problem, once a guy from school talked her into buying him clothes and all his food. \n\nNow to my brother-in-law, I never got a good feeling about the dude. He seemed nice enough but his jokes were slightly offensive. More like backhanded comments played off as jokes. And I know it’s  rude to say, and we aren’t rich by any means, but it’s like he purposely tried to look cheap. If you’ve ever witness this, you know what I’m referring to. He stuck out so hard, it made me initially not like him for my sister. My sister was very social with the family and once he started coming to family functions my sister was less social and just sat with him and didn’t interact as much as she use to. \n\nI know I probably sound like an asshole up until this point, judging him on appearance and taste, but I am trying to be as unbiased as possible. It would be easy to just put things that favor me to not sound like an ass but I really want to know. I did judge him and I didn’t like him for my sister. \n\nMarriage was mentioned early on their relationship and when I found out he didn’t have papers ( we live in USA), I thought he was trying to marry my sister for citizenship. He promised he wasn’t but then they secretly got married without telling anyone. Hence, why I don’t know how long they have been married.  This made me dislike him more but not quite hate him. I kept my dislike mostly to myself and shared the same feelings as my other siblings. \n\nFast forward about 6 months after they get married and my sister group messages all my siblings and I saying that she’s pregnant. My youngest sibling responds saying congrats, the rest of us don’t say a single word. My sister has lupus and has strict orders from the doctor not to get pregnant. That a pregnancy would kill her, literally.  My sister knew this, he knew this. He is a super super religious guy and thought it was a miracle that she was pregnant. I had to explain to them that it wasn’t that she couldn’t get pregnant, it’s that she isn’t suppose to get pregnant. \n\nNow every doctor they saw, that was aware of my sister’s condition, recommended termination of pregnancy. He (they) refused. He seemed more concerned about having a baby than my sister’s health. This drove me up the fucking wall. I tried talking to my sister and she seemed to somewhat agree with me and seemed scared about the whole situation but again she was talked/bullied into this being a wonderful thing *insert religious god wants this lines*. Fast forward to 3 months of pregnancy, my sister is in and out of the hospital. Her health is deteriorating, they suggest termination but again, no go. \n\nFor the next 2 months she’s on her death bed, her husband is dead set on my sister carrying the baby to at least 7 months. At 5 months of pregnancy, my sister is in a coma, lost most function of her kidneys and doctors basically said there is nothing they can do but deliver baby and hope it makes it.  Since she is in a coma, and he is legally her husband, he gets all medically decisions. I lost my shit on him. I made him cry according to my mom but about a week later my sister had schedule operation to take out the premature baby. \n\nNow the baby was in the hospital for about 3 months and my sister was there for a few weeks but now has dialysis 3 times a week. She doesn’t seem the happiest. She has come visit me a couple times and when she does, she usually doesn’t have money for gas or baby formula and the baby happens to run out of food. I lose it. I give her money, or buy her formula and food but it turns into me just hating the guy more. I understand they may have some medical bills that isn’t covered by insurance but they don’t have to pay rent or bills other than their car and phone bill. The moved in with my mom so she could help. My mom buys them all adult food. \n\nI feel he controls her to make sure she comes home at a certain time by not giving her money. She isn’t allowed to have male friends and has to ask for permission to do things. I just really hate the guy at this point. Shortly after they got married and my sister got pregnant he applied for citizenship, which raises a red flag for me. My sibling are cordial with him, don’t like him but don’t hate him. I actively ignore the guy. I acknowledge him when my manners get the best of me but for the most part, I’m cold towards him. Several family members have told me to be nice, my mom has asked me stop being basically and asshole, to respect their marriage and not get involved. \n\nSo am I an asshole for basically treating this guy like nothing when I am around?

      "description": "This was something that happened at Christmas, but its been troubling me since it happened. \n\nOver the holidays, my boyfriend was meant to stop by my parents house to stay for the night before we both headed back to his place. Because he doesn't currently have a car, his parents would be driving him to ours. When he told me this, he said something along the lines of \"my parents will be driving me, but just dropping me off.\" I interpreted this as they would be dropping him off at the door, and they would be heading straight home since its a 30+ minute drive and it would be dark, and this is what I told my parents before he was meant to come over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I want to say this as nicely as possible, but sometimes my parents can be bad in social situations, especially my mum. Another example of this was when a few months back my friend had come by to visit, and when my mum walked into the hallway we were both in, upon seeing my friend (and my friend clearly seeing her) she immediately walked out without saying anything or greeting her at all, which my friend was obviously hurt and confused by.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was worried something like that would happen again when he arrived with his parents - that they wouldn't come to the door when they arrived and say hello, even though they would obviously be in the house, and that his parents would be confused or find them to be rude. So, about 30 minutes before they were meant to arrive I asked if she and my dad could just come to the door and introduce themselves before they left, which almost immediately upset her. She asked me why they had to if \"they were just dropping him off.\" When they did arrive, my parents introduced themselves and then my mum invited them in, which I wasn't expecting. However, at the time I thought that part had gone as well as it could have: our parents seemed to get along okay, and nothing was too awkward, but my parents didnt really have any food or beverages to offer them except wine. But after his parents left, my parents were very upset with me. My dad said that when my boyfriend said that his parents were just \"dropping him off\" that it obviously meant that they would be expecting to be invited in and that I should have realised that. When I was leaving the room, I heard my parents say that they \"obviously can't trust anything I say.\" And now my mum is convinced that my boyfriend and his parents think they're horrible - and when I ask her why she said its because when they were invited in they didnt have anything to offer them. I have told her multiple times that this isn't true, that after my boyfriend said he thought it went well, and that his parents wouldn't judge them like that, but it falls on deaf ears I think. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really don't know if I messed up, or at least, how badly?  Was I wrong in assuming that \"dropping off\" just meant dropping off at the door? Was I overthinking everything in regards to making sure my parents introduced themselves to his when they came over? I will admit, that I was extremely anxious that day and I might have overthought everything too much, but I don't know.  I feel like maybe there was some miscommunication at some point, but I can't pinpoint where. ",

      "description": "I am in medical school on a generous scholarship. A local congressman (CM) was instrumental in getting my scholarship program set up, and without his action I would be in a much deeper pile of debt than I am currently in. (If it makes a difference, it's a publicly funded scholarship and not from his personal fortune). I am also gay and married.\n\nUnfortunately, CM does not have a good track record with LGBT rights. He recently voted to restrict LGBT rights in my state and has supported legislation that would have made my life more difficult. It is clear that he believes opposite-sex marriages are superior to same-sex marriages.\n\nCM's wife just passed away and my scholarship coordinator wants all of the students to sign a card for him. I am strongly considering not participating. We are a very small program. If I declined and/or \"forgot\" to sign the card, it would definitely be noted, but I'm not sure that I really care.\n\nI am genuinely sorry his wife died. I never met her, but she never did anything to hurt me. However, it galls me that I'm being asked to send condolences to someone who thinks he is better than me. I can handle people who don't like me due to my orientation, but people who attack my marriage hurt a lot worse. Our coordinator wouldn't ask a Jewish student to sign a card for a politician expressing anti-Semitic views, or a black student to sign a card for a politician expressing racist views. Or maybe she would, because it's the socially acceptable thing to do. Maybe I'm being way too oversensitive? WIBTA here?",

      "description": "For context, my parents are divorced and I am in my early 20s and in college.  \n\nYesterday I had to say goodbye to my 14 year old dog whom I loved dearly.  She was my dog at my dad’s house and the first dog I ever trained and took care of myself.  After saying my final goodbyes to her I was very upset and was crying.  My mom knew my dog was being put to sleep and that I had to say goodbye to her.  I went to my moms house since I was on her side of town and I haven’t been able to visit recently due to being busy with work and school.  As soon as my mom saw that I was crying she looked at me and said, “Oh stop it.” in the most dismissive tone.  I simply replied, “Fuck you.” and turned around and walked out of her bedroom.  I stayed at her house for 3 hours after that to see my little sisters and my mother never even bothered to leave her room to say anything to me.  \n\nShe had my sister tell me she wanted me to go talk to her in her room upstairs and I said, no and that I was not talking to her until she came to apologize to me for being rude.  I left without saying anything else to my mom and went back to my apartment.\n\nToday my mom called me and told me that I needed to apologize to her for being so rude yesterday.  I said, I wouldn’t because she was so dismissive of my feelings and unsupportive of me first.  She responded by saying that I didn’t support her when her dad (my grandpa) passed away 3 years ago.  I told her I wasn’t going to argue about this with her and ended our phone call.\n\nWithin an hour, she texted me and told me that all I do is take advantage of her and treat her like shit.  I replied and said, “You know that’s not true.”.\n\nI don’t think I treat my mom like shit, I call her at least 3 times a week and try to meet with her on her lunch break at least once a month.  I still partially rely on her financially while I am in college and I am certain this is why she claims i’m “taking advantage” of her.  I feel like she is trying to control me with money, but I am not financially stable enough yet to completely support myself. \n\nAm I the asshole here?  All I wanted from her was an ounce of sympathy and instead she completely dismissed my emotions and hurt my feelings because I was upset over my dog.",

I took this hard, but let her go. She insisted before and then that we should stay friends, and I said I would at least try.

      "description": "A little backstory: I’ve been at my job for over a year, it’s an entry level registration position at a local hospital. The work environment is toxic, you’re just a number to management, and there’s absolutely no flexibility. However, the job is relatively easy and the pay is very good for the work. \n\nI found out I was pregnant and about four months into my pregnancy a part time position in the same department became available and I applied. I got the position (2/3 days a week) but worked full time for the department until I gave birth because they were so short staffed. Now, here we are 11 weeks into my 12 week leave and I’m supposed to return to work on Monday. \n\nMy position would require childcare 2 days a week which a family member I trust has offered. However, the trip to drop my baby off, go to work, pick baby up, and then head home is 100+ miles a day and almost three hours of commute. I had every intention on going back but now as it approaches I’m very stressed about returning to work/commuting/returning to toxic environment. I spoke with my manager two weeks ago and told her I’d be returning to work (now I wish I would’ve just said I won’t be back, but I did have every intention of returning). \n\nI feel like I have two options: quit with no notice or return to work and give a two week notice. With the second option, I won’t burn any bridges but will have to shell out about $60 for a work uniform as my pre-pregnancy ones no longer fit and I’m no longer allowed to wear maternity clothes. \n\nSide note I have major anxiety and what I really want to do is just never go back, but I realize that’s pretty crappy. \n\nI’m not worried about having to pay anything back since I do not carry insurance through them. However there have been major cuts in the department and what I’m returning to is not the situation I left (they have fired/let go/approved transfers for 5-6 people) and mandatory overtime is on the horizon (potentially as soon as I return according to management and staff) and with a 3 mo old and my husband working 5-6 days a week I can’t do mandatory OT. \n\nSo AITA for putting in my notice as soon as I return to work from a three month leave?\n\nTl;dr: told manager I was coming back from maternity leave now I do not want to return. Aita for putting in notice my first day back?",

It wont turn on now and corporate has to give me a new one. Most of my work info is on a cloud so most wont be lost thankfully. Ill have to reconfigure a new one, and by new its probably going to an old used one nobody uses anymore.\n\nBut my papers on the desk were ruined and i was mad about the whole thing even though he profusely apologized.\n\nI gave him a terrible review and hes going to have to be retrained somewhere else. My boss thinks i shouldve been easier on him since our office was so close to his home and hes being transferred somewhere thats like an hour away vs a 5 minute drive to our office. AITA and was i too harsh?",

      "description": "Last semester, I was in a group project with a friend and another classmate. Classmate has a learning disability, which is very common and has a lot of online tools to help. I’m a transfer student, who has a double workload to catch up to my own year. I also have social anxiety, but due to recent improvement, this is something I haven’t shared with my class yet. The only one, who knows is my friend. The subject we are studying is hard and we all have difficulties. Classmate tends to bring us her homework and forcefully try to make us do it for her. I’m terribly behind in this class and have tried explaining this to classmate on multiple occasions without much change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Beginning our final project, classmate has a talk to friend and I about being so close and how this makes classmate feel like the third wheel. She reminds us that she needs extra help and time on projects. I suggest we each do homework on the project to speed up the process and ensure I can read the necessary texts. Everyone agrees and I spend the next three days hitting the books. I read about four months’ worth of literature in three days and do the planned homework. As it turns out, I’m the only one that remembered to do the homework and I present it on a projector to kickstart the project. I have explicit reasoning on every single suggestion in an effort to help classmate understand my POV.  Classmate is silent the entire presentation and the following work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  You need to be blind at this point not to get there is a problem. Classmate again says that we aren't helping and I frustrated with her ask: \"Is it best for you to do the exam with us then?\"  Classmate gets pissed and leave. I feel bad and write her a nice apology, realizing that I did indeed sound like an arsehole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  We meet again a few days later. Classmate come late and we work peacefully for about an hour. Then classmate explodes. She tells us that we are getting our wish and she won't be joining us for the exam. Then she goes into a long spiel about how I never hold eye-contact with her and just hates her guts, while friend is a saint and helping her so much. Friend ask her what she is planning to do now, and classmate explain our professor has asked her to finish this project with us and then do the exam alone. However, she has by then called me every name in the book and I'm fed up. I leave the table trying to hide how much I'm shaking with anxiety and refused to do the project in same room as her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  I realized afterwards that I've felt anxious with classmate for awhile and I therefore believe I might actually have avoided looking her in the eyes, but I don't want to share this personal piece of info with a stranger to clear this up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Classmate transferred class to avoid me.",

      "description": "Currently I live with 3 roommates. Roommate 1, I’ve lived with for many years and we get along awesomely, we moved together to a house with one of her friends, Roommate 2 and her cat, about 7 months ago. \n\n\nAt first I was annoyed because the cat’s claws were long, and she loves kneading the people she lays on, and it hurts. She also claws the carpet which the landlord will probably have to replace. I suggested helping RM2 cut her nails, she declined. RM2 told RM1 she was annoyed by my concern and said her cat’s quicks were “too long” to safely cut (which was false). I bought my own cat nail trimmer, and would cut her nails when she would come visit me in my room. No pain, no bleeding. \n\nSecondly I was annoyed that I’d often find her food bowl empty, albeit, never for more than 24 hours, so I brought it up, which annoyed RM2. Then when I tried to keep her food bowl topped off, RM2 asked me to stop because she likes to know “how much food her cat is eating”. Yet, RM2 would sometimes leave for 2+ days without explicitly asking either me or RM1 to check on her cat’s food and water supply. Of course we did though. Also her water bowl was frequently empty, and I was really mad about that until RM2 informed me she would drink out of the toilet, so I was less angry knowing the cat wasn’t going without water. \n\nThings get worse for the cat when RM1 gets a dog. Cat is now locked in RM2’s small bedroom, and cat is terrified of the dog. Cat spends her days sleeping under blankets in a bed, and is frequently alone while RM2 goes out of town, or is fucking pet sitting for other people’s pets for weeks at a time. Again, never explicitly asking anyone to watch her cat while she’s gone. \n\nThe cat is purely a convenience for RM2, regardless of how much she professes her love for her cat. And here’s what really has me bothered, RM2 is temporarily re-homing her cat so she can work in Alaska for 4 months. Her lifestyle is NOT FAIR to her poor cat. Ugh. \n\n\nAnyway, RM1 says my standards for pet care are high and that the cat is fine, so I’m alone in feeling angry about that the way this cat isn’t having a thriving life. I’ve kept it to myself until last night. RM2 is leaving for Alaska in 3 weeks, and this was our text exchange, verbatim:\n\n\n&gt; Me: I know you hate when I give cat advice, but [Cat]’s breath smells a little fishy. You might want to consider a checkup before you leave. You said you wanted to when we first moved in, she might need a dental cleaning. \n\n\n&gt; RM2: Thank you again for your concern but I don’t appreciate receiving these messages. She has an appointment scheduled before I leave. 👍\n\n\n&gt; Me: I care more about her wellbeing than bothering you. I don’t appreciate you leaving to take care of other people’s animals when you barely give yours an enriching life. You say you love her but zero of your life decisions involve keeping her in your life. Get mad. \n\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I dated a girl all throughout college. It was great, we were totally in love. But we were too young to get married at 22, and so we had a painful break up and she ended up marrying the guy she dated right after me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTen years later, their marriage is ending (no kids, mercifully), and she calls me the day she moves out of their house. For me, she's the one who got away, so I was totally happy to be her rebound. I'm still very much in love with her. But now it's been two months of serious dating and it feels like we might once again have a real thing. Obviously, I'm taking it very slow and trying not to put pressure on her. But I can't help the natural love and excitement I feel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in no way responsible for their break-up, at least that I'm aware of. We were barely even friends during the time they were together, mostly because it was too painful for me. But I'm not one to sabotage a 10-year marriage. The husband is by all accounts a stand-up guy. We might have even been friends in another life. Do I have a responsibility here to give them more space or can I let my love flag fly?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelated question, marital ethics aside: How long is it going to be before I know whether our reconnection was a rebound for her or if it's the foundation for Part 2 of our relationship? I'm mid-30s, never been married, ready for that whole stage of life; but I feel like it may be years before she's back at that point.

I am 22 and have a kid from my only long term relationship that happened when I was 16 in high school. We broke up after high school due to many different reasons and I moved away to go to uni while she and my child moved away to live with her new beau's family. So we have been a 10 hour drive away from each other for the past 4 years. This has led to me not having a super close relationship with my child, it is mostly limited to phone calls and visiting 2-3 times a year during breaks and holidays.\n\nThis leads me to my question. After we broke up I didn't have any interest in dating and just recently finally decided to get back into it. While I'm not completely opposed to dating someone who has a child, I will admit it definitely makes me think someone is not as attractive as a romantic possibility. Am I the asshole for feeling this way? I've used my not close relationship with my own child to rationalize this as an okay way to feel, but I'm curious what you guys think",

      "title": "AITA for explaining to my gf that Pit Bulls can be more aggressive toward other dogs...",
      "description": "For starters, yes, I know that \"Pit bulls\" are not a breed of dog, rather a group of different breeds that all get lumped together into the \"pit bull\" label. Her dog is an American Staffordshire Terrier, a dog found in that group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning my girlfriend received a text from her mom saying that her dog had started a fight, and might be put down this weekend. She was devastated, and I immediately was there to try and comfort her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while, she had calmed down, and started saying that it's \"*not his fault*\". Saying that it **MUST** be something hereditary (mental incapacity, etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she mentioned that it was hereditary I had asked \"*by hereditary do you mean because he's a pit bull?*\"... well shit, this **REALLY** set her off. She is someone who will defend the name of pit bulls, ignore anything she doesn't agree with, twist words, and only provide articles or \"evidence\" that \"proves her point\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I said that, she then claimed it's how he was raised. I didn't totally disagree with that argument, but mentioned that the breed of the dog might play a factor in the aggressiveness as well. I provided excerpts from the ASPCA's position statement on \"pit bulls\", excerpts from the American Kennel Club, among other sources... She responded \"*bull... fucking... shit...*\" each word as it's own message, I responded to this by saying \"if you know so much then why don't *YOU* go to the ASPCA and tell them yourself that they are wrong\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made sure to say repeatedly, that no, not all \"pit bulls\" are violent towards humans or other animals. But due to the nature of their breed, they MAY be more likely to act aggressively toward other animals. I also noted that \"pit bulls\" are not the only type of dogs that can be aggressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a single word of what I said was listened to. She started to list off dogs that she has met personally, claiming that they were all some of the best behaved dogs she has ever seen, and that proves her point. She then started saying that I needed to \"educate myself on dogs\" and that I am stereotyping dogs. She then goes on to say \"***I know what I'm talking about, it's not the dog, it's the owner***\" I then suggest she do a little research first. Then I get this gem of a text from her, \"***I don't have to because i already have***\" At this point I'm absolutely floored. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the best part, She googled \"famous dead people who had pit bulls\", then googled \"hellen keller and her pit bulls\", She then sent me two photos of hellen keller with her dogs and said \"*if they are so bad why did she have one*\" and \"*oh look she had two*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnsure of how to even respond, I kinda messed up by saying \"*how closed minded do you have to be?*\", she hit me back with \"*I rest my case,* *I'm not close minded,* ***you are****, by cataloging all of them*\"... what does that last part even mean? Cataloging WHAT??? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart of me thinks that everyone sucks here, but her acting this way in what should be a civil debate/discussion happens all too often, and usually gets out of hand... maybe this is a job for r/relationship_advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: TRIED to have a civil discussion with my girlfriend about pit bulls and how they were bred to be more aggressive toward other animals, and that maybe this was a reason her Pit Bull keeps attacking her German Shepard. In response she acted like she knows everything.",

Fast forward these past 2 weeks and she’s been texting everyone saying how she just saw the person and is making posts on her Snapchat about seeing him in the halls and stuff. Today I talked to them and told them how she needs to tone it back because she’s becoming obsessed with someone who will be out of her life in 3 months and anytime any guy leaves her she has a rough month and I don’t want her to experience that so I’m ending it while it’s smallish.

      "description": "So, in this case I feel like I'm going to be the asshole. I have a friend, and he is really nice. He hasnt done anything wrong, exept for trying to talk to me a lot randomly, and sometimes he would follow me a bit, while talking to me, even though its lunch time, and we don't eat together. He is a nice dude, and he hasnt done anything wrong. But recently I've just been feeling kinda...annoyed around him. Idk. He has done nothing wrong, and I feel like I'm being rude because I'm sorta ignoring him (aka when he talks to me I still reply, but dont really add more to the conversation). I feel like I'm the asshole. I have cut off only a few other friendships, one of them was a valid reason, but the other was not so  much. The second friend I've kinda wanted to stop was with this one friend who sat next to me on the bus. At one point he got mad at me because I wasnt talking to him. Mind you, I'm pretty introverted unless around close friends or family. Also he pretty much claimed that he \"knew\" I had a crush on him (which I didn't) because I apparantly blushed around him. I'm not sure if that's the reason why I didnt wanna be friends with him, but that may be it. So, AITA for breaking off these friendships for (mostly) no reason?\n(I'm fairly new to posting so sorry if this kinda sucks.)",

I wanted to try and talk with him about the stuff he's said and if anything is bothering him but I don't know how to do it, or even if I should say anything at all.\n\nThe first time it happened, two of my friends and I were playing Fortnite together and we were in a call, and then my other friend joined the call. My friend's mom yells at him and he yells back, and he says \"tell your mom she's a fucking idiot\" and then I said \"hey don't say stuff like that it's disrespectful,\" and then he said \"I can be disrespectful to anybody I want.\" I asked my friend if he was upset by that and he said he wasn't and his mom didn't hear what he said.\n\nA week or so after that, I was playing Smash Bros. Ultimate with another friend of mine. He plays Lucina and really only uses her best moves and nothing else, which is annoying but it doesn't bother me that much. My friend joins again and he and the guy I was playing with start talking and he tries saying Lucina takes skill, and then my friend says \"DUDE SHUT THE FUCK UP STOP TRYING TO SAY LUCINA TAKES SKILL SHE DOESN'T.\" I didn't say anything for a bit after that.\n\nThe most recent time it happened was yesterday. All three of my friends from the first incident were playing a Cards Against Humanity clone thing online and I tried joining but had no idea how to. Two of them were singing a Persona 5 song really loud and I couldn't figure out how to join. My friend then screamed \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ANDY'S TRYING TO JOIN THE GAME AND HE'S ASKING QUESTIONS YOU PIECES OF SHIT\". I stopped trying to register and left the call but I eventually joined after one of my friends my other friend yelled at asked me to come back.\n\nI won't make him apologize, but I do want to talk to him about it and see if there's something going on in his life that's making him more crabby than usual. Would I be the asshole if I did that?",

      "description": "Hi reddit, just got back from a weird situation at my local gym and I'd appreciate some help determining if I was in the wrong.  I arrived at 5:40 for a 6 PM yoga class and found myself with some extra time before the class.  The group class was currently occupied by a kickboxing class, so I was standing outside of the room.  The door was open, and next to the open door there were two chairs.  A few minutes went by and I decided I needed to use the restroom before the class, so I dropped my yoga mat down in the space behind the open door.  Of the two chairs next to the door, the closest one was empty, and the one adjacent to it was occupied by a woman who was hunched over, her elbows on her knees.  I go to the restroom, come back, and pick the yoga mat back up.  When I dropped my mat down and picked it back up, I came within about a foot of the woman on the chair, but I was not reaching over her or even around her.  When I picked it up, she shouted, \"Goddamn, do you not see me here?  You can't say 'Excuse me?'\" I'm shocked and don't say anything at first, and she continues to yell at me.  I then say, \"Well, I'm finding your reaction quite rude, I don't see why you need to escalate the situation so quickly.\"  She responded by yelling about how I had just done the \"same thing\" when I set the mat down, and she didn't say anything the \"first time\" so now she had to say something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGranted, I understand that everyone has different definitions of personal space, and had she addressed the issue in a calm manner, I surely would have apologized.  I felt that she forfeited her right to an apology by immediately screaming at me.  We went back and forth for a few minutes, and I began to get upset, so I asked her point blank, \"Did I touch you?\"  She replied, \"No, but...\" and I said, \"I didn't touch you, so I don't see why you feel the need to escalate the situation so quickly.  She shouted, \"You're goddamn right I do!\" We sat in awkward silence for a few minutes and then both entered the class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne other thing I should say about the situation is I am a 30 year old white guy, and she was a middle aged black woman.  I know there is an entire history of white men disrespecting the space and autonomy of women, especially women of color, and I think perhaps some of that played in here.  Thought I would mention it in case some people find it pertinent in rendering a judgement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, reddit, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Got within a foot of a woman to set my yoga mat down, did the same to pick it up. She began screaming at me and I refused to apologize.",

      "description": "My bro knows my actual account so needed to make a throwaway for this one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, my brother was always the nerdier one of the two of us and as a child and young teen, I was a bit of a bully towards him. In all honesty, I never meant any of it maliciously and I never let him go to sleep upset with me, but I used to tease him a lot about his hobbies (mainly anime tbh). We both played video games together but anime is something I never really got into so I used to tease him a fair bit about it, but like I said I never did it maliciously and I honestly didn't think it affected him this badly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the years we slowly grew further and further apart until we both went off to university, and honestly that's when most of our communication ended apart from the holidays where we'd come home to family. He's always been cold towards me since, and I figured that's just the way he is. He's still a huge anime/video game fan but I have absolutely no problem with it at all. I think it's really cool that he can be proud of his own interests and tbh both anime and games are super popular now, so it ain't a bad thing to enjoy them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 26 now, and he's 23, and he STILL hasn't forgiven me for the years I spent teasing him. His birthday was yesterday and I got him DMC and an anime poster - it's a popular anime I know he's always loved. He was super thankful but I knew something was off from the way he looked at it when he unwrapped it, but I let it go til after dinner. We were sat with dad in the garden for a while and when dad went back into the house, my brother let it all out on me. He said I made his years as a teenager miserable because I didn't give him the freedom to like whatever he wanted, and he used to cry himself to sleep because he knew he was a \"weirdo\" - he isn't lol. He's relatively popular in uni and definitely not an introverted shy guy so idk where that came from. Apparently he felt embarrassed to enjoy anime JUST because of what I was saying to him which is ridiculous. I told him he's always been free to like what he wants and he should never be ashamed of his hobbies. He wasn't having it lol, he called me hypocrite and said I'm an asshole who made him feel like shit for a long time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after having a go at me for like 30 mins, I was really fucking pissed off he still isn't over it. It's been like 10 years, and what I teased him about was never that bad. I'm really pissed off he isn't letting it go and is essentially throwing away our relationship as brothers just because I made fun of him as a CHILD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for what I did?? Or am I the asshole for being angry now?",

      "description": "I was at a friend’s mother’s wake service not too long ago. After the wake, a group of us were talking to our mourning friend who seemed to be taking it fairly well (or at least better than how I took it when my own mother passed away not long before this incident).\n\nThis friend was talking about his work for a bit and mentioned that he had just received an email from his boss that morning with condolences as well as a bit of uplifting news; his request for a promotion got approved.\n\nEveryone else congratulated him but I sort of gave a smirk and didn’t say anything. I have a reputation with this group of friends for being a snarky cunt sometimes, which they seem to enjoy, so the mourning friend asked what’s up with the smirk, and I said it’s inappropriate to say out loud. The rest of the gang insisted I say what I was holding in, and so I said simply “sympathy promotion”. Which got a lot of “oh duuuuude. Too soon.” from everyone.\n\nI’m aware that with any other crowd, this was super inappropriate to say, but having already given a disclaimer of sorts and still being asked to say it, am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for escalating the situation first by calling my landlord on my neighbours?",
      "description": "For backstory this issue has been going on for over a year when my neighbours first moved in. They are both in their 30's and had a toddler when they moved in, then had a baby around 6 months ago. Our complex is small, theres only 4 apartments, which are also small. The complex is on a main street above stores and bars, in a student area. These neighbours are attached to the bedroom we use as a spare upstairs, and the kitchen downstairs. The walls are thin in those rooms and we can hear everything, so we tend to avoid making much noise in those rooms. We have lived in this complex for over 5 years now, and never had a complaint. We have seen neighbours come and go, and have become good friends with all of them, except for these neighbours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance (27M) and I (25F) are homebodies, and are antisocial, we play music/games at decent times and volumes, make just general living noises (my fiance does walk around like a troll), but the most noise we make is our little dog. Our dog barks but never excessivley or late. Sometimes she'll bark when someone knocks on our door or rings the bell, if she's laying by the window and someone surprises her and goes out the back entrance (which is directly attached to our window, and is booming loud when the door shuts), occasionally if she's paying attention and hears a dog bark, and sometimes when a phone rings if it catches her off guard. However her barking is progressivly less and less as our training continues, and has significantly improved since the neighbours have moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first complaint, the new neighbours came knocking on our door around a month into living there, and kind of rudley asked to turn music down in early evening, we did so-issue solved.\n\nRepeat issue a few times, each slightly more hostile then the last. \n\n6 months in neighbour comes to our door in middle of day (when normal living noises being made) with her newborn in her arms (was so cute!) and very rudley tells us she needs quiet-we understand new baby, say our congrats-solved.\n\na couple weeks or so later our neighbour starts agressivley knocking on door about dog barking (dog had literally let out three little beagel barks) a passive agressive agruement ensued on both sides, we both apologized and let it go-solved.\n\nRinse and repeat issue every week for months each time escalating more, over dog, music, and living noises. \n\nA few months ago came home to note on my  door cussing me out and the noise I make-decided to no longer respond to her-couple days go by she apologizes-solved.\n\nDuring all this any noise we make in kitchen or spare room is met with them banging on walls and cussing us out, que baby crying and them fighting. \n\nThis has become a constant, in a year of these issues they never complained to our landlord or filed a noise complaint. So we have always taken that to mean they realized they over reacted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night my BF was putting his clothes away in the spare room which has one of those fold out doors that are noisey. The door popped out of the track (because all things in our apartment are wonky) and he had to pop them in, all making noise briefly, and at 8pm. Immediatly a pounding started on our wall-things thrown at it and our neighbour yelling at us and cussing us out, then baby starts crying, and can hear fighting ensue. Again this is normal now, expecting we will avod eachother a bit in the halls, and then get an apology, and repeat. However this afternoon I came home after walking my dog to the neighbour at the front entrance. Made the mistake of nodding at her and smiling, and she went off on me. She threatened me a few times, told me I had sworn at her toddler last night (?), that all the neighbours don't like us, and when her fiancee came down the entrance stairs he had to hold her back. I said she was crazy, and kind of stood their in shock, slowly walking around her and going up the stairs-my dog was terrified and hiding behind me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided I was done, I called my landlord then the police at his recomendation. But I had to go to work and was a bit confused about what I should have the officer do. I was trying to do the report over the phone but I couldn't give the constable enough of their info so she needed to come in person. I told her I had to go to work, and she told me to call when I'm done. My landlord then sent out an email to our neighbours with us CC'd to it, stating the policy on threatening behaviour and etc. I knew they would react badly to it, but I wanted to cover our own backs here. While at work (I only worked 5 hours today, and my fiancee gets home right after I leave to work) my fiancee was texting me with constant videos he took of our neighbours banging on our walls without cause, then even coming to our door. The woman yelled at him the entire time seemingly picking up right where she left off with me, while her shirtless fiancee and his shirtless friend literally flexed their arms and slowly walked towards my fiancee. It was all very strange and aggressive. When I got home we decided enough was enough time to call the police and do an actual report, I literally grabbed my phone when we got a knock on the door, and it was the police. They said they had been called for a noise complaint. They took all our information, and we told them everything from our side. The officers told us they informed the neighbours not to bother us anymore and said we should steer clear of them and not answer if they come to the door. They were very nice and understanding and clearly there was no noise when they came. They informed us the neighbours said they were moving in a month so they shouldn't recieve any complaints after that (but we all new that was very unlikley and that they will be getting another call soon). I know this is going to continue to escalate now that I told my landlord, and I'm not sure how to handle it from here.",

      "description": "I'm a huge sushi fan, so whenever I hear about a new japanese restaurant in my town, I always make sure to check it out. Recently, a new one opened up in a kind of sketchy part of town, but the reviews were amazing, so i decided to go check it out with my dad. We walk in and the place is packed, so we had to sit at the sushi bar. Everything was going great, the food was amazing, and the sushi chef was very friendly. We were just about to order another roll or two, when a woman walked into the restaurant and sat down next to my dad at the bar. I wasn't really paying attention to her, until I heard her start to cough.\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst cough I have ever heard. It legitimately sounded like she had TB. I looked over, wondering why someone this sick would be at a restaurant, to see one of the dirtiest looking people I have ever seen. She was Caucasian, but she was so caked in dirt that her skin was a very dark brown. We ignored her at first, because she wasn't hurting anyone, but then she just kept coughing, and I seriously felt like I was going to throw up with how it sounded.\n\nFor the probably 5 minutes she was inside, not a single waiter or waitress said anything, other than bringing her a glass of water. Me and dad stood up, and said that if they didn't remove her from the restaurant, we would be leaving immediately. They apologized, and escorted her out, and when she walked by me the smell hit me. She smelled like a mix of body odor and rotting food, and i completely lost my appetite. The sushi chef apologized profusely and gave us a free roll, but we didn't even touch it, asked for the check, and left.\n\nAre we the assholes here?",

      "description": "Okay so the restaurant I work at is pretty high end. Food is expensive, wait staff makes more than at a normal restaurant in terms of base salary. A few times a week celebs or obviously rich people will come in (it’s located in a pretty popular LA location so we expect it). Most of those people follow the no tip rule. But once in a while I’ll have someone give me a tip anyway. \n\nThe restaurant owners sort of turned a blind eye to it. I guess it was like a don’t ask, don’t tell policy. But lately some of the new waitresses have been complaining about it. Anyway, these men came in (one was an NBA player and the others were his friends, I guess. I’m not gonna say the name because it’s not relevant and might be against the rules). \n\nAnyway, his bill was like $8,000 (they ordered bottles, which is why it got so high). He ended up leaving $10K, leaving me a $2K tip. Now I am by no means rich. I live in a studio apartment and work my ass off for my money. So this was a really big deal for me. \n\nAnyway, one of the other waitresses found out and reported it to the one of the restaurant owners. So we ended up having this big group meeting with the wait staff, managers, and the owners about the no tipping policy. The owners announced they’re going to be stricter about the policy from now on and we are not to accept tips under any circumstances. \n\nFor customers who insist we’re now supposed to tell them that all tips will have to be turned over to some kind of common fund or something. \n\nSo the girl who reported me pipes up and asks about the tip I just got. The owners said it’s up to me whether I want to keep it but that it’s not going to be allowed in the future. \n\nSo that leaves me in a position to keep my tip or share it with the other waiters, which would leave me with like $150...\n\nTbh I’m really not inclined to split the money. Again, I’m not rich. Also holidays are coming up which are gonna leave me even broker. But I don’t want to be a terrible person either, you know? AITA for keeping it?",

      "description": "My girlfriend is half Kenyan and half Italian and was born in Kenya. She lived there until she was 11 years old  then she moved to the UK (after her dad died). Every summer she goes to Kenya with her mom to visit family for a month. We’ve been together for 3 years and she wants me to come to Ethiopia with her for at least a week or 2. There are many reasons why I don’t want to.\n\n1. A flight to Kenya is expensive,\n2. I honestly worry about my safety. Africa isn’t really known for being super safe, especially for a white guy – I mean there was literally a terrorist attack there like a month ago\n3. I’ll have to use up my vacation time for this trip… No offence but Kenya isn’t my idea of a vacation – it’s not like we’re going to be staying in a fancy resort.\n\nSo I told my girlfriend some of this (mostly the complaints about cost) and she said that her family will cover half the cost of the flight and we’ll be staying with family for most of it so it won’t be super expensive. When I said I was worried about safety she said I was being ridiculous and that Kenya is a safe country- Obviously ***she*** thinks so since she was born there and no one wants to talk negatively about where they are from, but I’m not used to it. \n\nWhen I told her I didn’t want to spend my vacation time on the trip. She blew up at me and said thinks I’m an asshole and I'm making every excuse not to go and that I should **want** to get to know the place she was born and she has been ignoring me since Friday. I think she’s being a bit dramatic and is trying to force me to spend my own money on something I’m not eager about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here? ",

      "description": "So this is what happened: About 1.5 months ago some dude from HS (4 year ago but I have stumbled upon him a few times on town) asked me money ( I don't want to say the exact amount) to help him pay his GF's medical bills after a work related injury. I said sure why not, just make sure to pay on time. He agreed to pay me back after getting his salary ( day 20 of every month) and we went our way. \n\nTime went on and he did not even bother to contact me so I decided to him ask him politely if he had already been paid and if he could pay me back. He replied \"hey bro, just wait a little more\".  I really hated that kind of reply so I asked for a date for when he can pay me back. No answer, one day later I message him again asking the same thing, again, no answer. This really pissed me of as it was clear he did not want to give an answer (and probably pay me back) , so I send him a text saying something along the lines of \" First of, I am not your Bro, and frankly i don't give a damn you Gf, it's none of my business, but I still helped pay her medical bills, so the least you could do Is have some respect and tell me when do you plan to pay me\"\n\nAm I the asshole for typing the last part?",

It manifests most often as playing with my hair. I shower and wash my hair daily, I don't have lice or dandruff, I don't pull it out, I just play with my hair. I usually grab a lock and go to town twirling as it soothes me. I'm really subtle about it- minimal hand movements, no combing, etc. I do it at work as well, where my job is mostly one handed, I've never seen a customer, and I don't handle any food.\n\n\nA supervisor from a different department calls me from my desk to the front of the room to talk to me. This supervisor isn't above mine in any way- he just manages a different department. My supervisor didn't say a word to me. The guy tells me that I play with my hair too much and it's really negatively impacting other people's work as they're busy staring at me playing with my hair, although he stated that my own performance is not affected.\n\n\nI just have a lot of questions. I tried googling fidgeting at work but all I get is fidget toys and research or articles about the behavior. It's a hard habit to break as I've had it for years. Am I in the wrong for it?",

I didn't say that, my character did.\" Yeah sure, okay...\n-Responds rudely to questions or gives very short, frank answers like \"Yeah, sure, whatever\" when asked if he wants to join us with a group action.\n\nMy conflict here is that he's *in the discord* and kicking him would require us to find a new player. My GM is also my boyfriend, which complicates things a little, but it's genuinely disheartening to see him having to pretend to be this guy all the time.

Obviously, my boyfriend will not necessarily listen to me because I'm his girlfriend (it would seem biased, right?) so I have tried hinting at him but I would want him to decide to kick this guy on his own accord. Plus, he might have a different tolerance level than myself. I've talked about it just kinda quietly \"Yeah... he's probably gonna say that he can't make this session.\"\n\nWhat do you all think?

Because of the way it was positioned in the corner of the room, one half was on one wall and one half was on the other. This caused a shadow to appear on only one half of the poster on the day this happened. So i was big into star wars at the time, and because of the shadow i said \"Everyone on this side is on the dark side (points to the shadowed side) and everyone on this side is on the light side, it's star wars!\" \n\nImmediately a bunch of my classmates came up to me, pointing out that there was one black kid on the 'dark side'. It wasn't like he was the only one on the dark side. There were 14 white kids on the dark side too. Word got around the classroom real fast that i was a racist, and eventually the teacher caught wind of it. She confronted me about it and i got really stressed because if everyone in my class thought and said i was racist, my parents would probably be called or something. I'd get into big trouble. I did my best to explain myself, stating how i meant 'dark side' in reference to the shadow. I didn't end up getting into trouble.\n\nSo, was i being racist? AITA?",

Oh and my parents just invested most of their savings to buy a new house and they'd been tellin my that they have financial issues since then. \n\nSo this is where my problem begins, I have never needed extra coaching or tuitions but my dad enrolled me for one and I have to go there. This basically makes its so that 5 days a week I leave my home at 7:30 am and come back after 9 pm with only around 2 hours of breaks (including the time it takes to commute). I did attend the first few lectures sincerely and tried to pay attention to what was being taught, but I literally cannot. And the fact that about 80% our syllabus is something I learned 5 years ago makes it even worse. I talked to my parents about this but they said that this year is the base and I need put in my best efforts...\n\nLast week one of my friends decided to not attend one lecture and asked me if I wanted to bunk with him and his friends and I went with them. I've not attended any lectures since then. Btw I have had a near 100% attendance record for the last few years. My parents pay over 2 Lakh rupees (like $3-4k) just for the fees. I feel really bad that I'm wasting their money but I don't think I can sit through the tuitions. \n\nI feel extremely bad about lying to my parents and basically wasting their hard earned money, but I really don't think I can keep this up for long, especially since they're being extra nice to me because they think that I'm forcing myself to attend. \n\nI'm sure I'm gonna get some comments telling me to just attend those lectures and not pay attention. The problem is that \n1. I could very well do that but that'd still make me feel awful and I don't think I can do that\n2. I am probably being dumb but sitting through the lectures, and especially C programming (I've been studying it for at least the past 4 years) literally gives me a panic attack. I'm writing this at 1 am in the morning so it'll take some time  for me to reply. \n\nTL:DR: Don't wanna attend coaching classes for my 1st year Comp Engg program, but parents already payed for it. I haven't gone for over a week.Not attending makes me feel bad, but sitting through one makes me feel extremely sad. AITA? Even if I am being a dick, could someone please help me out here?",

      "description": "\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year and living together for about two months. Honestly, I love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. I feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. \n\nWe can’t go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. When we’re out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we’re doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. At dinner, I always have to wait after we pay so she can go. At night, she’ll get up while I’m sleeping etc etc. I know she can’t help it, and she’s only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it’s seriously gotten on my nerves a ton. \n\nI always have to pause a movie we’re watching or something she’ll even pause foreplay so she can go. I don’t know if she actually has to use the bathroom or is just doing it to annoy me at this point. \n\nAm I actually the asshole for being annoyed by always being inconvenienced like this? I don’t want to mention it to her that it’s annoying me if I am the asshole here. ",

      "description": "AITA for disliking my mother? I've always had issues with my own mother but recently I had enough and said things that maybe could've been left unspoken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologize in advance as english isn't my first language and that this post might take a while to read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was playing games and talking with friends over discord in my room, when suddenly I heard a loud banging on my door. When I openend the door I saw my mother fuming and throwing stuff from the bathroom, that is located across my room, on the floor. (She does that quite often, throwing stuff around that is) And when I asked her what her problem was, she said, that she was having a talk with my younger brother (who was caught smoking weed, which she understandibly dislikes) and I was being too loud and the laughter irritated her. I asked her why she didn't ask like a normal person for me to be quiet first and her reply was:\"because you always say you're busy but all you do is play games!\" I replied angrily and said that saturday nights are the only time I actually have time to play games besides going to uni and working part-time. After I cleaned up the stuff on the floor, while getting berated I told her I'm done and slammed my door. She said she wasn't done and will cut the internet, to which I responded with:\"Good, I don't care! I'm done playing anyways!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater when my father returned home he asked me to go downstairs to the living room and talk it out. I agreed under the condition that it will be a dialogue and not a monologue. But it turned out to be a monologue by my mother anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere she kept going on that playing games only makes me a worse person, how it will affect my relationship with my GF, my grades at Uni and my work. It will also make me a more agressive person somehow. How I prioritize my friends over family and in general have a lack of respect for her authority. Why I can't have a better hobby.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her what rational person would throw shit around in a fit of rage. - No answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her how come my younger brother can stay out for days and be praised for joining a basketball club, while I get scolded when I started a gaming club/association (fighting games) with a friend. - \"Atleast he is doing something to be active.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked why she always thinks what I'm thinking and doesn't let me talk - \"Because I know you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFed up with her non-answers I said:\"If you can't respect me as who I am how can you expect me to respect you? I'm going to be frank, I dislike everything you say and I don't even know why, I should as you said respect and love you but I can't bring myself to do it and I don't know why but this is the truth, you are irrational, don't want to make compromises, never apologizes and can't understand what makes me happy!\" and walked away from the living room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis incident happened 2 months ago and I still think about it and find myself at the crossroad:\n\nOn one hand I know she just wants for me to healthy and only wishes the best for me but on the other hand I don't understand why she can't just see who I am and what I truly like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will greatly appreciate all answers.",

Sounds simple enough except they're an hour drive away, my shift ends at 8, and the current time is around 5-6. \n\nI tell them maybe and ask what we'd be doing as it is a commitment for me to get there, especially so short notice. After talking back and forth I learned that they don't have any booze (all parties involved at the time are under the age of 21) and told them I probably wouldn't be coming since we might as well chat on Discord as we usually do. \n\nI got some \"wow, really\"s and was ridiculed for my decision. In the end I was able to get ahold of some Titos and ended up going.

It was a difficult process as they didn't prepare or plan much and most of the details (such as hosting them and their three kids for a couple weeks) weren't worked out until they showed up on my doorstep. So, I struggled through the couple weeks in our tiny house pushed beyond comfort and the in-laws finally got enough cash together to get there own place. My wife watches their three kids Monday through Saturday so the house is always full except on my day off. But now my in-laws informed me that they are moving their friend who was homeless to come live with them (30M). I thought sure why not. Doesn't affect me at all... Well I was wrong. I guess years of drug use and the last year or so of being homeless had left him mentally challenged (their words not mine.) And he would need someone to watch him. So now they expect my wife to watch him along with their kids until he can \"get on his feet\" and support himself. But my in-laws work with me and we work pretty much all day six days a week and I don't think they will hurry along to prepare him to be on his own. AITA for not wanting my wife to babysit her sister's mentally challenged friend.\n\nTL:DR: in-laws want a baby sitter for 30year old seemingly man child. And expect my wife to fulfill the duty.",

At first I had no issues letting them park in my parking spot because I had no car. I’m not an asshole so I let them park their car there for years free of charge. \n\nA few months ago I had the wife approach me and ask me if she could take half of my front garden to build herself a porch, I said no. I live in the UK so we don’t have porch where you can just park your car, it’s all street parking. \n\nAfter I turned down her request she has stopped greeting me whenever she says me, fine I don’t care. I’d like to note at this point her family members were still using my parking spot. \n\nToday she approaches me and informs me that she will start building her driveway taking up half of my property. I’d like to note that I don’t own the house, I just rent it. The council owns the house. She tells me that the council has given her permission to take up half of my front garden to build her driveway, lol ok. I again informed her that I don’t consent and that she cannot go ahead with her building plan. \n\nThis kind of entitlement has enraged me so I called up my brother who had a car and told him to come and park in my parking spot, he did. As soon as my brother parked his car, my neighbor the husband came out yelling at my brother telling him to move his car that was when I told him that he and his family members could no longer park on my spot. \n\nThe whole driveway issues confuses me and I will be calling the council later today to try and stop this crazy woman taking half of my garden!",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have three kids. We both have a kid from previous relationships that are the same age, and one together. \n\nWe recently noticed behavior problems from our two 6 year olds, which is probably due to the baby taking up a lot of our time. They both started getting serious attitude problems, and being overall disrespectful, ungrateful, and lazy. My boyfriend and I talked about changing the rules of the house and how they would both have to follow the rules or they could go to their rooms. \n\nNow my boyfriend and I have different schedules, and most of the time I am caring for the baby, so I don't see a lot of the parenting that goes on between him and his son. Either way I was enforcing the rules with both of them when I was the one who was there and witnessing all of it. \n\nNow with that being said my daughter did an almost 180 degree change. She is respectful, does what she is told without argument, takes initiative when she gets home to feed her pet, clean, and do her homework around 90% of the time, which is very good considering. \n\nNow his son on the other hand has completely changed but it seems for the worst. If I could break down the way he acts I could sum it up by saying he reminds me of a two year old. You know a terrible two. \n\nFor example if he is hungry he doesn't ask for food he just yells \"daddy HUNGRY\" or \"daddy thirsty\". His dad has to literally DRAG him to the bathroom to have a bath. He refuses to learn how to read (by grade one here they need to know how to read), and based on his report card he is going to fail grade one. Basically his sons day consists of being on his phone all day long playing Roblox or watching YouTube.\n\nNow with that being said,  down to how I treat his son. Last night my boyfriend said I am a jerk to his son. When I asked how he basically started saying that I get him in trouble for everything, but those everything's he was saying were the rules that WE put in place. I tried explaining to him that I treat them equally, the problem is that his son wasn't responding or doing what he is told. I know that his dad lets him get away with breaking the rules because I have witnessed it myself, and I call him out on it, but apparently I am an asshole for that. \n\nI feel like I'm not the asshole here because I feel like he is undermining me to his son, I mean of course I would come off as the mean parent because I'm the one enforcing the rules we set out. \n\nSo AITA?

      "description": "Backstory:\n\nI am a 20 yo male who works 40+hours a week in a kitchen as a head cook. It’s tiresome and I feel like a work horse every day. But I love it so I do it, even tho my hourly rate sucks. I also have bipolar disorder and when I’m depressed my sex drive is really low bc I think very lowly of myself. My gf (20) knows this and doesn’t expect sex out of me during these times. But has also stated that she gets sad when we don’t have sex at least once every two days. I also work mornings only and am used to going to bed around 11\n\nAfter a 7am-4pm shift with no breaks, I hung out with some friends until my gf got out of work at 11pm. I head over to her place after grabbing the only meal I had yesterday, McDonald’s.\n\nThe tifu or not:\nWe started snuggling and kissing and I got turned on and decided to ask if she wanted to pip pip the diddly doo (not verbatim) and she asked me if it was a pity fuck bc she’s sad. I said no, that I genuinely want to fuck her. She then said that she knows that if we fuck now we won’t fuck tomorrow or the next day or on my bday which we’ve been planning. I said that it was okay and that I’d be down to fuck her anytime, rn, tomorrow morning, midday, and pm. But she said that I’m tired, this was around midnight, and we were already lying in bed. \n\nWe continued to kiss but I was getting a little turned off by the tuna taste from earlier and suggested that we should both go brush our teeth before bed. She refused. We keep on talking about harmless random things. \n\nAround 12:45, she pulls me out of a really long blink and starts kissing me. My dick gets hard, I was a little turned on but way too tired to fuck. But the fact that my body simulated morning wood got her really horny and I could tell. I say preemptively “I’m really sorry baby I’m a bit too tired to have sex tonight” and that’s when shit hit the fan. She started saying that it was bullshit, that I was clearly turned on and that she wouldn’t get this opportunity for a while so she wants to jump on it. I said that would have been awesome forty minutes ago, not when I’m half asleep. I got upset that she had that position. And she thinks I’m the asshole for being upset about it. \n\nShe pushed me off the couch, in a playful way, but she stayed in the living room for ten minutes before storming into her room to grab a cig, which she knows that I’m not a huge fan of but I never get upset at her for doing innocuous things bc it’s her own life not mine. She continued to fight until 2:30am and brought it up this morning before her boxing class. \n\nI’m at a loss. I’m kinda having a hard time figuring out how I should feel regarding this and kinda need help. How can I facilitate the resolution of this?",

I have been engaged for 3 years and talking abut my bridesmaids the entire time. Right after I got engaged, I immediately asked all 6 of them to be my bridesmaids and we have gone bridesmaids dress shopping many times, even though we haven't actually bought any yet. I am still really really close with 4 of them, but every single time we would plan something to hang out the other 2 (sisters) would bail out, save for birthdays. Sometimes for legitimate reasons, other times for bullshit. One of them even missed my first baby shower (which I had planned MONTHS ahead of time) because she never asked off work. Meanwhile, I have done this many many times for her. They used to host get-togethers and holiday parties all the time, but now they never do, or at least they never invite us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't think that they should be my bridesmaids if they won't put in the effort to keep up our friendship.

      "description": "Throwaway, etc, etc. I understand that this question already sounds bad, but I'd like to explain a little and see if I am out of line or if my feelings make sense. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are four dogs at my house. One is mine and my fiancee's, one is my sister's and her BF, and two are the family pets (my parent's dogs, although I pay the medical expenses). They are 1, 3, 8, and 10, respectively. They all got along fine for the longest time, but in the past 6 months or so there have been issues with my sister's dog (lab/pit mix) and the 8 y/o (white german shepard) have been getting into it when they are in the same space. We've been keeping them in separate parts of the house and let them out at different times, but it's not an ideal situation. If a door is left open or a baby gate goes down, they go at it, biting and latching on and won't let go unless we get between them and break it up. One time the 8 y/o got a bite on the leg bad enough that we took her to the vet, and while we were there we found out she had 10-15 mammary tumors. The vet said unless it's proven otherwise, it is most likely cancer. Looking back, there have been other signs like significant weight loss and appetite changes that also point to cancer. We think they may be fighting because the 3 y/o can smell that she is sick and is vying for the alpha spot, or the 8 y/o is uncomfortable and senses aggression from the younger one and wants to defend herself but, I digress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn recent weeks, the 8 y/o has been becoming harder and harder to deal with. She has been rougher with the other two dogs (pushing them around, mouthing their necks), and has been a lot more anxious and vocal. She is constantly whining if someone is not near her and barks at everyone, even if they just changed their shirt and came back. She doesn't listen to commands most of the time, and her attitude is getting to the point where I really just don't want to deal with her anymore. I feel bad because she was a good dog until recently, and I'm not sure what is the exact cause of the change. If it's because she is sick and she is in pain or extremely uncomfortable, she isn't physically acting like she is at that point. She still runs and plays and is not lethargic like one would expect from a girl in her late stages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I don't want her to be put down, but I don't want to have to deal with her and the stress she is putting on the other dogs anymore. Unfortunately with my family and with her health and age, those are kind of the only options. So I ask, AITA for feeling this way?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My 8 y/o white german shepard has cancer, and is causing issues with the other dogs at the house, fighting with one of them. AITA for not wanting to deal with her anymore?",

We stayed friends afterwards and eventually became FWB until ex moved out of state. We remained friends but contact slowly stopped because both of us suck at keeping in touch with people. We send the ocassional \"hi, how are you message\" and do see each other (usually get drinks, hookup, etc) when in the others state but that is the extent of the friendship. Both of our families live in our hometown (where they currently live too). I live elsewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe current situation. A concert is coming up in our hometown. It is someone I have always wanted to see and someone they have seen a bunch of times. My ex is also the person that got me in this genre of music. I don't have anyone else to invite and was considering inviting them. However, I would prefer my family not to know that I plan to ask the ex to go. I don't need approval or anything but I just don't want to answer a million questions. I really value my privacy. I also do not have any form of social media besides Snapchat. My ex does and she is still friends with my family. So I kinda want to ask her not to post anything that may lead back to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sounds kinda shitty so I'm checking in with Reddit before I do anything stupid.",

      "description": "AITA? Well, long story short a very good friend of mine didnt have such great luck out in LA and ended up homeless.  I had always offered my home where I live with my parents to him if he ever needed it , a room, a hot meal and time to get on his feet with no strings attached. BUT he ended up bringing his first serious girlfriend whom he was homeless with. Which I was fine with at first,  however things turned sour rather quickly . They fight ALL the time , not the occasional couple argument no. I mean like she full on cries hysterically like a grown baby , and they both say the MOST horrendous things to each other that you should never say to someone you love .  They hit each other and throw things all over the room . Its been over a year of this and the fights are horrible.  I love my friend and hes said how he just absolutely \"feels\" that she is the one and that he just can't put his finger on it but he just wholeheartedly believes their relationship will work out in the end when everyone else doesnt . He threatens to kick her out all the time but never goes through with it. he calls her a whore , a psycho. And she calls him a loser and a piece of shit and well ...just all manner of crap . They both have jobs but they refuse to save up any money To get up off their feet they spend it on wish or amazon and cigarettes but never put anything away. Usually peoples expenses would be absolutely NONE of my business but its been a year and they shouldve been way better off by now but they arent . Its frustrating my parents and they give ME a lot of shit about it . And its driven a noticeable wedge in our friendship every time I try and sit and talk to him about the situation.  Point is I did this for HIM not her,  but our good intentions have been lost on him and reasoning just wont do . So AITA and my parents for wanting to kick his girlfriend out? ",

I was a bit skeptical about being friends  with one of the girls because she was from Israel and  because I am a bit sensitive when it comes to Palestine and stuff but said I'll just hang out with the group and I'll give her a chance since she's the first person from Israel that I've met\n\nThe group &amp; I hung out for months and the Israeli girl (let's call her Maya) was funny, outgoing and a person that you'd love hanging out and she's really pretty. Way out of my league. \n\nBefore Valentine's she asked me if I'd like to be her Valentine but just as a joke,  because why not and she'd like to know more about me and just have a 1on1 conversation with me. I said sure and to be honest hanging out with her alone was more fun than being with the group because we did a lot of things since it only needed both of us agreeing to do this thing rather than 6. \n\nShe told me she'd like to do it again and we just hugged and went home. \n\nWe hung out a few times when she asked me if I was down to go on an actual date with her I told her I need to think about it and I'll let you know. \n\nNow the thing is when I date someone I'd like to make sure that there is a possibility of marriage. Like if we loved each other and everything went well nothing will stop us. Which is why I rejected her because everytime I tell somebody that I am hanging out with someone from Israel they'll look shocked and just say that they're really sad about me doing that and just 'selling' my country. \n\nHer parents hate me &amp; my parents hate her just for the fact that we're from 'enemy' nations \n\nI told her that I can't because I don't think things will work because of our society and no one would accept the fact that A Palestinian man is married/dating an Israeli girl. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n\n\nTL;DR : Rejected a girl I went out with on a few \"fake\" dates because we're from nations that hate each other. \n\n",

A month later, he proceeds to slide into her DMs on instagram (she doesn't follow him, they have had no online or other contact) asking her to do acting work for a marketing campaign.\n\nAll I can think is \"This **** didn't think I should be the one asking her if she'd want to do the work after she hears he may sexually assault ppl? 1) More likely she'd say yes if it wasn't out of the blue 2) Now she's gonna be too afraid to talk to me because of the company I keep randomly messaging her.\" I get that he didn't deserve what happened to him but can he at least try and not screw up my friendships/have some tact? Maybe I'm the asshole. Merry Xmas from Chicago, regardless. ",

      "description": " \n\nBurner for reasons\n\nThe  title pretty much speaks for itself. I was married for about a year  when i realized that my marriage wouldn't work out long term we just had  different outlooks on life. She wanted kids. and well I did not. She  expected me to get proper schooling and i never wanted that. There were  more things that were expected of each of us that the other never  wanted. and sadly to say we had a lot that we enjoyed doing in the  moment in life in general. it was just the future we could never agree  on.\n\nAt a year in we had a fight about  kids (and I am the type of person that likes to think and plan  everything i can out so I am not hurt or surprised by outcomes). after  this fight i sat down on the couch and thought about what i was going to  do if she left me and i realized i couldn't do anything the job i was  in was promising but i just wasn't in a position where i could afford to  live on my own. So i decided that I would try my best to make our  marriage work but never lie to her. i always showed my disinterest in  kids never said i would do or have any interest in any of the things she  expected of me. Along the way i also stopped expecting things of her  knowing it would not work out.\n\nThen it  finally came I was promoted given a good salary. Boom finally i could  afford to move on with my life. soon i filed for divorce and here I am  finished with the divorce and after having a discussion with a friend  telling him this then being called an asshole. So i extend the question  to you Am I the Asshole?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I break up with my boyfriend for not letting my 14 year old son have a birthday party at his house?",
      "description": "Background: I have been in a relationship with a man for 3 1/2 years. We've broken up briefly a couple of times. The first time he mentioned that part of his issue is that I have a son, not so much that he doesn't like him, just that he's there. He's not mean to him or anything. He has a grown son who lives in another state who he adores and he sees his greatest role in life as being a father to his son. The boyfriend came into my son's life when he was 10 years old, he's turning 14 tomorrow. My boyfriend makes a lot more money than I do and he has a big nice 5 bedroom house that he lives in alone, although he usually sleeps at my house. I, being poor, have a house that has a lot of damage from when I had a leaking roof and we had unprecedented rainfall a couple of years back. The plaster on the ceiling has fallen down and the plaster walls are crumbling. It's really in rough shape. My homeowners insurance wouldn't cover it and I have not yet had the money to repair it. I've tried to do some repairs myself but I have no idea what I'm doing so I've just given up until I can hire someone to do the work. My son is embarrassed by our current living conditions and he doesn't want to have friends over.\n\nWhen I first started seeing this man he wanted us to stay at his house more. My son would get bored there because he didn't have TV service and the internet reception was crappy, so my boyfriend bought an xbox and said it had to stay at his house. He would let him have friends stay over and things were good for awhile, until one day he just didn't want him there anymore and brought the xbox to my house, which was fine. He would still let him have friends stay over from time to time. So my son's birthday is tomorrow and I asked my boyfriend if he could have a couple of friends over. He said he wanted to think about it. I asked him again yesterday and he said, \"why does he have to have a birthday party? I never got to have a birthday party. I would just go out for pizza with my family.\" So basically he said no.\n\nSo the problem that I have is not so much that he can't have his friends over, it's the feeling of rejection that I'm feeling for my son. My boyfriend tries to be all spiritual and says stuff like, \"I've been blessed, the things I have aren't mine. I need to share them with other people.\" He has said that specifically about his house.\n\nAnd I'm not saying he's a bad guy. He's nice and he has helped me financially from time to time with a few hundred dollars when I've been broke broke or really needed something. The thing is though, that he takes no interest in my son or in wanting to spend time with him. He buys him food sometimes when he comes over and he's always polite and never mean.\n\nTL:DR: Boyfriend used to let my son stay at his house with friends sometimes but won't let him for his birthday. My house has a lot of damage that needs to be repaired and we can't have people over.Bigger issue is that he takes no interest in my son. I'm thinking about breaking up with him over this.",

She told me i could not carry my bag on the plane. Still nervous, i tried to ask if there was a big possibility of my bags not making it to the connecting flight. Before i could finish my question she just kept repeating that i can’t take this bag on the flight. This wasn’t even my goal. I have medication BURIED under my stuff. I was curious if there was a big chance of my bag not making it. And if I should go thru the trouble (and believe me it would be a hassle) to collect my things.\n\nI’m already exhausted so I snapped and said “if you weren’t interrupting me i could tell you that is not what I am asking” to which she rolled her eyes and began to shuffle some papers, then she snapped back if it was an issue i should try and find another flight. \n\nI work retail and try to treat others how I would like to be treated.

      "description": "There's this really attractive female bartender that works at the main bar next to my university. I (male) have been talking/flirting with her for the past few months every weekend that I go out. Typically, I'll be completely belligerent though and I usually struggle to remember our conversations the next day. Also, the bar gets packed and it's difficult to talk to her in the first place. \n\nI never really thought about making a move for a few reasons.\n1. She's seen me hit on other girls consistently for the past few months.\n2. She's older than me, working at a bar, and I assumed she didn't want anything to do with a guy still in college.\n3. I didn't want to make things weird at the bar I frequent so often (shitting where you eat kinda thing)\n\nHowever, recently she followed me on Instagram at like 4am without even knowing my username meaning she looked up my name (that she knew from my credit card). Also, the other bartenders told me and my friends that she was talking about me to them.\n\nSo I got hopeful and decided to message her on Instagram. She left me on seen then replied days later. I waited a few days and replied just to be left on seen again. I didn't really think anything of it, but then the next time I went to the bar, we barely talked and then she stopped serving me drinks because I was \"too drunk\" apparently. She went so far as to tell all the other bartenders not to serve me. I think this is because I didn't tip her since I was upset that she wasn't messaging me back. \n\nI was pissed off at this point and it probably showed. I was told later that I left the bar when it closed flipping off all the employees saying \"I'm never coming back to this shitty bar ever again\"\n\nThen I unfollowed her on Instagram but she stayed following me.\n\nNext weekend, I saw her and tried getting a drink from her. She walked right by and took everyone elses drink orders except mine. Finally she got to me so I asked if she was going to cut me off again. She said she would if I kept giving her attitude. I was taken aback and just bluntly told her to get me my drink. She slid me my drink and the check without even looking at me and walked away without saying another word. Again, I didn't tip her. \n\nI messaged her later that night asking why she was acting like that - just for her to leave me on seen again. I was blacked out drunk at this point so I got mad and decided to just block her completely. Today I unblocked her though and there was an unread message from later that night saying I was the one acting out, not her.\n\nSo AITA for not tipping her? Or is she the asshole for following me on Instagram just to not reply to my messages then give me the cold shoulder when she saw me? Judging by her actions, it seems like she was only talking/flirting with me before because I tipped her well. Then as soon as I tried talking to her outside of work / not tipping her, she felt no reason to be nice so she started being an asshole towards me. Curious to see what y'all think! ",

      "description": "I’m head of design for my high school’s robotics team. We lost our corporate $5,000 sponsor this year so our instructor had to assure that we each pulled in enough money to keep the team afloat. Each student needed to get $300 in sponsors from local businesses before the end of Christmas break. (This was a 300 point assignment worth about 40% of our grade) The alternative to finding sponsors was working community service at the concession stand during basketball games after break. Anyone who signed up to work the games had to work 3 games to pull in the appropriate amount. \n\nI personally ended up in charge of organizing the shifts and we had a few to many people sign up, so I asked around to see if people were willing to find sponsors over the break instead of working the games. To my surprise those that I asked said they’d get it done over break. While most of them kept that promise, one of them didn’t pull in a cent and just today asked to sign back up for concession stand work. I told him they were still full and he proceeded to accuse me of not letting him in because I didn’t want him to pass the class. While I couldn’t care less about his grade, was it wrong of me to deny him the opportunity to earn his points back? ",

Decided I would aswell, gf was into it -bending over etc. Just before reaching climax I lean over her so its obvious I'm going to cum on her -though theres about 4 seconds or so where she could object. She doesn't and continues what she's doing as though she's into it, I cum on her ass. \n\nShortly after I'm cleaning her up she brings up consent. I feel like what I did was appropriate given the context. She acknowledges she had the opportunity to object but says she felt like she 'had to' let me finish. She acknowledges that what I did wasn't that bad but is still unhappy that I did it. Am I out of order for having done it? I feel like it wasn't unreasonable and that in a relationship consent is more likely to be implied.",

      "description": "I’m poor. I work weekends and go to school during the week. I have a really crappy car. A combination of anxiety and a history of car accidents makes driving the crappy car with all its quirks and sounds overwhelming for long distances, because the sounds are very indicative of things that are wrong with it (both made up things in my irrational head world and real things I know from a trusted mechanic that I can’t afford to fix yet). \n\nThe horn doesn’t work. The airbags don’t work. So that with all the other mechanical issues it has, the thing is a death trap. But my fear of driving it has become exponentially more irrational as time goes on. \n\nI don’t even drive it to work anymore, an 11 minute drive on the highway. I will still drive it to school, a 5 minute drive that I can take side roads for. Also trips to the store are bearable because it’s just a few blocks. \n\nOne thing wrong with the car is the inner passenger door handle is cracked in pieces that can still be held together to open the door. Not a big deal. But when people use it after a trip I already am pretty anxious about the car falling apart so it just gets under my skin. \n\nMy partner and I live together and he doesn’t drive. When we go places I’ve asked several times for him not to use the handle and just let me open the car door for him from the outside. I worry that it will break. He makes a rational case, but it doesn’t matter to me in those moments. I know that the handle will probably not break to the point of being unusable. \n\nBut i feel like since it’s my property and I pay all the car related bills and the least he could do is not use it in a way that adds to my anxiety. \nAITA for insisting? \nThey’re my problems and I generally don’t expect anyone to tiptoe around my irrational feelings but I feel like this is one thing I don’t like about the car that I can actually control. \n\n",

Each and every year she goes on a vacation to the Outer Banks with her sister and grandmother, no men are allowed. I’m not upset by it, I’m slightly annoyed at how misandrist her family is (very female heavy, actually mostly female), but honestly, I would not enjoy myself if I attended. \n\nIn fact, my wife only enjoys one type of vacation, the beach. She just wants to lay out and read. That’s cool, she likes what she likes, but that’s the only type of vacation we can ever agree on (and I use the word agree loosely). We go to the beach together when I want to go to the beach. I prefer the mountains, but whatever. \n\nAnyhow, I’ve wanted to go on a backpacking trip to Europe my entire life. I want to throw on my ruck sack and visit small towns,  interact with the locals, stay at hostels, or camp. \n\nI’ve talked to my wife about going to Europe. She only wants to go to Europe if it means we go to the beach. \n\nThe way I see it, the beach is the beach. Sure, some are nicer than others, but you can go lay out at Myrtle beach or Daytona beach and it be relatively the same experience as St. Tropez. \n\nShe won’t want to do anything I want to do. In the 7 years we’ve been a couple, I’ve always done what she wants to do. I’m finally at a point in my life where I can save up and get vacation time to do what I want.

      "description": "Nearly 5 years ago I moved to another country to see if things would work long term with the guy I’m dating. Since then I’ve moved four times to different areas of the country for his job. This means I hardly ever make long term friends and have had to make sacrifices with my career. \n\nAbout two months ago we decided to move together to an area we both wanted to live for a minimum of six months. However, if our relationship improved we would stay longer. This was partly because his job was already close by (he was commuting 1+ hour one way), my recent job contract had expired, we had a friend who needed to rent their property out and we agreed to give our relationship one last chance. \n\nMy bf has now received another job offer on the other side of the country where he’s from originally and is seriously considering taking it. Mostly he wants to take it because of what they’re offering to pay him but also because his family is there. He believes he would have to move in the next month or so and wants to leave me to finish the lease at our current property (though he would still help pay rent). We would have to pay for his flights back to come and visit me. He has agreed that living apart is bad for our relationship (we spent all of 2017 living apart and me commuting on weekends to see him) and that living where we are now is helping improve our relationship. \n\nI’ve told him that if he moves in the next month for this job then not only will I not follow him but that will be the end of our relationship. My opinion is that we agreed to move to this town together for six months to work on our relationship so that’s what we should stick to. I feel like he frequently changes jobs to “chase the money” and I’m not comfortable with continuing to move if our relationship isn’t even close to 100%. I left big city opportunities to move to a smaller town where we both wanted to be and not even two months in to it, he wants to leave. He frequently gets offered jobs (this isn’t the first time we’ve had a disagreement about one) and could easily find another job where he’s from at the end of the six months if he wanted to. I also worry that if I move to this new city and we break up, I’ll be far from anyone I know, in a city I’m not familiar with and won’t be able to afford to live there alone. His opinion is that he’ll make lots of money for the future and be near his family in the meantime. \n\nAITA for telling him if he doesn’t finish the six months we agreed to then we’re done?\n",

She came back after about 10 minutes with my salad and said yea the guys in the kitchen are new so I put a fire under them and they got your salad done.  It had a little tiny container of ranch dressing with it.  She asked me if the dressing was enough and I asked to please get a little more.  She said no problem.  \n      She disappeared again and I finished most of my salad but not all of it due to not enough dressing.  By this time my drink is almost gone and she arrives with my tacos.  She then disappears again and my drink is empty.      \n      As I eat I start looking around for her because I am thirsty.  I see her to my left across the room sitting at a high top table talking to a lady.  I keep eating but also keep looking her direction hoping to catch her eye.  I never catch her eye and she never looks my way.  I finish my food and am now annoyed because I really wanted more tea.  She is still over at the table talking to the girl.  \n      Another waitress comes walking by and I ask her if she can tell my waitress “who is just sitting over there talking” that I would like my bill?  She said yes.  \n      Finally my waitress comes and she said here’s your bill.  Sorry I was training a new girl.  But she said I kept an eye on you to see if you made any indication of needing anything.  I don’t bother to tell her she’s lying because I stared at her for a long time and never saw her look my way.  In addition I don’t mention the ranch dressing she never brought and that I didn’t get a refill on my tea.  \n      I contemplated the idea of her training and should I feel guilty for thinking she doesn’t deserve a tip.  I pay my bill and didn’t leave a tip.  I just think even if you are training someone you still have to help your customers.  AITA?",

      "description": "My husband is in the process of enlisting in the air force and money is tight for us, but we wanted to get married before he shipped off in a few months time. \n\nOriginally I had not planned on having a reception party or even buying a wedding dress as we are trying to save money for our future. \n\nAfter telling my sister about our plans (a courthouse ceremony and a small reception dinner at a local restaurant) she insisted she wanted to make the day special and that she had bought some decorations for the reception dinner. She also offered to pay for half the cost of a dress that we picked out together.\n\nIn total she spent about 350 dollars on the dress/supplies. I was grateful for her help and especially for the dress. It was beautiful!\n\n3 weeks later and the wedding was wonderful! I thanked my sister for making our day special even though we were trying to be frugal.\n\nWell fast forward a month and a half later, and now my sister is saying she's short on her bills this month and is asking us to pay her back not only the money she paid for the dress (that I wouldn't have gotten if she hadn't offered to pay for half of) and the supplies she bought without asking me. \n\nMy husband is annoyed and thinks she's only asking because she knows we've been saving money. We can afford to pay her back, but we dont want to because we're trying to save for a down payment on a house for the future. She told us before she spent the money that it was a gift. \n\nI'm not sure what to do. Im a little hurt that she's now asking for her money back, but I love my sister and dont want her to struggle to pay her bills or damage our relationship.\n\nWIBTA if I refused to pay her back the 350 dollars when she needs it for bills?\n\ntl;dr: sister gifted us 350 dollars to help with wedding expenses then a month and a half after the wedding is asking for it back to pay her bills.",

      "description": "I apologize for any formatting errors, i’m on mobile.\n\nI met this girl in the first semester of school. We’re both in first year sciences and have become good friends over the past few months. We have almost every class together and we would occasionally meet to study, however, she didn’t study very much. I found most of the time we studied together, it would be her asking me for help on assignments, or sometimes just asking for the answers.\n\nThis semester we’re lab partners. A couple of weeks ago, we conducted our own experiment and collected data. So to make this clear, we both had a copy of the data. Because this is a first year bio course, we had a short introduction to stats tutorial showing us how to use a specific program to create graphs and perform tests on the data to get necessary values for our reports. During this tutorial, my lab partner sat on her computer and didn’t really try to figure out the program. It required some basic coding which neither of us knew how to do but I sat there until I figured it out. After the tutorial, I spent hours and hours of my own time working on our data to get the info to include in my report. Without any help from her.\n\n\nThese reports are a complete individual formal lab reports. We had over 3 weeks to submit them. Over those three weeks, I barely heard from her so I assumed she didn’t need to meet with me to do the stats program together.\n\nTHE NIGHT BEFORE ITS DUE she texts me asking if we could exchange reports to proofread. I had a late lab (different lab) so I told her I didn’t have time. She then asked if she could just see my report to make sure we got the same stats. I told her I wasn’t going to send her my report. I didn’t really say why, but it was because I didn’t want her to take anything from my report and risk getting caught involved in cheating. \n\nShe then admitted to not having done any of the statistics portion of the lab and was just hoping to use my values and graphs. At this point I’m pretty upset. If she had helped me or shown some effort at all, I probably wouldn’t have minded sharing with her. But because this was all my own work and my effort, I didn’t feel it was fair for her to get a better grade for not doing anything. All I basically said to her was that she had to figure it out herself. The next lab, she didn’t say a word to me and did the lab with a different group. \n\nAITA??\n\ntldr; my friend who is also my lab partner assumed I would be doing the stats portion of the lab and that she would just get the answers without doing any of the work. I said heck no.",

      "description": "Hey there reddit, first time user, long time lurker, mobile user, etc, etc \nThis will be a long one.\n\nFirst let me give some background on me. I’m a 20 year old male, first year university student studying computer science A struggling one at that, however with exams coming up shortly and my less than impressive grades I’m getting already I decided to really take my studies really seriously over the winter break to try and push my grades back up to what they should be. \n\nMy gf that I have been seeing for 11 months has been living in my parents house with me since last summer,originally it went from staying the night tho eventually being there everyday and I didn’t have a problem with it as for the most part. However my parents and my brother did and around two months ago a huge argument was started about rent pay and general living expenses ( I pay my share of the rent) it eventually led to my gf saying she was going to start spending more time at home. \nMy gf had the idea that it would be great if i tagged along with her and moved out to her house to live with her and her mom instead and for months started to list off very logical reason why it would be a better choice for me, she spoke about it to my mom and convinced her that it would be a great idea too and while I said It did have some benefits and I would think about it, i was never really convinced. I used to share a room with my brother until my sister moved out and only recently I got my own room to do with as I pleased. \nWith my mom on board with the decision and my gf going on about it every week and redecorating her room it felt like I was being pushed into it and it drove me away from the idea more then anything and just gave me mental stress.\nToday on the phone she brought it up again and I just went silent, she asked me if I wanted to move out and I said not really, I want to have some of my own space for studying and doing what I want to do, she tried to explain to me that I could do all of that at hers but I just said it isn’t the same. She got mad and said she isn’t coming to see me tonight, that I wasn’t man enough to tell her from the start and put down the phone.\nI’ve always wanted to move out but I want to move out on my own terms, I feel like right now it just isn’t the best time for me to do something like that now when I’m already stressed about university exams coming soon and such.\n\nAm I being the asshole here or are my reasons justified?",

      "description": "For as long as I remember, I have lived alone with my mother. When I was very little, she left my father due to his absence and alcoholic tendencies and took me with her. Now, it's over 20 years, and I visited him once in my hometown.\n\nI had the time of my life with my half-sister, but I couldn't exchange more than pleasantries with my dad. I never lived with him, neither I know his daily life. He only sends me messages and calls whenever it's my birthday or an holiday, but completely ignores my existence during most of the time. I never felt like I missed him, because there was nothing to miss at first. He never helped my mom economically or gave me a gift, only reminded me of his presence in two days an year.\n\nNow, last Christmas he mentioned the possibility of coming to visit me, but I shoved him aside and gave excuses, saying I would be traveling and away from home. However, I can't help but think every night if he doesn't realize what he does is wrong. I feel pretty shitty ignoring every attempt of him trying to come closer, but I'm sure I won't be able to love him, despite my efforts of giving him some attention. He's been sober for a while and struggling to maintain a job, but never texted my family or asked if there's anything he could help with.\n\nEvery person I've talked to made me even more miserable, saying I shouldn't ignore the fact that he's my parent, that I should be grateful he brought me into this world. I tried, hard as I could, but I can't love him. I don't hate him, nor harbor anything ill-minded. I just can't feel a thing. Should I call him back and hope that, unlike last birthday when he promise he would come but had a \"business trip\" two days prior to the party, he'll come and give me my first dress ever as a gift?\n\nAm I the asshole?",

I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "description": "To start with some background info; this guy I work with (we’ll call him D) got this adorable puppy last year around this time. D and I were pretty good friends and I watched the puppy a lot while he worked as we both lived in apartments above our workplace. I also bought the puppy a lot of toys and treats that he couldn’t afford at the time. Fast forward a couple months and D has stopped taking the dog outside more than once a day for a few minutes at a time and could no longer afford dog food for her. D and I got into multiple fights over it when I would tell him that a dog needs to go outside way more than once a day, especially a high energy puppy. Then D gets arrested and sent off to prison. The dog was stuck in his apartment above work so I asked the landlords permission to take his copy of the key and to take the dog. I now have had this dog for 7-8 months, which is longer than D had the dog in the first place. In that time I have moved into a house with a large fenced in backyard where she loves to run, she has received shots from the vet, she has been spayed, and she consistently has dog food, toys, treats, and lots of love. \n\nD just got out of prison a few days ago and the first thing he asked about when he saw me was the dog. He asked how his dog was doing and when he can meet up with me to take her back. I explained to him that right now he does not have a place to live nor does he have any money to take care of the dog. I also explained to him that I have spent hundreds of dollars on getting her shots and spayed and that he can’t just expect to take her back after I’ve had her for so long. He also owes my boss a lot of money so he won’t be making any money to take care of a dog anytime in the foreseeable future. This caused D to get understandably upset but now he is blasting me on Facebook, calling me a dognapper and other awful things that don’t need to be repeated. AITA for wanting this dog to have a stable life with me rather than give her back? \n\nTLDR; Coworker gets puppy, doesn’t take care of her well. Coworker then goes to prison. I take the dog while he’s in prison and now he is upset I won’t give her back because he doesn’t have a place to live or money to feed her. ",

      "description": "I'm going to try to keep sexes out of this, sorry if that makes things more confusing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a wonderful spouse. Good parent, kind, affectionate, patient, does a lot around the house, good human in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am holding a grudge that I would love to let go of. I have always been good with money, partner is very comfortable with debt. When we got together partner had 3K of credit card debt on shared card with their ex. They said they wanted to pay that off and not stick ex with it, so I loaned partner the money. Partner was making the minimum payment every month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPartner also had high student loans so when they moved in with me, I said I would pay rent, but they should pay 1K/month and whatever else they could on their student loans. They had been re-enrolling in masters program to not have to pay it back yet and not have interest start accruing, about $800/year to do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got inheritance of 140K, 100K went to pay off partners student loans entirely. 40K went to buy land we had talked about buying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPartner got 10K as wedding gift. When I asked after a few months what we were going to do with it, there was less than half left. Partner paid for a 2K piece of furniture for us with the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was all around 10 years ago. More recently I found out partner had 20K in debt which led us to couples counselling. Debt is now down to 6K.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe keep our money separate and the agreement is we both have the same amount towards personal use and the rest is family money that we will decide what to do with. Partner hates talking about money so I avoid the topic because I don't want to ruin a good mood and I don't want to make a bad mood worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm mostly okay with being the financially responsible one. I don't suspect drugs or shopping addiction. It seems to get frittered away on things like eating out, an extra $5-10/day on snacks or coffee, that kind of thing. I really don't know where it goes but I have no reason to suspect anything untoward other than that money just flows out of partner's hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently partner went to city to buy specialty item that would fall under partner's half of shared expenses but that I typically pay for because I am in city more often. I gave partner my bank card for a different reason, partner used my bank card to pay that expense. I was really annoyed but said nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe don't struggle for money. If partner were better with money, they would have a different personality that would make them less great in other ways. If I had to choose earning half my salary or losing my partner I would choose partner. So why do I keep a catalogue of these offences in my head and continue to expect something different? AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I have recently taken over as the headchef at a hotel, which itself has just been bought over but new owners.\n\nOne of the kitchen porters (dishwasher/cleaner) is a man I have worked with at a previous hotel for around six years. I like him, but, I think that he is lazy and will do anything to avoid doing what is asked of him. He will do the work but you have to chase him up all the time. When he wants to work hard he works hard but I think he chooses not to.\n\nSo a few days ago I come into the kitchen to open up and the place is a shit hole, not only has he not done the specific cleaning tasks I asked him to do but he's not even done his close down tasks. This isn't the first time I've seen him do this but it is the first time I have been his boss. I decided that day that if I want this place to work I need a team that can are motivated and want the place to work, and that wasn't him. I spoke to the owner and he left the decision to me and I decided to get rid of him.\n\nToday I've come in to start my shift and the temporary front of house manager has gone apeshit at me, saying that I can't sack him for this and that he needs more guidance because he is a little \"slow\" (her words), she thinks that it's \"disgusting\" the way we are treating him.\n\nMy view after working with him for years is that his disability is not severe, he is perfectly capable of functioning as an adult human  he needs help with reading and maths etc but he fully understands his role what it entails and he has been a kitchen porter for 15+ years, so it is not an excuse to say he needs extra guidance, and we can't afford to carry him. \n\nSo I will be sacking him on Monday and replacing him with a guy that I now works hard and I can trust to get us through a rebrand with minimal supervision.\n\nSo reddit am I the asshole?

      "description": "My parents divorced when I was ten years old. I am one of four siblings. Pre-divorce, my father had my mother get her tubes tied because he didn't want any more children. After the divorce, he immediately married a woman with an infant and adopted her baby (donor sperm, no birth father around). He then chose to have another baby with her. After that baby was born, my stepmother and father treated me and my siblings like second class citizens. She felt that we should be cut off at 18, while her now 18 year old daughter continues to live at home. She constantly criticized us and our mother. She frequently complained about child support (my father, despite making good money, paid only the statutory minimum). She was a total jerk at my wedding and wore sunglasses in all the photos. Now I have a new baby and all of the sudden she wants to be involved. She keeps having my dad call me and say HE wants to come visit, and she always comes along. She also frequently posts on social media as if she is involved in my baby's life. I am not comfortable with this. I am debating talking to my father and telling him that I don't want her involved in my baby's life. My concern is that when her kids have babies, my baby will be ignored and not understand why she no longer has a relationship with this woman. WIBTA if I have this talk with my dad?",

About a year in, things went downhill and they ended their relationship. He was brokenhearted, madly in love with her and though they attempted to stay friends he couldn't stop from falling for her causing them to stray again and again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few months I met a girl at party, Jackie. We became friends and me, knowing Arnold needed a way out of his blues, hooked them up and Walla! they fell in love! They moved in and he was doing much better and seemed to have put Lucy behind. I was so happy for both of them but especially for Arnold for moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLucy (Arnold's ex) and me saw each other on the street randomly, mostly small-talk. I was working part-time job and that called for a lot of late-night drinking, something that as I soon found out Lucy was also into. So we became drinking buddies, we would meet about once or twice a month for a beer and maybe a party, naturally after months we just became friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Arnold learned Lucy and me were becoming friends, he wasn't thrilled but knew he was deep in another serious relationship and asked me to not shove it in his face, to which I obviously agreed. I never mentioned it to him. Now is about 2 years after their breakup and 1 year after he met his new girlfriend, Jackie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's my fuckup - one time Lucy and me were out and extremely drunk and I said something sexual to her, yet she wasn't mad, laughed it off and I apologized quickly, understanding its the alcohol talking. We both went on less than a minute later as if nothing had just happened. Still, with lots of guilt, I wanted to tell Arnold, but since nothing happened I decided to put it behind me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomehow Arnold found out, went ballistic and cut me off completely. I wrote him nothing actually happened, that we were really drunk and I'm extremely sorry I didn't tell him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths later we tried to settle it down where I learnt he wasn't really mad about that incident, he was jealous of me that I can be her friend and he can't (because he's emotionally unstable around her or because Jackie wouldn't allow him to), so I was given an ultimatum - either cut off Lucy completely or he's not my friend anymore (alongside with two other friends of mine). I told him I need to think it through but soon after came to realize it would be a shitty thing for me to do to Lucy to just cut her off because her ex is jealous, it's just not her fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know IATA for not being honest, but AITA for staying friends with Lucy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS:\n\n1. I would have never hung out with Lucy if Arnold wasn't already deep in another serious relationship.\n2. I have a girlfriend and very much not interested in anything to do with Lucy romantically.",

      "description": "I'm a college freshman living in residence and me and roommate are both night owls, like I normally go to bed around 12:30 and she usually goes to sleep a few hours after me. I'm not actually sure how much later she stays up because I always go to bed first, but from time to time she complains/brags about falling asleep around 4 or 5. She's mentioned a couple times that her anxiety won't let her go to bed before me but it was never like a serious conversation. So anyways it's like 11 on monday night and I'm wide awake and I was on a bit of a Sims 4 kick so I decide to keep playing for a while longer. At this point I was concerned that might be a dick move because of the anxiety thing, but then I remembered how late she normally stays up and that she only has afternoon classes the next day (this is important later) so I figured it wasn't a problem, and it's not like she said anything about it. I still couldn't sleep a few hours later which I did apologize for at the time because I was awake for most of the night. When I woke up the next morning she had already left the room and left me a passive aggressive note asking me not to do that again because tuesdays are busy for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNormally I'd obviously be the asshole here, but here's the thing; last semester she often had guests over well past midnight to watch the office or talk about anime, which kept me from sleeping. I missed a few classes because of that including one that was worth 1% of my final grade (which isn't that much but still). When I asked her not to have people over so late I got chewed out. Apparently because we're both friends with these people they're also my guests (even tho they were only talking to her and doing things I'm not involved in) so I should have kicked them out, and how we shouldn't have a rule just because I can't communicate. My anxiety and basic manners can go to hell I guess. I ended up apologizing to end the argument (it's still the only time we've ever really fought). I ended up getting lucky because most of the people who used to come over decided that they also wanted to go to bed at a decent hour and now they leave at 11 for the most part. I was over this whole thing until I read her note. I can't figure out how I'm the asshole for keeping her awake at night AND I'm the asshole for asking her not to keep me awake, so I figured I'd ask y'all.",

We still made an effort to see each other from time to time to see how things were going, but I think we both knew it just would never be the same again. In one of our last encounters I mentioned that I was studying to become an actor, and that he should go see a play that I'm in someday, he said he'd love to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here is the thing, our School/Theatre Company charges for the tickets. (the actors never see this money btw) The students/actors can buy the tickets for any play there for 1/4 of the price , you just can't buy more than one ticket for the same play for this price, so we usually just get other students to buy it for us if we need more than one ticket for a play. So when I'm doing a play, family and friends are always asking for tickets for 1/4 of the price, not only because it's cheaper, but because they don't have to get in a queue for it. And it's kind of a pain in the ass because I'm trying to concentrate so that I don't fuck everything up when I'm on stage (I usually work on the lighting aswell, and that takes time to setup), but I need to be constantly checking my phone to see who is asking for tickets, and talking to people to see if they can buy a ticket for me. My best friend than texts me and asks if I can get two tickets for him, because he would get there late and the tickets would probably be sold out by the time he arrived, I said sure.\n\nThing is, I forgot to buy the fucking tickets, I was so caught up on what I was doing that by the time I remembered, the tickets were already sold out, and my phone was dead, so I couldn't text him. Since my family was there I asked for them to message him and say that he wouldn't be able to see the play.\n\nFor some reason, maybe because I'm quite a stubborn person, and because I was stressed out by the play and everyone that wanted a ticket, I didn't apologise, I just explained the situation, and hoped he would understand, I thought he did, boy was I wrong. Some time passes, and the next message I sent him wishing a merry xmas was met with a pretty cold reply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to some months later, and I'm again doing a play. This time I texted him the day before saying that to compensate for last time, I would buy him two tickets, go to his house and personally deliver them to him, he never responded, only saw the message. I said fuck it, I don't need this, people fall apart, that's life, I'll remember all the good and bad times we had together, but I do not wish to extend whatever this friendship has become. We never texted eachother again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a feeling this whole situation is super fucking petty, AITA here?\n\nPS. Sorry if this whole thing isn't clear enough, english is not my first language.",

      "description": "So a few years ago my mom and her fiancé find this house for rent and it has two separate suites. They can’t afford it on their own so ask if my husband and I would be interested in renting the bottom suite. We tell them sure, and that our budget is $1100 per month as we are trying to save money for investments/to buy a house. (We are already living in our own place at this point for less)\n\nFor context the rent for the entire house is $2900. They are living on the top two floors in a 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom house with a double garage and backyard for $1800 a month, and we are living in a 2 bedroom 1 bath basement suite for $1100. My husband works for an Internet company so we pay $100 for Internet and cable for the entire house, and they agree to pay the other utility bills (seems fair for the amount of rent they are paying vs space.) which equal about $250 a month. (So we are paying $1200, and they are paying $2050)\n\nEverything is fine for months. Then in December they ask us to sit down, tell us that they had gone on equal monthly payments with the gas company (this means you have to pay the remaining balance or get paid out at the end of the year) which we did not know about obviously because the bill was not in our name, and they got hit with a $1500 gas bill that they weren’t expecting because they weren’t tracking our usage throughout the year.. They want us to pay them $500 to cover a third of the bill. \n\nMy husband and I refuse to pay the on the grounds that they agreed to pay the bill, they are the ones who decided to go on equal monthly payments, and they should have been tracking the monthly usage. \n\nWe instead offer that for the following year we will increase our rent by $50 a month to help manage the extra cost going forward. (That would be $600 extra for the year, which lines up with the extra usage.) \n\nThey call us out and say we are big assholes, are ungrateful, and are using them. My moms fiancé even goes as far as to say that we are LOSERS and that they shouldn’t have to pay our way when we are working 24 year olds. I tell him that he’s getting a sweet deal on his huge ass house and to not act like we are the ones taking advantage. \n\nMy husband and I pretty much tell him to go fuck himself, and we give 2 months notice, move out and get a townhouse. Their landlord rents the suite to someone else and increases their share of the rent to $2400 plus utilities. Moms fiancé is PISSED and says that it’s not fair we would abandon them and put them in that position after everything they have done for us. \n\nI started to feel bad at this point but my husband says that we did nothing wrong.\n\nSo, AITA for not agreeing to pay the bill and then for giving notice and moving out and leaving them to figure it out alone? \n\n\n",

      "description": "So I’ll preface this with the fact that the wedding hasn’t actually happened yet. However, I told someone recently I didn’t plan on buying her a wedding gift and you would’ve thought I said I was going to burn down the church. \n\nMy reasoning behind this is as follows: \nI am the maid of honor in this wedding. I have flown across the country to see her for wedding related things probably 3 times in the past year. That’s ~$700 in flights alone. Not to mention the one I’ll purchase to attend the wedding, and the vacation days I’ve taken / will have to take. Also, a hotel room in Manhattan for that weekend.\n\nI purchased the bridesmaids dress ($300) and still need to buy shoes. I was told hair for the day of the event was being charged at $130 per person. \n\nThe bachelorette party is in Napa. My portion of the house was $400. My flights are probably going to be in the $300 range. This doesn’t include rental car or any activities we’ll be partaking in. \n\nI should mention that I in no way am upset about what I’ve spent or will spend on the event. She’s my best friend in the world and I know she’d be doing the same for me. She’s never been demanding in her requests. \n\nWith that said, I do feel like at this point my gift has been given. I will have spent thousands of dollars on this thing when all is said and done, and to purchase an additional gift on top of that seems superfluous and just doesn’t sit well with me. It’s a 250 person wedding, there will be ample gifts for them to enjoy. So AITA? \n",

Today I accidentally hit myself in the nose with my knee, really damn hard, trying to do a joke during class. I was excused to go to the nurse’s clinic, nothing serious, just put an ice pack. Got home, placed another ice pack from the freezer to help with the swelling. When parents came home, dad realised I had an ice pack on my desk, he asked why. I lied and said “Oh, I got hit by a volleyball while playing. I’ve already learnt my mistake, I don’t need a long talk.” (Context : my dad can literally spend hours talking on a subject on “self improvement” and they’re really obvious and can be remembered with common sense, he always does this talk that lasts way too long ever since I was young, a handful of years back) Dad replies with “oh okay, you should’ve just blocked the ball with your face using your arms, like this.” *holds arms infront of face* I interrupted him and said “please I really don’t want this talk, it’s almost for me to go to sleep.” I let my dad get out of the room and close the door. A few seconds later, he continues his lecture on how I could’ve defended myself better. Now I’m here typing this in the sub. I’ve had talks with him before on how he needs to keep it short with his “lectures.” MANY times before. Even though I lied about my situation, it is my fault and he’s trying to help, but I wanna hear your guys’ opinions.",

      "description": "During university my roommates (also friends) were very bad at turning off lights in common areas. I had discussed it with them at length before but their logic was they weren't paying for utilities so who cares. Fair enough. \n\nThe issue was that this meant sometimes when the bathroom light was on it didn't mean anyone was using it. We also tended to kept the bathroom door closed/open regardless of if it was not in use. Essentially what I'm getting at is that sometimes the bathroom door would be closed with the light on and no one in it. So I would often just try to door to see if it was in use. \n\nOne day my friend has his girlfriend stay the night. That night I go to use the bathroom to brush my teeth and open the door and she standing their naked so I quickly close the door apologizing and head back to my room a bit embarrassed.  I tell my friend about what happened and he just said don't worry about it so I just forgot about it. \n\nThe next day around noon (when I generally wake up) the same thing happens when I'm going to use the bathroom to brush my teeth again. This time my friend is in the living room so I look at him and just with a look of defeat say \"does she not know how to use the lock?\"\n\nHe said that it was my fault for not checking if the light was on before trying the door and that I should be the one being more considerate\n\nThis kind of caused a fight between us cause it had happened multiple times. But neither was willing to take the blame. \n\nJust wondering if I'm TA here for being annoyed by this. ",

We both are in the same class as her and he originally pointed her out to me. We both are pretty shy guys so nothing has really happened involving her until just recently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was able to befriend one of Jane's best friends in another one of my classes and she has been helping me get closer to Jane, inviting me to go out to lunch with them next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I found out about this I told John as nicely as possible to avoid a humble-brag which he understood and appreciated for me telling him so nicely. He just asked not to be bothered with any more details about it, which I tried my best to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where it gets unfortunate.\n\nI am out at lunch with 3 friends (including John) and I get get a text from Jane's friend saying that Jane has been talking about a recent short film I had presented in class. (John also was in my group for this presentation) They are both eating in her car at school and suggested I come back to join them. I was already at a restaurant with my friends so I just cursed and figured I missed a chance to talk to Jane. When my friends asked what I cursed at I kinda just blew it off as personal, not wanting John to get more upset at the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe drive back to school and there is still 10 minutes of lunch left, Jane's friend is still texting me to come to their car to talk to Jane. I know I should take this opportunity but I can't just leave John's car without having to tell him where I'm going, I can't just tell him It's about Jane because he wouldn't want to hear about it, especially in front of our other friends.  So instead I decided to ask John to pop the trunk so I can get something out of my bag. He agrees and I walk out of the car, grab my bag and go talk with Jane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's furious about this, I try to explain what my intentions were but he doesn't want to hear it. He believes none of this would have happened if he hadn't pointed Jane out to me in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I leave my friends at lunch to go talk with a girl I have a crush on",

We’ve had some other bumps in the road which led to me giving him an ultimatum saying that I needed him to decide whether or not he wanted to be with me. I didn’t pressure him into giving me an answer, in fact I told him I would give him all the space and time he needed to make a decision but the same day he told me he wanted to make it work. This was almost 2 weeks ago and so we’ve been back together and now today he just dumped me saying that it didn’t feel right and that he thinks he’s just scared of being alone. Yesterday we were just talking about buying presents for each other and just this week he dropped me off at the airport and was telling me how much he loved me. Obviously I was hurt and pretty pissed bc I felt pretty led on. He said he still cares about me and then he said he still wants to be friends and give me my Christmas present when the time comes. I was in the midst of basically an anxiety attack and told him I never wanted to see him again in a pretty brusque way and blocked him on everything. A mutual friend told me he’s really sad now bc I cut contact and I kinda feel bad but I feel like it’s really unfair of him to want to keep me as a friend when I clearly care so much about him and have just had my heart and future plans crushed.

      "description": "Yesterday, I took a final exam for one of my courses (this is university btw) and I looked up to check the clock to see how much time I had left when I noticed the guy next to me had notecards underneath his test. Moments later, he poked his friend's back, who happened to be sitting in the seat in front of them, and leaned over their shoulder to see their test.\n\nThis exam was brutal and if they happened to do well then they could've messed up the curve for the entire class (which is only about 30 students). So I wrote a note on my test saying what was going on and asked my professor if I could go to the restroom. I gave her my test for safekeeping and pointed it out. She nodded and I went to the bathroom (I actually did have to go).\n\nWhen I came back, she handed me my test where she had written that she'll take care of it. She was watching them for the rest of the class and eventually caught them in the act. She confiscated their tests and took them outside. They did not return.\n\nNow some of my friends are telling me that I did the right thing because they were stupid for trying to cheat on a final in college while some of them are saying that it was wrong of me because school is difficult. Also cheating results in automatic failure in this class.\n\nTLDR: Noticed two people were cheating, told the professor in a ninja manner, and possibly made them failed the class.",

      "description": "Not 30 minutes ago, I ordered some food through an app like Uber Eats. I listed my items in a clear manner, and made sure to be *really* specific, as to make it NEAR IMPOSSIBLE to get my order wrong.\n\nAnyway, all was going okay, until I realized she was already in route with my items, and I never heard a peep from her since ordering. About 95% of the time, I get a text message with updates from the driver. It helps me know whats going on, lets me be ready for them, and *also lets me know if something is up with the order.*\n\nShe texts me that she is here, even though that there are clear instructions to deliver to door. I checked the picture of the reciept *which showed only the lower half*.\n\nBy looking at what little I saw, I already knew a few things. Half of my order was incorrect. I asked for a Thai milk tea with tapioca pearls, I recieved a Panda milk tea that was a green tea based. *Believe me I frequent this place. And I would have today not barring car repairs. And that is really hard to get wrong.* If they were out (which is common) she should have said something before winging it, at least, I think so. And my sauces were incorrect and in poor shape. I could also tell that she went through the drive though, just by the way that particular reciept is printed.\n\nSo she parks at my place, and THEN, I hear from her. She doesn't want to come up. Every other driver has, unless the automatic doors locked. Which they lock at 6. It was 3:50. (In hindsight, they WERE IN FACT locked. Which is really *really* weird.) But, she didn't leave her car. I politely asked if can she deliver it to the door, as I was pretty busy working on something.\n\n\"There is no parking.\" Utter BS. There are two parallel parking areas, and less than 50 feet from those AND the lobby doors, is a full parking lot that doesn't tow unless your  car has been there for more than 6 hours.\n\nSo, now I was lied to and the order was wrong.\n\nSo I put on a smile, walked down the stairs, and got my food. She also *threw away the reciept right in front of me* when that is supposed to be given to me (app policy). I say thanks, walk back up, leave one star, and lower the tip *as much as possible.* Still had to give one, but odds are she broke even with that tip if not barely.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I'm not that organized as a person, but I started a Google Doc where I recorded all the notes that we took as a class. Now if you knew me, you'd know that I'm not the biggest asshole on the planet, in fact, I usually try to make the morally right choice when it comes to making decisions. However, I have a low tolerance for people that mooch off of other people. This belief was very much suppressed though, because I typically choose to help other people over myself, and I always found myself giving my friends answers to tests, quizzes, and homework. \n\nNow, to the point. In my Biology class, I sit next to a girl who is bad news. She gets wasted every Friday, has no life goals, and wants to drop out of school next year. Her choice, I'm not the one to mold her, but I'm not going to stand for people who have no goals or motives in their life and want to be lazy and unproductive. She never focuses in class. She always has her Airpods in, on some website while we're taking notes. I'm always on my Doc with everything all neat and shit. She's not paying attention at all. Occasionally after classes, I tell her that I kind of want her to focus more so that she doesn't have to keep asking me for shit, but she never does because she simply doesn't care.\n\nNow, we had a big test coming up over everything in quarter one. She asked me for my notes. I say \"No, sorry. I'm sick of giving you everything. I'm not going to be your crutch throughout the year. I'm not gonna deal with you not focusing in class. If you want the notes, you should have paid attention.\" She responded with an answer somewhere along the lines of \"Ok asshole, I'll find someone else\". She was obviously annoyed because she's used to being handed everything from me. I'm friends with her, but I wasn't going to just give her what she wanted if she didn't focus in class.\n\nHer friend approached me after we took the test (that she failed) and called me a dick for not helping her out. I told her that she needs to focus in class, but I'm sorry. I feel guilty now. She is bad news but she obviously has problems, and I was just trying to be firm. Now I feel like the bad person. Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "(Sorry this is quite long) Some back story- my mom is really ill, needs near-constant medical care. We live in a different country from her family where the medical facilities are better. For this reason, she usually goes to live with her family for months at a time to get treatment, meet with doctors. Because my dad and I both have corporate jobs, we can’t always go with her. But we do fly with her to drop her off and to bring her home. \n\nMy maternal uncle is not a nice man, he’s abusive towards his family and kids\nand towards the larger family and has picked fights with everyone at one point or the other. One time he hit one of cousins because she “talked back”.   Everyone hates each other in this family, but they continue to behave as if everything is normal and they all get along.  That said he’s always been there for my mum to support her emotionally and she has an intense soft spot for him because he’s the only brother in a family of three sisters. \n\n\nOver the last few years, my maternal uncle has become quite aggressive with my dad. He constantly belittles him and says nasty things to him. He doesn’t say anything because he thinks it’ll upset my mom, and make her sicker. And he continues to maintain civil contact with her family.  IMO my mom also doesn’t say anything to her family or her brother for what I consider severe disrespect to my dad. This is a big sticking point for me.\n\nEarlier this year, he and I got into a fight after he called my dad a coward for leaving my mom in “their” house for months and running away from her care (it’s a house my dad owns in that country but because of mom he lets her family live there). Wtf, where does he think the money for her care comes from?? My dad was really upset. That was the last straw for me.  \n\nI have since refused to speak with my uncle. My mom knows why, and my uncle knows why, but she constantly pushes me to speak with him. Recently, she got really sad and said to me that she may not have much time left in this world and she wants all her loved ones to get along. She pointed out that my uncle has been behaved with all my cousins and her other sisters but they still maintain contact with him so why can’t I. He’s family after all. \n\nAITA for not wanting to maintain contact with someone I consider a toxic person? ",

      "description": "So I'm (m25) dating this girl(f24) and we are(were??) really into each other (after 1 month she told me she never could imagine getting such strong feelings for a person in such short amount of time) but for the last 3 weeks she's distancing herself from me more and more like avoiding kisses and cuddles. Not telling me details about anything.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n\\-She never mentions names of her friends\n\n\\-She always is at my place because she recently moved back to her parents and is embarrased about this situation even though I said it's totally fine she's in a bad situation right now things happen\n\n\\-She didn't tell me the adress yet and doesn't want me to come over, not for helping her moving nor for just meeting\n\n\\-At for 1 1/2 month we wrote every day the whole day (i know it gets less over time) but from one to another day she barely wrote anything anymore. Short sentenced, no smileys.\n\n\\-Since that time she's always at her phone, covering it up on purpose so i can't see (which i really don't want to, normally i trust people really easily but it's just really conspicious)\n\n\\-We havn't had Sex in those 3 weeks now (before it was every time she was here which is 1-2 times a week) and i know it gets less but not in that short amount of time. Don't get me wrong i don't like her because we have sex but it'  \ns just another thing that makes me think about all that. She said in the first week she's on her period... Okay.\n\n7 days later.... she said she's on her period again she has just a weird cycle \"every 2 weeks\" she said and i said \"uhh that's one week but yeah it's alright\" ... Ok\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first i thought, yeah I'm a new person she met and you don't instantly tell others everything about yourself because there are enough psychos out there but it's 2 months by now and I can name numerous other questionable situations. I'm not a jealous person at all, I'm not a controlling person i really respect her privacy but i can't bear all those \"secrets\" anymore, Uncertainty is the only thing i can't stand. Really i would be fine with anything even if she met another one, i would end it and it's fine ...but like this my mind is going round and round about it.\n\nI spoke to her once that all started and she said that she's just a person who doesn't want to call everything out. But dating a girl for 2 months not knowing a thing about her social environment or even where she lives? She already met my friends and even my parents last week.\n\nNow i told her that i needed to speak to her but since 4 days now she doesn't have the time and I'm asking every day again... She's got always a different excuse (even though i don't like to say excuse when i don't know for sure), next week is her birthday where we wanted to have dinner together and i wanted to talk to her before.\n\nSo here I am... I hate to be annoying and i hate overpushers myself but I don't know what to do\n\nsry for my bad english.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: girl im dating for 2 months has many secrets or questionable situations, i'm overpushing her for meeting and talking about it cause next week is her b-day",

She has been going out to clubs and bars, being completely drunk all the time. She always used to message me during these events telling me \"How boring it became without me and she doesn't enjoy it that much anymore\" or just asking me how I am. Lately though when she goes out with friends, she doesn't tell me neither messages me but I can always see on her status how she is hanging out with her friends. Today she told me about a weird dream where she had twins. After I asked what happened in the dream she told me the whole dream, where she slept with \"this other guy\" at the bar in a room.\n\nAnyways I have this suspicion, that she actually cheated on me and either doesn't want to tell me directly or I am actually paranoid about nothing.

      "description": "My girlfriend and I have been on pretty rocky footing since we started dating a little over a month ago (we were best friends for a year before dating). As a little bit of background, she struggles really badly with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It's been getting worse and worse over the past couple of months and she thinks about suicide almost daily. She hasn't been eating, she's been skipping classes almost every day, and she calls out from work because she can't leave her apartment most of the time. She's told me her depression has never felt like this before and she seems completely hopeless in facing it.\n\nTwo days ago we had a particularly bad day when she overdosed on her anxiety medication and ended up in the hospital. Since it was an overdose she had to go to the psych hospital connected to this hospital to see if she needed to stay there for a while.\n\nBy the time we got sent to the psych hospital for her to get a psychiatric evaluation, she was ready to go home. We were in the regular hospital for about 8 hours by then. She acted incredibly rudely to all the hospital workers and was almost at a point of breaking mentally. She and I got into an argument in the waiting room because she told me that if I didn't lie to the psychiatrist and tell them that she was mentally stable (she isn't right now) that she would break up with me on the spot. She said \"fuck you\" twice and gave me the one breakup threat, saying I would be dead to her and she'd consider me the worst person who had ever been in her life.\n\nSo when the psychiatrist took me back I told her that my girlfriend had not expressed a desire to stop living (a lie), she had not told me she actively wanted to end her life (a lie- I've literally been worried about her dying from suicide almost daily for a month), and that I thought she wouldn't be a danger to herself (another lie). I felt extremely manipulated and I felt like she was making me subvert the next step in helping her depression that's resisting all treatments so far (antidepressants and therapy).\n\nI wrote a really cathartic entry in my journal right after this to release all these negative emotions on paper and not onto another person, but she knows I keep a journal. I wrote a journal entry that's showing negativity toward her, she found out about it, and she just walked out of my house because I wouldn't let her read it. It says some really scathing things, like that she was being manipulative and acted like a bitch to every psych hospital worker who tried to talk to her. Basically if she read what I wrote in my journal that I was feeling that night (feelings I've really gotten over by now), it would make her incredibly unhappy.\n\nI understand communication is key in relationships, but AITI for not letting my girlfriend read an entry I wrote in my private journal after our visit to the hospital?",

      "description": "Ok so this is kinda a long story. There’s this girl that I’ve know for over ten years, we became friends in elementary school and are both in college rn.\n\nI guess I’d say she’s my best friend from high school but that’s changed — at least in my eyes now. Basically since like the end of high school and up to now (the first semester of second year in college) I’ve just been getting more and more frustrated at her. \n\nFirst it started with her always copying me. And yes Ik the quote “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery” but this shit is just too annoying. And yes also I know the idea that everyone copies someone else so my ideas that I think are “original” actually aren’t. But I’m not claiming that all the things I do are original it’s just very blatant she copies me in just so many things. \n\nApart from that, she’s dabbled in tinder, ok not dabbled but like just delved into it which I’m fine with no judgement from that aspect. It’s just that when she started college, she started this trend of hooking up with guys, feeling shitty about it and regretting it immediately, then recovering and saying she just need to fuck a hotter guy. \n\nI try comforting her and giving her he advice of like maybe you don’t have to fuck every guy who you see at a party *jokes I said it nicer than that trust me* but then she just does it over and over again. And it’s gotten to the point where she’s woken up and texted me that she doesn’t know if she’s fucked this guy or not which I think is pretty troubling idk about you. \n\nThere’s been alot of those instances and dealing with her parents who’ve found out about her hookups and smoking n drinking stuff. I try to give her advice but all she does is continue to complain and not do a single thing about it.\n\nAnyways thats just a couple of the aspects and then just recently this happened. Basically one of the things she copied me by doing is making a fitness account/fitsta whatever you call it. And I know she made it bc I did bc she told me to my face. And since she followed it in the beginning, I’ve lowkey removed her from my followers bc it’s just better for me mentally and shit I can’t fully explain it but I’m more comfortable if she isn’t following me on it. I’ve done that a total of two times.\n\nBut just recently she followed me again and I’ve just started telling things straight up to her and texted her asking if she wouldn’t follow it and made up some bs excuse as to why instead if saying “it’s bc I specifically don’t want YOU to”. And since then she’s iced me out and hasn’t replied to me on anything. \n\nSo basically, AITA?",

      "description": "\n          This kid has been annoying me for years.\nHe has made suggestive comments, offensive jokes, and has invaded my personal space too many times to count. There isn’t much I can do to avoid him as we’re in the same grade and on the same alpine race team. I’m the past I have been nice because he is socially awkward and people make fun of home but now I make it a point to ignore him whenever possible. But he follows me around and often cuts lines in order to be my chair-lift buddy. \n\n          He is known for making a lot of noise, getting hyped and rowdy before races, during practice, during class, I could go on. I’m not an introvert by any means but I don’t tend to get overly exited. My philosophy is simple. Have a certain thing you focus on for that practice and use the time on the lift to plan your run. When you get excited you get sloppy. Apparently he has a problem with that because he is constantly trying to hype me up and get me excited for the next run.  He is constantly offering advice I did not ask for and acting as if said advice is gold.\n\n          Now I’ve dealt with this kid for years as I said and I have never blown up, only respectfully disagreed with his ideas and told him not to make such problematic comments, but a few nights ago I snapped. I was having a shitty day. Botched presentation, dead car battery, broken pole and this guys nagging sure as hell didn’t help. I basically yelled at him in front of the lift operators and at least 50 other racers and ski school kids. \n\n          Something along the lines of, “I don’t need your help, I never asked for your advice, give me some godamn peace and quiet. You’ve crossed the line too many times, let me be, go hype up somebody else.”\n\n          He looked kinda hurt by what I said (I would too if someone said it to me). He left me alone for the rest of practice and hasn’t really talked to me since. Several witnesses who have had to deal with him in the past told me he had it coming but I feel like an ass. I’ve been debating apologizing but I like being left alone and I’m afraid he’s gonna think we’re friends if I do.\n\nTell me reddit gods and goddesses, am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "soooooo this was ages ago but I still don't get it. My boyfriend (now ex boyfriend...) and I had a HUGE argument that led to him dumping me and literally never speaking to me again. This was because he found out I had posted to r/ relationships and asked if the first time we had sex was rape or not. He somehow found my account and found the post and confronted me about it, I admitted it was me. \n\nMy intention for doing this wasn't to \"falsely accused him of rape\" as he says I was doing. I was genuinely confused because when the situation I asked for advice about happened, I was 16 and had never done anything sexual. Basically I was crying and trying to break up with him and he started doing sexual stuff. I did say yes at first but after I felt so bad because I didn't know my first time would involve a bunch of rough sex and face slapping choking, degrading names etc etc. (more things, won't go too in depth) I did say that it hurt but didn't say no. \n\nHe says that I'm trying to get him to be the bad guy and that I have a victim mentality. He said I was an asshole psychopath out to get him and that he was gonna stay the fuck away from me. \n\nI had tried to bring it up to him but he didn't wanna discuss it, that's why I posted about it online instead.\n\nWas I being asshole-ish...?",

      "description": "This argument started when my girlfriend and I were laying out our plans for the future, and according to her, she's now rethinking having a future with me at all. I think she's not understanding what I'm saying or is naive about parenthood.\n\nI told her that there's no way when we have children that we will be able to split the load completely evenly. There are biological components to motherhood that come into play, like maternal instincts and post partum bonding and such, that require the mother to spend more time with the child immediately after birth. Additionally, because of this, it is often more likely feasible for the mother to stay home or at least be the primary parent for the child, in addition to economic factors that usually result in the man being the breadwinner and the woman being the primary parent. Thus, odds are, she will be the primary parent for our children for a variety of reasons, and there is no way we will be able to have a completely equal split. \n\nShe told me she will not have a child with a man who does not agree to split the work evenly, while I am arguing that it is not possible, particularly right after birth but also down the line. She is reconsidering our relationship now and I need to know if I'm being the asshole or being logical.",

I just asked why she was doing so and instead of explanation she accused me that I'm spying on her.

Today she wanted to order a feminine medical product making all types of claims that costs $100 USD. She shows me 3 instagram posts (~1 min) where 'famous' instagamers 'review' the product. To me it sounded like a poorly veiled paid sponsorship. You can only order the product via DMs in Whatsapp (as is tradition in latin america). I check the website and it's literally 2 pages with a home and product page. The reviews are literally whatsapp convos thanking the manufacturer. The packaging is questionable, the ingredients is a bunch of plants, the only recognisable one is aloe vera. I made some jokes and the scepticism was pretty obvious in my face. She was immediately offended and told me she will never talk to me about this type of stuff again. Our country has much more strict testing and guidelines than where she is ordering from. Why is it not sold here? Am I the Asshole by being skeptical and basically calling BS on it? Should I just shut up and support her?

      "description": "Last week my friend (16 M) had invited me (16 F) to go out with friends. In the past, he has asked me out about three times, and I declined all three times due to timing. I agreed to go because I believed that he was no longer interested in me. We have also known each other since about elementary school.\n\nThe day before we meet up, he tells me that his friends had plans come up that day and could no longer go. I still agreed to go, since I didn't have plans that day anyway.\n\nOnce I get to the restaurant we agreed to meet up at, he offers to pay for my food. I insist that I pay for my own food, but he pays anyway.  We then sit down, eat, and catch up on what has been going on in our lives. The conversation is relaxed as usual, however, I started to question what his intentions were after he paid for my food. After we finish eating, I suggest that we go to his house because we had been talking about playing games with his family.\n\nAt his house, we play games and continue to talk. He and I were sitting next to each other relatively close because his room was quite small. He suddenly asks me if he can put his arm around me. At first, I was relieved that he asked, but then I started to panic. I didn't know what to do, so I irrationally blurt out, \"Actually, I'm gay. Sorry!\" \n\nHe is obviously confused, and I tell him that I didn't want to tell anyone as I didn't feel ready yet. He was completely understanding. I then tell his brother, whom I am close to as well, that I am gay. They both tell me that I have no reason to apologize for my sexuality. I thank them, and we all continue on with our day.\n\nI want to further explain why saying \"I'm gay\" was the first thing that came to my mind. I really didn't want to reject him because in my experience, after rejection, I start to blame myself for not being good enough for that person. This guy is extremely kind and there is no specific reason why I didn't have interest in him. I just really didn't want him to pick himself apart because he thought he wasn't good enough; he is perfectly fine the way he is. If he found out the reason he was rejected was out of his control, he wouldn't feel bad.\n\nOf course, it was not okay of me to lie about serious matters such as sexuality, but it happened quickly, and I felt pressured at that moment. My intentions were not to hurt him, since he's an incredibly good friend of mine. \n\nAm I the asshole for rejecting him by saying that I'm gay because I don't want him to beat himself up over it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Title sounds bad, but let me explain. I (19M) was at a party and my friend (Jacob) and his girlfriend were there. This was the first time I met his girlfriend. Another friend brought some molly for a few of us, this was our first time trying it but we were with a couple people who had done it before. Molly makes you very happy and confident and makes you very affectionate towards people. Jacob, his girlfriend, me and 3 others all took some. We were all talking and it came up how we each lost our virginity. I told them that I was still a virgin and that I had never had a first kiss. Jacob's girlfriend offered to give me my first kiss and I said \"no I couldn't do that to Jacob\" (who was in this conversation). He said it was fine if I wanted to since it didn't mean anything, so we started making out. Jacob saw the whole thing and kind of congratulated me afterwards.\n\nThe next day I was talking to Jacob about the party and said it was funny how I kissed his girlfriend. He had clearly forgotten about it until now and got annoyed. He told me I shouldn't of kissed her and the only reason he said it was okay was because of the molly and alcohol. I said that me and his girlfriend were also on the same drugs as him so he couldn't really blame us if that was his excuse for allowing it. He said it is different and we shouldn't of actually gone through with it even if he did say it was okay.\n\nAITA for kissing his girlfriend?",

      "description": "I am in a band with some friends and as far as I can tell, 3/5 of us take it seriously, with one other (our bassist) being seemingly a bit less committed and the last (our drummer) who is probably the least committed. \n\nWe all seem to enjoy it and at least say we want the band to go somewhere. However, recently we were invited to perform in front of a small but sizeable audience. The 3/5 of us who took it seriously saw this as an opportunity to show what we could do, and although we had 4 weeks to be prepared, we were confident we could pull it off, plus, even our band tutor who teaches us has told us that he thinks we could perform well. This is where it gets complicated.\n\nOur drummer, the person who has been most frustrated with the band not going anywhere, has a habit of not turning up to rehearsals, almost always without any explanation, hence why they are considered the least committed member. \n\nAs the lead singer of our group announced to us all that we would have a shot at performing, our bass player said that she thought that we shouldn't perform as we were not ready and needed more time. She also brought up that she was not quite ready to be on stage in front of that many people, which I understand, but we are getting tutoring from our mentor about stage presence and performing comfortably and such. Also, i'd also argue that being on stage is the only way to get better at it.\n\nBeing someone who had done numerous types of performances before, I completely understand the worry of a performance being 4 weeks away, BUT we had all been playing with each other for over half a year and were all confident in our ability among each other.\n\nOur drummer agreed with our bassist, despite being the one that was always itching to perform. What infuriates me is that she is the one that says the band will not go anywhere, and she is correct if she continues to NOT SHOW UP. \n\nPeople who know how bands work will know that we need everyone on board for something like this. Whether our drummer and/or bassist will leave or just not perform with the rest of us, I have no idea, but we have backup people ready if they decide to not to show.\n\nI can understand our bassist point of view, I really can. But our drummer?? SHE is the one who wanted the band to go somewhere and now that it has she doesn't want it. Am I in the wrong for wanting to replace her?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Drummer and bassist back out of performance opportunity despite wanting it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It was awful and she wasn't doing very well even though I reassured her everyday that she wasn't pregnant because I was absolutely sure there was no way it could have happened. It was just a late period. She refused to take a pregnancy test which could have solved things a lot earlier but I digress. Today her period finally came and everything is fine and she was so happy. She asked me what I would've done if she was pregnant and I said I didn't know. She kept pressing me and I just kept telling her I don't know because I truly don't. She asked if I would break up with her in a kind of joking manner and I assured her that would absolutely not happen but I don't know what beyond that. She even said \"then think of something quick\" and that kind of put me off so I reiterated that I truly don't know what I would do. We're 20 years old. I really truly have absolutely no idea what I would do if she ended up pregnant. For some reason this really pissed her off and she's been upset for the last hour. From my point of view, I feel like there was absolutely no reason to delve into such a serious hypothetical and that we should've just been happy and thankful for the weight being lifted off our shoulders.

      "description": "\nShe has been coming every other week for almost 3 years. She is like part of our family. The whole thing is pretty devastating. A few months ago my wife asked me if I had taken $200 cash from an envelope in her desk drawer. I didn't take it. She figured that maybe she had just miscounted at some point. Then a month ago another $200 cash went missing. My wife was convinced that it was our house mates boyfriend but I didn't think it was his style at all. Last week we bought a new fancy baby monitor that runs through the wifi and uses a phone app to view and record video. I put money in a drawer within view of the camera which records whenever there is motion. That was a week ago. Today I get this frantic text from my wife asking me if I took any of the money because there was $100 bill missing. That was around 5pm. We reviewed the video clips and our cleaner actually went into the drawer 2 times today and took $100 each time. When went to my mother-in-laws' house, (cleaner works there too) we found out that old silver coins were missing and some valuable diamond jewelry. \nWe have adored this lady. Our son loves her. She has done great for us. Now I'm just concerned for all of the other people she works for, some of our friends and others I don't know. \nShe is also an illegal who has been here for 30 years with 4 grown kids. \nI could confront her, try to get our money and stuff back, maybe call all her clients to let them know. Or I could just let the police handle it. We don't want to ruin her life but maybe she already has. I just don't know \n",

      "description": "Okay, okay. Maybe that's a bit of an extreme title but it is what I said. Here's what happened:\n\nI'm a 15 year old who lives with his dad. My mom has been gone for years but I do see her sometimes still. What happened moments ago was I asked my dad for space and to fuck off. Recently, I've been fed up with him and even having multiple breakdowns in private. He would burst into my room at random times just to tell me things I did wrong earlier. It ranges from minor stuff like accidentally leaving grains of rice on the table to being on the computer for too long at a time (which in itself is reasonable) but this is where things take a turn. What usually ends up happening is whatever he says spirals out of control into how my grades are fluctuating to me rotting my brain to the internet and even how the internet is my only God (which isn't true at all). Today was different. He was asking about why I was missing period 3 of school today. I explained to him that I had a business club meeting (ironic since I hate big businesses and their bullshit but this isn't a communist manifesto) during lunch. The meeting ended about 10 minutes before 3rd period bell rang so I hurried over to Subway, got food and came back. Unfortunately, I ended up being about 5 minutes late. I have a feeling my teacher had me marked absent and forgot to change it back since he was teaching about drill press safety when I returned so I guess I'll ask him to correct it tomorrow. You'd think he'd accept that explanation. And you'd be damn wrong. He went off on how I should have gone to the school cafeteria even though I made it clear I wouldn't go there since it's overpriced and won't fill me up but he wasn't having any of it. He goes onto say a bunch of random shit that I didn't hear as I had my earphones on. It happens so often that it's what I do. He then proceeded to rip off my earphones and tells me that I'm a selfish, self-centered person who is incapable of taking criticism. I actually had it at that point because there was literally no reason to say that. I dedicate a lot of my time to events around Toronto (not just because it's a diploma requirement but because I actually enjoy it). It was just very insulting to me so I went off. I told him how he was an asshole who didn't have the capacity to listen to anything I said (The best example of that being that I never ate in the mornings until I was placed on meds that helped cut stomach acid. He always said it was because my sleep schedule was bad and I was always on my phone. I told him it was because I was always nauseous in the morning. The doctor debunked my dad's BS on a visit days ago and said I had stomach reflexes at night which caused acid issues or something along those lines. After it was prescribed to me, he asked why I never tell him these things even things and pointed this out. He told me not to fight with him in public.), told him he had nothing better to do than bother me. We had a few exchanges, mostly him taunting me into hitting him (I have anger issues and have lashed out before at other people when they've really pissed me off). I finally told him to fuck off and give me space. He called me an asshole for swearing at him (In his words: \"How could you swear at your own father?\" and referred to a bible verse). I gave him the middle finger and he tried to hit me until I had to push him out of my door, yell at him to fuck off and not to annoy me for once. He walked away after 5 minutes of that byt not ve called me an asshole. \n\nNow, since he called me an asshole I had to ask if I truly was being one. My behaviour was pretty bad but I need to know. Also, I apologize for my repetition of certain words and general untidyness.\n\ntl;dr: I got fed up with him because he called me self-centered and selfish as well as always coming into my room for no reason and asked for space. And to fuck off of course.",

      "description": "My in-laws are crazy about their dogs. They all have big dogs who all jump and nip at hands when you arrive at their houses. I was uncomfortable with them before I got pregnant, then they badly bruised my thighs from jumping and scratching when I was pregnant. I was told when my son was born that the largest dog does not like anything to be carried infront of him, he feels threatened. \n\nSince my son arrived, they have kept their dogs locked up for our visits, for the most part and this is on their own accord. A few weeks back, the largest dog was let out in the backyard and managed to scratch my son whilst my mother in law was playing on the grass with him. There have been several other occasions where they have allowed the dogs to lick my son and get excited over him. I am very uncomfortable with dogs licking in general. \n\nMy son gets babysat by my in-laws once a week whilst I'm at work. I am quite upset that they have been introducing my son to these dogs without even speaking to me or my partner. My partner is not overly fazed by these dogs, even though he knows them as little as I do. He thinks I'm overreacting and thinks I'm just scared as they are of the Bully breed. He just tells me to relax because they're known to be good around children. My issue is the sheer weight and nipping from the dogs. \n\nI myself have a dog who has never caused a fuss over the baby, but I still don't trust my dog around my child. I was bitten as a child and I am just so uncomfortable around my in law's dogs in general. \n\nI told them I am uncomfortable with the situation and they said that the dogs are actually really big softies and wouldn't hurt children ",

      "description": "So, this just literally happens moments ago. Backstory: I am living in another country with my relatives and so know little of them relative to their friends. My female cousin (FC) who's about the same age as me was growing her hair for donation but I didn't know when she would do it.\n\nSo, I was about to go shower when I noticed FC had returned home from her work and I, for a split second, thought she was another person because I'm so used to her long hair. I also noticed that her shoulders seemed broader because of her shorter hair but I didn't think literally anything of it. So I just say hi and go shower.\n\nAfter my shower, I asked FC if she had a regular haircut or if she donated her hair. She said that she donated her hair. Then I accidentally blurted out that her shoulders seemed broader because of her shorter hair. Now I didn't think of it as a compliment, a sarcastic comment or a critic, just something I saw earlier and just said it like that without anything in mind.\n\nCue a few seconds of silence. She then asked if that was a compliment. Taken a bit aback and I stuttered a bit, saying : \"Err..I'm sorry..if you..didn't take it as one.\" Another few seconds of silence before she said \"oookay\" with kinda a disgusted look on her face now that I think about it.\n\n Thinking nothing of it, I went back to my room, then went to fill my water bottle.  The kitchen is next to the dining table with no walls or door, you get the picture. My aunt (A) was in the kitchen with her other daughter (FC2) on the kitchen bench with an old photo while FC was near the sink. So I take the long way around to look at the photo and FC just angrily told me that she didn't appreciate what I said earlier (her shoulders seeming broader) and that she was offended, her face matching her emotions, basically being upset. Now I say that I'm sorry if that offended her while A and FC2 just stares in disbelief, or stand still, shocked at the situation.\n\nI try to deescalate the situation, saying that I'm sorry if that offended her, but to no avail and FC goes back to her room pissed. A enquires about the situation and basically gets lectured by her and a bit by FC2. I truly am sorry, don't get me wrong. I'm used to basically get in trouble for mostly anything I say but I was surprised by this and I feel like FC overreacted.\n\nSo, here's my question: Am I in the wong here? I know FC had the right to be upset but did she overreacted to what I said?",

      "description": "I am in a class in university that consists of only juniors and seniors. In this class, I sit in the second row all the way to the left. It being a higher level class that doesn't always take attendance, many people decide not to show up to class, so there are often empty seats around me. However, I always sit next to my friend and there is always someone sitting in front of me.\n\nAn assignment for the class is to write an Op-Ed, basically a short opinionated article. As part of the assignment, everyone in the class was randomly assigned two others to peer review their article.\n\nOf the two I was assigned, one was pretty good. They had a few grammatical errors and their points were a little confusing at times, but overall decent. I also didn't know too much about their topic to begin with.\n\nThe second one I reviewed was a train wreck at best. There were so many grammatical errors that I couldn't even read through the paper once without having to make corrections. Their sentence structure was so bad that I had to stop and try to parce out what it was supposed to say. I also knew a lot about this topic since I had written a paper on it a semester ago. They had the basic idea about the topic, but they left out a huge part of it that was really important to their point they were making.  All of that I left in my review that had my name attached to it online, but I didn't know who the person really was.\n\nAs class was ending the other day, my friend and I's conversation drifted to the Op-Eds that we had reviewed as people were packing up to leave. It turns out that he had looked at the first one I reviewed for fun and he had liked it as well. The other one he reviewed had some issues, but was ok overall. I told him about the topic that my second reviewed Op-Ed was about and what the person had left out. I reffered to the grammatical errors and bad sentence structure as a \"hot mess\" as I complained.\n\nI started to hear someone near me saying \"hey\" to get my attention and I looked up at the person who sat right in front of me. They informed me that I was talking about their paper and then walked away. My friend and I got real quiet and he gave me a 'you really screwed up now' face. I said that I stand by what I said, since basically all the things I mentioned were in my review online that had my name attached to it anyway.\n\nNow I'm not sure if I should feel bad about trash talking someone's paper and them calling me out for it.",

We rent a home currently and have been trying to save for our own home. I asked my father if we could use the refunded money towards a down payment on a house and use the voucher for the honeymoon cruise.

      "description": "My mother has had ALS for 15 years, and most of the care for her was done by me and my dad. Recently, however, my dad was arrested for abuse and he has completely left our household. We had a hard time with that whole ordeal but now we have quality care for her where all I do now is having to be in the house during sleeping hours so she doesn't suffocate in her sleep or anything. This also means that I put her to bed every night with the exception of when I go out and ask a caregiver to do it. Every night I put her to bed (around 10:15 PM) we always talk about something, usually about my college and work. Over the years it has usually been fine, because before I got a job I was fine with five hours of sleep at night before I went to school. Now though there doesn't seem to be anything worth talking about right at night time that we cant talk about any other time, and I really value my sleep especially since I have sleeping issues. Now I end up trying to get out of our conversation so I can go to bed but she always calls me back and tries to bring the subject back up and I get heated. The most recent discussion I tried to get out of I tried talking about my dad leaving and how if we don't have a stable way to take care of her for the long term, she would have to go to a home. This wasn't anything new and it was a branch from me talking about the good things my dad did for her, because she thought he didn't do anything good for us. I just don't know what the right call is to make because I don't want to talk to her at night time. I honestly just want to sleep but she always gets on me about things that I don't want to talk about like my relationships and what I talk to my friends about. I end up arguing with her almost every night and she ends up crying most of the time, but I don't feel bad for it because I feel like I should be able to talk to my mom about how I feel about things.

      "description": "1st time poster, sorry for being anxious/any mobile format issues.\n\nI’m a short woman who is terrified of big dogs due to bad experiences as a kid. Most ppl see a big dog &amp; go “good boy who’s a good boy!!” &amp; my instinct is to run.\n\nThere’s a new dog in my neighborhood. Idk breed/gender but it’s big, black, shorthaired, floppy ears. 2 weeks ago we were walking in our neighborhood, &amp; we were still in front of our house when a dog we hadn’t seen before runs out of our neighbor’s garage (not the neighbor who owns the dog. The dog was in someone else’s garage) at us. Not aggressive, but clearly untrained bc we were telling it “no” repeatedly &amp; it still was jumping on us. No leash, no owner around, not listening to commands. I ran but my mom grabbed me bc she knew that would make it worse. The dog is my height when on hind legs, putting its paws on my shoulder. It licked my eye, knocking my sunglasses off. I didnt realize it had done that til later bc I was so shaken up. It’s hard to convey written down how scary it is to have a dog your height jump on you. My eye hurt alot after. We later returned to the spot to find them on the gravel broken. I had to buy a new pair and they’re not cheap, $14.\n\nWe didn’t walk for days. When we felt safe we went, &amp; we passed by the house who owned the dog. It’s a young couple. They were right there in their yard w the dog &amp; it still ran right at us. I obv got scared, trying to cover my face so it wouldnt jump on me, &amp; we were shouting NO to no avail. It came back a 2nd time bc the owners couldn’t get it to stop. My mom got mad &amp; yelled at them that they can’t let this dog run around the neighborhood unleashed &amp; that it knocked my glasses off. The woman just said sorry a couple times but the man kept playing w the dog.\n\nThen last night happened. We have stopped walking in the neighborhood &amp; instead play badminton in our driveway. We were having fun when I look behind me &amp; I see that dog charging me again IN OUR DRIVEWAY. I shouldn’t have done this but I’m so scared of this dog that I dropped my racket and BOOKED IT for our house. I didn’t look back, just ran as fast as I could. My mom stayed outside yelling NO and STOP at it. In my rush to get tf inside it took me a min to realize I had cut my arm on some cut open rusty metal on our car (from a minor crash). Today I went to urgent care to get a tetanus shot which was $30.\n\nHere’s where I ask AITA for how I want to handle this. The dog is not aggressive but it chases/jumps on you &amp; doesnt listen to commands. Even if friendly it SHOULD NOT be running free w no supervision/leash, especially untrained. The owners don’t seem like total assholes, but this is the South &amp; tbh I’m scared they may have a gun. They are breaking the law and could be issued a warning &amp; then a citation. I also want to ask them to pay for my broken glasses &amp; tetanus shot. WIBTA for doing this? ",

I'm allergic to cats.\n\nMy fiancee and me can afford only one car, that she drives because her work is on the other side of town (and in the opposite direction of mine). I take rides with my neighbor that works on the same company as me.\n\nLet me just make it completely clear: I love cats, but I'm also allergic to them, I can't stop sneezing and my head hurts like hell for an hour or more after dealing with a feline.\n\nAnyway, I'm not exactly friends with this guy, we just see eachother at work and when occasionally run at the other at the local market. But he takes his cat everywhere, I seen he and the cat at parks, the cat waiting him at the car while he shops...\nI don't want to be a burden, I hoped he would do something by seeing me sneeze every day for months now.\n\nI think it would be a dick move to ask this, since I could just take the public transportation (adding an hour to my daily commute), but my friends and fiancee think I should just talk to him.",

      "description": "So I understand that not every person on the street asking for help is a fraud. Some people are indeed struggling in life and could use a helping hand. But in the news I've seen plenty of cases where people who aren't struggling spend the day asking people for money only to be seen driving away in a nice new car at the end of the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to avoid giving money to a potential frauds posing as a homeless/struggling person I thought what If I start questioning these people asking them what their story is. Like \"why are you struggling, do you work, why aren't you trying to find a job instead of relying on people to be generous, etc\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've even thought about wanting to tell panhandlers I'll consider helping them out if they show me their I.D. My theory is that people who have nothing to hide and really are going through a hard time in life would have no problem showing me their id if it meant they could get any sort of help. Someone who isn't comfortable showing me their I.D probably has something to hide like an arrest warrant or they don't want me to know their names because they might just be frauds who wish to remain anonymous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf they do seem like legit non frauds who showed me their I.D and answered all my questions about their struggle story genuinely, I was also thinking to make them do something small for me to further test if their willing to work for my help. For example simply cleaning off my windshield and windows with a rag and spray bottle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah all in all WIBTA if I made panhandlers go through those hoops to earn my help, questioning them, asking for their I.D and making them do a small job? All this to see if they aren't frauds and to see if their willing to work to get out of their situation, or if they just want free handouts for not doing anything.",

      "description": "4 months ago my ex broke up with me and left the country.  She left behind most of her belongings, her two cats, and left me to pay the full amount of the rent.  Well the lease is about to be up, and I'm moving to a new place.  She is now claiming that I owe her half of the deposit, and I have to pay to send her cats and belongings back home.  She's 6000 miles away from me, and this would cost A LOT of money, around 2K give or take.  She's now claiming that I'm \"holding her stuff hostage\".  AITA for not wanting to give her half of the security deposit. Our rent is $800 which I will be paying 6 months of full rent without her, getting a roommate in this tiny apartment is next to impossible with two cats. Deposit is $1000 by way (meaning I paid 500 and she paid 500).     \n\n\nI have agreed to send her all of her things, and her cats as long as she pays for it.  I've even agreed to set up all the paperwork and transportation for sending two cats out of country.   \n\n\nWe just got off a text exchange and she called me every name in the book.  I'm really really trying to be a good guy and be fair.  But she just keeps claiming that it's my responsibility to pay her the deposit and spend my own money to send her things back.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here.  AITA???  \n\n\nINB4: No I never cheated on her, No I never harmed a hair on her head, No I didn't abuse her.  She was just extremely homesick we both visited our friends and family back home one vacation and she decided to stay.    ",

      "description": "Okay context.\nI bought my own PS4 for christkas last year and added my own info and ganes to it, as such it was was the third PS4 in my house it was connected to the living room TV as I patiently wait for my room to have my very own TV\n\nI got to have the Spider-man PS4 game and played it non-stop and had to pause in very important moments to play another time.\n\nOne of those times my nephew came to visit and his mom asked if he could get to play, I hesitated for a moment but said no and continued the gane for a few hours, I went up to my room to do my thing and draw as I waited for food\n\nWhen I came down I came to see my nephew playing the game even though I told him no, I turned off the ps4 and luckily he didn't mess anything up but I was still pissed off, I then got into an argument with my family where they called me selfish for not letting him play, even my dad said how the ps4 was his because he used his money, even though he got it for me as a gift and has been my position for a whole year.\n\nA few days passed and we cut to yesterday where i was on my way to play the PS4 after I was cleaning up my room and greet my family as they came to visit again, but then I heard the PS4 turn on and the intro to the games plays very loudly, I ran down as fast as I could and told him to turn it off because nobody asked me in the first place, I told them no and left the room very angry so I should cool off by taking a shower, but as soon as had a towel around me I heard them start playing again even though k said no.\n\nI ran down with a towel around me yelling at them to turn off the PS4 very angry this time that they didn't listen to me at all, my cousin ended up turning it off and I got to take a shower even more mad than before, I went downstairs to eatmy dinner and my nephews come in asking to play with the game, being pissed off and salty I told them no. Another one of my cousin just comes in and said \"you should share, mama..\"\n\nLike I'm sorry, I would've loved to share but they used my stuff without asking me in the first place twice even when I told them no and I didn't want to mess up my game regardless, then when I was in the middle of eating dinner I heard them turn on my PS4 again even when I told them no, I had enough at this point and I stormed over taking the controllers and hiding them in my room along with putting a password on my account so that way they can't get in.\n\nEarlier today I was telling my dad about it and then outcomes another huge argument where he said that I was being \"stingy\" and \"petty\" and I should automatically share it to him because he's family, I snapped at him telling him that I don't care that he was family or not, he used MY STUFF without asking and I had to lay out boundries and even told him how there were two more PS4 in the house that belonged to my brothers, meaning that if I said no, they shouldn't be throwing a hissy fit and instead ask on of my brother's instead of pestering me even though I said no thousands of times.\n\nMy family still thought I being selfish but am I really in this situation.\n\nTL;DR: I unplugged my PS4 because of my nephews refusing to listen to my boundaries",

      "description": "I’ve always had a seriously strained relationship with my mom’s family. Specifically, my moms parents. They were always high on something and always causing unnecessary trouble and drama to anyone they interact with. I’d get into it, but it’s too much to list when it isn’t directly related to the decision to cut them out of my life. \n\nWhen my parents split up, my mom, brother and I moved in to their house. This house now housed my family, my grandparents and my aunt, her husband and 2 kids (they lived in the basement apartment, this is relevant). As soon as I graduated high school, I left the first opportunity that was presented and ended up moving a few thousand miles away and was doing really good for myself. I didn’t check up on anyone much, and was living my own life until my brother called about a problem he was having and asking me for money to get a hotel room. Why did he need money for a hotel room?\n\nWell, a few months before, my brother and my aunt got into an argument about my dad and his addiction problem. They were talking down about my dad right to my brother. My dad didn’t even live there. He couldn’t defend himself, so my brother did. My aunt was also constantly doing drugs, and didn’t like that being brought up and went off the deep end. She went to the police station and filed a protection order against my brother for verbally threatening her, spitting in her face and being a danger to her and her family. Everyone in this house knows it was a lie.  This stopped nothing. When the issue went to court, my grandparents backed my aunts lie and the courts ruled in her favor. My grandparents kicked out my 17 year old brother. My brother brother then moved in with my dad. My dad lived in a tent on a campground.\n\nI have not talked to anyone from my moms immediate family since then. My brother, who is now in his 20s, will go over for holidays and act casual with them, but that’s about it. He keeps to himself for the most part. He doesn’t believe i should be keeping my kids from them, however doesn’t blame me for wanting them out of my life. He’s mentioned our grandparents have since apologized and made amends. My mom is a people pleaser and is trying to keep the peace between everyone even if it goes against what i want with my children. She’ll come visit and bring gifts from them, telling them who it’s from and sending pictures back to her parents. I assume she’s let her parents FaceTime/call them while she’s been alone with them, but has neither confirmed nor denied doing so. I get the sending of pictures, but i feel like anything more than that is just blatant disrespect towards me and has not been allowed to be alone with the kids since. \n\nI’m no longer angry about the situation. It’s been awhile and I’ve gotten over most of the angry feelings i had about it. I don’t feel like it’s a grudge I’m holding, just a decision of who I want in or, in this case, out our lives. That being said, now i have a family of my own and want them no where near any of these people. If they could make their grandchild homeless, i don’t want to think about what they’d do to my kids. Everyone else believes that whenever I am back home, I should make time for these people and let them visit us since “everyone else has moved passed this,” and “we need to forgive and get the hate out of your heart.” Because i won’t budge and don’t want my kids even meeting these people, AITA here?

      "description": "I apologize in advance if this is all over the place, I'm writing this as fast as I can between errands.\n\nMy dad and I have never had what one would call a healthy relationship. I am 28 and he is 52 and, for as long as I can remember, he has been a liar and a total dick. He and my mom divorced when I was 11 after he had a psychotic break and refused to get help for his bipolar disorder. He was verbally and emotionally abusive and it's been a big effort to stay in contact with him as long as I have. It became even harder after my mom told me he ruined her reputation by spreading the rumor that they'd divorced because he caught her cheating on him, which is not true.   \n\n\nMy dad made living with him difficult, but living apart from him is almost like a punishment. He will go weeks to months without contacting me or my older sister (his ex step-daughter) despite attempts to reach him, but complain about how we never make time for him. He claims to have a six figure salary on top of his wife's salary, but is always in some state of financial distress. He is unreliable and often says he will show up and never does or shows up with no warning and expects us to cancel any plans we may have. He lavishes money on his step-daughters and cares for their children, including raising one of his step-daughter's kids while she was in rehab for meth, but has not once called to even speak to my two kids, his biological grandchildren, and only sees them once or twice a year. He is abusive to his grandchildren that live with him, hitting them and yelling at them. The most hurtful thing to me, personally, is his refusal to accept me as I am. I am transgender and have been out for years but he has made it clear that he will never use the right pronouns or call me by my chosen name (which has been my legal name for quite some time, going so far as to refuse to put it on things like money orders or checks, forcing me to bring my name change forms and out myself every time. My mother tells me all the time that I should forgive him and just try to bear it because he is my father, but I am very tired of dealing with him flitting in and out of our lives and having no respect for me or my feelings.  \n\n\nSo here is the meat of the matter: my dad is 52 and has had, to date, 4 heart attacks that I know about and a stroke. He had surgery a couple years ago that he said was to remove a benign tumor from his stomach, but we're all pretty sure that was a lie and he has gastric bypass. He may have had more health issues, but he does not call when they happen nor does his wife, so it's possible that I have been kept in the dark about other things as I was with 3 of his heart attacks. But, my dad claims to have a $300,000 life insurance policy with me as the sole beneficiary. And a very, very big part of me wishes that he would go ahead and die so I could collect it and move on with my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family has fallen on some very hard times. We moved into a new city after I got a job, but I was unexpectedly laid off and have been unable to find stable work that pays enough and now we can barely afford to make ends meet. Every small inconvenience is a financial disaster for us. Our credit has plummeted, our credit cards have been charged off, and my partner works his ass off to keep up afloat. We make \\*just\\* enough to be disqualified from most assistance programs and we have nowhere to turn for help. That kind of money would really help us get back on our feet. We would be able to breathe easier, fix our vehicle, pay off our debts, even buy Christmas and birthday gifts for our kids. If you've ever been poor, you know the difference money like that could make in a family's life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it's harsh to wish that my father would die. The policy could be another one of his lies. But, even if it was, I would still want him to die. A permanent end to dealing with him would be a relief, honestly, and I feel like I could finally get on with my life without feeling guilty or stressed out about him. In my mind, he's basically already dead anyway and I'm just being haunted by his bullshit. So, AITA here? I'm willing to accept that I am. I don't think it would change the way I feel, but it would be nice to know what others think.",

      "description": "My classmate texted me a week ago asking if he could pay me to write an essay for our class. His chosen topic on the subject was different than mine but I’m sure the professor would’ve noticed similar writing styles. Plus he offered $10 to do it and it is more than $10 of work.\n\nI will say he has become more than just my classmate but a friend of mine so I felt bad doing this. I know he’s got a lot on his plate working two jobs and going to school full-time. He does not have any financial support from his family (single mom who is abusive) so he lives on his own paycheck to paycheck.\n\nI empathize with his situation but it angered me to no end that he would do that and I asked him if he has done it before. He said only a few times when he doesn’t have the time because he’s scheduled too much at work and can not afford to lose his job. Still no excuse. Why should he get great marks on an essay he didn’t even write? I put a lot of time into mine and still don’t even have as good of grades as him. It is not only illegal but it’s just an insult to all of us who are actually working hard for our degrees.\n\nSo I showed the professor the texts he sent me and he was kicked out of the course, may be facing expulsion. I was very honest with him that I showed the professor our texts with him asking me to plagiarize for him. He’s very upset with me saying I ruined his chance of giving himself a better life than what he grew up with and that he’s hurt a friend would snitch on him like that. AITA?",

      "description": " To be honest, I really don’t know how to title this one without giving the whole story away so here it goes. My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) rent a house together in a nice town by the ocean. We have an great landlord that can sometimes be weird but otherwise he is a good guy. The other day I was home alone, smoking some weed and cleaning around the house. There was a knock and doorbell ring at the door, so obviously I go to answer it (and spray some febreze first lol). Random guy says “Hello I’m so and so from a local solar panel company and I was wondering if I could come in and take a look inside the house and the attic.” I glance behind him and I don’t see a car with any solar panel company logo. I say something along the lines of no, I wasn’t informed by my landlord that anyone would be stopping by so I’m sorry but have a good day. He insisted. He said something like please I’m supposed to do this, are you sure he isn’t here etc. etc. I again say no, told him to call my landlord then and proceeded to shut the door. That was that, stranger saunters off. \n\n Later on that day, landlord stops by and is kind of annoyed with me. Landlord says“ that guy drove two hours to come here and you just sent him off like that. You should buy him a six pack or something to say sorry!” He kept going on about it. I told him next time someone is stopping by to inform me because I will never let a stranger in the house regardless if I am alone or not. \n\n Also, I did not mention this is not the first time he has sent someone by without informing me and I have shut the door in their face. I don’t believe I am in the wrong here but I also am hyper aware of crimes/rapes/murders that have happened because of situations like this. I am not sure if I’m being overly cautious because of all of the terrible shit I read and if I’m the asshole here and owe some people apologies. ",

      "title": "AITA For wanting my dad to send me the $100 I'm entitled to?",
      "description": "So a little bit of back story, I currently live with my mum after living with my dad for the first 14 years of my life, and because of the custody battle my dad made me go through just to live with mum, my relationship with him has definitely dwindled quite a bit. I am also living away from home as I am attending the school for the deaf (I'm not completely deaf, moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears.) Both my mum and dad agreed on this plan - Mum puts $50 on my school trust account, and Dad puts $50 into my bank account.\n\nOkay so here is how this all began. Around the middle of February I had gotten a text from my dad asking if he could not send me the money this week because he and my older brother needed haircuts, this did confuse me quite a bit because my older brother has his own money from baby sitting a lot from time to time. \n\nA week later I then got a message from my dad again saying that he found something that would make him a \"millonaire\" and that he was coming to the city I'm in to check it out. That alone would be an eight hours drive. I had gotten excited because I thought that maybe.. just maybe he was using it as an excuse to see me. It wasn't.\n\nHe's  there by the next afternoon and I was asked if I wanted to go with him to the University here, I had said yes. On the way there, he said, without asking, that he was going to be withholding another weeks money from me. Quite frankly I was pissed but could't do anything about it. I only got to see him twice during the day and a half he was here, even though he was just less than a 100 meters away from me as he wanted a free room for the night. Convenient they have flats here for visiting parents.\n\nThe day he left I would actually be flying back home to mum, I had called her on the Thursday night to have a heart-to-heart talk with her so she already knew what had happened. She was going to confront dad but I had asked her to delay it until I came back up here. During the weekend I was back home, I went up to my dad's house for dinner to see my Granddad, by the end of the dinner, I had asked my dad if he was actually going to send me the money, and followed up with a \"I'll be fine with you just sending me $75 for  two weeks.\" All he said in return is $50 is a lot of money for someone who is unemployed.\n\nIt's been nearly two weeks now and it still annoys me quite a bit, so I've pretty much had to sic my mum onto him, as it is very unfair for me and for mum.\n\nTo make this clear before anyone asks (if anyone does.) You can't get a job while being a student here as its dangerous because of our disabilities, which is completely understandable. We also usually have a lot of after school activities that we do so that's another factor of it.\n\nTL;DR  Dad avoids paying me so I can get basic necessities for two weeks, offered for him to only pay $50, shot down and I was told \"it's a lot\" for someone my age.",

      "description": "So I’m getting married, yay! But with weddings there always comes tough decisions and drama. I have 3 sisters, 2 of which I am close to and will definitely be in the bridal party along with 2 cousins I’m close with.\n\nSome background on my relationship with my third sister... it has never been good. All throughout my life I’ve been belittled, disrespected, and bullied by her. I’m the youngest sister so I was her go-to punching bag all throughout our childhood. She had a bad temper, and would physically and verbally abuse me, without ever offering any apologies. In our teenage years she would spread rumors about me to friends and extended family and always make jokes at my expense, to make herself look better. Our relationship as adults is just straight up hostile and it’s clear we don’t like or respect each other, but we can be usually civil for family gatherings. I wouldn’t say I hold a grudge against her for my childhood, but it has definitely had long lasting effects and I don’t think we will ever be anything more than tolerable of each other.\n\nSO I could go on and on about my broken relationship with my sister but needless to say I DO NOT want her to be a bridesmaid in my wedding. It just doesn’t feel right to have her standing up there with me when we basically have no relationship. She also has some beef with my fiancé because he has spoken up for me in the past when she’s treated me poorly, so that’s another concern of mine.\n\nBut even with all of this, I still feel like the biggest asshole ever for not wanting her as a bridesmaid. She is my sister and although we don’t get along, I love her and I know how hurt she will be if she’s not included. Both of our sisters and all the other women in my family that are close in age with us will be my bridesmaids. She won’t be seated with any of our immediate family at the ceremony because they’ll all be standing at the alter with me. I also think if the roles were reversed and she was the one getting married, she would probably ask me to be her bridesmaid. It doesn’t seem like it from what I’ve written, but my sister does have her good moments and her happiness is important to me. I also know I’ll have backlash from my family for not including her... so I’m just so torn.\n\nGive it to me straight Reddit, WIBTA for not making my sister a bridesmaid?",

My uncle was the glue that held my family together after he died we kind of scattered to the wind. The family tries to keep it together by meeting up for holidays and some birthday and the rare \"just because\" weekend. \n\nThe problem is I either don't get invited or I get invited at the last minute and the fam gets pissy if I'm busy or tired. I also don't know about family members flying in until they show up at my door step.\n\nLast year I wanted to know what we were doing for Christmas (we never held it in the same place) and was told we were not going to celebrate so I took up a friends offer to celebrate with him and his family. Christmas day while I'm at the friends house I get a call from my mom. She and my sister are at my grandparents house. She's only calling to tell me that I'm rotten for not being there. When I ask why I was told we weren't going to celebrate this year, I get the same list of excuses.\n\n\"You're never doing anything so we figure we could just tell you and you would show up\"\n\nWrong. I'm usually tired on the weekday because I have a very labor intensive job. I would perk myself up if people would just tell me shit is going down. I always tell them when I would have free time, thinking that would make it easier to invite me but sadly no. \n\n\"We thought we told you.\"\n\nNope. They don't call, text or send me a damn pigeon. \n\n\"Well, we just forgot.\"\n\nYeah I can tell!\n\nThe shitty part is that when I want to make plans with my family it's like pulling teeth. I basically have to pay for everything before they will even consider doing anything with or for me. \n\nI don't know why but it's just me that they do this to. Even my cousin who has let my family know that she wants nothing to do with us gets invited to family events. I want to be close to my family but at this point I'm about to tell them all to eat dicks and fuck off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Backstory me and my ex dated for about 2 months never had sex or anything she completely randomly calls me crying says she cheated on me and we obviously then break up. Fast forward about 2 months and I match with her on a dating site again but on this dating site there's private pictures, here's the [convo] (https://imgur.com/a/cVF2N4V). Anyways she asks to see mine I don't care so I gave access but what I didn't know was her best friend was with her and she showed her best friend my nudes. Anyways bout a week goes by and her best friend completely randomly hits me up. We meet up etc end up banging then become fwb's for a couple months doing that pretty much everyday. This completely ruined my exes and her best friend's years long friendship and they completely stopped talking. I also matched with another one of her past friends more recently who wasn't that close with her anymore and had a similar thing happen where they hit me up first cause they knew of me through her and we ended up banging as well. It's not like I'm going after these girls as payback cause they're the one's who hit me up/messaged first they're cute and I don't see why I should have to respect my exes friendships lol. I really feel like I'm not the asshole here but my current girlfriend of about 6 months brings this up every time we get into an argument saying something like at least I'm not an asshole who bangs my exes best friend as payback. So I'm starting to doubt if I'm an asshole here or not and came here for some unbiased opinions haha.",

I’ve lived here for about 2 years now. This dude, not named Justin, moved in about six months ago. He’s okay. He’s kind of an asshole. Like nothing *bad*, just one of those people who thinks he’s better than everyone else kind of thing. \n\nAnyway, for the most part, he’s a decent roommate. He’s going out of town this weekend, and he said that one of his friends is going to be staying in his room from Friday at 10am when his flight gets here until about Saturday evening when his flight leaves. Justin told him where the spare key is so he can get in. Between work and school, none of us will be there Friday during the day, and there’s a good chance there won’t really be anyone there much of Saturday. \n\nThis doesn’t seem right to me. I don’t know this dude from Adam. Justin says he’s a good guy, but fuck if I know that. I’ve had my shit stolen from my best friends sister before back at home. Them’s the type of dudes that will rob you blind and then come over to help you find the shit you “lost.” \n\nAnyway, I told him I wasn’t cool with that. If Justin’s gonna be here, all good, but I’m not down with some guy crashing at my place by himself. Needless to say he wasn’t happy, asked me what’s his friend supposed to do. I basically told him to get an AirBnB or a hotel. He’s a grown ass man.\n\nI’m not gonna lie. I feel bad. This dude is from the Midwest suburbia, and I grew up on the streets, so maybe it’s just different experiences giving us different senses of security, but I think it’s unreasonable to ask me to round up all of my valuables and lock them in my room for a day, so your boy can save $50.

      "description": "I have a problem with my stomach that is basically really bad heartburn. I get it literally every day if I don't take my medication and there was a year when I could barely sleep because my stomach hurt so badly. My doctor told me to avoid tomatoes, peppers, anything spicy, anything fried, chocolate, fatty meats, and alcohol, among other things. If I eat a slice of pizza or even a mild curry, I feel sick.\n\nI am a college student and the dining hall was a bit of a challenge for me. More often than not, the entrees will have something I can't eat in them. During my freshman year, I lost 30 lbs (down to my middle school weight) and was just eating cereal for dinner many nights.\n\nI told the dining hall staff that I was having a hard time and they were super understanding and set up special meals for me. I appreciate it and try to request simple dishes that they can cook in a few minutes, like quesadillas or grilled tofu.\n\nI moved off campus and no longer technically need to be on a meal plan. I could cook at home, but I like eating with friends, so I bought a meal plan.\n\nThere aren't a lot of people who need special meals because our dining hall caters pretty well to vegetarian/vegan/kosher/gluten free/other normal dietary restrictions. As a result, a lot of my friends are jealous of me because I get to eat whatever I want and they have to eat whatever is on the menu. Some of them have entertained the idea of also asking for special meals with dietary restrictions (anything from \"I'm allergic to most meats\" to \"when I eat too many gingerbread cookies, I feel sick\"). I feel a little bit guilty because I essentially have a personal chef.\n\nAm I the asshole for either of the following reasons?\n\n1. I get to decide what I eat every day and my friends are at the whim of the dining hall\n2. I live off campus and could cook for myself\n\nTL;DR: I have a really good thing worked out with my college's dining hall because of my crappy stomach. Is it an unfairly good deal for me?",

      "title": "AITA for calling out a girl for being rude on her Birthday?",
      "description": "\nAlot of context is needed, myself and 16 others went on an exchange to Malaysia for a month through University. The girl in question, lets call her Sarah and the best way to describe her is 'stereotypical privileged white girl from Australia'. She wasn't that awful at first, but things started to go sour when I decided to go from Kuala Lumpur to Penang, the 16 of us had a group chat so often we'd put our plans in there incase others wanted to come. \n\nTurns out a fair few people wanted to go, as it was alot of peoples first time overseas I organized getting there and back and an Airbnb. We spent about 3 days there, however myself and two of my friends came down with food poisoning or something so they ended up spending time in the airbnb, skip to the last night in Penang the 7 of us that came went out to dinner as the two people who where sick ended up feeling better. Sarah started making snide comments about how stupid she thought it was to stay in an airbnb for the entire trip instead of exploring ect. Alice, one of the girls who was sick was quite upset at the comments.\n\nSo at this point myself and Alice are a bit wary of Sarah, even more so the next morning when we are leaving. Since I organized getting to Penang I had all the info for getting back. I made it super clear we should be ordering an uber by 8am that morning. Que next morning, Sarah and one of her friends decide that they would go get starbucks at 8:10 before heading to the bus station. This obviously annoys me and others as this was a university trip we did have a certain obligation not to leave anyone behind despite being all adults. I dont really say anything despite being annoyed and fortunately they made it just as we where boarding the bus.\n\nAt this point we are in week 2 of our trip, and the issues dont stop there. Those of us who noticed Sarah being rude just chalk it up to being in a stressful and new situation and try not to start an issues as we still have to deal with her for 2 weeks. I spend alot of time avoiding her, unfortunately she seems to pick on Alice quite a bit and this quite upsets her and me. I overhear Sarah gossiping about how 'I'm getting too involved' with organising things (like Penang), Sarah had been overseas multiple times as she quite often liked to bring up so she was a seasoned traveler. (She spent two weeks at Oxford University in the UK and managed to bring it up in every conversation, and according to her 'Melbourne has better coffee than Paris AND Italy'.\n\nSo que her birthday, all 16 of us are in Melacca with some people we met at Uni. It's her Birthday and she's made everyone aware and decided that we should all have dinner with her. Alice and I aren't thrilled about this, but since half of our group decided that they wouldn't we kind of felt bad. Initially I said I wasnt feeling well, so i went back to the hotel but when i heard that alot of people bailed i felt bad. Since the resturant they where at was close by I sent them a quick message saying order without me I'll be there in 10 minutes. I arrive and Sarah makes a scene about how I made them wait to order, and when I told her I actually I said order without me she still tried to attack me for it. Anyway the waiter makes a mistake with Alice's drink and Alice tries to explain it was wrong this confuses the waiter. Sarah makes snide comments about Alice ordering the wrong drink ect. Dinner is awkward but we make it through. That night we where planning to go out for drinks since our hotel had a really cool rooftop bar, but Sarah will be there. Alice and I decide to go anyway and just try and avoid her. We manage to find a nice secluded area, but unfortunately Sarah and one of her friends manage to find us and invite themselves into our conversation. \n\nSo her comes calling out. Alice is completely done with Sarah, but she's definitely more sensitive and emotional the some people. Sarah then asks me if I would like to go to the markets with her and her friend tomorrow. She asked only me, specifying my name multiple times I front of 5 others. Alice takes I quite personally and decides to leave with tears in her eyes. Alice and I had become really good friends throughout the trip, and so when Sarah asked if she was feeling sick again I decided I would say something. Keep in mind I think I did I rather civilly. I told her that her actions had been coming off quite badly to myself and others. I didnt call her a bitch or anything I really wanted to. Anyway she starts crying and I apologize for saying these things on her birthday but we had all been suffering. I left and went to talk to Alice. She messages Alice to talk to her and instead of apologizing she said, and I quote 'well I think you took those things so personally because you haven't traveled as much or have as much life experience as me'. (She is 22, lives with her parents and works one shift a week. She told us they contributed most of her funds for this trip).\n\nAnyway she never 'apologizes' to me and I didnt really mind. She avoided us for the rest of the trip.\n\nShort story: Am I an asshole for calling out a girl for being consistently rude to myself and others for 4 weeks on her birthday after she made someone nearly cry.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? I do kinda feel bad about doing it on her birthday but she really deserved it.",

She mentions another girl, let's call her Brenda, asking if I was interested in Brenda. I said no, but that I was interested in someone else, tho she wasn't as pretty as Brenda. (I felt the need to say this bec the last time I talked about another girl I was interested in with her, she immediately went and told me that the girl wasn't pretty). She then asks me if I think she's prettier, to which I answered honestly, saying no. \n\nThen she loses it. She tells me she hates me and that she didn't need that \"other girls are prettier than you\" bullshit. Especially from me.  I keep telling her that it wasn't my intention to push the idea that other girls were prettier, I was just answering her question. She continues being condescending by saying things like \"You of all people have the guts to tell me that?\" I tell her I never would have if she didn't ask.\n\nShe tells me she felt attacked. She felt objectified. (By my simple response to her question asking to be objectified in comparison to another woman) \n\nShe tells me to try not to be an asshole about those things and so I apologize because I felt that yeah it really offended her big time. She tells me not to push my luck and that I'm the only one she knows that would prolly tell that to a girl upfront.  \n\n\"Would you rather that I lied? Or was that a question not meant to be answered?\" I asked.\n\n\"I can't get over it.\"\n\n\"I dont tell anyone that \"other girls are prettier\" but you asked a very specific question abt my preference\"\n\n\"It still translates as that, to me.\"\n\n\"Well you read it wrong and that was not the intention at all.\"\n\nShe then says it was still an asshole move and it didn't matter what my intention was but how she perceived it. \n\n\"Doesn't the misreading count as a fault on your part?\" I say.\n\n \"Are you hearing yourself? Now we're counting faults?\"\n\n\"No, nvm.\" I say. \n\nShe responds to my previous message asking if she preferred that I lied or ignored the question completely. \n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\nTo which I no longer responded bec I've had enough at this point. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "My best friend Jen [F24] and I [M25] have known each other since middle school and then went to the same high school and university. Jen has become fully part of my family and I've become a part of hers. We go to family events and she's even good friends with my brother and sisters. I've always been relatively single and she's been dating a guy for a year. Jen used to be a fun \"party girl\" and I am more on the reserved side, but still love going out. We both have strenuous jobs in the legal field so we only go out about 2 weekends a month. A typical night used to included getting buzzed at a bar or nightclub, dancing, having a great time with other friends, and then mexican food at 3 am to close the night. The issue arose a couple months ago. There were times she couldn't go out due to her girlfriend duties and I'd go out with my guy friends. I didn't care that she couldn't go, I completely understand her boyfriend wants to go on dates. Jen and I talk and send memes constantly so it's not like I was missing her. I started to noticed that I'd get extra attention from women that I was NEVER getting when Jen was around. This occurred multiple times until I brought it up to my guy friends to see if they noticed anything different. Did I get better looking or richer in the last year? No. They told me that every time I'd go out with Jen we kind of looked like a couple. This made sense to me because we're very close and she's very affectionate (hugging my arm, resting her head on my shoulder, etc.). It understandable that women wouldn't approach me or feel uncomfortable if I approach them when they think I have a girlfriend. Now Jen, doesn't have many friends and has difficulty making new friends. To me this means 2 things: 1) She's not really introducing me to new social circles of women and 2) Whenever she wants to go out, I get the call, so either I go out or nothing happens. When I hang out with my guy friends, they bring their female friends, who in turn bring their female friends. I get to meet, sometimes start friends with benefits relationships, or even go on serious dates with new women. I've had tons of fun. Jen on the other hand has had a huge shift in the last 4 months. I don't get a \"let's go clubbing\" or \"let's go barhopping\" text. Now it's always \"let's go to lunch or dinner\", \"let's go to karaoke\", \"come to hang out with my family\". I don't mind doing those things, but they're the last thing I want to do on Friday or Saturday nights with the bars are \"poppin'\" as the kids with fake IDs at the bar say. I feel those are Mon.-Thurs. activities, and I'm not going to meet new people sitting in a karaoke room or having a one-on-one dinner with a girl. 3 weeks ago she drove us to a bar at 10 pm and I got a text from her asking to leave at 10:30 pm. \"Ummmm; NO!\" I responded \"You leave. I'll find another way home\". It's gotten to the point that when we're invited to clubs or bars by mutual friends she rejects the invitation and then invites me \"to go to dinner instead\". Now I have to either bail on a friend that I know I'm going to have fun with, or bail on Jen and have her be alone and pissy. For 3 months I'd just do whatever Jen wanted, I wouldn't go out to the bars, and I was miserable. The last 2 weekends both Jen and I have been invited to the events at a bar for friend's parties. Both times she's called me an hour before the meeting time trying to make new plans with just me after I'd already committed to going out. Honestly I was really annoyed so this last time I told her, \"I'm going to the bar. I want to go and have fun tonight. We can do dinner anytime. Are you sure you don't want to come?\" I got no response which I know means she's mad. When I got to the bar another mutual friend was surprised to see me because Jen had told her that she and I had made other plans. Another mutual friend texted me that Jen said I was **\"being an asshole\"** and that they were going to dinner. She's my best friend, I love her, and I'd do anything for her, but AITA for wanting to ditch my best friend on weekends to have debaucherous fun in my 20's?\n\nTLDR: **So r/AITA, am I the asshole for not wanting to hang out with my best friend on weekends because she's become in my opinion boring and uninterested in doing things I'm interested in.**",

      "description": "BF and I have been together for 3 years, living together for most of that time. When we met he was going to bars with 3 of his friends (also roommates at the time) 4 or 5 times a week, getting hammered and trying to pick up girls. Well, I'm an introvert and when I came around that slowed down immensely. BF is almost 30 and makes sense for him to want to slow his roll at some point, with or without me in the picture. Bars aren't really my scene and we try to find things to do together often. We invite his friends out with us often and they always ignore him if I'm involved. Well, on multiple occasions I've seen texts from his \"friends\" encouraging him to break up with me. They all tell him I'm too controlling and not good enough for him and to start over and do better. I'm confident when they're together they're saying the same in person when I'm not around. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I do get anxiety when my boyfriend goes downtown with his friends without me because I know they discourage him from being with me and I know they likely encourage him to try to hit on other women. I want him to have healthy time with his friends without me around, but I also don't want to be on edge the entire time knowing they're shittalking me and possibly putting him in a bad position if he is drunk and his inhibitions are lowered. I don't think he would ever cheat on me under normal circumstances, but this scenario playing in my head eats me up. My boyfriend allows this and continues to be friends with them. I want him to have friends....just not friends that disrespect me and make me feel like I can't trust them. AITA for being upset about this and feeling like he is allowing them to not only disrespect me, but our relationship together as well? ",

      "description": "My coworker kept making random gay/sexist jokes and I’ve never told him to stop, which is on me, I would just laugh or walk away. Then he started to up his rude meter. He kept going on about how he knows the manager and that’s how he got the job. How he can basically do whatever he wants because he’s not going to get fired. Also brought up how the founders of the company has the same last name as his so he can do what ever he wants. (Note: founders have sold the company YEARS ago so this shouldn’t even matter). I would ask him to grab something for me from the back and he would just say “nope!” And walk away. He spent 90% of his time talking to another coworker and would get upset at everyone else when they weren’t stocking fast enough. \n\nThe final straw was when he began to spread this rumor that one of our coworkers wanted to fuck him. First of all, we weren’t in the break room or in the back, just out by the registers where customers were. Second, when I told him that she doesn’t usually go for skinny guys, he erupted. Telling me that being called skinny is just as bad as being called fat and that society just wants me to believe that being called skinny was a compliment. When I tried to deescalate the situation, he kept interrupting me and going on about how skinny has just as many negative connotations as fat. \n\nThe next day, I reported him to my managers. I told him every joke and every rant he went on and how he barely did any work. Managers talked to him and he found out it was me who reported him. He only got a verbal warning and didn’t get written up. Now he gives me the silent treatment and refuses to be in the same space as me. If he’s placed in the same section as me, he’ll walk away and won’t help at all. \n\nI’m just really angry and I regret telling the managers about his behavior because it’s made the whole situation worse. I feel like the asshole because I should’ve just let it go and not let my anger control what I did. ",

      "description": "Pretty low impact one here but I thought reddit might enjoy it. My girlfriend, her mom, and my mom teamed up to get me a Nintendo Switch and Mario Odyssey for Christmas! Super surprised, I was wanting one bad and hunting down good deals with no luck. Very grateful for that. We've been playing it a bunch since getting it with me holding the sticks for most of the time (video games, especially Nintendo/Mario, have been a huge part of my life ever since the original). My SO is entertained by video games but usually gets bored after 15 minutes and moves onto something else. I get way into it, and I am WAY into Odyssey. \n\nI had been talking about this level called \"New Donk City\" and how hilarious that name was, how I couldn't wait to get there, etc. Today, I was at a rehearsal (I'm a musician), and after a bit of playing I see a text from my SO from an hour prior. It basically said \"Hey we're playing New Donk City \\[oops emoji\\], do you want us to not beat it?\" (we have friends in town). I obviously put my drumsticks down and responding \"Wait! No! I want to play it!\" It was too late.\n\nLater on speakerphone I very calmly and light heartedly said \"Hey, I really wanted to play that level, I was looking forward to it. How many moons did y'all get?\" She said \"...all of them\". I calmly said something like \"aw man\", and she proceeded to shrug it off saying things like \"whatever you can just replay it who cares?\" And I said \"Well the level will have changed and the collectables will be grayed out\", to which she said \"Oh well just start over then I don't know\". I stayed calm and said, see y'all later, bye! \n\nI then texted her very respectfully how it made me feel and that though she may find video games insignificant, they are very important in my life and I was very excited to experience this one fresh. She, through a few texts, got defensive, and even tried to guilt me into feeling bad about the way I felt a couple times. Things like \"K well everyone is freaking out over here now\" and \"I get it Aaron obviously we wouldn't have done it if we knew you would be like this\". To be clear, I simply stated that I was upset by what she did knowing how important the game was to me. I said that we'll just start a new file and replay it all (honestly, I'm okay with that). She still has not apologized for playing without me nor the way she handled the situation, and she's seeming like she has no intention to do so. This is what's getting me. \n\nSo. Am I the asshole here? Like I know I've said it a thousand times how calmly I handled this (rare form for me), but am I an inherent asshole for getting upset by this? I know it's \"just a game\" and all, but she knows how much work I've put into the game and how clearly enthralled I was with exploring everything. She's an awesome person who is generally very in touch with approaching conflicts and all that, which is making me think I might be the asshole. Let me know, y'all.",

      "description": "For context, I live with 3 other roommates. I moved into my current apartment only 3 months ago. May be I can call them friends in future, but we are not there just yet. And one of them, let's call \"A\", is good but we just don't really vibe with each other. \n\n\"A\" recently got scammed and started getting really paranoid. She doesn't trust anyone which I totally understand. The night she got scammed I asked what happened and if I could help and she straight up started shouting at me and asked me to leave her alone. So I did and we never talked about it again.\n\nBack to recent events, roommate \"B\" ruined our kitchen tiles when the other three of us were not home. It was her responsibility, so she called the maintenance, they checked and let us know that  it would take around 3-4 hours. If we let them, they will enter the apartment, finish their work and leave even if none of us are home, which we are okay with, except for \"A\". Without consulting me, they scheduled it for tomorrow. All my roommates are out of town, I said oh well instead of dealing with the noise I will just go to a library or something. \n\nThis is where the problem begins, \"A\" insists I should stay home because she doesn't want the maintenance folks entering our apartment without one of us being home. I said I was not involved in the decision making, no one asked me and I do not want to be home and take care of everything when I was not let know of it in advance. I also suggest rescheduling it to some other time when \"A\" can be home and take care of it.\n\nBut she says I should understand her situation, how she was recently scammed and be more accommodating. We texted back and forth, not even in one of them she asked me politely to do her a favor which I would very much agree to do. She says I am obliged to do this and that she would do the same and it doesn't require an \"official request\". I tell her that she never really treated me as a friend and I don't really owe her anything. She just got passive aggressive and decided that I am not a person who she thought I was. I mean, I don't even expect anything from my own boyfriend. So the entitlement really shocked me. Again if only she asked me to do her a favor, I would have. Maybe because I thrive off of appreciation.\n\nI am generally used to being nice, so saying no in this case is bothering me. AITA here?\n\n**TLDR**: Roommate B ruined the kitchen, roommate A has some issues and they decided its on me to stay home and get it fixed, without asking me. I declined, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "The likes of ‘sorry for bad formatting, on mobile’! This has been weighing down on me. I am f. My high school is very hard to get into since you have to audition.\n\nIn freshman year of high school there was this kid we’ll call G. G is a very flirtatious kid that was in the same grade as me. We randomly said hi whenever we’d walk past each other but that was all. That was until we figured out we were in the same biology class. We ended up sitting next to each other and having a good time like friends do.\n\nUs getting to know each other turned into a friendship, though he’d always talk to me about this girl named N. N had liked him but it fizzled out, though he ended up being really into her and didn’t stop talking about her to me about how much he wanted to snuggle her and how he jacked off to thinking about her because he liked her so much etc.. He’d cry to me about it but I was always supportive and comforting because I cared about him.\n\nSoon he turned this like onto me. I didn’t know how to respond to some things he’d do or say. He would reach under the desk to tickle me. That later went to grabbing my upper and lower thigh with me uncomfortably shifting away in an obvious manner. Weird touching wouldn’t end there though when he’d also grab the back of my neck to somewhat ‘paralyze’ me and make my head hit the table, saying how it was hot how submissive I looked when he did it. He ended up making more comments about how much he liked me and how he wanted to grope me w my parents around.\n\nI told him I was uncomfortable and started acting very hostile when he was around me, saying stuff like ‘why tf are you over here? I’m not talking to you at all’. (I moved my seat in biology 3 times because he kept moving back over to around where I was.) He’d raise his hands in defense and walk away while making comments on how mean I was being. I told the Social Worker and she said that ‘boys will be boys’.\n\nSooner or later he ended up avoiding me which I was happy w, though maybe a month later I met a few girls who said that they had similar experiences with him. I ended up telling them that we should go to the dean and talk about what happened since he still did that stuff. There’s a lot more id like to explain but I can’t really remember the whole thing.\n\nThere was a police investigation and he ended up being kicked out and he can never come back. I feel bad getting him kicked out of a good school though I didn’t like how he was trying to seduce erryone. (I have a friend named E (M) who joked that he was drunk, to where G forcibly kissed him)\n\nI was talking to some of G’s friends and they said that I was an asshole bc he was just being a freshman, though I didn’t think it was right of him to do since a lot of people told him that he was making them uncomfortable with his touching. He also sent nude photos of himself to a girl who didn’t want it and she felt inclined to do so back since he’d pester her so much at school.\n\nAITA?\n",

      "description": "Okay to preface, we have a four month old daughter.  My boyfriend [27M] is in school full time right now, and I am on maternity leave. \n\nFor the last couple years, we’ve been arguing over the frequency in which he plays video games. I’ve often felt as though I take a back burner position to his games, and am often told things like, “well if you can find something for us to do then I’ll hang out with you but if not then I’m going to play.”  \n\nSince the baby has been born, I’ve been getting more upset about this. It’s frustrating to take care of her all alone all day long and then he comes home and hops on.   Less than a week ago, I got very mad at him and told him that it was inappropriate for him to be spending hours at a time on his game while leaving me alone with the baby.  He agreed. \n\nFast forward to today... he gets home from school, and the baby is hungry. She takes about 10 minutes to eat. So he leaves to go play a 40 minute game.   In that time the baby puked on me and herself, I had to strip her down and wipe her, then go downstairs to get a change of clothes. When I came back up she was fussing/crying on her mat while he played his PlayStation 10 feet away.  I told him as soon as I got upstairs that I was upset about the game... 20 minutes later, he’s done and doesn’t understand why I’m upset. \n\nI told him at this point I’m done having this argument. I told him it was the very last time I was arguing with him about it, and the next time i was done and gone. I told him I have more respect for myself than to stick around in a relationship where the other people obviously doesn’t care that his actions upset me. \n\nHe thinks I’m picking a fight. I’m saying, I literally told him 5 days ago that if he wants to play while she sleeps then that’s fine but other than that it’s guna make me mad.  The fact that he still plays other than that just shows me he either doesn’t care, or doesn’t respect me enough to do something about it, so why should I stick around in a relationship like that? \n\nSo?  Am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "Thanks to my personality, I never had a good amount of friends. I don't remember having a good number of pleasurable experiences in the time I was a school, either, so any time I had a good conversation with someone, I was pretty glad.\n\nI was bullied a lot...for a number of reasons. It eventually stopped and I ended up being seen by the rest of the class as someome....kinda valuable, I guess? But not in a good way. It was as if I was just...something they could always joke about...if it makes any sense.\n\nI ended developing some sort of...indifference. I had to. Otherwise, I don't know.\n\nI only had one friend (lets call him K) (still my only friend), and I frankly didn't give a shit about anything or about my class anymore.\n\nThen came this guy in junior year (lets call him T). He was everything I wasn't. He became friends with K and eventually, he became friends with me, too.\n\nThis guy, is the kind of person that has friends everywhere. His social circle is massive. He has the kind of attitude that makes him comfortable to be with, and he's extremely outgoing.\n\nI also ended up (at least partially) inside his circle of friends.\n\nI can't lie. I was overjoyed. You have me, someone who was drowning in his own loneliness, finally being able to be with a group of people.\n\nFor two years, it was just....okay. I was nowhere as social as them but I always joined them when I was in the mood.\n\nThen, it just ended. At first it was subtle, like minor misunderstandings. \n\nThen, three months ago. I agreed to meet with him and a bunch of his friends. He told me to wait until they arrived at a friend's house so I could join. I waited....and waited...and waited.\n\nA little over an hour later, I call. They were having dinner somewhere in the city while I was there, like an idiot, waiting. \n\nI got annoyed, but It didn't last.\n\nPeople like me...I guess we grow attached to easily. I let it slide because I didn't want to escalate the situation.\n\nSo, going back to my friend K. While living in the states (I'm from latin america) he had a girlfriend.  Me, K, his girlfriend and T used to play online a lot. To put it simple and short, K's girlfriend ended up destroying him and dumping him. She moved from the states to my country. Less than a month after the breakup, she starts hanging out with T, and they get along pretty well. \n\nBy this point, I was questioning myself. I felt like I was slowly losing trust. This idiot girl is just a player, she used K and left him as a mess emotionally, she gets back to our country and immediatly starts hanging out with T, which he reciprocates as if he didn't give a shit about K.\n\nFinally, a little over a month ago. I was having a pretty bad day. I had a monitor from the hospital that took my heart pressure every fifteen minutes, and it was downright annoying. I had two tests, and I was pretty anxious. I ended up calling T to meet up, so maybe we could have a chat and I could calm down a little.\n\nHe agreed, so I sat and waited.\n\nHe didn't come, so I went to class.\n\nI waited for two hours.\n\nWhen he finally answered, it was him asking me to give him a ride home.\n\nI had enough. \n\nI just ended it right there. No words. No excuses. He sent me a bunch of messages for like 2 mins and called me twice. Then he stopped. Called again two days later, and that was it. Didn't get an apology or anything. Just a bunch of excuses about how I was being...dramatic. \n\nI lost. As always. \n\nThe guy didn't care a lot. He maybe did for maybe two days, but he has so many friends that he honestlty just forgot after he saw I wasn't going back.\n\nK ended up confronting T about the girl, and he apologized. I never got an apology. Instead, I was just left alone. I asked one of his friends to retrieve something from him he had taken from my home without my permisson, and he ended up getting mad at me and leaving me, too.\n\nI did everything I could to not lose him, too. He didn't give a single shit about my effort and ignored everything I had to say, siding with T. So I ended it all.\n\nI was fine for a while. I concentrated on my work and my studies, and was looking forward for the holidays.\n\nThen, they all met up yesterday. T, K and everyone else. They had a good time. And It all came back like a tsunami wave. The memories...and how easily I was disposed. I guess I was never an important part of them. Just some nice guy who happened to have a nice car.\n\nIt frustrates me to no end. Because this shit has happened my whole life. I'm always the second choice, I'm always someone who gets treated like shit and has to endure all of it.\n\nI guess I'm just...me. And people will always see me this way.\n\nSorry. I couldn't keep it to myself anymore. I had to let it out.\n\nSo....please. Tell me... I need to know. Maybe I'm just too dramatic.\n\nThe only good thing is that K still talks to me.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She doesn’t have much time left and I’d like to see her as much as possible, but Christmas is a terrible time for me. I lied and told my mom I have food poisoning and can’t join. I used a similar excuse for Thanksgiving but I have serious stomach issues so it’s somewhat believable. \n\nI’m feeling pretty guilty but my mental health goes down the toilet this time of year.

      "description": "I’m a female college student with two other female roommates, one of whom was away on a trip and the other asleep. \n\nI woke up to pee and had trouble falling back asleep at around 2:00AM I went into the kitchen for a snack. I saw a man looking in my window. \n\nNot, like, looking in from the street—totally pressed up against the window. I didn’t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said “Let me in.” It was one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. \n\nI SCREAMED as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. \n\nPolice came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and I guess he got confused because the doors look similar.)\n\nClassmates have been calling me “Break in Barbie” because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn’t describe him at all to police, but I would’ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. \n\nPeople I barely know are asking “Why couldn’t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?” “Why didn’t you just talk to him like a human being?” “Why didn’t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?” And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like “If it were a white man you wouldn’t have called the police I bet.” “Do you call 911 every time you see a black person?” And asking things like “Did you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.” And the most common one “How did you know he didn’t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?” \n\nTo try and see things from the other side — I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn’t brandish a weapon, he didn’t threaten to harm me, and he wasn’t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. \n\nThe name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I’m hoping it’ll blow over. Even close friends who I’ve vented about this to have said “Yah but what you’re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.” I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I’d be a giant asshole and more. \n\nSo I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash? \n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This happened years ago but I still think about it. I always went to this gas station in my town, and it was usually pretty busy. Whenever I would go to any gas station, I would go inside, prepay with a twenty dollar bill, and then pump my gas. At every gas station I've been to, the pump shuts off when it hits the prepaid amount, and this gas station was no exception.\n\nBut one day when I was pumping my twenty dollars worth of gas, I noticed that the pump didn't shut off. I had prepaid with a twenty dollar bill just like all the times before, but this time it filled up my tank and I got maybe about 8 dollars worth of extra gas. I thought the pump malfunctioned, or the cashier didn't input my prepaid balance properly.\n\nEither way it wasn't my fault and I thought it was my lucky day, like getting an extra soda from a vending machine. I was about to drive off, but then the cashier came running out saying I had to pay. I explained to him that I prepaid with a twenty dollar bill, and it wasn't my fault that the pump didn't shut off like it was supposed to. I didn't want to pay any more than twenty dollars, which I feel is the whole point of prepaying.\n\nIt definitely wasn't worth arguing over, and I did get the extra gas, so I just paid him and that was that. I didn't go back to that gas station though. But I'm still wondering, was I obligated to pay? Am I ignorant on gas station etiquette?",

      "description": "My son started a new school last year (grade 4) and quickly made friends with a couple of kids one being the kid (a girl so I will call her the girl) he no longer hangs out with. \nWhen the first met my son and the girl got a long great they'd hang out with another boy after class and all was good. Near the end of the year my son was to be her one friend she got to invite during her sisters birthday party. I was invited to stay as well and I got along ok with the mom. The mom seemed to have to decided that since our kids were best friends we were besties too. I am a single mom, I already have a strong group of friends, plus I work, go to school and volunteer. The mom seemed very put out that I didn't have time to do weekly dinners and such. I tried to when I could, but other than the fact that we both have kids we have nothing in common and I just never felt like we clicked as friends. After she made some comments to my son about how \"I never do anything\" after I explained that I was working on my thesis and couldn't go out I was pretty much done with her.\n\nMy son and her daughter had been butting heads since the beginning of the school year (grade 5). They had been put in other classes and my son had started to make other friends, but still spent most of his time with her. She had begun lying about a whole bunch of little things to get her way pretty much constantly (I had witnessed this behaviour on multiple occasions) and after months of calling her out on it and giving her many chances to stop doing it my son stopped being friends with her.\n\nAfter a few days of my son refusing to give in and bring her friend again the mom called me up and demanded to know why our kids were fighting because her daughter told her she had no idea what was going on - there is no way she didn't know my son called her out on it almost everyday. At first I played dumb because I didn't want to get involved with a kids fight, but my son told me to tell her what was going on so I did. She claimed that her daughter didn't lie and must have been playing around and my son took it the way. I told her that they'd figure themselves out and I am not getting involved. The mom seems to think that I am not doing enough as a parent by letting him throw this friendship away.\n\nAITA for being secretly glad this friendship is over because I don't want to hang out with the other mom? I didn't do anything to push him away from this girl, but I didn't really encourage him to fix the friendship either, I just let it play out with no intervention from myself.",

      "title": "WIBTA If I Didn’t Return a Refund to my Roommates from Utilities?",
      "description": "This is my first post, sorry for mobile formatting! \n\nI live with my GF, her sister, and one other person in a reasonably nice apartment. For whatever reason, none of them are very responsible and particularly not responsible with bills and utilities. This is only the second time that I’ve ever lived in a place that had utilities separate from the bill and the first place was with my GF and her sister, so I am no more knowledgeable than they are, plus I’m a foreigner and they’re all from the UK, where we live. \n\nI’ve set up all the utilities and regularly do gas/electric readings, pay the internet and water bills and come to them with the totals at the end of the month. I’m not fond of the way the gas/electric company creates bills because they’ll debit you an estimated amount each month and then either return the difference or charge you more when they do come and do a reading. \n\nMy GF, her sister, and I are all very conscientious about energy usage and make sure to keep all the lights and heating off. The other roommate is a mess, when it comes to everything really (leaves lights on, spills food everywhere, slams doors). Either way, we’ve managed to keep our bill way below the estimate so that each person would probably be getting back £40. \n\nNow the reasons I don’t want to give the refund back are first, because I work from home and the others often treat me as a house boy or servant. We are required in our contract to perform regular duties on and around the apartment, like sweeping up leaves, cleaning specific parts of the flat, and maintaining appliances. They are daily chores and no one else keeps up with their duties which forces me to take over (our landlord lives above us and can tell when certain things aren’t completed). I also regularly clean the flat because the fourth roommate is frankly disgusting and I don’t want to have to live in her food waste or have bugs/rodents (it’s a basement). I’ve complained multiple times but nothing has come of it. There are other things, like basically being a doorman and always dealing with the landlords even though on the tenancy agreement I’m only a guest because I’m a student. I normally wouldn’t mind doing these things but at least one of the other roommates is always in the apartment and it’s usually that fourth roommate who will hide in her room anytime the landlord comes around and will ignore the door bell (I’ve had to sprint out of the shower or jump off the toilet multiple times to get her packages only to hear her scurry out after I’ve received them and left them in the living room). \n\nThe final kicker is shopping. I regularly shop because the nice store is near my gym. I always like to keep up on buying things like toiletries and condiments because I don’t want to be sitting on the toilet without any mayo (just kidding, I don’t want to wait until there’s no toilet paper to buy more when I need it now). In our last place with my GF and her sister I was down around £300 split between the two of them for regular things like ketchup, salt and pepper, toilet paper, garbage bags, laundry detergent and things like that. I’d try to wait until we’d run out of things to force them to buy it but it didn’t make a difference. It would just mean I didn’t have anything to wipe with. \n\nThe same thing started happening in this apartment where everyone was using the supplies I’d buy. I finally got tired of it and have kept all my things separate from everyone else, still my GF has seen our other roommate steal my ketchup and mayo amongst other things. I’ve probably only lost about half of what the refund actually is while in this apartment. \n\nSo would I be the asshole if I kept the refund to make up for all the work I do and the supplies people have taken without asking or paying for? \n\nTL;DR\n\nWIBTA for keeping utility bill refund as compensation for the work I do around the flat/the food/supplies people have used without paying me. \n\n\n",

      "description": "When I was in 7th grade, there was this fellow, we'll call him Z. Z was a strange fellow. He had freckles, ginger hair, and had this weird accent when he spoke that sounded like it was German or Eastern European. He would frequently tell people to \"shut up\" even if what they said had no bearing on his existence, and he would get angry for no reason. At times, he would point his fingers at random kids and threaten to kill them, and he would (hilariously) tell kids who were far bigger than him that he would \"kick their butt.\" Well, one day, I was in our PE class (that I shared with him), and he had a spot on the gym floor just inches from my own. We were doing situps, and...at one point...the worst happened: I let one rip. It was loud, and it cut like a knife. This kid in front of me, K, turned around and asked if that was me. Already embarrassed, I pointed out Z, and pinned it on him. Before I knew it, a significant amount of the class turned and started chastising him for blowing a big one he did not commit. \n\nThey never found me out...unless one of you is reading this sub, of course. Then, ya got me. Lol. ",

      "description": "To preface, my friend and I are mostly over this. We both think the other’s wrong, but we’ve moved past it. Here’s the story\n\nI was over at a friends house and we were just kind of chilling and playing video games. We go on a walk and on the walk he basically decides “I’m going to make you play my favorite game of all time.” I knew what game it was, and I already knew I didn’t like it, since I had actually bought it before and promptly deleted it after playing three hours. He made me play it for a while and I did my best to pretend to like it. I should add here that my friend is VERY passionate about this video game. Basically an insult to the game is an insult to him. I didn’t really hate my experience, but I was totally burnt after two hours. \n\nThis is where the conflict comes in. He asked me what I thought and I said something along the lines “I didn’t hate it as much as I thought I would.” I chose my words very carefully to show that I didn’t really like the game while still trying to protect his feelings. I guess I did too convincing of a job, because he thought I genuinely liked it and his immediate response was to go online and ask if he should buy it for me. (He can definitely afford it better than me) I tell him that I wouldn’t if I was him because I’m not quite sure I would play it a lot. He basically told me it was too late because he had already bought me the game. \n\nFast forward a few weeks. The game is delivered, he gives it to me, and I play it for about 90 minutes before putting it away. The next week he asks me how far I am in the game, and he gets extremely offended when I tell him I’m not really playing it because I don’t like it. He basically accused me of lying to manipulate him into spending sixty dollars on me. I didn’t even want him to buy me the game. My argument is that He loves it so much he can’t imagine anyone else disliking it, so he convinced himself that I did too. He’s really upset about how his money went wasted (he bought it online so it’s non-refundable), but I told him that it’s his fault for buying it without being sure I wanted it. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Friend asked if I liked a game that he loves, I say it’s ok, he buys it for me without me asking for it, I don’t play it, he’s mad that he wasted money.  ",

      "description": "Hello, I'm posting from mobile so an early apology for any errors. Also no tdlr because there's really no way to sum this up cleanly.\n\nTo start I'd like to describe my two friends here.\n\nA, is a former close friend of my sister who I've known for over 10 years but only really got close to around 5 years ago. The type of close where nearly everyone we knew thought we were dating for at least a moment. We often say that we're platonic soulmates. They've always been a Mom Friend who gives everything they can to people without getting anything in return.\n\nB, is a friend I met via a chatroom online also around 5 years back. However I've really only been close to her when she started dating A around 2 years ago. She's had a lot of rough shit happen to her over the years and really the main support for our friendship is that I'm a removed party for her to vent to.\n\nI introduced the two through that chatroom 5 years ago when I added A to the group so I'd know someone there better, and the two ended up meeting irl and deciding to date long distance in spring 2016.\n\nAnyway enough set up here.\n\nFor the longest time A has expressed a wish for their relationship to become more physical. B was not comfortable with that, and A fully respected that, and didn't press on it. However B would regularly allude to being interested in that, only to back down when A would bring it up. This wasn't to big of a deal, A would regularly bring this frustration up with me and another one of our friends who is better at relationship advice. A fully respected B's choices with her body and wasn't going to push her into something. B had also expressed discomfort with a more open relationship when A brought that up, and A respected that as well.\n\nThe long short was that A was very sexually frustrated, which they could deal with. And it was never something they felt they were owed, or pushed on.\n\nThe second factor was emotional. As I briefly stated A has a very giving personality. They'll hold you and let you give your life story and support you, even if they're falling apart. This is something I've seen them put themself through time and time again. While B is much more of a taking personality. Around 80% of one on one communication between B and me, is B complaining about her friends, expressing insecurities, and being generally needy. As I have also stated  B has had a lot of bad shit happen to her in friendships and relationships. So I get where this neediness comes from, even though she seems blind to it.\n\nThat led to a relationship that was basically A taking care of all of B's emotional needs while ignoring any stress or issues they were dealing with. This wasn't B's fault alone, A knows they do this. But it was still a very unbalanced relationship.\n\nA had intent to cut things off after the holidays because they didn't want to ruin the holidays for B. I supported them in this and let them know I'd still be close to both them and B.\n\nThat plan tanked though. A had been hanging out with a friend, and while I was not present, what happened was that their friend allowed A to Have that emotional vunrability that they'd been denying themself, and the pair kissed briefly before A snapped back and realised what they were doing.\n\nThat night A thouroughly ran themself through the mud, and came to the conclusion that they needed to tell B right away in the morning. Which they did, and did not ask for forgiveness or to remain friends.\n\nNow a few weeks later I'm left in the awkward position as a mutual friend to each.\n\nToday B made a dramatic post in our original groupchat we met in to announce to everyone that the couple was no longer a couple and that A had cheated. And while I do respect that it's B's business, I can't shake the feeling it was more of a show. Given that B has made posts on all of her social media everyday about how betrayed she feels. All the social media where she knows A will see it.\n\nAnd really I'm reaching the end of my wits here. I've always been firmly a \"cheaters are scum\" type of person, but I can't help but believe A isn't the sole party at fault. Am I the asshole for thinking B is partially at fault for how this all ended? Would I be the asshole for calling her out?",

It pays pretty well and is very close to where I live.\n\nBefore going in for an interview, I told my best friend about it and just told her all about it and how I would really like to get it. (The interview went well and now I work there, which is great!) Yesterday she told me that after I told her about the position she went ahead and also sent in an application. At first I saw nothing wrong with it, but at that time it wasn't clear at all that I was going to get it, so now thinking about it, it kind of rubs me the wrong way that she would do that, basically sort of jeopardising my chances of getting it. \n\nShe also has done the exact same thing before with a pretty cool internship I told her about. \n\nAm I being overly sensitive?

      "description": "I (20M) live in a flat with 5 others at university. There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem\n\nShe always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.\n\nSo we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).\n\nI have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.\n\nI had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.\n\nSo I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. \n\nShe keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. \n\nThe guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. \n\nSo the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.\n\nI then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "Hey all, \n\nFirst of all I'll preface this with the fact that this is obviously a throwaway, and that my girlfriend is not generally a jealous person at all which is why I'm wondering if IATA. \n\nSo last night I was talking to my girlfriend of 5 years in a pretty general fashion, she had just seen a movie with our housemate (I work away 6 days a week) and we were in high spirits, when suddenly out of nowhere I get a message from her saying \"So I went on your fbook profile to show (housemate) some old pics and I noticed that you still have photos of you and (ex girlfriend) ??\" \n\nI immediately did a double take, because to be completely honest I normally have my facebook in the 'inactive' state and just re-activate it whenever I get bored (and by that I mean log-in without thinking which reactivates the account). Not only that, I had no idea that I even had any photos still on there from that period of my life. I have a quick look after this, and buried deep down in the tagged photos section is a few photos where I'm still tagged in photos that my ex is in. Now to be honest, I actually breathed a sigh of relief here because (at least in my mind) having photos where I've just forgotten to remove the tag is much better than having photos where I've uploaded them myself and kept them on there, like I'm pining for the past or something. \n\nRegardless of all this, I send a message to my girlfriend saying that they're gone now, and that they were just photos I was tagged in not photos I'd uploaded to my account, and that I'm sorry if she was upset by it. Despite me saying sorry, and that it meant nothing she has been passive aggressive and barely speaking to me since last night when it happened. I've tried asking her to elaborate on how she feels but all I get back is \"I'm fine/it's fine\".\n\nSo Reddit, I ask you, AITA?",

      "description": "Alright, so the title is a longer one because I couldn't figure out how exactly to summarize it in less text. So now for some context.\n\nLast summer I received an absolutely spectacular opportunity to get a job working for a family member away from home, and as I don't travel often, the legal age of work is lower in my home province, and being in Highschool means more opportunities to spend money I didn't have at the time, I gladly accepted. Now, I accepted this job when I was single. By the time I realized that \"Oh dear, I'm going to need to leave my s/o for a few months\" it was too late. Time to get to my partner at the time.\n\nFor anonymity's sake I'll call him Hunter. Hunter had been a very close friend of mine for several years before we started dating so I trusted him immensely, however there were some lines I wasn't comfortable crossing just yet given a long line of issues that for the most part are irrelevant. Basically, I didn't want to have sex with him because I wasn't comfortable. He assured me it was fine and the relationship went for months without a hitch. Enter the bastard who my ex cheated on me with. Let's call him Eddy.\n\nI found out a couple of weeks before my flight out of province that Hunter would be going on a camping trip with Eddy, one of his most notable exes as their parents were friends and wanted them to get along, and he still talked about him. I was a bit nervous but I wanted to put trust in my partner, so I just told him to have fun. I eventually communicated my nervousness with him for the sake of honesty and accented that I knew I was wrong. Four days before I left, he confessed that they'd kissed. I was hurt, yeah, but it was only a kiss after all, so I forgave him and I just told him he needed to learn to say no.\n\nI head out, happy and naïve, and enjoy my first month with relative ease, continuing to converse with my boyfriend while out there. Then mid-August, I stumbled upon something. Hunter had given me access to his messages after the first little incident so he could show he had nothing to hide but whoops. I found him talking to his friend about how upset he was that Eddy had now found a girlfriend after he \"Gave him a few handjobs\" and \"Let him finger me\". I was understandably furious.\n\nI confronted him, was fed the lines of apology, la dee da la dee dee. Now I should've broken up with him at that time, I know that now, but this was my first serious relationship and I cared for him dearly. I had two requests, however. One, easy, don't do it again or I will break up with you. The second one came with issues. I asked him to stop seeing Eddy. He was very distressed and one of our mutual friends asked me if I could come to a kinder compromise as cutting people off was hard. I gave in and relented.\n\nA note I probably should have put earlier is about what kind of person Eddy is. He's manipulative and abusive which is clear from how he treats my ex, so not a good person.\n\nNot a month passed before he broke up with me for the other guy, which left me in a very bad place. Enough about that though, while I know the matter is concluded, I still want to know. Was I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend cheats on me with a guy twice and I ask him to cut the guy off, AITA?\n",

      "description": "So this year I became president of my school's debate team. And I know, it may sound like I'm taking high school debate a bit too seriously. Still, debate is my passion, and I'd like to see my team go far. However, only four people got to state, and only one person, yours truly, was able to make it to nationals last year, which really irritated me. Our debate team had a couple issues:\n\n1. As an asian myself, I can safely say debate is one of the extracurricular activities 90% of asian parents push their kids into, whether they like debate or not. So half of our team is kids who like debate and want to compete. Some kids were forced by their parents, but still take debate seriously and want to compete. The rest of the kids are either a) just terrible debaters or b) kids who blow off debate and don't show up to meetings \n\n2. Our debate team didn't get as much funding as compared to stuff like sports or theatre, which is frustrating. We didn't even have a debate coach. Thos is because our school isn't that good at debate. Out of a team of over a 100 people (if you're wondering, the school has about 2500) 4 people made it to state and 1 made it to nationals. That's not enough to get good funding.\n\n3. Caps. Our team had a system in place where after 4 tournaments, you have to sit out the rest if tournaments for the year. So all the kids who are good at debate have to sit it out, and the kids who don't give a fuck about debate or those who are terrible at debate are forced to sign up for the tournament (because the school needs to fill a certain amount of slots). Then the school gets thrashed. \n\nSo I was elected captain at the beginning of the year. My goal is pretty simple: we need to go further, win more, become good enough at debate so that the school increases our funding. The hard part is getting there. \n\nIn the meantime, to become the best we can, I decided I needed to start asking for membership fees. Normally debate is free, but we needed to pool money for a coach. I went to the school and asked them permission to collect fees and do fundraisers and stuff. Since the principal likes me, I got the go-ahead. I started collecting a fee of $75 per person, and told people to see me if they couldn't financially afford it. Next, we did a few fundraisers: everybody brought in stuff they didn't need anymore and we did a yard sale/raffle. We threw a pool party with a $5 entry fee. Finally, we started a GoFundMe page and got our school to put it on their Facebook/Twitter. \n\nWe finally had enough money to hire a good coach, and we did.\n\nNext thing I did (I had the authority to do this, being captain) was remove the caps. My belief is that if you want to go to tournaments, you have to be the best. I arranged what I call tournament qualifiers: the kids in each categories would face off in rounds against each other, and the highest 5 in each category would go. \n\nLastly, and most controversially, I kicked a lot of kids off the team. Debate so far has been a club where anybody could join, but I made it into a 'by try-out only' kind of club. There isn't actually a tryout, but it is similar: if you miss 5 meetings (there are 3 meetings a week), you're out. If you're falling behind (ranking badly in 2 qualifying tournaments in a row), I'll give you extra one-on-one time with the coach to improve. By the next qualifying tournament, if you don't do well, you're out.\n\nMy reasoning behind this is simple: it's a really large team, and we only can afford to hire one good coach. The coach has to spend time with 113 different people, and many of these people just aren't improving or just don't care The more people on the team, the less time he has to focus on each individual, their strengths, their flaws, and how they can improve. If we kick out the kids that aren't improving, the coach will stop wasting his time and help those who can and want to be helped. \n\nSome people are calling me an asshole, but I think my policy is tough but fair. If you're falling behind, I'll give you one-on-one time with the coach. If you improve, great! If not, you'll just be wasting the team's time. ",

      "description": "I have worked at my current job for two years now. Over the last couple of months, I have cared less and less about it. I’ve been taking sick days just to avoid having to deal with my boss. \n\nI work in the marketing department as a trainee with the marketing coordinator, officer and the project leader. I have no problems with the marketing coordinator and the officer. They have always been kind to me. However, I can’t stand my boss. For a number of reasons (let’s say her name is Karen):\n\n* She used to interrupt me when I was on the phone to other staff/public callers quite often, with pointers about what I should be saying. I’ll add that she also does this in a condescending manner. As if I’m an idiot for having forgotten something. Now I just try and make phone calls through my mobile so I can leave my desk and not have to be around her when I’m on the phone. \n* When I brought it up with her, I said trying to listen to the caller and you, when you interrupt me is difficult and I would prefer if you didn’t do it. In response she just got defensive. She said that she is doing it just so I don’t accidently say the wrong thing, and she didn’t agree to stop doing it. Again, she says this very condescendingly, like it is obvious and I’m a peasant for not understanding. She went on and on about it. \n* She would ask me to prepare media releases and other such material, but no matter how I tailored it to her preferences there was always a million things wrong with my work. It seemed that no matter how hard I tried she would send it back to me covered in red and completely changed. Almost every sentence was different. This got so bad that at one point I copied and pasted a media release that she had prepared a year earlier, only changing dates &amp; times to see what would happen. Low and behold it came back completely different. She even sat me down and went through how each sentence that I (she) wrote just wasn’t right. Again, very condescendingly.  \n* One day Karen asked for help creating a new email address for the marketing team. She wanted to know what we think. She wanted to go with mediaunit@company.com. I sort of politely said, why don’t we go with media@company.com. I think it’s a bit simpler. I said that ‘mediaunit’ kinda sounds like we are part of army or something. She then proceeded to go on and loudly about how we are an army unit, because we deal with the tough issues and we are important and need to present ‘a united front’ or something blah blah… When she finished I said, I just think media@company sounds better. She said \"well it doesn’t matter what you think because you’re not going to be here as long as me.” Since then I've stopped voicing my opinion to her at all really. Seems pointless... She always does what she wanted to do anyway. \n* She has a wall of posters up around her desk. One of which is a redo of that British “keep calm and carry on” poster. It says “keep calm and listen to Karen.”\n\nI could go on and on… there were many times over the years that she has acted like this. So much to the point where I am afraid of even asking her for help or asking a question. Even if it is just a yes/no question, I will almost always get an extended condescending lecture about it.\n\nNow here’s the asshole part and the part that is making me feel confused. Every time we have a meeting and go through any issues in the relationship, she always makes me feel like somehow, I was just being emotional, or just reacting to her actions the wrong way. She never apologises for anything or admits that she did anything wrong. The only apology I’ve ever gotten is “I’m sorry you have had that experience.” She acts like every issue I have with her is simply my fault because I am just interpreting her actions the the wrong way. This just makes me more confused. I can’t tell who’s right and who’s wrong anymore. She is so adamant about it each time that I'm starting to question whether or not she actually is the good person and I am just thinking about it the wrong way. It doesn’t help that I have no one to talk to about this in the office, I feel like I can’t confess that I don’t like her to anyone, because they all seem to think she is this great leader.",

I will call this friend the 'boyfriend' and his girlfriend just the 'girlfriend'.\n\nDuring this hangout, we spent some time sharing stories about the boyfriend, most of which were fun but also listening to her complain a bit about different fights and such. At one point in the conversation, the girlfriend asks us if we know about the one time the boyfriend had sex previous to their relationship (at this point she had enough to drink to be pretty unfiltered). The boyfriend had told a couple of us the story before, and it occurring when he had traveled to NYC.\n\nInitially I had assumed the girlfriend was just trying to get us to bait information out of us, but when she referenced NYC I thought perhaps the boyfriend had told her about it before. When I replied that I knew exactly what she was talking about, she didn't believe me and I replied that it was with 'Alice'. Apparently the boyfriend had told the girlfriend a different story about who he had slept with in NYC, due to his history with Alice.\n\nThis resulted in her confronting him, them getting in a big fight, and him angrily messaging me calling me a liar and ultimately blocking me. The girlfriend messaged me as well, apologizing, and explained this was a big issue due to him lying about big things like this in the past.\n\nAm I the asshole here? I feel very guilty as it feels like I am causing them to potentially break up. I am fully aware that perhaps we shouldn't have been talking about that subject at all, but the atmosphere at the time seemed like telling funny stories rather than gossiping, and at the time I genuinely thought we were both referencing the same story.\n\nTL;DR: Accidentally exposed friend's conflicting story to his girlfriend resulting in a fight between them, AITA?",

      "description": "So I recently went through a breakup (few months ago). We were together for more than a year. It wasn’t a bad breakup, but it came out of nowhere for me. \n\nSo she originally told me the reason for breaking up was because she’s “going through a lot of stuff.” I should’ve known that wasn’t true. I later found out through a mutual friend that the real reason was because she wanted to sleep around with other guys. \n\nFinding out all these things hurt me even more so I just decided to not hold onto her anymore. She doesn’t know or care how much pain she has put me through. \n\nShe also hasn’t sent the ol’ “I miss you” text or any text at all. I’ve decided that if she ever texts or calls me I will just not answer. I’m not saying that she eventually will, but there’s a chance. \n\nSo WIBTA if I ignored her calls and texts if she ever reached out to me?",

      "description": "About 12 months ago my downstairs neighbor bought a puppy and she would put pics of her with the dog online everyday saying how cute he was and all this bullshit. I know it was bullshit cause she could be heard shouting at him during the day and would lock him out the back most days even in the rain. So fast forward to about 2 months ago and suddenly she stops posting about the dog and I suspect it's because he grew up fast and she probably doesn't think he's as cute anymore and it seems he's always outside now rain, snow, sun doesn't matter. A couple days ago I heard her screaming at the dog and could hear her at her back door so I looked out my window and just as I did this psycho drop kicked the dog halfway across the back garden and he squealed and limped around for a few mins. I felt sick to my stomach and didn't know what to do. I heard her leave a few minutes later and without thinking I went down picked up the dog and brought him to a shelter. I explained what happened and they told me I shouldn't of taken him.they said they'll hold on to him for now but if she comes looking for him they'll have to give him back. She's going to kill this dog cause she's very mentally unstable. \n\nAITA? what can I do? \n\nTLDR; took my neighbors dog to a shelter after I seen her abusing him. ",

And she's not super on top of keeping her hands washed. \n\nI like to eat handfuls of shredded cheese as a snack. \n\nMy wife will take my bag of cheese out of the fridge and stick her unwashed hand into my cheese, **immediately** after taking her fingers out of her mouth. \n\nThat is fucking disgusting IMO. Now the whole bag of cheese is ruined, and my snack is gone. \n\nSo I started buying her her own bags of cheese. I clearly labeled each bag with either her name or mine.  \n\nFF to the next morning, and she has *my* bag of cheese. Hers is still sitting in the fridge (opened, and contaminated by her unwashed hands). She didn't bother checking the labels. So now she has two bags of cheese, and I have 0. \n\nNext step: I buy a mini fridge and put it in my bedroom. We have seperate bedrooms, so I figured I was solving the problem.   \n\nBut NO. 3 days later, I get home from work and she's **sitting on my bed, eating my bag of cheese**. There was still plenty of cheese in the main fridge. This is not a money issue. I don't care if she eats 100 bags of cheese. I just want **my** cheese to be **my** cheese, so I know it hasn't had unwashed hands in it. \n\nSo I installed a deadbolt on my bedroom door, and I keep my room locked whenever I am not home. Now my cheese is safe. My wife still has plenty of cheese to eat. She just no longer has access to **my fucking cheese**. \n\nShe says it shouldn't matter, since we kiss all the time. But I don't want to eat cheese that has someone else's stale saliva on it. No matter how much I love her, food safety is food safety. She is introducing germs into a fertile breeding ground, and I just can't get over that. I need my cheese to be clean. \n\nSo, AITA? ",

      "description": "This is more of are we the assholes as my wife and I are on the same page here. We have a 3 month old who is the only grand child on my side of the family, and the only one in the state on hers, so we have a lot of family looking to come and visit frequently.  Our families live 1-2 hours away so it’s usually more like day visits instead of quick visits.  \n\nObviously, with me working full time and my wife staying home with a baby who needs almost constant care (along with a 9 month old puppy) and also working a part time remote job, certain house keeping items can fall through the cracks and we get behind.  I will point out that we do keep a clean house, I come home from work most nights and tackle either dishes or laundry, and we pick up the clutter and vacuum pretty regularly.\n\nOur mindset is that if family members come to visit for the day on a weekend, we expect them to do more than just hold the baby, but actually help out by maybe doing the dishes, switching laundry to the dryer, taking the dog for a walk, etc just so we can lean on their support for a small break from all the stuff that piles up.  Some family members are super giving with their time/efforts and are happy to help, but my wife’s mom and step dad basically expect to come and hold the baby without doing anything else.  We have to specifically ask them to do things if we want them to help, and if they do it it’s usually with a pretty snarky/put off attitude.\n\nThis was capped off last night when they came to babysit while we went to my company’s Christmas party, and as we were all dressed up and heading out the door, my MIL called out to my wife for help because our son had a poopy diaper and she made us change it before leaving. It’s a small thing but it made my wife confront them about not being helpful when they come to visit, and her mom responded that “that’s not what grandmas are for” and that if we need help we should just hire people for it (they are pretty well off, but we don’t have money for a nanny or anything.)\n\nSo we really want to know, are our expectations too high for support from family when they come visit, or is it fair to expect some pitching in when they’re here for several hours/a whole day?

If it were between a) signing up for a $50,000 loan (let alone $100,000 like some I've heard of) and b) finding a job to pay for junior or community college then transfer or find a company that pays for tuition and pull out all the stops to work there, I would much rather not sign my life away for the \"four year experience.\"\n\nI know it sucks.

      "description": "Hi,\n\nJust yesterday I was out with my girlfriend and our puppy and we stumbled upon 3 moose about 100-200 yards away standing in a tight group. They were all facing us (clearly having seen us) and me being unsure if I can trust our puppy to stay calm and collected and not potentially make the moose feel territorial and stir up some shit, I said \"Let's go back. Those are moose, and we shouldn't mess with them.\"  to which my girlfriend (having seen no moose in her life) says \"Woww, no! Let's stay and look at them!\" and starts walking a bit closer, at which point I again try to interject with \"No, for real. Don't mess with moose, they're not nice animals. I'm turning around and leaving right now and you should come too.\" at which point I grabbed our puppy and started leaving, turning back toward her and saying \"Come!\" once before we more briskly walk away.\n\nOn the walk back when she a few minutes later (fuming and being pissed) joined us I explained what I expected could happen (moose being somewhat territorial by nature, puppy starts barking, moose gets testy, get closer and something bad happens) and she doesn't address this at all and just says \"I can't believe you did that!\"\n\nNow my girlfriend is annoyed at me for \"abandoning\" her. Her first argument was that the situation was fine and that people go closer to moose all the time, but then when I pointed out that other people doing risky stuff is no excuse to do risky things she switched to that I abandoned her and that I'm an asshole for it. \n\nFrom my perspective, if she wanted to stay, fine, she's free to make her own decisions as long as she's informed that they're risky. But I needed to get our unpredictable puppy out of there that might have caused a dangerous situation simply because he doesn't know better and could have endangered us all.\n\nI do understand her point of view. Being 'abandoned' is not a pleasant experience no matter the circumstances, but from my point of view I told her that we were turning around and leaving and why about 3 times before actually doing so, and she decided against it and made her own decision. I don't feel like I'm obliged to make the same mistakes as her just because she doesn't want to follow my lead.\n\nAm I the asshole? I feel like I probably am an asshole for being so unfeeling about it, but at the same time I do not regret in the least how I acted because I've lived in moose-heavy areas before and I know they're nothing to play around with and am not about to get peer pressured into making a stupid decision.",

      "description": "Context: my(15m) now ex-girlfriend(15f) and I have been together for months. She used to tease me alot by being with other guys and have her arms on their shoulders. It would always hurt me but at the end of the day i always forgive her.\n\nBut what broke the camel's back was yesterday when she was doing that with one of my \"friend\" lets call him \"Pete\". So \"Pete\" was being an asshole and disturbing my then girlfriend, ngl i was furious at \"Pete\" and told him to fuck right off, so he went right back to his seat. Then my then girlfriend found it as an opportunity to make me jealous. So what she did was she stood up and sat right next to him and were hugging each other right infront of me, i basically knew that it was over at that point it was like she was asking for our relationship to end. So after that i went nc with her for the rest of the day, it really broke my heart because i would always make time for her and make excuses just to be with her and before all of this she would spend more time with other guys than me. I did what any other logical person would do and end it off through phone call. She was a mess and blamed it on me for taking her \"joke\" too seriously. The next day i am deemed the asshole between my friends and her for breaking up with her.\n\nTLDR; Broke up with my girlfriend for making me jealous by being next to another guy, now i am the asshole in her and her friend's eyes.\n",

When my husband got home that afternoon, he looked at the couch in the living room and said \"didn't you even bother to straighten up in here, you just let him in the house with it looking like this?\"  He was referring to the fact that there was a rumpled up throw on the couch and most of the back pillows were piled on the futon.  He clearly thought I hadn't bothered to neaten up after he'd been laying there the night before.  I replied with \"I did straighten up the living room, I was just taking a nap there at lunch.  And anyway, it's not as if he's here to inspect the house, he just comes in and goes straight to the basement.\"  Precede the words straighten, nap, inspect, comes and basement with f@#king.

      "description": "I'm getting married in June. My soon to be father-in-law lives out of town in a larger city and is helping me get suits for myself and the groomsmen.   \n\n\nHe just needs my measurements help get the right size suit.  \n\n\nToday I walked into a local suit shop and asked an employee if they could take my measurements. I think I made it clear that was all I needed and probably wasn't going to be purchasing anything at their establishment.   \n\n\nI offered to pay them for the measuring as I realized it was sort of an \"icky\" thing to do. He said someone could help me out but they were just finishing up with a customer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited a few minutes and the other guy came over. He asked me if I was purchasing online and I said no, and explained the suit was coming from out of town and I just needed some measurements.   \n\n\nHe then told me he didn't really like that because he would rather me spend money at his store (I mean, duh). He then told me about another customer in the store who was ready to drop $1000+ and that it didn't make sense for him to deal with me. \n\nHe then said \"it would be easy to do\" and started spouting out my neck size, chest size and waist size (because I guess he is such a master of measurement he can do it by eye). \n\nI tried to say calm and said something like \"I understand where you're coming from, I was just asking if it was something you guys could do for me, you just have to say no, I'll leave\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was pretty flustered, embarrassed and angry. I understand what the issue was, he just kept drilling it into my head that I was waisting his time. I just had to turn around and walk out.   \n\n\nI've never written a google review but I'm so tempted to just shit all over his customer service. I don't want to do it because maybe I'm the asshole for going in their in the first place?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for listening. I hope this is clearly written",

      "description": "My wife has gained 15 maybe 20 pounds recently. We’re high school sweethearts and when I fell in love with her she was a 90 pound cheerleader. \n\nI knew when we reached our 60’s she might put on a few pounds, but I thought we still had a lot of good years left. \n\nI’ve tried to encourage her to resume her more active lifestyle and cut calories. She used to run three miles every morning but now she only gets out twice maybe three times a week. \n\nShe’s eating a lot more. Granted, she is four months pregnant, and the doctors said she’d need to eat more, but I think at this point she’s using it as an excuse to let herself go. I’ve done research and women don’t really need to gain any weight while they’re pregnant until the third trimester, and I’ve seen a lot of pregnant women on Instagram who don’t look at any different only four months in because they doubled down and made fitness a priority. \n\nI still love her more than anyone in the world. I’m just not attracted to her, at all. After a while of not accepting her advances in the bedroom she asked if something was wrong and I was honest with her and she flew into a rage. Now I’m wondering if maybe I shouldn’t have said anything. \n\nI feel bad I made her upset, but I didn’t want to lie to her. I can see why she’d be extra sensitive to feedback right now, and I know women today don’t like getting any comments about their bodies good or bad. I was really just trying to watch out for her best interests. \n\nAITA? \n",

      "description": "My current job is pretty simple, I have 17 years of experience in the industry. I have 2 co-workers whom I don't dislike, but don't get along with. 1 of them is a manager, he steals from the register (boss keeps him on the job because he's a friend and they feel sorry for him) and tries to borrow money from our vendors and regulars due to a gambling habit. He's borrowed more than 5K from all our co-workers combined and refuses to pay them back. He's rude to customers and these costumers come to tell me, this happens almost daily. I've tried to bring these complaints up with the boss, even tried to get them to talk to the costumers, however, they'd rather have me listen to complaints than that they'd solve the problem. Needless to say, our co-workers don't like the manager nor like working with him. Due to my experience and papers I've been promised the manager's position as soon as he'd get fired. However, he did not get fired and has been given another \"last\" chance (he's been given second, third, etc. chances for 6 years now). The other co-worker with whom I don't get along has given in her resignation a few months ago. I was asked to cover her hours, which I agreed to. This co-worker didn't leave and as compensation I've been given more hours, but not the amount of hours that were promised. She's an okay person, but likes to make little jabs and thinks she's the best in everything. When called out, she ignores you for days/months. Right now, I'm the one that my co-workers come to to complain to or to ask to bring X subject up with the boss. I do feel bad for both my co-workers and my boss, they're kind people and boss has even helped me when I was in a time of need by prepaying my salary (which was then deducted over a few months instead of 1 month). If they hadn't done that, I would've not been able to put down a deposit for the lease of my apartment. An apartment I've been dreaming of ever since I became homeless 2 years prior. So I feel very grateful and very inclined to stay with my current job because of this. \n\nNow I've gotten a new job offer. A managers position with a salary and perks I don't want to refuse. This possible new workplace is also closer to my home, 10 minutes of cycling/5 minutes of public transport vs 30 minutes by car/45 minutes by public transport. I would be an idiot to turn this offer down and I don't want to turn it down because it benefits me greatly in several ways. However, I can't shake the feeling that I'm about to leave my boss screwed. Maybe I'm overthinking or giving myself too much credit, but I'm afraid that if/when I leave, the work environment will become more toxic and people will become less willing to go to our establishment. Reddit, WIBTA if I left and take on this new job or should I just leave and don't look back?",

      "description": "It sounds bad, but hear me out. I love my husband sooo much, he is the highlight of my life and I totally understand why he thinks it’s important that I wear a ring. \nWe have had REALLY bad luck with wedding rings. We’ve been married 2 years now, and have gone through two rings already. \n\nThe first we found out it was fake and it started to rust. It was super scratchy and uncomfortable so we went out and bought a new one.\n\nWe bought the second one about 4 months ago from JC Penny. It was $2500 and he declined the warranty. \nThe diamonds are now falling out like crazy. It my opinion it honestly looks horrible and they just keep falling out the more I wear it. I suggested we have it fixed, but really if they are going to just continue to fall out there’s really no point in replacing the ones that have already fallen out.\n\nI tried calling JC penny and they literally told me “too bad, that really sucks but we can’t help you. You should have came in earlier”.  I told them they didn’t start falling out until just recently and once again I got the whole “too bad so sad” spiel from them. \n\nI talked with my husband about it and he said I should just wear it and we will buy a new one in a couple years. He got mad when I told him I don’t really want to wear it because I think it looks bad. He said it would make him feel better if I just wear it anyways.\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to wear it? \n\nThank you! ",

I feel like an asshole because I don't have a rationale for not wanting to take them, other than it makes me uncomfortable. To a certain degree, I am paranoid if his phone ever gets hacked or something -- that's probably where some of the apprehension comes from (not exactly a grounded reason).\n\nI just need to know if I am being an asshole from a third party, or even some advice would be nice.\n\nThanks",

      "description": "First of all, I come from a strict (Filipino) family. I (22 F) have graduated from law school and I have a job at a law firm. I don’t live at home anymore and I currently live with my boyfriend (22 M). I have always tried to help my family whenever I can. But I’ve been accused of forgetting them and abandoning them. \n\nFor example, my dad suggested to go on holiday to the Philippines this summer as a family. But I’ve said I can’t come because it clashes with my own plans to travel and I’ve only said then because the topic of holidays came up. I have planned to go interrailing. He got very angry and said that I’ve only thought of myself and placed more importance on my boyfriend then them. He said I should have suggested interrailing to them but it’s not like a family holiday. It’s what students and young people do. I may have been selfish here. He said that I should have told him earlier about it rather than now. But I thought what difference does it make and I haven’t completely finished my plan to travel yet but I’ve already committed to saving that date to travel. \n\nMy mother then sent abusive texts and called me 10x wishing the worst for me and swore and disowned me. I said that I wasn’t going to answer if she was going to shout and be rude. But she said she doesn’t care and that I should answer her calls. This was during my birthday lunch yesterday which bf treated me to as today is my birthday. (No messages from them still and I didn’t expect to) \n\nThey say that I am an asshole and I’ve never been useful. When a few days ago I applied a loan (£4K) on their behalf so they can go on the said holiday and I’ve always given them money when they need it. Like my dad I have him £250 for the car and this weekend. It just hurts as everything I do for them is always wrong. \n\nTLDR; parents get angry and disown me because I couldn’t go on a family as I’ve made my own plans even when I try to help them financially to go on the said holiday. \n",

      "title": "AITA for wanting to be friends with someone my girlfriend hates",
      "description": "I’ve made a few posts in the recent past about this situation, more or less, but I’ll recap it.\n\nLast year, when I was a freshman in college, I met these two girls that I quickly became good friends with. We would frequently talk in our class that we had together and hang out in their room just reading doing homework. They were definitely my best friends at school and I told my girlfriend (who lives 5hrs away) that they were excited to meet her. She wasn’t thrilled to say the least. From then on I didn’t mention them much out of fear of upsetting her, until one day she saw I was talking to them on my phone and told me I needed to stop. I was undeniably stupid and selfish, and so I chose to keep talking/texting these girls, albeit only in class, because I really had no other friends at school. A few weeks later she saw our group chat and was immediately convinced I was cheating. I realized my behavior was awful and did my best to rebuild her trust, but she’s still mean about it sometimes even after a year. This process included me blocking those two friends on everything online and not talking to them after I informed them that my girlfriend wasn’t comfortable with it. \n\nRecently  I’ve been seeing them every so often, just walking around campus or sometimes with other people I know, and my heart just aches. I just want to be friends with them... I really haven’t found anyone else at school that I’m comfortable with so I’ve lived in seclusion for a whole year and it’s been misery. I’m tempted to talk to them again but I know that I can’t without hurting my girlfriend, so I’ve chosen not to engage with them and I only acknowledge them with a simple “hi” or “how’s it going” if I see them, though my girlfriend would feel that is unacceptable as well. \n\nBut my question remains if I’m the asshole for continuing to think about something that my girlfriend isn’t comfortable with. Part of me thinks that I’m justified in wanting to have these friends in my life but part of me feels like I’m selfish for putting my needs above my girlfriend’s wishes. \n\nFor reference, the reason my girlfriend believed I was cheating is because I allowed her to read through our messages and at one point they said “don’t be sad, we love you!” and I replied basically with something like “haha love you too thanks”. That, combined with my failure to tell her that I was still talking to them, was evidence enough of me cheating. I still feel guilty about it and it’s a sore topic among us. \n\nAITA Reddit? I want to make clear that regardless I won’t actually talk to them behind my girlfriend’s back, but I want to know if it’s wrong or selfish to have these feelings of loneliness without my friends. I really wish I was more easily social with guys but I’ve always been someone to be more comfortable around girls and now it’s causing problems. I just want friends, I promise. I’ve tried making more in at least a dozen different ways but I’m not very good at it. It’s not for a lack of trying. \n\nTL;DR I was dishonest in the past to my girlfriend about two friends and after I cut them off I miss them. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\n",

      "description": "Ok so this sounds bad but bear with me.\n\nWe're supposed to be attending a 40th birthday party this coming Saturday for my step mum. My wife's mother had surgery last week to remove part of her lung due to a tumor. This is obviously major surgery and she's still recovering from it now. We've spent a lot of time at the hospital with her keeping her company but not much else.  \n\nAs for my mother in law's condition, she's not great. She's got a tube draining her lung and is subsequently not very mobile. She's also in some pain because of the tube. Having said that, the medical staff are confident she'll be discharged on Monday and with the tube gone quite a bit of her self sustainance will return. She's also been making marked recovery aside from a slight set back yesterday.\n\nNow, having said all that, my mother in law also has other people who could support her, including her husband. These guys are a little further away from the hospital than us (an hour as opposed to our 30 mins) so my wife isn't the only person helping out. My sister in law is also flying down over the weekend to help out.\n\nOn Monday this week, just after the surgery, I told my dad that my wife wouldn't be able to attend. But then after that, as my mother in law began to recover we agreed my wife would be able to make it after all. After my mother in law's recovery stalled a little though, my wife now thinks she should stay.\n\nHere's what's getting me: she isn't actually physically helping her mum, at least she's not doing anything that others couldn't do, her mum isn't in any danger of suddenly getting worse, her mum has plenty of other people to look after her but here's the kicker: _we'd only be gone for one night_. I simply can't understand why she feels she has to stay. Am I the asshole for not getting this through my thick skull?\n\nCaveat: there's something to be said for her not feeling like partying very much, which I do understand of course, but I'd like focus on the whole mum being sick aspect as I'm trying to determine if my feelings about that Vs the party are assholish, not if she should come to the party strictly speaking.",

      "description": "For about a month and a half, I've been giving rides to an airman friend who is medically restricted from driving, meaning he requires accommodation to get from home to his work on an air force base. He's currently divorcing his wife, who is also my best friend, and as such she's moved into a different house (and I moved with her - we lived together already, anyway). I wasn't working for a bit, but I still woke up early to make sure he had a ride to base, and picked him up from base when he was done (two round-trips, about 18 miles each, mostly on my own dollar - he only offered to fill my tank once in the month and a half, and that was after I had a bit of a financial crisis and bitched about it).\n\nI recently started a new job which runs from 8 in the morning to 4 at night, and the location for this job is on the opposite end of town (an hour long drive from the base). I told him that I would still try to get him to work so he isn't left in the dust and doesn't get into trouble. He said he would like to be there at 0530 to do his required PT before his shift, which I agreed to, but told him that this would only be viable for about a week. (I also advised another mutual friend of this situation and he said he might be able to give rides on certain days, but didn't necessarily say what days.) This meant I had to wake up at 4, rush to get ready, drive to his place, pick him up, drive him up to the base, then drive to work (with not really enough time in between to get any more sleep). I completed my first day of work and was exhausted the rest of the day, but still intended on sucking it up for this week to give him time to look for other accommodations beginning next week.\n\nToday, I still woke up at 4am, still extremely tired, and drove to pick him up. I arrive and message him saying that I am there. No response. I send another message and wait another 10 minutes, with no response. I call him, he answers and after saying that I was outside waiting for him, he tells me that (other friend) was supposed to give him a ride later that morning, and that I should have known. I told him that I wasn't made aware of this, he said \"oh shit, well sorry\" and offered to compensate for the lost gas. I said \"alright\" and hung up the phone.\n\nI angrily took my exhausted self back home, made breakfast and tried to rest before having to leave for work an hour later. Once I composed myself I checked my messages to see another apology. I told airman friend that instead of paying me for gas that he needs to get a bus pass and that I won't be providing rides anymore.\n\nAITA for cutting him off? ",

She seems like a nice girl and theyre a great couple and I know he is happy, but ever since he started dating her he's becoming more and more distant. He spends a good amount of his free time with her and when he's with her he wont answer his phone. He still makes an effort to see me and his other friends but when we're hanging out he's messaging her constantly. I also feel like he tells me less and less about his day to day life now, like we still talk a lot but it doesn't really have any substance, I just get short responses or really generic answers. He'll also spend a few days with her at her place and then blow off other plans afterwards because he's tired. \n\n I know I should be happy for him and I'm probably being a juvenile asshole for feeling this way but I miss my friend. He's still the most important person in my life, and I'm not the most important person in his anymore. \n\nSo, AITA? ",

      "description": "Growing up my father worked 60+ hours a week at a position making good money, so we lived in the upper middle class kind of life. I got everything I wanted as a kid and it showed in my attitude. my mom being a stay at home mom got the worst of it because she was around all the time. \n\nGrowing older and older however I started to ask for less and less. Because I wanted to feeling of achieving and getting something all by myself. I stopped asking for things at Christmas, my birthday, and holidays. Even though they would still get me things. My mom actually started to complain because she didn't know what I wanted because I never asked for anything. \n\nAlso growing up I realized I was an introvert. So being in school all day wore me out. By the time I got home I was all socialed out and wanted to be held up in my room and in that presepctive I kept to myself. \n\nMy mom's attitude towards me changed as I became more and more Independent. Some of her words because harsher and harsher. Then I started to think about how my mom would act during evening.\n\nShe would constantly be on her computer. I'd try to talk to.her she wouldn't listen because she was playing a game on her computer. Even eating dinner.... Computer. She ignored us after we became teenagers, and then became angry at us when we would interrupt her wanting to tell her about out day. \n\nShe started putting me in stress filled situations like putting me in between my dad and her in an argument and having me be the mediator. After a while of this obvious I acted out and eventually asked to go to a therapist.... She told me therapy is for weak people and then repeated it.\n\nNow I'm in my twenties moved out she live at least an hour away. And is still managing to upset me from that distance. Whenever we are in person it's a guilt trip about how she doesn't see me enough. I tried to explain to her what an introvert was and she threw it back in my face. This post would be a book if I wrote everything. Very rarely will she do something nice but then it gets held over my head or twisted.\n\nI've met the love of my life and the only one not happy for me is her.  When I talked to people that know the situation significant other excluded they give me a foul response like I'm the bad guy. \n\nSo.....I decided to ask an internet full of strangers \nAm I an asshole if I just cut all ties with her every though everything she has done for me?",

      "description": "Last week I gave a small 4.4 cubic foot refrigerator as a birthday gift for my ex’s apartment. It cost me about $250, which isn’t a whole lot of money but definitely isn’t nothing either. Less than a week later I discover she has been frequently texting her ex though she told me several months ago she had stopped. We have only been together about 8 months but this has been an ongoing issue with her so I decided to not allow myself to be played or lied to anymore and simply cut my losses. When I first bought the fridge one of my friends asked where I bought it as he was considering buying one for himself. I’m fairly certain he will be willing to buy it from me even if at a discount being that it is already out of the packaging. If she had had it for a few months before I discovered her lies I would just let her keep it but being that it was not even a week I feel like maybe I have the right to ask for it back. She is selfish but not a bad person and I believe she will give it back to me if I ask her. I should probably also mention that in October we took a trip to Halloween Horror Nights and we agreed we would split the gas (we took my car) and she would pay me back the $160 I spent for her ticket and I would cover the hotel. I ended up paying 80% of the gas and she never again brought up the $160 she owes me even though it was made very clear and she fully understood she was supposed to pay her share. I honestly found that to be really tacky because I would never do something like that. Anyway, WIBTA? Thanks for reading!",

We've had the talk about what we want but since we both live with our parents respectively we've agreed to keep things casual. About 3 months in I asked if she'd like to be my girlfriend but she said no. I was cool with it and we've been having a great time together. A couple weeks ago I reconnected with an old friend (29f nurse) who was in town for just a few days. We finally met up on her last day in town(California) and old attractions flared up and we hooked up. She went back across the country(Connecticut) and we've been talking about me coming to see her and hook up again and even offered to pay for my flight. I told her that I'm seeing someone here, but since it's not serious she doesn't mind. Am I the asshole for flying to Connecticut to hook up with nurse without telling Law student why?",

The two bosses I have are the district manager and the owner. They have been upset with me since I took a paid vacation, which they offered me.

Today was my first day off in a whole week, and an employee in my store called me at 5pm. I answered, handled the situation, and hung up. The store closed at 8pm as per usual, so at this point I assume I don't have to babysit my phone anymore because nobody is working and nobody should be calling me. \n\nMy phone rings at 11pm. It's the district manager. I don't answer. I get a text saying \"plz call me\" and 20 minutes later my phone rings again. I still don't answer. This particular manager has a habit of calling and keeping me on the phone for hours at a time for very tiny details that can are not, on any scale, big issues. \n\nRight now my nerves are shot because my managers have been nit-picking with me over little details and pushing me to quit ever since my vacation 2 months ago.

I'm very use to being the butt of the jokes in my school and she's use to hearing them. Well one day she joked around saying that if I where to ever go through with the jokes I should give her my hat first. Well she walked away for a bit and her and my close friend suggested I should walk into school one day put the hat on her head and say \"I won't be needing this anymore\". At that point I started cracking up so she came back over and asked what was funny, so her friend repeats the joke and she gets mad and storms off. She slowly distanced herself from me but not the people making the jokes. She's also been trying to ruin my life by grasping at straws to go tell the school officials. I finally asked one of her friends why she's been doing this and they brushed it off as her bipolar disorder (we where friends for 6 years and this never once came up between me and her.) I finally got tired of this and started retaliating by making fun of her for every insult thrown my way\n\nHer friends started confronting me calling me the asshole for \"bullying\" a girl with \"bipolar disorder\". They also have been distancing from me or getting mad when I insult her back. The friend who made the original comment refuses to take the blame because \"it's funny to see me mad\". \n\nI'm not looking for justification for me I just want to get other people's opinion on whose the asshole.

      "description": "My friend has been suffering with mental illness long term, I won't go into all of them here for her privacy needless to say there's a lot of issues going on there.\n\nWe were pretty close friends about 2 years ago she was making good progress on getting better then had an episode and did some pretty horrible stuff after which she moved interstate and cut ties with all her friends.\n\n6 months ago she calls out of the blue to inform me she married a guy she knew for only a month and she was moving back to home and she hoped we could be friends again.\n\nAnyway she moves home, we start to hang out and I can tell she has totally backsliding on all the progress she made mental health wise, her new husband \"doesn't believe in mental illness\" and while she started taking anti depressents and mood stabilizers again she mixes them with copious amounts of alcohol and passes out from drinking most nights, when I suggested you aren't meant to mix medication and alcohol I was told \"the doctor didn't mention I couldn't so it's probably fine\".\n\nAnyway this has resulted in 3 suicide attempts in the last 2 months, she refuses a stay in the mental health Ward(we are in a country with universal healthcare so cost is not as much of a factor) and when we try talk to her about getting help she just claims \"my medication made me do it\" and insists she needs no further help and it won't happen again.\n\nThe first two times I rushed to visit her in hospital as soon as it happened to try help and support her, but this time I just can't, it doesn't seem like she wants to stop this or get help anymore, me supporting her doesn't help her friends being there is not gonna help. All our mutual friends are calling me an asshole for not rushing there again, but I\n feel like I need to withdraw for my own emotional well being cause at this point I only see it ending one way.\n\nSo am I an asshole for tapping out and giving up on my suicidal friend?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I asked my neighbour to stop \"borrowing\" my dog to distract her autistic son?",
      "description": "I've had this dog since I was a kid and he's getting on in years now, but he's still pretty spritely for his age. I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.",

      "title": "AITA for wanting my dad to do something about my older brother?",
      "description": "To start off, I am a 19 y/o female and my brother is a 24 y/o male. He's lived with my dad (59) and my other brother (27) for around a year and a half now. Let me preface this by saying I by no means hate my brother: I just can't stand living with him, nor can I tolerate a number of his behaviours. Ever since he moved in with us, life at home just hasn't been as good. He lives in the converted attic/loft, which is directly above mine and my dads room, and is rarely not making noise, either by shouting and otherwise being verbally loud (he's a 'gamer'), banging and smashing furniture because he died or something, or walking around (the creeky af floors) till past midnight. He hoards dirty plates and glasses in his room for days at a time and leaves said mess in the sink for someone else to clean up (which personally is repulsive and as someone with a mild germ issue, this stresses me out). He's very anti-social so doesn't really spend time with us, cannot be disagreed with without an argument ensuing, smokes weed 'out of the window' - not that it smells like it - which is an annoyance not only because it smells, but because its illegal. He's also very aggressive at times. I mentioned about the banging when he games - well, that's the tip of the iceberg. In pain? Hit something. Internet cuts out? Hit something. There's no milk? Hit something. Any mild/moderate inconvenience? Hit something. Including people. On my 19th birthday, he threw a full bottle at my bed, ripping open my ear, and then punched me in the face. When we got home, he had to be restrained by my dad and boyfriend multiple times to prevent him assaulting me a third time, and even spat at me. He threatened to kill me when I said I was going to phone the police. He tried to defend himself by saying I provoke people. Right.\n\nSo, as you can tell, he's not an ideal person to be around. And my dad knows this. But he does little to nothing. When he moved in with us, he told me that things would change. His anger problem would be addressed, his basic inability to function like a normal adult wouldn't be tolerated, etc. Of course these turned out to be just words. My dad feels as though his hands are tied, and in a way, I get it. He doesn't want to have to kick out - or even threaten to kick out - his son. But the problem is, he's going to have to end up choosing between the two of us, because I can't tolerate it. Every day there is another thing I have to bring to my dads attention, and he's no longer interested in hearing it and tells me to give it a rest. He says I'm being unfair and that there's nothing he can do. Am I an asshole for pursuing it? I have to live here too. In fact, I've lived with my dad since I was 12, and only continue to live here as I'm a student and can't afford to move out. To be honest with you, I'm scared of my brother 70% of the time, and don't feel safe or comfortable in my own home, which makes me really sad. Am I overreacting? What should I do?\n\nTL/DR: my elder brother is loud, messy and aggressive, and I want my dad to act on it.",

      "description": "Wondering if AITA and also need some advice. My girlfriend and I met at work (psych unit in bigger hospital) she was a student on a clinical. We started dating after she had finished her clinical. Fast forward few months, she applied for and got a job on the unit I worked on. Because it was different shifts and my old role required travel we rarely saw each other. Fast forward to now (at this point now dating 1.5 years) I tried out for US Navy and got medically DQ'd at basic (still dating GF). Came back and basically told all my former employers what happened and that I'm looking for work. The unit my GF works on (where I used to work) immediately told me they would hire me back, only this time we would work similar shifts and roles(so likely work together closely). I really want to take this position over other offers I have as I love the unit, the management is great, and the colleagues are amazing. It's also much safer than other hospitals I have worked at (I've always worked in psychiatric care and this is the best workplace I have had). I was very forward with management about relationship and they said HR okayed us working together and they are cool with it because of my good work history there and professionalism. Only my GF doesn't want me to work there, she says she feels this way because she doesn't want to mix her personal/professional life, she feels it's \"her workspace\" now, and is worried about other coworkers talking about us/watching us under a microscope. Am I the asshole for taking this job despite my GF not wanting me to?",

      "description": "Hi everyone, firstly I love my girlfriend more than anyone else; I can honestly say she is an amazing and beautiful woman. We’ve been together around 8-9 months and we where best friends before for about 5ish years. \n\nHowever..... the one huge issue is she is religious, she come from a Muslim family/upbringing and I’m from a mainly atheist one. While I have no issue with religion, I’ve never really found any reason to follow it and I kinda think in this age it does more harm than good. I love her and i told her I’d do anything for her; including converting (I have to convert to be with her, or else we couldn’t be together). I tried to look into religion with an open mind but every time I think about it I feel sick; I just think it’s kinda wrong (please not tryna upset people here, it’s just my personal opinion) \n\nSo now I’m at the stage where I’m beginning to doubt we can work; I feel like I could either be with her and live a lie as a Muslim, and raise Muslim kids or we could go our separate ways and I’ll feel destroyed and also immensely guilty for hurting her, and it would hurt her badly. She is my best friend and I said I could become religious for her but after looking into it I can honestly say to me at lest none of it makes sense. \n\nOn top of this I’m gunna move out from home soon (I’m 24 and just graduated; about to start my career) and my gf desperately wants to get married- as she feels sinful being with me, I said I’d be okay with getting married soon but thinking about becoming Muslim makes me feel desperately unhappy. Part of me thinks it too soon as well. \n\nSo am I the asshole for feeling this way, I feel torn between the woman I love who I want to be with but it comes with the caveat of following something I struggle to believe in. I feel like to be with her I’d be living a lie. I truly wanted to embrace the religion but I couldn’t and now I’m lying to her that I’m okay with it.  ",

      "description": "I and some friends have an roleplay story in a chat. It's a word where B and M have been working on since youth and are very attached to. A few years later L got added, then my BF, B's GF, I got in, GF left a rampage that tore our friend group, now everything seems fine again.\n\nThe story itself is like a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, but with the exeption being that M is the DM (dungeon master, guy running the game) and also the main PC (player character, in our case, we have multiple at once). And this frustrates me. M wants to be the main protagonist, the main antagonist, every important plot NPC and B and L are totally fine with it. But they also get to have more everything. They are more important. \n\nMy BF and I have spoken about this, he also sees we get sidelined but he is less confrontational than I am and we as a group have had discussions about this before. They say I stick too much to history and real world logic and want too much reason in it while they \"just\" want to have fun. \n\nI talked with them too after I basically got an anxiety breakdown trying to introduce a new character in a fightscene, but I couldn't because I knew she was going to be ignored, belittled and pushed to the sideline. Like the others. We talked and they tried to be friendly and helpful saying that if I had questions I just need to ask or if I get stuck or feel something isn't right just to say it. \"It's an rp, we want to have fun together\" but they don't put action behind those words.\n\nThen there is tonight. B started a fightscene with his evil child of a demonlord. M steps in telling us to stop because he can't be there (nevermind the thousand times L, BF or me ask for a pause because of something). B ignores this and BF and I use our goodguy demonlord child sisters to fight B.\nAnd he completely ignores any attack we make, prefering to taunt our PC's. \nI'd say that since the sisters and B's PC are of equal powerlevel, the fight should be in BF and my advantage or at least equal, but no. I text B asking why the fight is going like it is and he ignores it completely and after BF got destroyed and his PC almost dying I'm done and I tell BF so. I'm being ignored, he's destroyed and B seems to have the time of his life with his power fantasy. \n\nAfter the fight is over B sents me eight messages explaining why his PC got to do what he did and we didn't, from a non-existant powerdifference between the demonparents to \"but the bad guy is supposed to be stronger\". It doesn't matter what his excuse is, they do this with all that isn't theirs.\n\nI feel like they dragged me into this story just to get NPC's to work off of, without caring about other people and what they might want. They act like being included is a gift. That all I see is my problem. It honestly makes me feel like I'm not even wanted here.\n\nAITA for wanting to have some control in the game, stable laws and a feeling of inclusion?\nI feel like I'm emotionally exaggerating or being arrogant for wanting this.",

      "title": "AITA for giving my friend edibles on top of her first LSD trip",
      "description": "My roommate Erin and I decided to trip LSD together a few weekends ago. It was Erin's first time with LSD and my third. Our friends Morgan and Maddie joined us to babysit. \n\nOn a Saturday around 1pm Erin and I take the tabs and have a fun time wandering around. By about 9pm, the acid was wearing off and we all laid on the couches. Erin and I weren’t seeing any visuals anymore, but we both said we still could feel ‘shiney’ still, as in still felt remnants.\n\nMorgan and Maddie were off in another room talking while Erin and I were on the couch. I ask Erin if she wants to smoke with me (to get a last little bump from the trip). She declined right away (she doesn’t like smoking). She then asked if I had any more edibles. I did, so I grabbed one for each of us and we chomped them down. ‘They’re gonna be mad’, Erin laughed. I laughed too and we joked about it being our secret.\n\nThe girls rejoin us and we keep watching TV. About an hour later Erin sits up and grabs my arm: ‘it just hit me’, she gasped.\n\n‘What hit her? What’s going on?!’ The girls demand. We tell them we took edibles. They are unhappy with this choice.\n\nErin grabbed her head and told us she was getting paranoid. I get her some water. It doesn’t help; she’s in a bad place, spiraling out. I take her for a walk and sit with her by the kitchen table. She can hold a conversation and can follow what’s happening on TV, but it having a terrible time. I feel miserable about the whole thing- paranoia is terrible but it’s something you have to just wait out to feel better, so all I can do is sit with Erin and wait for it to pass.\n\nMorgan and Maddie announce they’re going for a drive. I say okay. They leave.\n\nAfter about 90 minutes of paranoia, Erin finally calms down but is really shaken up by the whole thing. We talk about it for a while until she is calm enough to joke a little about the night. We watch a little more tv then both go to bed.\n\nMaddie and Morgan never came back. I snapped Maddie to ask where they were, and she replied that she had gone downtown and that Morgan went home. Morgan didn’t text or call at all.\n\nThe next morning, Morgan calls me and bitches me out for giving Erin drugs. She says it was stupid of me to give her an edible and that I was an asshole because I knew she was already on meds for a sinus infection paired with her first trip, that my carelessness put Erin in a ton of danger, that I didn’t care at all about Erin’s well being, that I’m a bad friend, that it's disrespectful of me to not ask or tell her or Maddie about the edibles until something bad happened. I think she's overreacting, she thinks I don't understand the severity of my actions.\n\nI need some perspective: am I the asshole Morgan thinks I am?\n\nTLDR; Erin and I drop acid together. 8 hours later, I give her an edible to boost the end of the trip. She gets super paranoid for 90mn. Our sober friend blames my thoughtlessness for endangering Erin and says I’m an asshole.",

I’m a very introverted person and she’s very aware of this fact and has even said it several times herself. When I get home, all I want is to stay by myself in peace and quiet. After work/spending time with friends, I get worn out socializing. I’ve brought this up to her a few times, but nothing comes of it.\n\nIt wouldn’t be this hard to tolerate, but every time she tries to talk to me, it’s just irritating. Given the chance, she will jump into a political rant with views I don’t agree with (she also knows this.) Her views on politics, and life in general, are pretty far fetched and we’ve had many arguments in the past about these types of topics.\n\nI’m not sure if I’m an asshole for wanting privacy and silence, as it’s a vital part to my mental health. Maybe I’m looking at this wrong, so I’m posting here to possibly get a different perspective on this. If I left out any details or if you have a question I’ll try my best to respond. Thanks!",

Also , when I wanted to vent about something , she was never there.. fast forward a bit, she has a different job with better pay , and not once has she invited me out to do anything.

      "description": "This was a while ago but I will still omit details for anonymity.\n\nFrom the title many of you would immediately answer yes, but now for the context.  \n\nI was with an on and off relationship with this person for about 2 years, I had previous relationships, never had trust issues with any of them.  The girl in question had even told me on several occasions that I was the most trusting boyfriend she had ever had and that it was one of her favorite things about me.  After about one month of dating she broke up with me and told me she wasnt ready for a relationship, about a few days later she was dating a man who she had told me was just a friend while we were dating, I had convinced myself with her help (reasons why she broke up with me) that I just wasn't being a good enough boyfriend.  I went back to dating other people but remaining single.  A few months later they had broken up and she came back to me telling me he was so awful etc and we gave it another shot.  As you would imagine my friends and family were now very skeptical of her, I had to defend her to them saying how I wasn't very good to her etc.  Anywho we end up dating for another 8 months and I suddenly was dumped again for weak reasons that seemed made up since she hadn't mentioned them before (turns out he had \"leverage\" over her), well what do you know another guy that was just a friend while we were dating is her new boyfriend a week later, I was able to win her back a week later (I feel pathetic writing this out I know).  My friends and family of course saw her for who she was and hated her but yet again naive gaslighted me had to defend her.  The relationship survived until we lived together for a period of time when I slowly realized how I had been played, idk it was some kind of slow forming epiphany.  I even had a doctor appointment for experiencing weird health symptoms which the doctor suggested was a physical manifestation of psychological stress.  I denied this but in retrospect he was a genius since the symptoms disappeared after I dumped her a few months later.  In my heart I still loved her but my brain had had enough clearly, I was literally destroying myself inside.  A week after dumping her I was on my laptop and noticed her chrome account was still logged into the browser, the entire past 2 years I had spent wondering whether my trust issues were just paranoia and if I was just another one of those crazy boyfriends but I could have the answers at my fingertips, I honestly couldn't resist.  I know what you're thinking (the truth will only be more pain, dont do it) to which I would disagree with you because in retrospect I could know that it wasn't my fault, the truth set me free.  I logged in and found proof of her cheating, not just on me, on her previous bf too, and that she was lying to the guy she was currently seeing about the fact she was also still sleeping with the guy she cheated on me with.  The guy she cheated on me with told her about how he wished I knew about what they did together.  Waves of rage overcame me, but the illusion had been shattered, I knew now what happened, that I wasn't crazy, and that the people in front of me were just truly despicable people, this was a guy that I shook hands with, that I let hang out with my gf because I was trusting.  I screencapped everything, I wasn't going to let this happen to another dude.  I sent the logs to the new guy she was seeing, explained who I was, and that was that, I wasn't interested in being with her again, maybe I wanted vengeance partially, but most of all if I could've had someone send me that and avoid the past 2 years of my life I would've given anything to have that.  In the end I got a title XI complaint from the university and was scared shitless but I would still do it all over again, there was no contact following the sent pictures and a thank you from the guy.  No one knows about it except the parties involved, sometimes I worry about what my friends and family would think so I guess I just want reddits opinion given the context AITA?",

      "description": "So here's a rather short story compared to others here. There's a girl I go to highschool with I always just assumed she was one of the special education students cause (I thought) she had a really noticable speech impediment as well as the fact that I always hangs out with some of the other special Ed students at lunch and I've only ever had her in my open classes (open is the identifier for courses that meant to be passable by anyone. The classification is mostly used for art and religion courses). So today she had a presentation in our religion class it was a break down of a song any way she chose a song that wasn't English and at the beginning of the presentation somebody asked what language it was and she said she didn't know but that it wasn't English and wasn't German. I thought it was weird that she mentioned German and then it all made sense. It's not a speech impediment it's a German accent (confirmed by actually paying attention and Listening to the presentation. Previous to this I had only ever heard her respond to questions with just a word or two, I had never actually heard her really speak a lot) I mean this doesn't prove or disprove my the possibility of being a special Ed student (not that it really matters). I guess the real question is am I an asshole for mistaking an accent for a speech impediment? \n\nPs. I never acted, treated or thought any differently about this person based on my assumption ",

      "description": "So there's this little pizza place right next to my apartment. The food is quality, it's cheap, and has great hours open until 3am. Except one catch - the service.\n\nNearly every time I go in there, even at normal times, the cashier counter is completely deserted. Everyone's in the back hanging out or whatever, when they aren't even busy (it's often empty). Sometimes I have to wait as long as 20-30 minutes (yes) for a person to show up, not kidding... unless I yell loud enough to get their attention. Or bang on the counter, shake the tip jar... anything that'll make noise. They used to have a bell but they got rid of it, replaced it with a \"camera\" though it seems useless if they never pay attention to it. It's basically just a waiting game for them to come out of hiding and socializing in the back.\n\nLuckily the other factors haven't stopped me from giving them business, but I was getting kinda aggravated having to deal with the above every single time. So I had a great idea - pulling out my phone, I searched \"loud alarm noise\" on youtube, found a great 10 minute loop of something, played it on full volume blast.\n\nThat did the trick and summoned them, they didn't seem all that peeved by it. Have repeated this a couple other times, works like a charm.\n\nBut... I feel kinda bad, AITA for it though?",

      "description": "It as late at night and me and my FWB were cuddling. At this point we had been regularly sleeping together for at least 6 months, often late in the night. Normally when we get to it, there is no mention of consent, but as I noticed she seemed to be particularly sleepy at this point I decided to ask before I made any moves. I asked if I could remove her underwear as well as give her oral, both of which she said yes to sleepily. I did not think much of it at the time but I noticed after a few minutes that her breathing had changed and thought she might be asleep so I stopped and asked her if I should stop altogether. Instantly she begins tearing up, saying that I had just sexually assaulted her. I was gutted, as hurting her is the last thing I would want to do. I was under the impression that everything had been consensual. The night took a turn for the worst. I went home and saw later in the week that she had posted \"me too\", so it is clear she still considers the incident to be assault. I have since apologized and been forgiven. It has been probably a year at this point since the incident and it has not really been mentioned at all. In addition we still regularly sleep together.\n I have to know however, was I in the wrong for not recognizing how tired she was, and if so was this sexual assault? What is the point in asking for consent if consent does not mean consent? It might be important to know there was no alcohol involved. This has been bugging me ever since. ",

I took a large broccoli out of my plate and threw it at his shirt he gets angry quite fast and it suddenly not as funny when something is done to him . And then the guys who i was sitting with seemingly give me that's not cool look but didn't give a shit when he was bothering me  , I tried to say sorry but it's your own damn fault , but when he was cleaning off the sauce that was accompanying the broccoli these guys were like get the hell out of here and we're physically pushing me to leave . After that I just left , I honestly don't feel guilty at all about what I did. For anyone wondering these aren't the cool kid/bully friend group but just dickheads . ( These guys were honestly nice at the beginning asking me to sit with them and etc but thank you for showing me who you really are)",

      "description": "So recently my boyfriend (soon to be husband) and I moved away from each other to save money to get married and be closer to our places of work. This involved me moving back in with my parents and younger siblings. I pay my parents rent for my room in exchange for letting me move back in with them.\n\nI haven't lived there for 7 years and it feels hard for me (I moved out very young). My mom is something of a 'helicopter parent' and I don't get a lot of personal space. E.g. If she wants me to eat something but i don't want to, she won't leave me alone about it until I physically leave the house (otherwise she will follow me around). It's the same with a lot of other things (if I sit down or start doing something in a certain place where she doesn't want me to, if I suggest a lifestyle change I want to make and she doesn't want me to) I can't take time to myself in my room because she will let herself in. Locking myself in the bathroom doesn't work because she just knocks on the door and will talk to me through the door. My dad isn't often around and isn't bothered so much by her behaviour. She tries to make me do unreasonable things if she feels like that's the solution for a 'problem' which 9 times out of 10 isn't a problem and rather her getting caught up in her thoughts.\n\nI am mentally exhausted because my mom has no filter and is controlling to a degree. It's one of the reasons I left in the first place. She cares about me however she's not interested in me as a person which is the sticking point. I don't expect her to be, but the conversation is always so one sided because the moment I bring up something I am interested in while she is talking at me, she changes the subject again without acknowledging it.\n\nThe reason I am explaining this is to give some backstory on something that has been happening in the past 8 weeks. There are squirrels in the loft - getting in and nesting right above where I sleep. It means that I cannot get to sleep until 3/4am when I have to be up at 6am and it started to make me unwell. I hear them scuttling and knowing at the beams, ripping up the insulation and recently the ceiling started crumbling so I started taking my blanket and sleeping in the spare room (used for storage) to try and rest because I was only getting about 3 hours sleep.\n\nHere's what happened afterwards. I have told my parents several times that the squirrels are going to seriously damage the attic and I can hear them ripping the insulation but they just ignore me and will only validate it when they hear it themselves:\n\n- I got kicked out the spare room because one of my siblings had a guest, so I started sleeping at my boyfriend's house from time to time which is an hours drive away, and staying with friends where I can. Also on my parents sofa.\n- My mom has now said I may stay in the storage room but only for sleeping. I am not allowed to put my belongings in there.\n- As I am not sleeping in my room until the squirrels are dealt with, my sister has now agreed with my mom that she can have my mattress (because she wants to put a double bed in her own room) leaving me no option to stay in the storage room for sleeping only for the forseeable. \n- Removing my ability to sleep in my own room means that they can prolong getting the squirrels dealt with (my mom initially didn't want to disturb them in case they had babies). I'm terrified the ceiling will eventually fall down and cost them a lot of money.\n\nI'm getting more and more upset with my situation and I feel so displaced, probably because I'm tired. I know this isn't my home anyway, but I don't have a choice but to live here while I pay off my debts unless I spend more money moving into a room on my own. I have offered to get pest control in myself but my mom doesn't want me to do that.\n\nTl;Dr moved back in with parents, paying rent for a room I can't use because of a pest problem. They've now taken my mattress from that room, removing my ability to sleep in that room completely. AITA for being upset and angry at my parents?",

My son thought it was hilarious. I took a moment to explain to my child that this is something you should NEVER do, etc., then sent him upstairs to play. I said to my bf that I didn't appreciate that, and he should know it, and said he needed to have more regard for what he does around such an impressionable mind. He became incredulous and stated that he doesn't do inappropriate things in front of the child, so I mentioned his little jokes that aren't age-appropriate and his cursing. He stated that he thinks it doesn't matter if you drop gratuitous f-bombs around a child, as long as you teach them that it isn't okay to repeat them. I just want to avoid to headache until he's older and will understand social boundaries better. This ended with \"I'm going to curse in front of him, whether you like it or not.\" I'm, like, stupid mad. Does that make me an asshole? \n\nBackground: I have been with this man for all but 6 months of my son's life. We have plans to get married. He's great at teaching my son things, and very calm and level-headed with him. His sense of humor is inappropriate for a child, in my opinion, but he's a good person. ",

I don’t really know them and I feel extremely uncomfortable living with strangers (albeit they are her friends).  Should I just be a nice guy and feel weird in my own home during that time or am I the asshole for even feeling this way. Thanks ",

On Christmas day we had a big fight and I asked them to leave my home. My sister-in-law went online and posted all sorts of trash about me, even though the fight was between my brother and myself and I reached out to her to apologize as soon as they left. They are in their early forties and recently moved out of my parents front bedroom after 6 months \"between apartments\". They constantly take advantage of my parents, and at one point the two of them ganged up on my mother and yelled at her for taking my side regarding the Christmas fight. I decided on Christmas that they would no longer be welcome in my home, but after seeing how they behaved and other things they have done I have decided to cut them out of my life completely.\n\nI am now getting a lot of guilt from my mother to show her some kindness, because her father passed away due to his own actions last week. I feel bad for her, and I know my mother is really hurting about the way my brother and I are towards each other, but I just can't seem to get past the way they treated me and my family on Christmas, or all the times they have taken advantage of my parents.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for skipping my sister-in-laws fathers funereal?",

I'm an adult now and know how important tips are in our service industy. That being said, when I arrived at the restuarant I ordered a tea as a beverage. I received the tea by a nice woman around my age, thinking all is well I began to drink my tea. That's when I noticed there was food in my glass (a small piece of lettuce, I hadn't even ordered food yet) I immediately felt sick, but I really wanted this places food, so I showed it to the waitress who apologized and gave me a new glass. I inspected all of the dishware I received after that. After eating and receiving the bill, I saw that I was being charged for the drink. I dont like confrontation so I just paid and left a note on the receipt that said \"Dont serve a customer a drink with someone elses food and then charge me for it!\" with a 0 on the tip line.

      "description": "So, I am a music student at a public university. The past two years we have had a visiting professor for the instrument I play. In this time, he has threatened to fail multiple people for mundane reasons, encourages hazing of \"lazy\" students (also known as students with jobs), and has told students they should leave and never come back if they have to have a job and not commit to the instrument. \n\nThe final straw was earlier this semester, when he told all of his students minus the few he was targeting to isolate the rest of us. He said we were unethical in our practice sessions, a bad influence to the studio, and shouldn't be there. The funny thing is, this worked. Out of the 21 people on the instrument, 6 of us (including myself) were completely ignored except when we were being harassed to quit. \n\nI'm a senior, and so are two others. One of the other 3 are dropping out after this semester because of this. The other two are trying to stick through it, but one of them is a freshman and her mental health is taking a decline. She is being treated the worst; these other students have been cornering her and telling her she's worthless, and no one likes her, and she should quit. Basically your typical high school bullying, except the teacher told them to do this and we're all adults.\n\nThere is currently a search for a permanent position, and this professor is a finalist. In retaliation, I and everyone else being harassed wrote formal letters describing everything that has happened to us. We have also spoken to multiple people on the hiring committee and the dean of the music building. I took it one step further and went outside of the school of music to talk to the dean of students, who specifically deals with students' well beings. \n\nI don't think this teacher is coming back. The reason why I'm wondering if ITA is because if this professor leaves, a lot of students are leaving as well, which hurts the school. The harassment may also get worse if they know it's my fault that he isn't coming back.",

      "description": "Alright guys here's the context: I'm (25f) spending the weekend at my BF's (28) house, and with BF's permission, I brought a puppy that I've been fostering along with me for socialization purposes. BF has 2 dogs at his house, one of the dog is an untrained 1yo pinscher who belongs to his sister (32) and the other is a well trained 9yo poodle who belongs to his roommate (28f). \n\n\nI live in a state that allows recreational marijuana usage and brought a 500mg edible with me for the evening time to help me sleep. It was wrapped up in it's wrapper, in a closed bag, inside my duffle bag, which was zipped up and sitting on top of the highest point in bf's room. The only dog allowed in bf's room is my puppy, due to the fact that's she's potty pad trained and the other ones are not and have a history of pooping and peeing on his carpet in his room. \n\n\nFriday no issues.\n\n\nSaturday evening BF and I want to go out for a date so we ask roommate if she would be okay with watching the puppy while we went out from 8-10:30pm. She agreed happily and said it would be no issue so I got puppy's food/water/supplies out and closed the doors to all the vacant rooms (bf's bedroom, bathroom, etc). When we left the house BF's sister was home and had her dog inside the house, puppy and the pinscher we're playing nicely in the living room. No calls through the date, we assume all is good. When we arrive home, puppy is in good spirits, no mess in the living room, and roommate says all was good. Within a few minutes of being home we notice BF's sister's dog lying on the other couch drooling excessively and isn't responding to us calling her. Normally this is a really excitable, responsive dog so we know something is wrong within 5 minutes. We see that there are bits of a bitten up styrofoam plate under the dog and in her mouth. This dog has a well documented history of pulling trash out the trashcan and eating it so we think the dog ate a plate and can't process it. \n\nBF's sister had gone to work while we were out and didn't put her dog out in the yard or ask roommate to watch it, so we call sister because it's her dog and we want to know what she wants us to do (vet bills can be expensive). Well, sister panics and doesn't know what to do so she calls BF's mom to come fix it. It's 11pm BFs mom drags her hubby &amp; 2 12-14yo sons over to pick up the dog and take it to the vet (which we could've done but sister didn't tell us to because she was panicking so bad). We get an update from bf's mom an hour later saying she has a lot of thc in her system and she's farting and burping a lot. BF immediately goes to his room and sees that my duffle bag is ripped/chewed through, my belongings are chewed on and spread everywhere and the wrapper for the edible is on the bed with bitemarks all through it. It's clear what happened.\n\nSo sisters dog is home from the vet, she got a major high going on, but other than that the vet said she is fine. BF's mom and sister are pissed at me and bf. AITA?",

My sister did not as she actually lives in the city where the wedding is taking place.\n\nMy sister has now asked to share my hotel room with me, which I said was fine as long as we split the bill. She disagreed however, and claimed I should still foot the entire bill myself since I was already planning on staying there anyway. She also made a point that I earn more money than her and can easily afford the hotel room myself, while she can't afford the room or even half of it. I stood my ground and said she would still need to pay her share, to which she said I was being a bitch.\n\nAITA for expecting the bill to be split 50/50 despite our different financial situations?",

      "description": "So there’s an event that’s being put on by an organization I work with. Last week on Friday of the members of said organization asked if I was going, and I made a comment about not really being able to afford it. She then suggested I volunteer, which would grant me entry to the event for free. I know at least one of the volunteers and it’s for a good cause, so I said I would be interested, but needed more information (like details on times, roles available, etc). She sent out an email that same day to the volunteer organizer and cc’d me on it saying I was interested. I did not receive anything further and assumed they were full up. Coincidentally a friend is also having her birthday party on the same day, so I figured it all worked out for the best since now I could attend.\n\nThe event is tomorrow. Today, towards the end of my shift, the same woman I’d originally talked to asked if I would be there. I said I never got a response. As she was leaving out the door she said she would email him- I told her not to bother since it was so last minute, but she was literally walking away from me and I don’t think she heard me. I was about to go home when I got an email for the event organizer. He apologized for the delay, and then said they still needed volunteers so he’d gone ahead and signed me up. He then said we could chat further about what role I would like to volunteer in.\n\nAgain, the event is literally tomorrow. I get that they need help, and I was willing to volunteer in the first place. But now I have other plans, and I don’t really want to cancel them. I was also a little taken aback that he just assumed I would still be interested and available, and just signed me up without asking. It’s a great event and I don’t want to be rude or leave the in a lurch, but I don’t feel like I was treated very respectfully. I’m honestly considering replying and saying that I won’t be able to go, and to please remove me from the list. Does choosing my friend’s birthday over volunteer work make me an asshole?",

Sometimes I'll go a week without seeing him since it can get super busy and we're both just too tired after work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe also haven't had sex or any form of it. The furthest we've gone is making out (one time) and I'll let him grab my butt or breast or whatever. I'm not a very physical person and I just am not interested in sexual contact with anyone. I've been over this with him and was straight and said I'm only having sex when I am good and ready, and that's not going to be for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, the other day I realize I haven't seen him in a while so I text him saying, let's go to the pool after you get off! He agrees, I get showered, get in a swimsuit and put clothes over it, and find him. He changes the plan and we go to another coworker's place, where he's already been hanging out at for a while before coming to get me. We're there for two hours, he's been drinking the whole time and likely an hour or so before that. So he is pretty drunk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we leave the coworker's place, we go to his room to crash for the night. I get out of my swimsuit and back into normal clothes. Didn't wear underwear under my sweatpants. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe go to sleep and I wake up to his hand down my pants and his finger in my labia. I immediately rolled over and went under the covers; he didn't wake up. I had to get up at 5:30 for work and I just left, haven't really seen him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I'm probably overreacting and he was likely drunk. But I'm also concerned maybe it would escalate in the future? My mom would tell me I'm being a prude, so would my friends.

      "description": "As title implys I'm a college kid living on campus. I'm a third year so I've had my fair share of RAs who either dont care or care too much. This is my first RA that i get along with really well, we knew each other beforehand as well.  \n\nRecently I have been having some issues with them not being an RA to our housemates. We live in a apartment and have 5 housemates, on top of everything we live in trans-inclusive housing, so issues of body image/gender disphoria/euphoria are topics that come up. My RA has recently started working out with the new year. And counting calories. And grabbing their stomach. And constantly talking about how fat they are. \n\nProblem is, I'm the \"fattest\" one in the apartment. Weight wise I am by far the biggest one in the apartment and everyone else is thin without trying, and my RA could be chubby but that would be pushing it. Now, i understand that everyone is allowed to have their own issues, and my RA is just trying to get support. They have a history with eating disorders and so they get plenty of it because most of our personal apartment has some sort of mental health disorder - including me. And they arent mean, they never comment on my weight, even compliment me on my body. But they comment negatively on their body at least 3 times daily and are constantly talking about their eating habits. If i enter a conversation with them its a 9/10 chance that their weight tranier, eating habits, or weight gain will be brought up.\n\nI was never planning on saying anything, but last night i had a dream. And in this dream my size became the focus point. I kept gaining weight and people would say i look fine but then say how big they are and i had to sit by and look the way i did and compliment them. Its starting to affect how i view my body. I used to care very little and just worry about if im being healthy over my size. But now i worry about how much fat i can grab, ive stopped eating due to stress. I need to no longer be in this environment. \n\nWIBTA if i ask them to stop? I would also need to talk to their boss because i live with the RA so any issues that i dont feel comfortable talking with a housemate about would normally call for an RA but if its an issue with a housemate that is my RA would call their boss in.

      "description": "i was college roommates with my best friend of 10 years. her parents bought a townhouse where her and i lived. there was no official lease but i paid rent monthly.\n\nmy roommate knew i loved and wanted a cat but i never bothered pursuing it. one day she tells me she’s scheduled a day to adopt a cat. i was taken aback because she said it like it was a set decision made before consulting me. i even asked her if i was allowed to come along. she then said yes and that she wanted the cat to be OUR cat, but she was planning to not tell her parents because she was pretty sure they wouldn’t allow it.\n\nwhen we go to pick out a cat it becomes obvious to me that although she said it’d be our cat (meaning i help pay for it) she wasn’t willing to compromise or take my input into consideration. we ended up not picking a cat that day because of this so i thought it was just TBD.\n\nabout a week later she tells me she went back to SIGN PAPERS to officially adopt the cat she wanted WITHOUT consulting me. she then said that she realized she really didn’t have the money or time for a cat and didn’t wanna go against her parents in the end so she didn’t go through with it. i understood but i viewed this as an open door to bring up me getting a cat because i did have the money and time (i’d been researching getting a prescription for an ESA well before this as i was dealing with some mental health issues) i asked her if she thought that if i spoke to her parents about getting one they’d be receptive.\n\nshe said “i don’t know, that’s between you and them and i think you should approach that on a landlord/tenant basis.”\n\ni said “oh okay, i’ve been researching getting an ESA and they’re legally granted housing so technically as landlords they couldn’t keep me from having one.”\n\ni regret this now as i see how it could have come off harsh (not at all how i meant it). even if i approached getting the cat through an ESA i would have still made sure they were okay with it and if they weren’t then i wouldn’t have gotten one.\n\nafter that convo she gave me the silent treatment and after weeks of being confused and not being able to take the silence i text her asking if she’s upset with me.\n\nshe said “tbh i was just really disappointed and hurt with the decision you made regarding the cat situation knowing that it would cause a rift with my parents and with me”\n\ni saw the whole thing as a miscommunication so i asked her if we could talk about it the next day. we never got to that as the next morning her mom called mine saying they “sold the townhouse” and i need to be out in the next 2 months. everyone i know agreed that this was probably a lie to just kick me out. although i had no family, car or money at the time (which she knew) i moved out within two weeks and she treated me like shit the whole time. this was a year ago and we haven’t talked since.\n\ni want to know cause i’m still confused to this day, was i the asshole?",

      "description": "So my 9 year old son has been diagnosed with ADHD since he started Kindergarten.  His energy is definitely off the charts, but I think a lot of it is just that he is a little boy.  They are supposed to be high energy after all.  Anyway, of course the answer to this from the Dr is to give him meds, Adderall to be specific.  In case you aren't aware the meds for ADD/ADHD are methamphetamines.  I have always had a huge problem with giving him these meds, but apparently I'm the asshole for fighting the doctor and wife all along the way to the point where I finally just give in and give him his meds every morning.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I will admit that it has helped him with focusing in school, but not so much any more.  So what is the first thing my wife and doctor says?  You guessed it, more meds!  So I have put my foot down and let her and the doctor know and document that I am very against medicating him.  I told my wife that I find it sort of disturbing how OK she is for wanting to keep giving him these meds.  What do you guys think?",

You can’t just be assuming genders like that, it’s really disrespectful and rude.” At first, i thought she was joking so I chuckled. But then, she asked “What are you laughing at? Gender equality isn’t a joke. And besides, if she was a girl, she’d probably be better then you.” At this point, I just went quiet because I didn’t really want to waste my mental energy arguing with a person that I don’t know how I’m not sexist.\n\nAlso, the person next to her turned around and said “Sorry about her, she’s just really passionate about this kind of stuff.”\n\nWith all that, Am I the asshole?",

(Mobile)\n(Some things will be intentionally vague to make it impossible to figure out who this is)\n\nMy mom, little sister and I emigrated to the United States from a third world country in 2011. My mother left everything. Her job, all her possessions, her family, and her husband. My little sister was diagnosed with a serious medical condition when she was 6, and we couldn’t get her proper medical care where we were, so that’s why my mom decided to leave (among other reasons, but that was the main one.)\n\nMy mother is incredibly religious. I was outed to her as gay when I was 13, and she was expectedly furious. She isolated me from all of my friends and took away all my social media/electronics. She’s made me meet with countless priests in hopes of “curing” me, and she took me to a convent because she thought I was possessed by a gay demon. \n\nMy situation has gotten better over the years and she’s treating me better, although it’s only because she’s in denial, and anytime my sexuality is brought up her mood is instantly turned, and she often cries. I know there’s nothing wrong with my sexuality, but my mom is heartbroken.\n\nI’ve dreamt about moving out for years. I’m in a healthy relationship with someone in a similar situation, and we’ve both agreed after we have stable jobs and started our careers, we would move out together. Our families will completely disown us and never talk to us again, so we have to make sure we can support ourselves and each other.\n\nDespite her faults, my mom has sacrificed everything for me and my sister. She’s been working multiple jobs just to be able to support me and my sister, and she would literally take clothes off her own back for either one of us. Me and my sister are the only people my mom has in the world, and I feel like me leaving would be a complete and utter betrayal, she will be devastate and I’m afraid she might even have a heart attack or some other illness because of it.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to leave my mom and my sister?\n",

He first said hello to me, and then I said hello back and asked him about the book he was reading. We hit it off, and it was a lengthy bus ride. We shared life stories and such. We got off at the same stop because he happened to live on the beach where I was going to swim. After departing, he asked for my number, and said he'd like to grab a beer with me sometime.

I honestly think that this could just be a good friendship, but I feel weird about it. He's a single man, who doesn't have a family or wife, who used to be a high school teacher. I looked him up in the local sex offender catalogue and he wasn't there thankfully. \nI feel like an asshole for being so suspicious of him. Some part of me thinks I'm right to be so cautious and assume the worst, but another part of me thinks I'm a shitty person for giving into the old pedo guy stereotype.  \n\nI'm not sure if I should go for dinner with him. My friends would think I'm weird for hanging out with an older guy (I usually talk to most older people I meet on the bus), so I don't want to ask a friend to go with me.

      "description": "I have an older sister that was **very** mean and discouraging when we were younger, she'd call me a retard and stuff constantly and to make it worse at the time I was \"that\" kid everybody hated in school so I was bullied a lot.\n\nNow so far there's not been anything too unusual, I mean brothers and sisters getting on each others nerves happens all the time and is not really a big deal, the critical difference in my perception is that she didn't team up with me against the others in my class, she teamed up with **them** making the experience *much* worse *on top* of doing her best to put me down at any opportunity (Yeah, I'm still pissed about all this). I never managed to see a psychologist about this but I'm convinced I was depressed at the time because of this (I won't go on why I believe that, this post is long enough as it is, suffice to say I had to teal with suicidal thoughts and other stuff for a good chunk of my childhood, entire adolescence and the first couple years as an adult).\n\nSo when I was 15 I finally snapped and shouted that I never wanted to talk to her again and did my best to have as little contact with her as possible, which at the time was great for my mental health (on top of graduating shortly after and leaving the toxic environment that my school was for me and the luck that my sister seemed to take my distance from her as a challenge).\n\nNow the reason I'm posting this is because after we became adults (we're in our late 20's now) I noticed my sister seems to regret what she did and since our early 20's has tried to be the sister she never were, she smiles and hugs me on family events (the only moments we're together as we don't live in the same house anymore) buys nice christmas and birthday presents every year (she has a very good salary), asks our parents how I'm doing since she knows asking me directly wouldn't work, wants to see movies and TV shows with we during said family get-togethers and so on.\n\nSo now with christmas closing in my parents have been making pressure for me to just forget how she was in the past and stop killing the good mood with my long face and constantly keeping her at arm's length, to top it off my sister's boyfriend is a great guy and I worry a lot about me being an asshole to him since I mostly have to keep him at arm's length as well since he and my sister are together all the time for obvious reasons.",

      "description": "Didn't really know how else to word it. A while ago, my roommate quit his job and was unemployed for months. During that time, I picked up all of our shared finances save for rent which included house necessities, take out, snacks, groceries and etc. I only make about $8.70 an hour and the majority of my checks were about $200 weekly, so I didn't mind too much since he was unemployed and I had some disposable income at the time. Even before he was unemployed though, I was the main one who was funding our outings but didn't mind. \n\nFast forward to now, I'm a bit in debt due to unrelated reasons (car, school, spending some money I thought I had but didnt and regretting it), but he now has a job which pays about $9 an hour AND he gets 10% for every item he sells. A few days ago, he asked me if I wanted to go down to the gas station to get a slushie (about 85cents a slush) and I say yes after mentioning I was EXTREMELY tight on money and can't be spending anything. He didn't say anything so I assumed maybe he didn't hear me, and I asked him if he could pay to which he says, \"What? You can't spend $2? It's YOUR turn.\" real curtly. He did previously go to Taco Bell to get himself some food and got me a taco, even though I didn't ask so I didn't think it was my turn. I didn't say any snarky comment back, but told him again that I was super tight on money. I feel like it was really rude of him to act like that towards me, especially since for the longest time I would pay for the majority of things but idk. AITA? ",

My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. ",

The beginning of our relationship was not great and that caused negative opinions to be formed between my parents and my friend. That was 3 years ago. My parents have since moved on and are trying to be more inclusive of my friend in order to repair all of our relationships. My friend is still a bit bitter about everything.\n\nThis morning, I was telling my friend a funny story about how my mom got stabbed by a cactus when we were visiting a nursery. She just rolled her eyes and said \"your mom is a dipshit.\" I told her I didn't like that she calls my mom a dipshit (she has called her a dipshit before) and I wanted her to not call her that anymore. I will admit my mom can be ditsy, but she is a very smart woman. My friend thought I was being too sensitive and got mad and a fight ensued. My friend's argument was that she calls her own mom a dipshit and a dumbass all the time. That is fine because that is her own mother and they have a relationship that that is okay. My friend and my mom don't have a great relationship and certainly not one where I feel it is okay to call my mom a dipshit. I didn't feel that calling my mom a dipshit was in good humor either. I felt that there was malice behind it. I am not sure if I am the one being too sensitive here.",

      "description": "So it was my 20th birthday not too long ago and I wanted to have some friends over for a low key party. I haven’t really enjoyed going out and drinking for the last couple of years for some personal reasons and my friends have been super understanding, so this party was a big deal to me. I even spent like $80 on a really nice cake. \n\nMy friends like to do this thing with each other called “icing” so if you find the Smirnoff ice they’ve strategically hidden for you, you HAVE to chug it on the spot while everyone yells “CHUG CHUG CHUG CHUG”. \n\nAbsolutely not my thing. \n\nAnd low and behold I get “iced”.  At first I laugh and kindly decline, but 3 of them keep pushing me to chug and they’re pulling their cameras out so they can record me chugging and post it online.  I don’t want that. I feel like the only sober one in the room at this point and I’m not having fun anymore. I keep saying no and now they’re getting mad and telling me to “seriously, just chug it.” \n\nI said no again but it doesn’t seem to make a difference. At this point everyone at the party is looking at me. I’m looking around the room for help but everyone is just looking at me. \n\nSo I started chugging. It was embarrassing. I couldn’t even get through half the drink before I needed to catch my breath and you could hear EVERYONE in the room go “awww” and then my friend posted the video on her social media. I felt like such a party pooper at my own party. The mood really went down after that. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "This is my first ever reddit post, so sorry if it’s all messed up.  \n\nFirst, some background: \nDialogue might be off because this did happen some time ago and I can’t really remember. \nMe=M   BP=B*tch Parent   \nG=Daughter of B*tch Parent\n\nSo, to begin with, this event happened when I was in the 4th grade. There is a certain event called the Lincoln Lympics for all the schools in my school district (if yk yk). Being a person who was competitive I tried out, and surprisingly, I got in. I was in the 100 yard dash. So I ran in the event and came in a terrible 5th place because I am in no means fast or athletic. I’m a little kid who’s like 4’4 and 50 lbs. When I finish the race I go to my friends but as I’m walking I see this girl  (G) throwing up. I ask her is she is ok but she’s so sick that she doesn’t even acknowledge me (which I completely understand). After I said this, her mom (BP) must’ve heard me and approaches me. Enter, B*tch Parent. \n\nM: Are you okay?!?\nG: *vomits*\nBP: DOES IT LOOK LIKE SHES OKAY YOU LITTLE SH*T?\nM: No... (irritated)\nBP: INSTEAD OF ASKING RETARDED QUESTIONS, WHY DON’T YOU F*CK OFF AND GET MY DAUGHTER A WET TOWEL!!\nM: ok? (I was surprised because a complete stranger was ordering me around to do stuff, in a rude way nonetheless, how dare THEE)\n\nSo I ran away to get the towel. When I got the towel I was so angry at that woman that I had to get her back. I had the towel and went into a bathroom to wet the towel and ran back to the woman. When I arrived I saw that G had stopped vomiting but was still crying. So with the biggest sh*t face grin, I approach the BP. \n\nBP: Took you long enough... no wonder you came in last. (I guess she saw me run, also I was 5/6 b*tch)\nM: OH, sorry for the wait ma’am, here’s the towel. *extends hand*\n\nBP snatches the towel out of my hand also ripping my arm off (let me remind you that I am very small and fragile) and gives the wet towel to her daughter. I ran away and watched from the distance. G takes the towel... BUT, what BP didn’t know is that I also wiped off a few stains from a toilet bowl with the towel after I wet it. What occurs is the following. G starts to wipe her mouth and suddenly stops. I stare intensely at her with a HUGE sh*t faced grin. G removes the towel and I sh*t you not... ;) ... there is a streak of crap on the top of her lip. She starts crying and IMMEDIATELY starts to throw up again. This girl is like a water fountain of vomit. BP erupts in anger and starts yelling, “I’M GONNA BEAT YOUR F*CKING A*S YOU LITTLE F*CKER”. I quickly hide from BP and for the rest of the event I never see BP or G ever again. \n\nEndnotes: in retrospect I do think that I did go a little overboard. Lmao thanks for reading though :)",

She has done this so often that she has memorized the price, brings exact change, and when she walks into the building every employee there goes and gets one for her without her having to ask. I know that she’s not buying them for anyone else because she’s very chatty with me especially, about everything from when she has sex to who she’s having sex with. She’s very sweet, but I get the impression that she thinks plan b is a regular form of birth control. A generic plan B is just shy of $44, so she’s spent at least $1k on them in the time that I’ve worked at CVS. \n\nWould I be an asshole if I took her aside the next time she came in to ask her if she wants to know about other contraceptive options? Or if she wanted to talk to the nurse practitioner in our Minute Clinic? I know it’s really none of my business, but I know she works a minimum wage job and like I said, plan b is expensive. ",

      "description": "I'll start this off by saying I take shrooms very seriously, and all my friends know I do.\n\n\nSo me and a friend(L) did a 3g trip each. They were mine and I didn't charge him for them. I prepared for it the whole week leading up, I stopped all other substances, meditated, ate well, worked out a little and got plenty of sleep. He didn't sleep the 2 days prior(got sleep the night before), ate chips and junk food, stayed on his couch for days, drank the days leading up and smoked weed before, during and after the trip.\n\n\nThe plan was for us 2 to go to an insect museum, and meet our trip-sitter(T)there. Then before the peak we would go to another friends house(A), who has a huge field to goof off in.\n\n\nThe museum was great! I couldn't look at some beatles bc they were a little scary, but still had a blast. About 45 min in we decide to go to A's house.\n\n\nWe weren't there 5 min and L starts talking about smoking but we can't do it inside or around the house because of neighbors so he'd have to go really far in the field to smoke, that was fine because that was the plan anyway. But it gets to L because he wants to smoke right away, it puts him in this weird mood from then on.\n\n\nWe were in the field and around my peak( L peaked prior, don't know why. Probably the weed) I told the 3, A,L and T that I want to be alone for this part. This was supposed to be a revelation trip for me, “new year new me” and just didn't need to listen to them talk while I do this. I didn't walk to far away from them and I can already hear L getting annoyed with A because of the smoking thing.\n\n\nSo in my tripped out mind I'm thinking well fuck my friends aren't getting along what can I do, and that was my only thought during the peak. I finished and walked back to them. We talked casually for a bit the went back inside.\n\n\nStill pretty trippy I sat down and was stuck in my head for a bit. I come back into their conversation and L says he's going back out to smoke some more. It kind of caught me off guard, like how are you not high enough right now? So we let him and he comes back and says he doesn't want to be here anymore bc he can't smoke inside. I'm still fucked and am indifferent about it, eventually he annoys me enough so I say fuck it let's go even though I'm still to high. T drives us back to my car, while driving, L says he doesn't like A and some other stuff about the trip. We get to my car, thank T and I drive back to L's place, still to fucked to be driving. So I tell him I have to hang here for a bit until I feel safe.\n\n\nWe get in and his new bed he's been waiting for has arrived, I asked if he'd like help and said no, that I could go sit down so I go and lay down/ space out on his couch while he starts putting up his new bed. A minute later he tells me he needs help, I'm still pretty high and didn't understand how to put it up so he gets annoyed with me, so i say fuck it and go sit on the porch. 30 min later I'm good enough to drive so I walk back in and he has set up his bed. I tell him I'm not high anymore and that I'm leaving. He apologized for being an ass all day. I said something like yeah it's fine, then I left.\n\n\nI was not in the right mindset to be angry at him then, but now that I'm reflecting on it he ruined everything from the A's house until I went home. I know he didn't have a good trip and got annoyed immediately as we got to A's house, which in turn got to me and I didn't have a good trip.\n\n\nLike I said I take shrooms very seriously and his disregard for them has got me livid today, so much that really dont want to see him again. I don't know how you can do all that shit and then say your ready. I feel like I wasted a beautiful day just worrying about him. The entire trip didn't feel special at all, like I was just a little extra higher than I would be on weed.\n\n\nI want to call him today and tell him that it was a total waste of time and that he needs to pay me for them. AITA?\n\n\n\nTl;dr: Did shrooms with friend, he didn't take it seriously and ruined it for me as he just cares about weed",

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been in an on and off relationship for just under two years now. We fight over stupid little things and can't communicate our feelings but care deeply for each other. I went back to Europe last month for a few weeks to visit family. He stayed at my place for the first time, two nights before dropping me off at the airport. We told each other we would talk everyday but that didn't happen. We got into a small argument a week after and didn't talk the rest of the time I was away. \n\nOn my way back, my domestic flight was delayed and I missed my international flight home. It's 9pm in the capital, all the offices are closed and I have no phone to call any US offices to figure out my situation. The people I spoke to at the airport said I'd have to wait til 8am but I may not be able to get a flight out for another 2 days. I'm supposed to arrive home at 5am and I work later that day at 4. \n\nEven though we hadn't spoken for a while, I called him and he was able to rearrange my flight for the following morning. I was incredibly thankful. He said he'd pick me up at the airport and to call him when I arrived at last layover. We said our loves you and hung up.\n\nI called and msged him when I touched down but got no response. Got on my last plane ride and was excited to be home (5 hour flight). No reply even after grabbing my luggage and going through customs (not even a 'K'). I decided to wait another 20 min and have a smoke to see if maybe he was just running late or accidentally slept in (arrived around 6am and he has work at 730 so he usually needs to be up by 630 anyways). I decide not to call since this isn't the first time hes slept through one of our plans or just completely flaked and didn't show up. Grabbed an uber and went home.\n\nI'm lugging my bags up the stairs and I receive a text \"where are you\" I reply \"I'm home.\" I immediately get a call and he ends up calling me an asshole. We're currently not speaking. AITA for not calling before leaving the airport? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So my friend group and I are going abroad for a week in the summer. This coast me a £150 deposit which I payed a while back as well as a £430 payment which I payed just three weeks ago. \n\nThis is all well and good. Except an issue has come up where one of the people going with us may not be able to go due the possibility of it clashing with a more long term work/study holiday abroad.\n\nNow to be fair, she payed her remaining balance (£430) two weeks ago and only found out last week that these dates could clash. She will find out whether or not the dates are ok soon enough I hope.\n\nMy issue is that if, in the worst case, where the dates do clash, she of course won’t be able to go meaning according to the person organising the holiday, the remaining people will have to bail her out pretty much. We have all of us, payed our share towards it, each of us having payed £430 each. \n\nOf course I feel bad that she is put in a pretty unfortunate predicament, but I can’t help but feel like my friends and I are getting shafted, having to pay for the room that she can’t attend. We aren’t aware yet whether we will have to pay if she pulls out, and we’ll find out from the place where we are staying soon. \n\nTLDR: Am I an asshole for not wanting to split the bill to bail my friend out, when I’ve already payed for myself.

      "description": "A bit of backstory is needed to explain her mentality. Her father ran an extremely successful construction business that his father left to him in a large city. He regularly was winning multi million dollar construction bids and once he asked his now wife my fiance's mother to marry him he told her to quit her job and that she wasn't going to work anymore.\n\nNow to us, I'm 28, she is 26 and we have been dating for about 3.5 years now. We both have student loan debt up to our eyes and the only reason we have a house is because her father gave her one about 2 years ago. There is no way we could afford a house right now (yay student loan debt and various credit card debt we both have.)\n\nHer family is wealthy and her father is great but he also believes in making your own way, I respect that and am super grateful for what he has done so far with the house and bailing us out a few times when things got pretty bad.\n\nSo now to us, I proposed to her 2 months ago and it all was great. Both families like each other and we all get along great. However.. last week my wife to be told me she put in her two weeks notice and is extremely happy to finally be a wife and not work anymore... Uhh what? We had our first major fight right there because we NEED her income to survive especially if we are going to have a kid in a year or so like we plan to.\n\nI'm not on a position like her father was to fully support a family on my income alone, not to mention her debt piled on top of mine. Also if she never planned to use her degree once she got married why did she take all the loans? I also found out she would have ZERO student loan debt if she went to what her father calls a \"real school\". She went to a local state college because her boyfriend at the time was going to go there even though she was accepted at other schools.\n\nNow I'm not going to argue her Dad's an ass to pay for college at one school and not the other or blame her for wanting to be by a boyfriend at the time and taking student loans to go be by him. That's the past and when you think you are in love or are in love you do some stupid things sometimes.\n\nHowever I cannot marry her if she honestly just won't work now that she's a wife. I get that it's her mother's kind of fairy tale that happened to her but I'm not wealthy enough to do that. We talked about doing that for 3-4 years once we have a kid because I do believe that a child should always have one parent around and not just daycare/babysitters because daycare is extremely expensive. Then once our kid gets into Pre-K she would return to work part time then full-time once school actually starts.\n\nNow apparently that plan we had is moot and her new plan is to never work again because I popped the question. Not cool and her mom is FULLY behind her decision, the Dad is way more level headed and took me out to drink and told me there will be no bad feelings if I back out because I shouldn't be expected to do that unless I'm in a financial position to do so.\n\nAITA if I give her an ultimatum to work or not get married? I also don't want to get married on the back of an ultimatum, I just don't see that being healthy either.",

      "description": "This is going to be short and not so sweet.\nI'll refrain from too much detail for privacy reasons.\n\nI have a very close friend of 4 years. We are both females in our 20s.\nMy friend can feel feelings a lot more intensely and this can sometimes lead to a lot of mini dramas and subsequent support from me.\n9 months ago, friend had a big blow up with her boyfriend. I dropped a lot, let her stay in my apartment, stayed up until 5am talking about him, humoured her whilst we drove past his workplace 3 times in one night, the whole shebang. \nPerhaps it's important to note I work full time 6 days a week. She works from home as a freelancer and has a lot of freedom on taking a few personal days etc. \n\nA week later they get back together and admittedly I'm disappointed. After spending so much time hearing about his faults, it was very much a sudden 180 for me.\nWhatever, if she's happy then I'm happy.\n\nCut to 3 weeks ago.\nThe same situation. Another big fight and it's the end of the world. I'm trying to respond to dozens of lengthy messages every hour whilst between jobs. \nFriend now lives 800km north of me. She asks to fly down and come and stay at mine just like before. \nI said no. I explained I do not have the time to do this again. I cannot be your therapist. If you make the choice to fly down, it's up to you. I cannot let you use myself and my apartment every time there's a drama. \nBeen rocky and awkward ever since. Had some judgement from other friends for \"leaving her out in the cold.\"\nAm I the asshole?\n\n(*side note; the city we live in has decent rooms for as little as 5USD a night and furnished rooms for 100USD a month. We both earn similar wages. If it was a case of her being homeless, I would not respond in the same way)",

      "description": "I was with a group of friends at a restaurant, we were talking about local bands(we have to organize an event), he asked our opinion on one band and I said that I thought they are boring and he for no logical reason tells me to shut the fuck up if I can't tell him a better band or do it better myself (we had this argument in the past) so in the heat of the moment I called him stupid and childish and started explaining to him that I can give my own opinion even if I can't do it better, after my explanation he got up swearing at me, threatening me and just left. I just stood there confused as why he got that mad, AITA for his leaving?",

      "description": "Mobile user, first time posting, not a native speaker, you know the drill.\n\n\nI should start by saying that my parents broke up when i was pretty young, about 9 years old. mom finally stepped her foot down after years of abuse from dad (from even before i was born) and our whole relationship has been 'weird' ever since.\n\n\nafter that we did the typical \"kid with divorced parents\" thing of me seeing him every weekend and stuff. not much things happened there and the fights with mom were pretty much over, however i still was (and am) very scared of him. the thing is he's extremely bad at showing any kind of affection or interest in the things i do, and he gets really angry whenever i say no to meeting up or recieving something.\n\n\nnow that i told him i didn't want to meet up he said he'd never invite me anywhere and if i wanted to hang out i'd have to call him and show up there by myself. the thing is, i never wanted to do (i never felt close to him) that and i just did it because i feel like it's my obligation as a daughter. \nthis was about 2 months ago.\n\n\nyesterday, mom told me he called her and said that he would never call me, that he's \"never done it with any of his children and he's not gonna do it with me\". i didn't care and kept thinking about how i hated to be walking on eggshells every time i call him and that i never felt close to him in the first place.\n\n\ntoday, she mentioned that he was crying when he said it. and it made my heart sink a bit.\n\n\npart of me (and im pretty sure mom thinks this too) thinks that i have no right to be mad about the past seeing how i barely remember it, that i'm just being a heartless bitch to him. and me being scared of him makes no sense since he's never hit me or even threatened me.\n\nso, am i the asshole?\n\n\n",

      "description": "Hear me out. The local grocery store chain has always employed a few mentally challenged employees for getting carts, bagging groceries, etc. totally cool. Thanks for giving people jobs. For the last year or so thay have been hiring more and putting them as cashiers as well. It’s to the point now where every cashier and bagger has challenges. Some of them just seem to have social issues but it’s making it difficult as a customer. If I just have a simple order and everything goes smoothly then it’s usually OK except for the bagging. They tend to not really understand how stuff should be bagged and my groceries sometimes end up mangled ( bread shouldn’t go under the big bottle of shampoo, right?) I’ve offered to bag but that seems to be upsetting for them at times and they just stand there and stare at me while I bag because they don’t know what else to do. I stopped bringing my own cloth bags because they often don’t know how to handle that and will put one or two items in my bags and then bag the rest in plastic. If I have any kind of issue or request for the cashier, they often can’t handle it and need to call for the manager. This slows everything down and so I usually just won’t say anything if my items ring up wrong because I just don’t want to hassle anyone or hold up the line even more. As it is, it takes forever to get out of the store now. \nThese employees seem to be pretty young and maybe don’t have all of the social stuff down. The conversation is often awkward and more than once I have walked up to an empty line and found the cashier scratching their ass or picking their nose and then they want to just jump right in and touch my groceries. I’m sure that kind of atuff happens all the time but to see it happen is kind of weird. \nI kind of feel like an asshole for fussing about being inconvenienced because I am happy the store is giving them a job. I am not happy because I have seen how some of the “normal” staff treats some of them. Once I saw a customer drop a container of fruit and the manager told one girl to go pick it up. No broom. So she just got down on her hands and knees and chased down blueberries. At the time I just didn’t know how to handle that. Looking back, I see a bunch of different ways I could have stepped in and spoken up for the girl. I would do it very differently if I saw something like that. I once saw one of them trying to talk to a manager but he just kept saying “I don’t want to hear it. Stop talking to me”. From my perspective he seemed to be frustrated at having to try to manage the guy’s behaviors. He was trying to work but was just being pestered and interupted. \nMy other issue is that the store is union. I know how much these staff members are paying out of their check and it’s really not ok. \n\nI don’t know how to manage any of this. I don’t know how to approach a manager and ask why they have chosen this approach. I’m sure they do not give a shit about losing me as a customer because they really are the only store around except Walmart. I don’t know if there is any point to me explaining they are treating all of their employees unfairly and making it harder for customers. \n\nI feel like an asshole but IDK how to help the situation. Any ideas? ",

      "title": "AITA for borrowing a chair?",
      "description": "I am using a throwaway for privacy reasons. I have just completed an MSC in App development. Compounding my annoyance with this whole situation is that I working for this company for minimum wage providing skilled labour and designing an app for them. I work upstairs and their is a shop downstairs. I admit this is going to be more one sided then I'd like because it just happened one hour ago and I partially wrote this try and explain to myself why I am upset.  \n\n\nI have gotten into the habit of writing up reports of any confrontation I have in a professional setting from working with a bully in a previous workplace. Also they stress me out so much I cant remember any details if I don't write it down and it helps me calm down. Anyway here is my report from today:  \n\n\n \n\nI enter the shop and one of the girls asks me about the chair I borrowed from the charity upstairs. I had asked them for it nicely because I was experiencing back pain from the chair I was using. I was getting a pain in my tailbone and have since then, before resolving it, resorted to standing up and using my laptop that way. I didn’t want to bother the owner with buying a new chair. I told them the shop I worked in and told them they could come back and take it any time.   \n \n\nThe girl informed me that a representative of the charity had come down claiming the chair was stolen while Joe was on shift and had solicited a 5 euro donation from him as restitution. I told Zara that I would now have to go and clear up the situation.\n\nI went upstairs and erroneously went to a representative for the Santa’s grotto and was redirected by her to the correct place. \n\nI approached the correct place this time. “Hello” I said. “I borrowed a chair from here a few days ago. You seem to think it was stolen I’ve come to clear that up. “ I informed her that I was sorry about the whole incident but I had in fact asked for the chair nicely, informed them where I was working and told them they could get it back any time.   \n \n\nShe informed me that they had all been very busy that day. She acknowledged that I had come in because she said I had “hurt my back”. I confirmed this in order to move the situation along. She told me that the CEO had come in and noticed a chair missing and that many families used the chair. I had only taken one chair. There were maybe ten chairs there. I repeated that I had asked for the chair, told her where it would be and that she could take it back any time. I then brought up the 5 euro donation she had solicited from Joe; the guy who had dealt with them when he had come to the shop. “Yes” she said “he was very good to do that. Would you like to make a 5 euro donation?” “No I wouldn’t” I said. “You wouldn’t?” she said sounding surprised.  \n \n\nThis was the turning point in the conversation for me. She had offered no apology for the accusation of stealing, the distress she had put my colleague in, the damage she had done to me and the stores reputation or the 5 euro she had unjustifiably solicited. To be accused of stealing is one thing but to be accused of stealing from a charity is even worse. On top of this was the fact that I had all ready proffered her an apology early in the conversation as a show of peace and that she had now just tried to solicit another 5 euro from me making the total restitution for the alleged crime 10 euro.  \n \n\n“you took it for four days. We didn’t know what had happened to it. We had thought you wanted it temporarily”. I reiterated the details of the case i.e that I had asked for it, told them where it was and offered to bring it back to them anytime they wanted it.\n\n‘I am under the impression you pressured him into donating” I said.   \n \n\n“Oh no no no” she said “would you like me to give the five euro back?”  \n \n\n“Thats not going to happen “ I said “I think you know thats not going to happen.”\n\nI felt this offer was very disingenuous and was designed to embarrass me. She continued to offer despite me telling her that I though it was inappropriate. She even reached into a bun-bag she was wearing, despite my protestations and began to fish for a five euro. This started to go around in circles\n\nI eventually interrupted her and said “so I am just clearing that up. The chair wasn’t stolen. Thank you so much”\n\nI was surprised at the situation. All they had to do was come to the shop and ask for the chair. It would have been no problem and created no drama. It is what I would call a reasonable response.  \n \n\nI returned to the store. They asked me how it went. I said “They are very tricky people. She wasn’t easy to deal with and she tried to get another 5 euro donation from me.”  \n \n\nI went upstairs and began writing this report while the events where fresh in my mind.  \n \n\nAbout 10-15 minutes later. Zara came upstairs and informed me that she had gone back to the charity and apologised on my behalf. I think, but Im not entirely sure, she said she had pledged another 5 euro to the charity. She also told me that I would be paying Joe the 5 euro. She said that she could see from the way I had come back that i had not, to paraphrase, handled the situation properly. I told her I was extremely unhappy with what she had done and that she had no right to apologise on my behalf.   \n \n\nShe said that the girl was upset. She said I had originally ran up there shouting about hurting my back and taken a chair. I reiterated to her that I had told the charity where I worked and that anytime they wanted it they could come back and take it. She said I should have taken it back myself. I told her that i was here working everyday and that they were temporary therefore it made sense that they simply come back for the chair when they needed it rather than me bring it back. She ,in a rather demeaning way, said   \n \n\n“you just work here part time.”  \n \n\nShe disagreed with me.   \n \n\nI explained to her that accusing us of stealing and of soliciting a donation was a crazy thing to do and I had gone there to clear it up. She conceded that she shouldn’t have said that Joe was pressured into giving a donation. However, giving my experience with the representative of the charity and the fact that she had in fact solicited a donation from me, and even mentioned the exact figure of 5 euro, I believe she did.  \n \n\nShe informed me that she was my manager and that she could do that. There was a back and forth on wether she was my manager or not. She said she would call Tommy. I told her that she was free to call Tommy if she wanted. She told me that because she was my manager I should have gotten her permission to borrow a chair. She repeated this several times. To my knowledge she works in the shop part time. She does not make my roster. She is not even the person in the shop with the longest hours. Joe is. I have both my boss  and another woman named Jenny who is on maternity leave. It is my belief that both these people manage the shop. I take instruction for them. Zara is a drama student.   \n \n\nI replied “its just a chair. Why would I need your permission to borrow a chair?” She said that I should have told them where I had gotten the chair. She also told me that I should have had her permission to go and talk to the charity. She said I had stormed over there. I had not stormed over there. I had arrived to work in a good mood having exercised earlier in the morning so I would go in with a positive attitude. I had gone over to the charity with good will and in a good mood merely wanting to clear up a misunderstanding. That is the truth. I smiled at both the girls when I came in to greet them.  \n \n\nI really never envisioned this becoming the major problem it had now become. She became very upset and began to raise her voice slightly. I did not raise my voice but she said “I don’t like the way you are talking to me. Is this the way you are going to talk to me?”. I did not see the way I was talking to her as inappropriate.   \n \n\nI was doubly upset because on Tuesday I had come into work and Joe was sick. She had been called in to cover his shift and was annoyed that he had left five minutes earlier the day before, hadn’t cleaned up, had taken the pass home with him and now she had to cover for him. The store was very busy and she was stressed. I came down and brought her some chocolate I had bought because i felt sorry for her. I covered for her while she was on break for half an hour. I offered to give her another twenty minutes break because she was worried she wouldn’t get it. I also told her to call me if she felt overwhelmed and I would come down and help her. I also offered to pre-cut some wrapping paper for here to save her some time. When I left that day I gave her a reassuring pat on the back as I was leaving as a show of support. She wanted to know when Tommy would arrive there but didn’t ring him. I wanted to ring Tommy anyway so when I did I also asked on her behalf when I thought he would be there and then relayed the information to her. I have never been anything but polite and respectful with Zara and was now very annoyed at the way I was being treated. Despite this I wanted to try and normalise the situation. It felt like this had all gotten completely out of hand over something very very minor.   \n \n\n“This is crazy” I said. I repeated this several times throughout the conversation. I also said “Zara this is mental”. This was my natural response. I couldn’t believe things had gotten so out of hand and I thought by saying “this is crazy” it might diffuse the situation and give us both some perspective. I was really surprised at what was happening. I had never had a problem with Zara but I thought on Tuesday she had been a bit unjustifiably annoyed with Joe and it had made me slightly weary of her.\n\nI also said that she had muddied the waters by going over to the charity and made it look as though ",

      "description": "Okay, okay, I know this sounds bad but I need to get some context in:\n\nI have 2 female friends: B and J. Last school year they had some random beef with another girl, H. Basically H said she didn’t like the way B and J treated her to another person and so B and J denied it all and resent her.\nA few months ago (3-4) H started showering B with gifts, it soon became apparent that H had a huge lust for B, disclosing this to me in a DM, both B and J now knew this and still didn’t like her.\nNow the important part.\nOne month later, H is celebrating her cake day with a sleepover, I get invited, but I’m not allowed to go bc my parents don’t like the idea of me sleeping next to girls home alone all night.\nB gets invited, despite she doesn’t like her, says yes, she invited J to come as her +1 as H couldn’t get anyone else to come, from bits and pieces before the cake day I figured that they were going to tease her ( yes in a sexual way) for a laugh.\nThe night rolls around and from what B and J told me (they keep telling me not to talk to H and to my trust her) they went, DESPITE STILL NOT LIKING THIS GIRL, and tease her for the night, playing T or D, rubbing up against her.\nWhen they all fall asleep B tells me that she felt H sidling up begins her and fondling her boob while masturbating, even getting to the point of climax. When H falls asleep later, B wakes up J and they leave, walking home at 2am.\n(B did tell me at one point she whispered in H’s ear “I want you” apparently as a joke)\nThey tell me they told the school but they won’t do anything because: “B’s grades haven’t dropped so it’s not serious” and the police “said” that she was lying.\nI don’t believe that the school nor police would intervene, and reading the written statement to the school, they did say anything about leading her on or hating her.\nI do t even think they told the police or the school.\n\nThese 2 have had it in for H for a year, as in, they want her out of the school, when I was told what the school and police said I kept quiet, but when asked later I said: “it’s improbable that the school and police would do nothing and if you guys hated her so much why even go”\nThey both got mad at me, calling me “Victim blamer” and “rape apologist” they started spreading rumours that I was all of the above and that I wanted to *explicit* to H.\nAll these rumours caused my gf (named S) to break up with me .\nI have the texts to show B and J hap planned to go and see H and lead her on, but nothing to defend myself, I’ve been with S for 3 years, and B and J ruined almost everything in my life, they’ve sent me DM’s saying if I “keep up my act” AKA being skeptic, they’ll phone my parents and tell the school.\nI’m worried guys, my life is ruined, this isn’t a lie or a joke, I just want advice on whether or not I make the DM’s public.\n(Sorry for long post, needed to vent)\n\nTL;DR-2 girls may have lied about being raped and when I got skeptical, ruined my life\n",

      "description": "I (26 M, married) have worked at a children's science museum for nine years this month. We're open from 9AM to 5PM every day. I work in the Exhibits department with two others, the relevant one being Richard, who is also 26, single, and has worked with us for about three years. Richard is an odd dude, though I really like him. He's got a speech impediment, with his Rs becoming Ws. On his off days he buys and sells basically anything he can at flea markets. He's a great woodworker, and he also works events for our Rentals department. He's had several issues with various coworkers at the museum because of his blunt attitude. He'll regularly call someone or their opinion stupid in an argument. He's also called coworkers he doesn't like \"ugly\" to their faces while laughing. But he's also usually an amazingly hard worker, and believes in doing things exactly right (by his definition of right, I should clarify). \n\nOne of our department's daily responsibilities is turning all of the exhibits on before opening and turning them off at the end of the day. We also do floor recovery, which is a nice way of saying we straighten up areas and put toys back where they go around closing time. \n\nWhen I started and I was being trained, I was told that we start turning things off at 4:45 PM. We do it in a specific order so that we're hitting mostly small things at first, and the very biggest exhibits last, just to be a little more courteous to the visitors. But we're still turning things off a bit before closing to send the message that we are, in fact, closing very soon. For reference, the exhibits we're turning off, from small to large, include: decorative lights, televisions playing educational videos, a projector displaying a wordless video of marine animals, interactive computer displays, microscope activities, a large exhibit with images projected on a sphere to show atmosphere information, an interactive activity with a projector involving music, and the largest interactive area, a water-themed section with several smaller components. We never turn off those last two things until 5 PM. \n\nIn the past nine years, we've had **2** complaints in regards to this policy. Our staff are all copied in on the comment cards as a way to help us improve. Both complaints were actually more of a direct result of one of my ex-coworkers. She was an elderly woman and was rude to visitors who stayed past 4:45, actually asking them to leave. We typically never ask folks to leave until it's actually 5. I should add that we make announcements around closing time, one at 4:30, and four more at 4:45, 4:50, 4:55, and 5:00. \n\nUpon the second complaint being made, we were asked by the CEO at the time to no longer shut down exhibits before 5 unless there were absolutely no customers anywhere nearby. We already did things like that, but now it was official. This was a few months before Richard started.\n\nBack to my coworker; Richard and I have very different views on customer service. I absolutely agree that we should strive to give our visitors a fantastic experience. We're here to be a resource for learning and fun in the community. However, I hold the opinion that business hours mean a consumer has the responsibility to be *out* of the building by the time it is closed. Richard says that closing time is a suggestion, and we shouldn't even ask people to leave after we close. They'll get out when they feel ready to leave. \n\nRichard and I get along very well nearly all the time, except when we discuss this topic, which does come up about once or twice a month. It usually remains somewhat civil, but is an argument every time. He has a strong \"the customer is always right\" stance. I believe that is a dangerous and easily-abused attitude. I want our visitors to feel as though they're welcome to enjoy themselves, but I also want to do small things that will remind them of our closing time in a non-aggressive way. When we're busy and it's loud in the building, they can't hear the announcements. I no longer turn off most exhibits before five--but I *do* turn off the sound that's playing on three exhibits to lower the volume in the hopes of making visitors more aware of the announcements and the fact that we're closing soon. Even that upsets Richard. \n\nThis all came to a head on Black Friday this year. We were very busy, with schools out and plenty of people visiting from out of town. The floor recovery was going to be a real chore as a result, and the crowd was still somewhat strong and loud around 4:45. It was just me and Richard working in our department. I muted one television and turned off the music playing with the marine-life video. That's really it. But Richard got mad and turned the sound back on for both, saying again that I was diminishing the customer experience. We argued, with him bringing another coworker into it, who agreed with me before removing herself from the situation. \n\nThe conversation died for a bit as Richard and I did our floor recovery. We managed to get into one area that was empty and work on cleaning it up. Shortly before we finished, a family walked in, looked around and saw us cleaning, and left without touching anything. I pointed it out to Richard. I said that, by his logic, we just truly diminished visitor experience. Had we not been cleaning, that family would've gotten to play more. He said \"it's different\" and stormed off to clean the next area. I followed--mainly because we usually do clean areas together, but also to continue my point. It's about 4:50 at this time. \n\nWe're in another empty exhibit cleaning now. I continued, the conversation going something like this:\n\nMe: The sound being turned off wouldn't stop anyone from playing in an area--\n\nHim: Stop it. Just shut up.\n\nMe: No, really, I just want to know how this is actually better to you.\n\nHim: Just stop. Shut up. We're done.\n\nMe: No, I wanna know, which one of us is going to our boss Monday?\n\nHim: Stop it. I'm done.\n\nMe: You or me? Because clearly we can't be cleaning before five. If turning off SOUND bugs you because it's diminishing the experience, you can't tell me you're okay with THAT. (I gestured to the area we previously cleaned)\n\nHe was also laughing and shaking his head during that quoted conversation, which he's admitted he does when he gets into arguments and thinks the other person is being ridiculous. I was upset because the minute I had a good point he started telling me to shut up. I was upset that he was *laughing at me*. That last line I quoted in the conversation, I did raise my voice. Not quite yelling, but kind of like a-dad-scolding-his-kid volume. After that, I went quiet and he laughed some more as we cleaned, then we parted ways. About 4:55 now. \n\nI cooled off a bit, and I regretted raising my voice. I genuinely really enjoy working with Richard and he's fun to be around once you get used to him. I went back and found him about four minutes later and apologized. I said I lost my temper, and I was truly sorry for that. I said I shouldn't have raised my voice at him or spoken so harshly, and that I would be more respectful of his opinions in the future, even if we disagree. There was no need for me to get angry with him over it, and I would avoid that topic of conversation in the future. He said \"nope, do whatever you want from now on\", still laughing and shaking his head, and said he'd see me next week before we parted ways again. \n\nI didn't say it to him, but I stand by my opinion. I do regret the way that conversation went and my apology was sincere. I've discussed the idea of shutting things off starting at 4:45 with several coworkers over the years and it's a very dividing topic. I liken what I'm doing to the employees at a restaurant turning off their music fifteen minutes before closing time. You're still completely able to eat and no one's asking you to leave, but it makes it quieter and should make you more aware of the time. \n\nSo, basically, it comes down to a couple things:\n\n1. Am I the asshole for thinking it's okay to turn off audio equipment in our museum prior to closing to calm the atmosphere and send the message that we're preparing to close?\n2. Am I the asshole for the way I treated my coworker, Richard, in our disagreement?\n\nI actually work Tuesday through Saturday, so I haven't seen him since and will see him again for the first time tomorrow morning. I'm asking because I really want some outside perspective if he tries bringing this up with me again. I'm going to try to avoid it, but I'm also nervous that he might have gone to our manager or to HR today to complain about me. I want to go into tomorrow with the most objective view possible of the situation. ",

      "description": "So yesterday I stopped by my dad and step-moms to bring her present and a homemade birthday cake.  Everything seemed fine at the time. She almost cried at the thoughtful presents and her favorite cake.  She opened her card last and didn't seem to change demeanor.  The front of the card had an elderly fairy with wings and a magic wand and said something along the lines of this fairy comes once a year in your sleep to make you one year older. You open the card and it says one word \"bitch\".  Of course we signed with our love and Happy Birthday. \n\nI get call this morning and she tells me she really liked the presents and the cake was really good but dad wanted to talk to me. So he gets on the phone and says they both cried all day yesterday because of the offensive card. He said I was calling her a bitch and that really hurt her feelings. I asked him if he read the card and it was a joke and I wasn't calling her a bitch but the imaginary age fairy.  He lectured me for a few minutes about offensive language and then step-mom got back on the phone and lectured me some more.  I apologized for offending her and tried to explain the joke. I think she understood that it was maybe just a generational difference in humor but then she started talking about how they never use that kind of language.  I said that wasn't true. Ive heard my dad cuss plenty of times. She said maybe when he was younger but not now. I told her that I put a lot of work into making sure she had a great birthday. Weeks finding thoughtful presents she would like and got up early and spent at least 5 hours on her favorite cake and even spent at least 20minutes choosing a card. I thought the card would catch her off guard and make her laugh and that it was light hearted and only mildly offensive.  I told her I was done talking about it and hung up on her when she continued.  I feel like she is looking for ulterior motives and reasons to be upset. And i feel like she is shitting on all of the effort I put in to make her birthday nice.  Well am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Tldr at the bottom\n\nMy dad is the kind of man who just wants people to be happy. He's not fake or superficial or anything, he just bends over backwards for the people he cares about, a quality some people in his life abuse.\n\nThis brings us to his wife! They've been married for a while now but it seems lately things have started getting out of hand. She often adopts a \"my way or the high way\" mentality, snapping at everyone or sulking until she gets what she wants. If she's in a bad mood, she makes sure EVERYONE is in a bad mood. My dad doesn't handle this very well and does basically whatever she asks to end the situation. This could range from small things like cooking or buying dinner, to things a little more... out there, like scolding my brother on her behalf or scheduling vacations they can't afford because she wants to go to Disneyland for the fourth time that month (they are by no means close to Anaheim). If it's not done the way she wants, the whole cycle starts over again. I've seen her snap at him because he was humming while doing the dishes and she wanted the house to be quiet. \n\nThe most recent in the string of household spats is over my dad's tattoos. My dad has a heart with my name in it over his heart. He got it just after I was born and has another one on his bicep for my younger brother. Even though he has two other tattoos dedicated to his wife, she's currently insisting that he get the tattoo with my name covered because it's painful for her to have to see another woman's name on his body, let alone over his heart. She says covering it would be no different than when my dad covered a tattoo for his ex wife (my mom) after their divorce. \n\nI think this is insane. \n\nThey've been fighting over it for a while now but over the holidays she stated with great satisfaction that she was pretty sure he was tired of fighting and would give in soon enough. \n\nCan I call her out on this or should I just mind my own business? \n\nI dont think it's right that she keeps strong arming him into doing things he doesn't want to do. I've brought it up to my dad before but he says marriage isnt perfect, everyone fights, and at the end of the day relationships sometimes require sacrifice. I understand but it still seems he's the only one giving. \n\nOn the smaller instances where I've brought this up to her, she's taken it out on my dad by being extremely passive aggressive towards him and snapping at him anytime he does anything she perceives as annoying.\n\nI feel like she's seriously crossing a line but at the end of the day, I don't have to share a bed with her. I don't want to make things any worse for him by instigating a fight then leaving. When it comes to fights, her stamina knows no bounds. She can be angry for months if she sets her mind to it. \n\nAm I an asshole if I tell her she's being crazy and taking advantage of my dad? Or am I more of an asshole if I ignore it? \n\nTldr: my dad's wife takes advantage of the fact that he will do anything to keep his family happy and makes constant demands to have things her way. She has recently demanded he remove a tattoo with my name on it. She also takes it out on my dad whenever she receives criticism. Would it make me an asshole to confront her about this, if it raises the risk that she might take it out on my dad by throwing more temper tantrums and fighting with him even more? ",

      "description": "I (college student hoping to become a counseling psychologist) work at an institution who treats children for psychological and behavioral disorders. \n\nThe youth specialists including myself were tasked with coming up with a unique game for the kids. This particular coworker of mine claimed he had thought of one so we allowed him to do it. The game was that the children were to hold a doll, say something nice to it, and pass it on to the next kid. After that was over, they then were to grab that same doll, shout something mean to it, throw it on the ground, then pass it to the next child. This is where it gets chaotic. The children were shouting things like, “You fat retard!”, “Stupid whore!”, “Worthless piece of shit!”, you get the point. This coworker of mine was in fact laughing at their derogatory remarks, making some of the children think that these things were okay to say. I on the other hand was trying my best to tell the children to not use that language and try to be a little more respectful. At the end of the activity, he gave a shitty moral of the story speech about how saying mean things and hurting the doll does not make the doll feel good about himself.\n\nIt was confusing for them because one adult was telling them to do one thing (yell something mean to the doll and throw it on the ground) while I was telling them to do another (try to be respectful and not say super hurtful things even though it was just to a doll). I believe this activity was not in any way helping them and their psychological issues as this coworker of mine was laughing and encouraging the children to say horrible phrases (things they’ve probably heard at home/said to themselves). \n\nI came to the conclusion that possibly talking to my clinical psychologist about this incident might be the most responsible thing to do as I fear the other activities that happen while I am not there are similar to this one and whether or not his activities are positively impacting them at all.

I frequently photograph this one girl because she is a great person to work with.\n\nI brought my roommate to help once, and ever since, he relentlessly sexualizes her to me and speaks endlessly about how I should invite her to our parties, invite her out, etc. His girlfriend met her at my showcase for the work party, and since she is bisexual, both she and my roommate were asking me for her number, not telling me why, but I later found out it was to arrange a threesome. I never gave the #.\n\nI said no because my roommate has trashed many of my own past friendships with girls via his awful treatment of girls (cheating, manipulating, etc) and I'm not about to let his creepy gf relationship invade someone I work with and ruin that. Obviously, I did not explain this, but I did say no because I don't want anything affecting my partnership with her.\n\nHis better friend was present when I said no and seemed to have a problem with me saying he can't do that, but was holding back in telling me so.\n\nSo am I an asshole for this? I feel like this is incredibly invasive of my personal relationships and business life in an extremely creepy and not normal at all way.",

      "description": "My housemate is a great friend, and for the most part we get along fabulously.  He got a new girlfriend a few months ago, and she's over a lot.  I like her well enough, but the issue is his room is right next to mine, we don't have the best walls, and she is *loud* during sex.  This results in me hearing very uncomfortable sounds when trying to get to sleep, sometimes when I have early morning classes the next day.  I've tried asking them to keep it down, which was met with an apology and some quiet... for a few days.  \n\nI don't want to be a nag or not let them have their fun, so I started buying some earplugs so I could sleep better at night.  They're not too expensive (about 5 bucks and the packs have enough to last about two weeks) but college students and budgets and all... so I'm considering asking him to buy them for me.  Would I be an asshole for doing this, or is it reasonable?",

      "description": "...but not at all for the reasons you're probably thinking of. Also, I am in no way looking to raise any money from this post. I just don't know where else to turn. With that and the click-baity title aside let's dive in. \n\nOur dad is a Micronesian. The island he's from has only 2 people on it right now. The next closest island is where he currently lives and has about 11,000 people. He moved back there to take care of his side of the family when his mother passed away. We have not seen him since. In fact, I can only remember seeing him three times since he moved away due to the crash of 2008. The last time was when he came back briefly after going out for her funeral. We have never been there and only have the stories and descriptions that came from him. \n\nLife out there is pretty simple. Many people would consider it a third-world country. It hasn't been until recently that our dad has had a reliable way to communicate with us. Now they've got semi-reliable internet out there and cell/satellite service. In the last short while, our dad has finally managed to get himself a nice cellphone and even a Facebook!\n\nWith Facebook came a revelation. Our dad is old, and more importantly he's sick. We never realized the extent of it until he posted a picture from his tin shack on his story. There were more pill bottles than we've ever seen. His diabetes has gotten worse and his leg is swelling worse than the last time. He's also been getting general sicknesses and pneumonia on and off since he moved there.\n\nNaturally my brother and I have more or less dropped everything else in our lives and our main priority is getting out there to see him. We were finally able to get together and start planning/coordinating late last week. We're hoping to go this summer if not sooner and both of us are going to drop our jobs in order to go for at least a whole month. We'll figure out what comes after when we get to it.\n\nWe're not rich, but we're not poor. We are both in a position where we make a bit more than our monthly expenses. He recently started working for a trade and even picked up a second job at Starbucks to help the grind. I work 70 hours a week at a full commission job. I stashed some money away because I knew business was going to drop off and I'm only making it out by the skin of my teeth and some help from my SO. I haven't had a real paycheck in 4 months and it looks like I have one more to go. I don't have the time for a second job but you can bet your ass that I'll be selling my ass off until we get there.\n\nThe round trip alone is at least $2,300 EACH and I'm not even sure that includes a bag. Then there's paying our bills while away, living expenses (food/gas) on the island, and I would also like to have some money in the budget to improve my dad's living situation. Even if we're building it ourselves. We would even like to get traditional tattoos if we could somehow pull it off. Bottom line: we need about $6,000 collectively. We would love to aim higher because that doesn't pay any of our bills while we're gone etc., but that is the bare minimum we need to get out there and forget the consequences if that's all we can do.\n\nHere is where we come to a crossroads. I think that a Go Fund Me or whatever offers a good enough chance to help us make this happen. I've gotten over that some people use those platforms for the dumbest things and am confident that our cause is righteous enough to be worth putting out there. I also understand that it's a long shot and that the grim reality is that we'd probably fail because we didn't get lucky. That's not the point though. I want to take advantage of any edge we can get because we have a really tight deadline.\n\nHowever, my brother disagrees. Overall, he's skeptical to the point that he thinks we don't have a real chance. \n\nFurthermore, he thinks that we should do everything we can to make it happen ourselves without putting any burden on others. The people we know are generally worse off financially than we are and anyone who is likely to donate is probably one of our friends that can't really afford it. I understand this point. I would like to keep it separate from the people who cannot afford it. I'm not sure what we can do about this though. If our friends want to and think they can then maybe we should let them. Some of my friends have already asked me if there's something they can do to help. I don't think they could, nor would, contribute all that much. Also, I don't think they'd put themselves at risk either. Maybe I could be wrong about his circles.\n\nOn top of that he believes that nobody outside of our groups would be that interested in giving to us because we don't have anything that sets ourselves apart from anyone else there. I told him that some of my most memorable reddit contributions are when Yap's Stone Money gets brought up in r/todayilearned or something. A few people have asked me to do an AMA and I've even briefly spoken to someone else who's mother is from Yap. Maybe we can contribute something. Maybe learning about people that most people never considered or even knew existed before Moana could be enough to set apart even a little bit.\n\nNone of that is particularly controversial between us, but I don't know how I would write what's below without also writing what's above. Maybe I need to vent. idk. \n\nI know it's going to seem very ironic that I'm talking about this publicly, but it is the real reason why I'm here. My brother has a big hang-up about airing out personal matters to other people. Specifically the people close to him that aren't directly involved with it. He doesn't want to deal with other people talking to him about the issues that we face nor deal with any emotions that might come with facing these things in a public setting. \n\nHe did say that he would get over it if I could prove that it's a viable opportunity. I don't think I can suddenly come up with *the* way to make it work, and I don't think I could if I'm not actively working on it. I'm not even sure that we need to include **any** information about him being sick. We could instead leave it as two sons that haven't seen their dad in a decade and haven't yet had a real chance to explore anything of his culture.\n\nThis situation has been keeping me up at night for the last 2 months. Mostly because of dad's condition, less about getting there. All I can think about when I have any free time is getting us out there. I wonder if it's worth trying to turn the time spent thinking into time I spent working towards getting us out there, though I don't see any other avenues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWIBTA if I set up a Go Fund Me despite my brother's feelings about putting ourselves out there?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, and much less importantly, AITA for posting this despite my brother's feelings about putting ourselves out there? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know where else to turn for perspective. I don't know where to go for help either.",

      "description": "Throwaway because reasons.\n\nMy best friend is fat. Due to a number of health issues including PCOS and breaking her leg in multiple places a few years ago, she hasn't been able to properly exercise in some time and has gained more weight than she would prefer. She knows she's fat and is trying to increase her mobility/etc so that she can get some more exercise and lose some weight. That's not the issue here. \n\nEarlier today she had had a fight online with a good friend of ours and she'd been really upset about it, and I'd taken a few hours out of my work day to help her sort it out (she didn't ask me to, I chose to, and I have flexible working hours).\n\nTonight she was in a bit of a self-negative spiral about how she was a terrible friend &amp; she'd made me lose hours of work etc. This isn't an unusual thing for her, she has depression and often needs to be reassured that things are okay. It was a long day for everyone though and when my reassurances that I was responsible for my own actions and she wasn't a terrible friend, etc seemed not to be getting through, I got frustrated and said something like \"can you get it through your stupid fat head that you're not responsible for my actions!\"\n\nShe was pretty hurt by that, and she explained later that while it's no secret that she's fat, I had never used it in a pejorative sense before. She was right and I apologised, but she's now doing things like trying to pretend she's not hungry because of it, and claiming that I didn't do anything wrong (by calling her fat like that).\n\ntl;dr: I called my overweight friend who struggles with self-esteem fat at the end of a difficult day, and now she's showing signs of disordered eating and claiming it's all her own fault.

      "description": "I'll keep it short. I'm a 19 year old freshman in college who lives away from my parents, but they still help me greatly and help me take out loans and pay for part of my tuition and I couldn't be more thankful for that, really. I would have to drastically alter my lifestyle and be under a lot more stress without their help.\n\nHowever, my parents are pretty religious and conservative (I am definitely not) and they do not want me doing any illegal drugs or having sex before marriage. I am very sexually active, and also love smoking weed and dropping acid. I never do it in my dorm, but at my friend's places. I know that my parents explicitly tell me not to do these things and although they haven't said it exactly, I know if they found out that I did, that they would stop supporting me financially.\n\nI am doing great in school, so it's not like their help is being wasted or taken for granted. I just feel guilty because I am lying by omission here because I know they would disown me or dissociate from me if they found out what my lifestyle was like outside of school. On the flip side, I feel like since it's my body, it should be my choice what I do with it, and my business, and that I shouldn't feel obliged to tell them what I am doing with my own body. I don't do drugs in a manner that puts them at risk for legal reasons- I live far from them- so I'm only putting myself at risk here. Am I the asshole for continuing to get financial aid from my parents while having sex and doing drugs in my free time? I am not willing to give up this lifestyle as it doesn't adversely affect me, and instead makes me happier and have more fun on my downtime. My options would be to continue to do this and lie by omission, or tell my parents what I'm doing and suffer them being very heart broken and also not financially supporting me anymore. (They won't stop paying for my college unless I give them a reason to because they are nice and if I just asked them to stop paying for some reason they would probably be weirded out and think I was trying to get away from them) \n\nThank you for your replies!",

      "description": "I'm basically at the point of breaking off me relationship with my fiancé because I'm so frustrated by this whole thing. I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fiancé for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fiancé looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?",

      "description": "Context: This happened in high school. I'm currently in college now. We (me and my bff) made up a week after this incident occurred, but I felt like I never gotten the validation (or invalidation) from my actions so what better way than asking Reddit? Also, the best friend in question has another issue that would be great for another post on this subreddit, but I'll console the internet again if it's eating me like today's scenario is.\n\n\nI've been best friends with this guy ever since I got transferred to the same grade school as him. We've been inseparable all throughout our school lives and I was very happy that we went to the same middle and high school together. We never really had a major issue of conflict until around sophomore year of HS. \n\n\nHe comes to me seeking comfort or advice when something goes wrong in his life. I don't really stick my nose where it doesn't belong, but he's my best friend so I'm going to stick by his side no matter what. I never hesitated to be there for him when he tells me things no one else knows, even his own family or his boyfriend at the time! This is how he came out to be as not only gay but transgender as well. The latter will come into play later on. Of course, I supported him wholeheartedly. I didn't really get it at the time, and everything made sense later on my journey of identity. Anyways, moving on!\n\n\nDuring our time in high school, we became acquainted with this pair of twins, but the conflict of the story involves only one of them since I had more classes with her than my bff did so I think we got along a little better than she did with him. \n\n\nOne day she gave me a piece of cryptid piece of paper and told me to look at it when I got home and come back to her once I decoded it. I didn't get why she couldn't just tell me straight up what's wrong, not to mention we sit next to each other in the next class, but whatever. Took me some time to crack most of it and tl;dr my friend doesn't believe that my bff is really transgender and that he's doing it for attention. Of course, I was shocked and appalled by this bold accusation and confronted her about it. \n\n\nShe told me to not tell him what she said. I immediately told him when we met for lunch. I couldn't bear hiding this knowledge from him and normally I would've asked my mom for this kind of advice at the time, but it became too much to wait it out. Not to mention it could've been worse if I told him earlier. All he did was reply with, \"I know.\" and stormed off without a word. When I got home I got a call from that friend who asked me why did I do that. I can't remember how I replied exactly, but I do know that I was in a complete state of despair and just a crying mess over the situation.\n\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for being an honest friend? Or am I the asshole for not keeping an incriminating secret from my best friend? My bff and I haven't really talked to each other ever since we graduated. In case if you're wondering, the other friend transferred somewhere else before junior year started since she had a medical issue since birth that she was getting surgery for around that time, so I assumed she wanted to focus on her recovery. I know her family runs a store nearby that I can walk to any time, but I never really had a proper reason to go inside. I highly doubt both of them will see this, let alone use reddit, so that's why I'm not using a throwaway. \n\n\ntl;dr my best friend since grade school came out to me as transgender in high school. A mutual friend told me that he might be doing it for the attention and I should not tell him she said that. I told him as soon as I saw him since I couldn't bear the guilt and he didn't talk to me for a week. AITA?",

      "description": "Kind of preemptive seeing as no real conflict has happened, but my best friend (we'll call him Jake) recently has been hanging out with one of his female coworkers, and so she's been hanging out with me subsequently, and her and i are now considered \"friends\" although not close ones.\n\nNow this girl has a huge crush on him, i know cause he's told me that they talked about it. So she knows he and i know and its chill.\n\nHowever there was one day that i was hanging out with Jake and a couple others when she texts me high off her ass and says \"Hi, [my name]\" i say hi back and she says \"is Jake there? I wanna talk to him\" i say yes and she immediately calls my phone. This is because Jakes phone is dead. He answers and they talk about whatever and they hang up. \n\nThis kinda makes me upset, not enough to be in a bad mood but enough that I don't like hanging out with her as much. Jake even make a joking remark saying \"how does it feel to be the third wheel when she's not even here\" which while a funny joke, is very true.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to hang out with her?\n\nTLDR: my friends coworker and i are friends until one day she uses me as a means to talk to him while barely acknowledging me.",

      "description": "Some background info:\nSo for the past few years, I've been working for my school's intramurals sports program [where students get to play against eachother] as a supervisor and volleyball referee, because A, I'm actually a certified referee, and B, I get to play during downtime. Whenever there aren't enough players to play or the game is forfeited, my school's policy is to simply cut the game off and have the folks go back home because they've already technically won. However, these students took a while to get to the gym because it's all the way on the west side of Manhattan, while the school is in the Lower East Side [hint hint], so I usually give them the court to play on for fun, and there's usually some players from other games and whatnot who are down to play. I am in no obligation to referee the match, because in the end, it isn't an official match.\n\nNow the other day, some students were playing around because of forfeits and it was an open court for them to play on. My staff and I were hanging out, doing our thing, because we're friends. One girl comes up to me, lets call her Sally, and asks if I could keep score on the match that they had been playing for fun. This was within the last timeframe of the games for the night, and by then it was already almost 10PM. Keeping score would mean that they would not be able to leave until the match was over and that would take a while, because when the athletes aren't exactly athletes, the game simply becomes a back and forth exchange of points. I knew my staff of freshmen and sophomores [I'm a senior] had things to do after, and they were quite uneasy at the thought of getting out late. So I turned to Sally and I flat out told her \"no\". She said something along the lines of \"well you're paid to be here so why don't you do your job?\" That part is *not* part of my job description, and if I really was being an ass, I would have just dismissed them and called it a night, so my staff and I could get home, none of which I chose to mention. I told Sally our job was to referee matches and make sure no one hurt themselves, which we were all doing. She scoffed visibly and obviously did not hide her discontent with me. My staff recommended that I just kicked them off and called it a night, which is technically what I'm obligated to do, but I chose not to, because I had a long drive home and felt like this was the last thing I wanted to think about on the way. So we ended perhaps around 10 minutes later, which the girl's team ended up taking 20 minutes to pack up and leave, because they felt petty for the time being. I overheard her calling me \"rude\" and \"pointless\" for the night but I kept my lips shut. When I saw them leaving, I cheerily said \"goodnightttt\" as I hopped in my car, and drove my staff to their dorms as a thank you for holding down the fort.\n\nSo, AITA here for not being nice enough?",

      "description": "This is way past history for me.  No longer with this person for other reasons but quite curious what you all might think.\n\nI'll try and keep this as objective as possible and try to just keep it to the facts of what happened.\n\nI'd been partnered up with this person a little over a year.  We had shifted into a house together.  She had a kid, I had three.\n\nI had/have a shared care arrangement with my ex wife.  It's bit unorthodox but basically every other weekend and every Wednesday night the kids stay with me.  Ex wife, kids and I were all happy with this.  We'd been doing it for several years.\nAs well as this, for every day every other week I'd take the kids after work and give them dinner at my place, then return them home at around 7:30pm.  A bit of a strange schedule but it worked for us.  (She had her child on a regular week-about schedule.)\n\nA point to note is the new house was further away from my ex than my previous house.  So the commute to take the kids home each night was a bit longer.\n\nAfter a while my new partner voiced her frustration with the schedule, saying it was hard to organise things when the kids had to leave early each night.\n\nIt then came to a point where she asked me to change the schedule to a classic week-about arrangement.  She directed it solely at me so I guess I was supposed to say \"okay\" and then convince the kids and the ex that this was a good plan.\n\nI was very much against it saying that the kids, ex and I were all quite happy with how things were and didn't really want to change it.  She wasn't very happy about that.\n\nWe were seeing a relationship counselor at the time (things weren't great between us), and I wont' say the counselor took her side but it felt like it.  He agreed that we should change the schedule.  I felt hurt that the counselor would jump to that decision so easily without weighing up that there were more people involved here than just my partner and I.\n\nAnyway, was I the asshole for not wanting to change the schedule?",

      "description": "Ok, I guess I’m still a little upset over my friend’s reaction to something so small. And it wasn’t like I intended to gross her out.\n\nSo I was meeting my friend at a café today. This place was pretty packed and busy, and not the cleanest. There were little fruit flies over the trash cans, and the restrooms can use more frequent cleaning. \n\nAnyway, it was a heavy, heavy, heavy flow day for me and I couldn’t wait until I got home to change the pad. So I used the ladies’ room at the café. I wrapped the used pad in wrapper and intended to discard it in the trash. Unfortunately, the trash can was already overflowing with paper towels and other trash. So I took it out to the trash can by the drink counter/café entrance and disposed of it there. Well I didn’t know the wrapper had unraveled and the super soaked pad was fully exposed. She came back to the table complaining that some asshole threw her pad unwrapped (it WAS wrapped!) by the food counter and “period fruit flies” were buzzing all over it. \n\nI mean, I get that it wasn’t the ideal situation but the trash can in the ladies room was already overflowing! I just felt she was being super dramatic and was overreacting a little bit. And no I didn’t tell her it was me. I mean, am I right to be a little peeved by her drama? ",

      "description": "Alright Reddit, throwaway because my other account is quite active however I’ll show my fiancé this question afterward. \n\nSo long story short I’ve been with my fiancé for 7 years and we are getting married in June. We’ve been engaged for a year and a half and his family hasn’t been overly involved in wedding planning despite our encouragement. Which is fine, kinda sucks but whatevs some people aren’t into that it is what it is. \n\nSo my wedding shower was planned MONTHS in advance because my SO’s family is from out of town and I wanted them to be able to make time to come. Immediately after invited went out, all of his mothers side said they couldn’t come and they would host a shower in their town for me a few weekend later. (Which I at first was excited about but a tad bummed as I wanted at least his mom to join but still, they’re celebrating in their own way) I should also note that we all regularly travel the 8 hour distance for various events throughout the year at various intervals but their grandpa is sick and they didn’t know if they could make it. \n\nWe were in town about a month ago (with the shower scheduled two weeks after- and the second shower scheduled a week after that) and visited everyone including sick grandfather. Well, grandfather passed and we figure they’ll plan the funeral for the weekend of their families hosted shower since all the family was already going to be in town. I should note my actual shower (in our town) is co-Ed since none of his family could come we wanted the groom, and his groomsmen, siblings, etc to be able to join!\n\nAnyway we got word that the funeral was going to be the DAY of my shower (the actual shower). Since I have other family coming from out of town I cannot attend the funeral but we decided SO should obviously 100% go. But we are just wondering if we are being butt hurt for no reason. \n\nWe 100% get the family is grieving and will not be bringing this up but we sort of feel slighted because they knew about this event months in advance and already haven’t been involved it seems sort of like a slap in the face especially because the town it is in has one flight per day so we can’t even try and accommodate both events (which we wanted) or assumed it would be the day prior or after so again we could do both. \n\nSo?\nAre we the Assholes?",

      "description": "Don't think it's as straightforward as it sounds. \n\nI had a friend in hospital a few years ago. We were both on the same ward and helped each other through some really tough stuff. We're very different people, but I do have a lot of love for her. \n\nWe lost contact for a few years, both living very differently. \nShe came back in contact two days ago saying how much she loves me and misses me. Tells me I'm one of her favourite people. All real heartwarming. She is struggling with cancer now, which is obviously a really horrible thing. And I expressed my concern for her and how I was here if she needed a shoulder. Or anything. \n\nYesterday  she messages me asking for £20 to get her prescription. This doesn't sound right with me. \n1) in the UK prescriptions cost less than £10 to collect. But I'm also fairly certain if you have cancer you don't have to pay for prescriptions. \n2) she borrowed a similar amount a few years back, I'm unsure exactly on if I got it back. So don't want to focus on that too much incase I'm mistaken. \n3) it starts me thinking how much she sounded like she might be on something last night on the phone. And I know she's had quite a coke habit in the past, and also spent a lot of time on large doses of tramadol. \n\nI replied explaining that I'd lent my sister rent money this month, and was struggling to support myself and my fiance until payday (as he is waiting to start a new position). \n\nI feel like an asshole though. I have £20. I could lend her it. What if I'm being way too presumptuous? AITA?",

      "description": "My husband and I went to Sweet Tomatoes this past weekend. If you don’t know, it’s a buffet type place that first you go through a salad bar, then pay, then you have access to the rest of the options. \n\nIt was pretty busy and there was a sign at the front that said after you paid, you would have to wait to be seated. It’s normally seat yourself. So there are two line options and we picked the one with just one family ahead of us because we were really hungry. Turns out the other line would have been quicker. their kid could barely reach the salad bar. (I’m guessing about 6 or 7 years old idk were expecting our first kid now and don’t really know enough to properly guess ages) So that was taking awhile because she couldn’t really reach and I get that they’re trying to teach her responsibility but it seemed inconsiderate to those behind them (us and an elderly couple at that point.) The parents were also having multiple discussions on what should go on her plate. “That’s not enough Lima beans.” “She needs more lettuce.” \n\nAnyway we had gotten everything we needed on the salad bar and were just waiting on them. This has happened before and usually people notice and tell us we can go around. They don’t but we’re starving and anticipating a bit of a wait (not super long as we can some tables clearing already) so we went around not thinking much of it. The elderly couple behind us followed suit. We paid and were waiting at the end of the counter when finally the family got to the end to pay and the mother “told on us” to the cashier. She told him that we and the elderly couple had skipped them and they should’ve seated first. She complained that they were trying to teach their daughter about nutrition and we should’ve been patient. \n\nThe guy basically ignored her and we were seated first, but when I saw how embarrassed the daughter was I started to feel bad. So AITA?",

My mother also does not trust him and has her own theories about things he may have done.\n\nHis mother, father and him were due to come over to our families for Xmas lunch. He has now decided not to come (which in my opinion is the correct decision). He obviously won't tell his Mom about the situation between both of us now so she will likely think it's my brother's fault he is not coming. My mom has asked me to text him, to thank him for reimbursing me (despite not admitting it) and say we should let this slide for Xmas. However, I cannot do that.\n\nThis is all likely to snowball and cause a rift between my Mum and her sister, who are very close.\n\nAITA for a) not waiting until after Xmas to do all of this and b) not wanting to forgive him so soon?\n",

      "description": "This story happened a couple of months ago, so some of the details are a little foggy. On mobile, formatting etc.\n\nSo, me and my little sister have piano lessons on Thursdays. We were coming to the end of the  Christmas term, and the teacher had told my Mum last week that the next lesson was the last one before Christmas. In between hearing this and writing it down, my Mum must have got the weeks mixed up.\n\nSo the week after this, the teacher arrives. My Mum and my Sister had just left for the shop, and I assumed they’d be back shortly. Normally I have a half hour lesson, and then my sister also has one. Forty minutes later, I give my Mum a phone call. She tells me she is at [big shopping centre 45 minutes away], and that we don’t have a lesson that day. I sighed, explained the situation to her, and finished off the lesson (using my sister’s time).\n\nAbout ten minutes after the teacher has left, I get another call from my Mum, in which she apologised profusely, and told me that she would take me to a moderately famous British restaurant chain which sells spicy chicken and also rhymes with Man Toes. She said we would meet there in about 45 minutes. I agreed, and caught the bus there.\n\nI was actually worried about being about five minutes late (I don’t like being late, and I prefer others to show the same courtesy as me in arriving to arrangements on time). When I’m a couple of minutes away, I get a call from my sister, informing me their going to be about twenty minutes late. I’m annoyed by, but regrettably used to my Mum’s serial tardiness. So I getup the queue for a table, and wait for them. Fifteen minutes later, I get another call, saying they’ll be another twenty minutes to half an hour. I get a table, and start scrounging money from my wallet, and seeing what could work with the fifteen or so pounds I had on me.\n\nShortly before my food arrived, my Mum and sister arrive. I check the time, and they’re almost an hour late from when they were originally supposed to meet me. I’m pissed, and make a lot of snarky comments. Here’s a few examples. Me is Me, and M is Mum.\n\nM: So we were actually quite stressed in the car, because I-\n\nMe: Not stressed enough to leave earlier though?\n\nThe absolute gem\n\nMe: (in a snarky way) Please could you pay me back for this food, as I’m actually a bit low on cash.\n\nM: Well I don’t want to now.\n\nAs well as\n\nMe: You do know you’re fifty minutes late, right?\n\nEventually my Mum told me that if I made one more comment I’d be grounded. Her and my sister later called me “Grouchy Ves”, which pissed me off no end.\n\nI later found out from my sister that the traffic wasn’t insane. It was still pretty bad, but they only set off 5 minutes before we were supposed to meet.\n\nWe still have disagreements about this day. My Mum calls me a “moody teenager”, which I agree with, and I feel I was totally justified in being moody - this was supposed to be a make-up kind of thing, and she couldn’t even be arsed to show up on time.",

Examples: \"Should we order pizza soon?\" \"Should we talk to the children about their bad habits?\" And I know she's asking me to do it myself but I always answer something like \"Yeah I don't have a problem if you want to do that.\" And then nobody does the thing because neither of us actually requested or offered. I'm asking because I know I get a little frustrated whenever she does this and I can't really tell if I'm being righteous or just petty.",

I was born with a deviation in my penis head that had to be corrected with surgery and when I was eight I was sexually assaulted by a neighbor who burned my penis with fire. Both of these incidents left me with a lot of scarring around the head of my penis that prevents a good amount of sexual feeling.\n\nThere are days where I just will not have an orgasm no matter what and I have explained this to her many times. I’ve told her that it’s no an issue with her it’s a problem with me that I can’t change. She gets so upset and takes it so personally when I don’t orgasm that I eventually started faking them when I wasn’t going to have them. She seems to be stuck in this mindset that she’s less of a woman if she can’t make her man cum every time, and it depresses her for days. \n\nEven sense I started doing this she’s been much happier and frankly so have I because shes not depressed all the time, but in the back of my mind I feel bad for lying to her.

      "description": "I know I just made a post on here, but I'll post another anyways. I'm, as of a little while ago, single and in my final year of high school. I narrowly lost Prom King, but that was okay because I decided I didn't want to go alone anyways. Prom was something me and my ex were always super excited for, and so thinking about going without her and potentially seeing her there in the dress I bought her definitely secured my not going. However, I have been begged by lifelong friends coming out of the woodwork to reunite the \"Boyzzzzz\", a middle school group of people I was something of a kingpin of. The proposed crashing wouldn't be disruptive or rude, but my friends are convinced they can bribe or convince the DJ to play Beyonce's Single Ladies and for us to do a choreographed dance. Because my tux has been through hell and back, I no longer have a matching jacket or shoes, so the proposed outfit for me to wear would be the one pictured here that I wore for a middle school concert:\n\n[https://scontent.find1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12799171\\_1532252543744042\\_396304499616322027\\_n.jpg?\\_nc\\_cat=102&amp;\\_nc\\_ht=scontent.find1-1.fna&amp;oh=ec576ce14e4497a6f6635b3b2eb64268&amp;oe=5D061746](https://scontent.find1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/12799171_1532252543744042_396304499616322027_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.find1-1.fna&amp;oh=ec576ce14e4497a6f6635b3b2eb64268&amp;oe=5D061746)\n\nwith some alterations for flair. Several other hijinks were planned throughout the event. However, we have a pretty nice school and a very formal prom, and I don't want to ruin it for others with essentially a series of annoying inside jokes.

I just refuse to live by this norm that you have to say it when people sneeze otherwise you come across as the rude person.\n\nI've had arguments with my partner who thinks differently about this, but I believe that it's important to understand the meaning of what you say when you say it. Otherwise what's the point of speaking at all. We might as well just speak in gibberish if we don't really understand why we say things to each other.\n\nI digress though, I will often tell my family and friends to not bless me, and have to explain myself afterwards.

      "description": "I'm (20NB) and he's (20M). We moved in together in February this year. It's going well and we've gotten through a lot as a couple (our communication is much better, we've supported each other through the passing away of his close friend and my depression last year) so we're in it for the long run. This is not something I would consider breaking up over but I would like to know everyone's thoughts on it.\nSo we've divided up our house chores since we moved in together, we take it in turns putting out/bringing in the washing and doing the dishes. We both work part time around our full time studies (he works both weekend days, I do Sunday and Tuesday), we both do physically demanding work so we're both pretty tired afterwards and don't always feel like doing the chores.\nThis has arisen since I used to do most of the housework and he worked, but now that I've gotten a job this has changed (I still recognise that 2 days in a row is more tiresome than my work schedule).\nNow onto the example, so this week he took up an extra day of work on the Monday, so 3 days in a row. I had put the washing out Thursday and asked if he could bring it in on Friday. He said he'd do it Saturday after work and I offered to help since I knew he'd be tired.\nI spent much of Saturday doing housework and had a pretty rough day since the shooting in Christchurch has torn us all up (he has family and friends there who are all thankfully accounted for), I feel this might be relevant as it's a huge emotional strain on everyone. So the last thing on my mind was bringing the washing in/ reminding him.\nI had a conversation with him on Monday night (yesterday) about how I feel like I often have to remind him to do chores. I feel like I've become a lot better at not nagging since seeing a counselor, but it does bother me that he doesn't seem to do the chores of his own accord (sometimes he does). I feel like he doesn't compromise by doing things of his own accord even though I've communicated how important it is to me. \nHe said last night that he feels like I should be able to call him out for not doing washing ect. Since we're a couple, and I asked what he ever needs to nag me for if this goes both ways (the only thing he could think of was when I don't want to go to uni and he encourages me to, but I don't feel like that's the same since the chores are both our responsibility, not just mine).\nI told him I didn't want to have to remind him to do the chores since I feel like a nagging mother, and I also don't want to have to organise when to remind him to do his chores around mine, I want it to just be his thing and I do my bit and not have to worry. \nSo, AITA for feeling like he expects me to mother him?",

      "description": "So I babysit here and there for a family but haven’t in a few months because they would only hit me up last minute then be frustrated when I couldn’t do it or if I had to cancel because I was sick (it’s happened once) they called it “bailing” and were angry with me. I’ve missed the kids a lot but figured the parents would come around or not. This past weekend they hit me up to ask if I could babysit their youngest for a few hours mid-week and I said I’d love to. I was so happy they’d actually asked ahead of time so I could do it. The past few days I’ve been dealing with a sinus infection, so while not contagious or “sick” I’ve felt a bit crappy but knew with ibuprofen I’d be ok watching one toddler. \n\nLast night the mom texted and said “Could you stay later tomorrow? I had an appointment come up later in the day and also I’m keeping my other daughter home since she’s running a fever. Does that all work for you?” The appointment made the babysitting go from maybe 4 hours to over 7 and now with two kids, one of whom is sick. I wrote back and said I wasn’t feeling 100% myself and had thought I could handle the one ok for a few hours but couldn’t do all day and both kids, especially if one is sick. And that I (actually do) have a doctors appointment this afternoon. She said she understood me not being able to stay late but that this was the second time I’d “bailed” on them (last time being when I was sick and I guess this time now) and she’d figure it out. I was frustrated because she was the one who changed all the circumstances, I could still watch the daughter, I wasn’t bailing, I just couldn’t do this new thing, I didn’t respond,\n\nSo AITA for not being able to do this today? This also isn’t the first time she’s sprang her child being sick on me. I’ve shown up for full days of watching to a very sick child more than a few times which is upsetting for the kid and not great for me as I can’t afford to be sick with this just being an occasional gig for me. I feel so bad for not being able to do it today and was so excited to babysit (and make some money) but worry I’m the asshole for not just rolling with everything. I know how hard it is for parents to find childcare but I’m not that bendable.",

Thing is though he hasn't had his first communion yet. \n\nFor those who don't know Roman Catholics literally believe that the bread and wine become the body and blood of christ. You have to take a class in order to be allowed to receive communion. \n\nI don't agree with this which is why I left the church (among a few other reasons) but I respect it that I don't go up and receive communion because I know many devoted Catholics who truly believe in it.\n\nMy parents (who say they are devoted catholic) says that it's okay to receive communion without going to class while I said no.  They said that I was being too rigid and \"a pharisee\" because I was saying they should follow this. I can understand not following EVERYTHING in any religion but this is literally one of the biggest things in Catholicism so I felt like this is one of those things which they should respect and follow. \n\nAm I the asshole?

      "title": "AITA for not being able to help my sister and not apologizing",
      "description": "So my little sister’s  partner’s grandfather died a couple of weeks ago.  This meant that my sister and his family had to drive five hours away for the funeral.  When I heard the news I immediately text him my condolences. They weren’t close so he’s not distressed just sad. \n\nI called my sister the next day (Wednesday) and we are chatting about how everyone is coping and funeral plans. She explains that it will be difficult for them since they have a 1 year old puppy and they usually leave her with his parents or in their fenced yard but neither are an option apparently. \n\nAll of a sudden my sister asked if I could maybe come down and house/dog sit. I said yeah I should be able to (thinking the funeral would be over the weekend). We chat about the puppy and then I ask her when she wants me to come down since I had to deliver some papers to the courthouse on Friday morning but would make the 1.5 hour drive that afternoon. She then informs me that the funeral is Friday and I would need to come Thursday afternoon. It is important to note that I share a car and would have to alter schedules to make Thursday work. \n\nSo I apologize for the confusion and told her I thought the funeral would be over the weekend and I am unable to help due to having prior plans. I forgot to mention the car because she started to tell me how she didn’t believe my “plans” and I was being selfish. \n\nI genuinely care for her partner like a brother and wanted to help in a difficult time. I feel like I should have been clearer with why I couldn’t make it but she was really upset before I could explain. \n\nShe hasn’t spoken to me in over two weeks and she called my mom to vent and my mom explained the car situation but they both came to the conclusion that I’m being selfish because I could’ve put off my court papers and rented /borrowed a car. I have been texting her like usual with no response. \n\nI tried to let it blow over because while I did say I’d help, it was five minutes before I knew the details and I had to get this particular errand done. I am getting irritated because she is trying to “teach me a lesson” with her silence according to my mom. I just don’t think I should apologize anymore in this situation. It was unfortunate that I couldn’t drop everything to make it down the next day even though I said I’d help but I don’t feel like that makes me selfish. Mom is trying to play peacemaker but it is frustrating that she agrees with both of us to our faces and is playing it kinda as a joke. Like I should have been more flexible and it’s funny my sister is being so dramatic. Not helpful. \n\nI’d like to get past this but I don’t think I should give in because my sister had always been the dominant one and can be pretty moody so I usually end up apologizing but I just don’t think IATA here. \n\nI’d appreciate some insight and if I am being selfish I will apologize. I just need some unbiased opinions. \n\nThanks! \n\nTl;dr : sister (25) is upset that I (27) said I would dog sit before knowing the details of when she needed my help. That was not great but she refuses to speak to me as a way to teach me a lesson about being selfish because she doesn’t think I had valid reasons not to help. I feel like it was an unfortunate situation but I don’t think I should apologize as I was willing to help if I could. Frustrated by mom’s attempt to play peacemaker. ",

      "description": "This has happened a couple of times with my friend and each time we have argued about who is in the wrong.\n\nIn this particular case me and my friend (F) went out to the bars with some other friends of ours. I'm having a great time, and my friend was too. \n\nNow my friend recently decided that she doesn't want to drink as much when she goes out, so she only had a couple drinks for the night. Her lack of drunked-ness coupled with her general dislike for \"partying\" as hard as me and the other people there made her want to tap out around 12:30 am or so.\n\nShe turns to me to say \"Hey, I think I'm going to go home.\" I say something along the lines of \"Okay, see you later!\" I was having a blast and didn't want to leave so early.\n\nShe looks at me for a second, then heads out of the bar. I thought we were cool until the next morning and she tells me that I shouldn't have let her walk home alone. It is a long walk from the bar area to our place (maybe 20/30 min) , but she wasn't that drunk and I myself have made it home alone plenty of times before that, so I thought it was fine. I also mentioned that she could have taken an Uber if she was that scared to walk home alone, but she did make the fair point that it's a bummer to pay surge prices.\n\nI just want to know once and for all if it's  an asshole move to let a friend (especially female friend) walk home alone?",

      "description": "OK so let me get a rundown of the story\n\nMy parents bought new phones (The recent S10 series) My parents let me inherit their old phone. Which are an S8 and a S8 Plus. My grandma who lives with us got the S8 from my mom and i got the S8 Plus from my dad. Considering that this is my first proper smartphone, I was exited. The S8 plus has a small crack in the corner but there was nothing too serious about it. I honestly preferred a smaller phone and, thought that my grandma would prefer the stronger and more powerful like the S8.\n\nSo I asked my grandma if we could trade phones. Note we did not have a phone number to those phones yet so they were just glorified tablets. We both had our own phones happily (S8 plus to my grandma and vanilla S8 for me) About a week later my mom finds out that me and my grandma did the dastardly illegal dead of \"Trading phones\" and started yelling at me for something between me and my grandma.\n\nIdk lads am i the asshole\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Last week concert tickets went on sale for one of my SO &amp; I’s my favorite bands. We knew it would be in high demand, so we were both gonna be ready the second the tickets went on sale.\n\nI downloaded the Ticketmaster app, and had my laptop open with 3 tabs on various browsers that I would try to refresh. He only was going to use his phone (on safari, so not even on the TM app, which I advised him against)\n\nI end up getting thru and am able to secure 2 tickets for us, Ticketmaster crashed on his phone and he wasn’t able to get any tickets. Show sold out in like 3 minutes. He Venmoed me half for his ticket, everything is good.\n\nLast night we were at a bar and a song from that band was playing, he mentions that if he can’t make it to the concert, he was gonna sell his ticket to a friend or try to turn a profit. (Currently, the tickets for that same show are on stubhub for 4x the price)\n\nI told him that wouldn’t be possible. \n\n1) the tickets are under a will call to be picked up by name.\n2) the concert is 5 hours away, so if he does want to sell the ticket, that means I’d have to go alone, which I wouldn’t (my car wouldn’t make it on that road trip, I couldn’t afford to book a room alone, plus I just really wouldn’t wanna go alone in general)\n\nI told him if he wasn’t going to go anymore, then I’d just pay him back what he paid me for his ticket and I’d try to see if one of my friends would join instead.\n\nHe got really angry, walked out on me in the bar, and said “it’s MY ticket. You can’t tell me what to do with it!!” Like it was really blown out of proportion how upset he got over it. It ended up being a big fight, but am I in the wrong? Is he entitled to do what he wants with it? Or is it mine?\n\nTLDR: I got to concert tickets at a sold out show for my SO &amp; I, he paid me back half. He says if he can’t go, he would sell the ticket to turn a profit. I said the tickets are mine and under my name, and I’d just pay him back the amount he gave me. He said it’s his and he’s entitled to do what he wants with it.\n\nUsing a throwaway btw.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my abusive ex to change or be happy",
      "description": "So, I was with a guy who was physically abusive (think black and blue eyes, kicking, shoving, etc.) and emotionally abusive to me. He also sexually assaulted me multiple times. He made me think it was somehow something that I did or how I acted that warranted him to treat me this way. Whenever I would try to leave, he would promise that he would change. He started going back on medication (he had made me believe I needed to go on medication and never told me that he had gone off of his) and started doing meditations and FINALLY went to therapy after an incident where he yelled at me on the street for no reason. I found out later that he had done something similar to someone else, except when she broke up with him, he ended up stalking her and pinning her down and forcing her to have sex with him. His dating history is littered with young women he emotionally abused in some way or the other. He also got into a fight with his sister and assaulted her, strangulation, and refuses to admit he did anything wrong. He has dragged her in the courts for over a year now because he refuses to plead guilty. I broke up with him. Two days later, he's with someone else and all of a sudden, I'm the one that was holding him back and I'm the one that was too hard on him because I couldn't forgive him for what he did to me and I'm the one that can't see that he's a better person and won't support him through his trial with his sister. He's telling everyone I was so hard on him for no reason and he's telling the new girl all these lies about his past and how I'm crazy, similar to what he told me about his previous exes. I want to be clear so I'm not completely one sided, after 2 years of the physical abuse, I did not trust him. I wanted him to prove that he was becoming a better person but I would catch him in small lies all the time. I was hard on him because I was scared but I just wanted him to be accountable. His sister's trial just killed any hope I had. For the last year I was with him, I was not the kind, supportive, and caring partner I wish I was. He hurt me and I wanted to make sure he was getting better and any small lie or problem would become a red flag in my eyes. I was still scared of him. \n\nBut here's the thing now, I definitely don't forgive him for what he did to me but I also don't want him to change or repent. I just want him to be shitty forever because if he changes that means that his life might get better and I want his life to be ruined by him the way he's ruined it the past 35 years. I want his punishment to be that he is a crappy human being forever. I'm terrified that one day he might actually change and that then allows him to find true happiness because I don't know if I can be okay with that. Whenever I hear about him still lying or doing his same old tricks, I get happy because that means he didn't change, even if that means that he's hurting and lying to other people. I feel like an asshole for feeling this way. I wish I could wish well on everyone, even the people who hurt me the most, but I can't wish well on him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: ex was physically and emotionally abusive to me, was shitty to multiple other women in this world, i broke up with him, now don't want him to find happiness ever even if that means he hurts other people",

She told me her friend will be bringing her other friend over for dinner as well and my SO said she doesn’t know if she was a guy or girl. After the dinner I ask how it went and she said good and told me about it and that’s was that. Fast forward to today when we called, she was telling me something and she mentioned the a guy was there and her friend was trying to get her with him (they think she’s single because we aren’t public with our relationship). I got upset she didn’t tell me and she said she didn’t think it was important and he hardly even spoke the whole night. I trust my girlfriend and her ability to handle situations. I wasn’t upset about her being around a guy, but upset at the fact she didn’t mention it when she had several chances to mention it. Her defence is that this seems like I’m not trusting her and she feels like she has to step on eggshells. That she has to go through a checklist when she goes out and that in parenting her. She was pretty mad at me. I just want to know if she’s with guys. She’s allowed to be with them, but for safety and general courtesy I want to know. So, AITA? ",

      "description": "I live in a flat, and recently we had some new upstairs neighbours move in. I haven’t met or seen them at all yet, but I’m about to lose my mind.\n\nThey clearly have a number of small children, which is fine. You expect some noise in a block of flats anyway, it can’t be helped, and I get that kids can be noisy but this is actual insanity.\n\nFrom early morning to at least 10:30pm, every single day, they are tearing about the flat and screaming. Stomping SO loud non stop it’s all we can hear, and screaming and shouting and jumping, dragging or throwing things across the floor etc. \n\nAs I say, this happening occasionally is to be expected, I don’t expect a silent home when I live in a block of flats. But in my opinion this is happening beyond what would be considered reasonable.\n\nIt’s not normal walking footsteps, it’s loud, constant thudding and stamping. The screaming and shouting and crying is relentless and very piercing. And as I say, this goes on ALL day EVERY day and until way past 10pm every single night.\n\nAt a weekend I’m completely fine with noise (we have other neighbours that at a weekend regularly have loud parties until 5am and I never complain - it’s a weekend so crack on in my books); but during the week I think this is just rude and inconsiderate. There’s no longer a moment of peace in our flat.\n\nI totally get that kids are a different ball game to parties, you can’t tell people to keep their kids silent. But I really feel like more could be done to at least minimise some of this noise, at the moment it sounds like these kids are allowed to constantly run absolute riot.\n\nWould I be an asshole if I said something? Maybe a (very politely worded) note through the door? I know notes are a bit passive aggressive but I feel knocking on the door could be a bit confrontational...\n\nMy flatmate also finds this infuriating, but her view is “kids will be kids, we can’t tell them to shut their kids up, it’s asshole behaviour”. Whilst I would usually agree with this, for example I’d never complain about a crying newborn or something like that that can’t be helped, I think this is just unreasonable from the neighbours. If not the level of noise, at least the time of night it goes on to (and duration).\n\nSo, would I be a massive asshole for telling these new neighbours to rein their kids in before I actually lose my mind??!",

      "description": "AITA for trying to work things out with an asshole\n\n**Background**:\n\n**Mom**: 70 years\n\n* Has dementia, 1.5 years ago scored 20 on the Montreal test, 8 months ago scored 10, still reasonable cognisant\n* Got bipolar when was 30\n* Divorced 18 years ago, moved in with Bob 3 years later, they never had carnal relations, nor slept in the same room\n* Was living with Bob and two of Bob's family members until this happened\n* Calls Bob the love of her life and very much cares for him\n* Gave POA to myself &amp; my sister\n\n**Bob**: 55 years\n\n* Anger management issues but, clearly cares for my mom\n* On and off welfare, tough life\n* Has been benefiting from the comforts of my mom having some money\n* As my mom's situation has been deteriorating has been denying dementia\n* Unilaterally changed her medication\n* Sent many messages blaming both myself and my sister for the situation, angry messages, emotional blackmail, etc\n\n**My sister &amp; I**\n\n* Long distance\n* Families\n* Careers\n* Standard adult life problems\n\n**The Question**:\n\nSo, basically what happened is that after Bob took my mom off Invega she inevitably relapsed into another bipolar episode.  She went to the hospital and desperately wanted to go home (even though there was a clear issue with bipolar). The doctors and medical professionals decided that due to her mental health, lack of cleanliness and drug use in the house, and lack of a full-time caretaker she, needed to be in a care home.  Bob found out about this and started freaking out 'you can't take her from me!'.  He was banned from seeing her at the hospital.  She was moved to a long term care facility (1.5-hour drive as it was the earliest available) and he continued to freak out (including many abusive/angry messages to me &amp; my sister).  He was banned from seeing her and all visitors are currently banned from seeing her. My sister, in the meantime, was dealing with police phone calls, the lawyer he sent, my mom's finances (which were apparently a major mess) and generally hates Bob at this point. Additionally, my mom is on a waiting list for a care home where my sister lives which would mean Bob &amp; her friends for the past 15 years would never be able to see her.\n\nSo, in light of all this, I talked to my mom on the phone.  She begged me to be allowed to talk to Bob.  So I reached out to Bob and tried to get him to act like an adult (cease the abusive messages, withdraw the lawyer he sent after us).  I got him on the phone with my mom by setting up a conference call and she was extremely grateful.  As Bob has exhibited signs of adulthood, I've been trying to arrange for a reduction of the restrictions on him, and possibly move my mom into a close by care home.  My sister does not appreciate this at all, and we've had a major conflict over me trying to work with Bob.  Am I the asshole for trying to allow my mom to see her friends &amp; the people she's lived with for 15 years even in the face of this behavior?",

      "description": "Didn't know how to world the title so please bare with me. This is a serious post so please don't say that this is shp.\n\nBit of backstory: I live with my mum, and about a year ago our toilet broke. It would not flush properly anymore and the pipes would make this horrible churning sound when it actually did flush. I told her for months and months to get it fixed but she would just say that it was fine, she couldn't be bothered and it was too much hassle to try and get it fixed. It's not as if she did not have the money either, I even offered to pay for a plumber numerous times but she refused.\n\nSo then today, stepdad goes to the toilet and it gives up the goose completely. Mum said it's fine, and that we can just pour a jug of water down it when we go for a wee and that we'll have to put on a pair of gloves and scoop out the poo and put it in the bin when we go number 2. At this point I am completely floored. I ask her why we can't just call a plumber out, and offered to pay for one for her again, she wouldn't have to pay a single penny, but she says again that she doesn't want to because it's too much hassle and that she doesn't want to let a \"strange man\" into her house. We argue about it for a while, mainly because I just cannot see her reasoning behind not wanting to get a plumber, and that what she wanted us to do was very unhygienic and gross. I end up snapping at her after she shuts me down for what felt like the 100th time and said to her that I wasn't putting my hand down the toilet to scoop up my own shit, and that it will be her fault when the pipes burst and we'll have to rip up the whole floor to get it sorted, just because she wouldn't get a plumber out. She calls me a selfish bitch and storms off. Stepdad says I'm being unreasonable and then I immediately felt guilty for snapping at her.\n\nI honestly feel like my head is screwed on backwards in this situation. I have no idea what is going on anymore.\n\nSo am I the asshole in this situation? Surely it's not a normal thing to do to have to pick your own feces out of the toilet and dispose of it yourself?",

Oh, and biology (or science in general) because to her every woman wants to get pregnant and have a baby, and you are broken if you don't (one of the major things we disagree on).

      "description": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few years and we are always open with each other. We don’t really give each other stupid rules about who we can or can’t talk to except for a few occasions. \n\nI ask him not to talk to this one girl that constantly broke his heart ( not a old girlfriend just some girl he liked) because she constantly made him feel bad about himself. That girl made it difficult to make him get into relationships so I don’t want her to make him feel bad. So he doesn’t talk to her. Both of us don’t like her and we stay away.\n\nThe guy my boyfriend wants me to stop talking to is one of his best friends. He thinks his friend is a huge asshole and whenever he is around , the friend makes him feel bad about himself ( not a good friend I know). Anyways , my BF constantly talks with this guy , plays video games and hang out but he hates when I talk to him. \n\nIt’s kinda hard for me not to talk to him considering he’s around so much and I feel like it’s not a fair standard. I asked him if I should just message him telling him I can’t talk to the friend anymore but my bf said that would be awkward. \n\nSo tonight we got in a fight because he’s mad I still talk to his friend and he said “ it’s fine because I finally accepted you won’t listen to me”.  I got mad and o thinks it’s unfair that he still gets to hang out with him and it just makes it awkward for me because I’m not ‘allowed’ to talk to him. He won’t let me tell the friend I can’t talk to him , he just wants me to ignore him which I find pretty rude. I feel like if I ignore him that will create more drama. I don’t know what to do.\n\nSo AITA for still talking to my boyfriends friend even though he told me not to ?",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my husband to work from home?",
      "description": "My husband has a very flexible job that usually allows for working from home several days per week. That's great, for several reasons, but it can also be difficult on both of us. Occasionally he has to do video calls, record meetings or interviews, and though he has an office room upstairs, noise can still reach.\n\nWe have 3 kids under 4 who are home most/all of the day, whom I look after primarily during workday hours. It's just plain noisy sometimes. I believe I strike a good balance between keeping the peace/choosing my battles and not spoiling them or letting them get away with bad behavior, so there's occasionally screaming, crying, fights, and tantrums. That's how babies and toddlers are (and my husband is around a lot and knows this well).\n\nMy husband has never gotten upset about the noise, but he will request we be quiet during times he's on a call, and send reminder texts to keep it down pretty much every time the volume goes up. This is stressful for me, because one, it's not like I enjoy the crying, I'm already trying my best to keep them calm anyway, not like I've forgotten, and two, I don't like feeling like a nuisance in our own house. I don't mind taking the kids out of the house during vital times either, but again, if they're all home it's not the easiest thing to keep them all safe and corralled outside either, and especially times weather is bad or I'm not feeling up to it.\n\n(Another, smaller piece of why it can be extra stress when he's working at home is that he does create extra mess. He's conscientious enough, but if he's busy he might eat/drink and leave dishes in the kitchen, leave clothes not put away, small things like that. I like keeping the house fairly neat, and that's already a herculean effort with all the children around, so I don't appreciate extra clutter on top of that. I don't want to complain about this too much, since it's not a huge deal, I am cleaning anyway, and I'm happy to do so while he's the one doing all of the income-bringing work. So again, it's another place I'm not sure if I have the right to complain.)\n\nSo, I THINK I'm being fairly accommodating, to a reasonable extent. I do want my husband to enjoy the benefits of working from home, being able to wear comfy clothes, no commute, work in the comfort of his own space, etc., plus I benefit as well, if it's a less busy day and he's around to cook and eat together, play with kids together, and so on. But at the same time, it's often an additional stress on top of an already insane amount of stress I deal with every day being the primary kid watcher and work-from-home parent myself. I feel like, since he always has the option of going to the work office, or even elsewhere out of the house, if he needs absolute quiet, he should arrange ahead of time to leave, and if he chooses not to, he should not really have much complaint about the kids being noisy when I am also at least making an effort and he knows they're unpredictable little kids.\n\nWhen I ask my husband what his plans are for the day, he sometimes asks or offers if I'd like him to leave the house. I already feel like too much an asshole to say \"yes\". But I'm not sure, so that's why I'm asking. I tried to represent both sides fairly and accurately. AITA for not wanting my husband to work from home all the time, and WIBTA if I said so?",

      "description": "I'm concerned. My dog was whining near the dinner table because she wanted food. She does this all the time and usually lets up if you tell her to. My brother was annoyed and decided instead to grab the scruff of her neck rather tightly for several minutes. She looked really uncomfortable and I said as calmly as I could \"(Brother), let her go. She's fine.\" I had to say it a few times for him to stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also concerned about the way he's treating one of our cats, Marcel. Marcel had an incident where he was scared by a contractor who entered through the basement storm doors, which is where his litter boxes are. This combined with pain from defecation (his stool was often bloody before we switched him to a higher protein food) has caused him not to defecate in the litter box. Instead, he goes on the cement floor in the basement. We've tried to get him to stop and eventually realized that he probably won't and if we try anymore he might choose to shit upstairs, which is worse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother is mad that Marcel does this, and has said stuff \"If we kick him he'll probably stop,\" and \"he knows what he's doing is bad, we should punish him.\" Punishing the cat is a terrible idea, and might make him decide to start going to the bathroom in a worse place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy cat took a dump on the basement floor and my brother caught him a moment afterwards, then chased him upstairs and when my cat jumped on the couch, my brother blew in his face several times. My cat was obviously upset about this and his eyes got all big and he flinched. Me and both of my parents told him to stop. I'm upset about it. A few minutes ago, my brother came to talk to me and said if he caught Marcel he would be able to stop him. I don't know how he intends to accomplish this but it's really worrying me.

Context: we all live with my parents because they have a duplex, and while we build another addition for my husband and I, we're staying in the other \"apartment\" with my sister, her husband and kids, me, my husband and his son. I'm also pregnant.\n\nThat being said, my sister's husband has a habit with doing drugs. He's been in rehab and has  already been dealt with my mom once for doing it under her roof. \n\nToday, my boyfriend was fixing a hole in the fence my dogs had dug when he found a needle 15 feet from their back bedroom door. It wasn't there a few days ago because we had to fill another hole my dog dug (she's a heathen I know but I love her) and there definitely wasn't a needle there. My dogs get into our trash when they get out sometimes, and it's possible they drug it up or something. None of us, nor my neighbors have any medical conditions requiring said needle. My boyfriend has dealt with drugs before and he says it's for sure used for drugs. \n\nSo I'm stuck. My mom will test him if I tell her, and if it's positive he'll get kicked out. But he's awful when he's on drugs, as he's being now. Aggressive, complains about everything, fucks with our stuff and threatens to kill/harm my animals. My sister may be a shitty person and subject her kids to a meth head shiteater, but I don't want my kids anywhere near it. So, WIBTA for showing my mom the needle?",

      "description": "Throwaway.\n\nFriends for 10 years. Neighbors for 7 years. Now live multiple states apart.\n\nWhen I met friend, she was going through some rough shit &amp; had some abandonment issues due to a really hard childhood. She was pretty possessive, always wanting me to confide in her, often asking for the label of “best friend”. She would intermittently flip out &amp; tell me i’d leave “just like everyone else”. The pressure felt weird/uncomfortable to me but seemed to come from a place of insecurity, so I assured her I loved her like a sister &amp; i wasn’t going anywhere, &amp; that she was free to come &amp; go if that helped her be comfortable.  Pretty early on, I inwardly decided our friendship was one-sided as far as vulnerability was concerned but I was ok with that.\n\nOver the years I’ve been told I should cut her off, but I generally don’t believe in burning bridges... plus i told her i’d always be around to be a sounding board or whatever &amp; didn’t feel like i could go back on that.\n\nAs time has gone on, this friend has generally only reached out when she needs something,  which is fine— I feel like we all need someone we can rely on. She stiff-armed me a few months ago when she got into a relationship that most of her other friends didn’t support. She assumed I held their same opinion though she never asked me. I didn’t really push for her to talk but i did reach out some to let her know i missed her &amp; was thinking about her.\n\nRecently she broke her silence, &amp;  messaged me saying her life is falling apart. She said she was going on a head-clearing vacation to visit family. i floated the idea that i could possibly meet up with her on her trip as her destination is slightly closer to where i live than her home stays is, but that i wasn’t sure i could because i work etc.\n\nShe liked the idea, as we haven’t seen each other since i moved. (now, a detail: i had a kid 2 years ago &amp; this friend has asked about my kid maybe twice since i gave birth.) she went on to say that she imagined it would be hard for me to find care for my kid so i could make the trip but she appreciated it. That really irritated me &amp; has me wanting to renege my offer altogether. Perhaps I should have voiced my assumption that it wouldn’t be a problem for me to bring my toddler with me... but her saying that feels like the proverbial last straw.\n\nI used to not care that this relationship is one-sided but i feel hurt that she doesn’t care about my kid or even remember my kid’s name. \n\nMaybe it’s normal for people with no kids to not have an interest in their friends’ kids. I didn’t/don’t expect this friend to like, babysit my kid or anything like that— but I feel like my friend isn’t interested in me as the whole person i am— maybe just the part of me that can offer encouragement... &amp; i feel a little done.\n\ntl;dr- long-time friend has hit hard times &amp; needs encouragement but i’m tired of extending myself but feel like an asshole",

      "description": "A week ago, the group I've been working with had to present the work we've done to a superior. It was bad, had minor details missing here and there, and it led to a major buildup of anger. \n\nAt one point, it was apparent that one part of the presentation was missing. Everybody looked at me because it was the part I had to work on. God knows how my already angry superior might be feeling at that time, and that was all I could think of.\n\nNobody knew that my part was left out of the presentation with an exception of one person, who did not inform me earlier about this matter, which, if he did earlier, I would most definitely work on solving this technical difficulty myself. Out of shock, I spoke out stating that nobody informed me about this and that I thought the person in charge had everything settled.\n\nLittle did I know, that statement had hurt my colleague, BAD. My guess is he's been feeling shit already from the hurtful comments and all the yelling from our superior. I had to apologise countless times as he went on about how I could have asked earlier, and how I could have done it myself instead. Well, I didn't ask or do it myself because since he volunteered to take up the task to get it done for everyone, why would I have to check or ask or anything like that? Since nobody said anything, I assumed everything is done. So i guess now it is on me to check if his task is done right?\n\nThis incident has created a barrier between him and I, and I think it's gonna stay this way for a long time. I hate these type of tensions and I'm always avoiding it, and I really don't know why it keeps happening to me.\n\nI'm honestly just lost here. AITA?",

She's asked me for permission for this and other things such as selling a video of herself tied/taped up worried, struggling to get free, and pics of her feet etc. Fucking weird I know believe me. Usually I'll agree but full blown nudity I'm not cool with. She's my wife and if she wants to make easy money off weirdos, uncomfortable but ok as long as I shoot video, approve more risque pics, and make sure she's ok. Had been asking for \"good pics\" for a while but haven't got any nudes.\nObviously I get upset when I catch her and tell her I'm not blaming her I'm not mad but I want her to understand why I'm hurt, upset, that it's wrong, and to respect herself me and our marriage. She says she just using them and \"sex\" as an object to get what she wants or to show thanx to some who got her nice things. That it's her body I don't own her. I tell her she should feel bad it's like I don't cross her mind or her even think about me. And say you're not a whore anymore, says she basically \"had to/no other option/forced another story ik, I see you're so much more. Immediately apologised I felt bad for saying it due to illnesses. \n\nShe looked so hurt and like I was shaming her. Way later said I was manipulating her you feel sorry but that's not the topic. Says she's sorry she needs to put me first focus on me and our marriage. And she'll do anything to make up for such a horrible mistake. And she did a lot for me over the next week. I did feel guilty and bad if she thought I was \"attacking\" her but who wouldn't be upset. But after her childhood trauma I didn't want her to do anything that may be a trigger.\n",

      "description": "    In my Stats class this year, I sit next to a guy who is very obviously gay. I am a straight guy, and while I have no issue with homosexuality and don’t view being gay as a bad thing, sitting next to this guy makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable. \n\n     My table is two other guys and us two, but for whatever reason he makes a point everyday to comment on how wonderful my pants are, and often calls me cute or adorable whenever referring to me. I tolerated it at first, since I thought that’s just his personality, but noticed very quickly that he only does it to me, and none of the other guys at the table. I stopped responding to anything other than my real name, Gray, about two months ago to try and give him a hint, but he still does it everyday without fail. He also makes very obvious innuendos all the time about being gay loudly to our whole table, and kind of makes it awkward for everyone.\n\n\n    Yesterday I raised my hand to answer a question, and when the teacher called on me, he perked his head up and said “that’s not his name, his name is adorable and you should call him as such” loudly to the whole class. The teacher looked at me funny, and I said “unless you want to make me uncomfortable on a daily basis like he does you can just call me Gray”\n\n    Now, in retrospect, I realize that probably wasn’t the best way to voice that opinion to him,  as the whole class heard it, but I was really fed up with it at the time. I understand that it might just be his personality, but the fact that he specifically targets me at the table makes it seem to me like he was trying to get me to say something so he could play the victim. \n\n    He acted very offended and didn’t say anything for the rest of class, but I don’t know if I really did anything wrong. AITA?\n\n    This is my first AITA, so feel free to tell me if I should format this differently or if this doesn’t belong here.\n\nTl;dr, gay guy in my class made obvious innuendos and called me by the title adorable despite it being made known that I was really uncomfortable ",

      "description": "My daughter’s 5th grade class is having a sex education week this week and yesterday she came home and I asked her what she learned.\n\nShe told me basically what I’m shocked to think they’re teaching children that age and then she showed me a condom that was given to her.\n\nThis morning I walked right into the principals office and demanded to know why they were giving my daughter condoms in sex Ed (as well as why they’re teaching her about oral and anal sex other more advanced topics that are age inappropriate).\n\nThe principal insisted that I leave immediately and to instead send a letter if I feel so strongly against “proper sex education”. She threatened to have the school resource officer remove me.\n\nOn the way out, I actually asked to talk to him and he told me that if it was him he would be pissed and in fact he said he would have made a huge scene and he commended me for my peacefulness.\n\nGuys it is just me or is it NOT cool to be giving condoms to 5th graders and teaching them about oral/anal sex? 5th grade in the USA is about age 10-11 btw.",

      "description": "My best friend from college and I have been long distance for most of our friendship (since College, so for 10ish years now). We used to chat on the phone regularly but when I gave birth two years ago, this became increasingly hard for me and now we mostly chat through sporadic texts and Instagram private messages. If it matters, she is currently childless and gets sad about the fact that she is not married and doesn’t have kids yet.\n\nI’ll admit that I was the asshole for a little - early motherhood has been more overwhelming for me than a lot of moms. My kid only started sleeping through the night last week (literally) and before that, I was up every 2-3 hours. So I was chronically sleep deprived, working a full-time job, and trying to keep my marriage stable and happy. I also had a bout of postpartum anxiety, where I obsessed over SIDS for most of my daughter’s first year. My goal was to keep my head above water while still being a good mom and partner.\n\nExcuses made, when I had spare time or a moment to breathe, I mostly wanted to catch up on sleep or take a shower or just watch mindless TV. My long distance social connections (local folks were easier to get together with) became a low priority and I’m sure my friend felt that. She would try calling but I wouldn’t answer either because I was with baby, at work, with my husband, or rarely just decompressing. I tried texting but she’s not a big texter.\n\nNow at nearly the two year mark, I can feel the clouds of early motherhood lifting. I have more energy, a greater sense of self, and I’m finally out of survival mode. I am however still not at a place where I can be spontaneous. My kid will yell and scream if I’m on the phone (very fun phase) and so I need to schedule long social calls ahead of time for when my husband, mom, or another babysitter can watch/distract her during evenings or weekends. She is still too young (developmentally) to be left alone in a room.\n\nWhen I’ve asked my friend if we can schedule time (I’ve apologized for being MIA and said I wanted to catch up and make up for time lost), she always says sure but then won’t pick up when I call. Then she calls at a random time later and gets annoyed when I can’t talk then. She says scheduling calls is too regimented for her and she’d appreciate some flexibility on my end to show effort. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So, I was gonna get a single dorm, but my parents thought it was too expensive, so I got a double with a randomly assigned roommate. He was a bit awkward at first when I first met him and he didn't talk much. I noticed he had some kind of animal costume in his closet one time and thought it was for Halloween or something. Everything was generally okay up until the point he talked to me about \"furries\" and I thought it was alright, not for me, but do your own thing, you know? After this however, he started wearing it in the dorm while talking to his friends online. I usually have headphones on and our desks are facing away from each other, so it didn't really bother me too much, it was kind of weird though.\nAnyways, I told him I was gonna have a friend over to do calc homework, so I figured he would take off his fursuit when I went to go down and let my friend in, but when I opened the door, he was standing right in front of it and said something along the lines of, \"Hi X's friend! I'm Y, his fuzzy roommate!\" I was shocked at this display, I saw my friend looking wide eyed, not knowing what to say, so I just said, \"we'll be right back\" and we just went into the study room down the hall and just pretended it never happened. I had no idea how to address it in the first place. After that, I went back to my dorm and told him that it seemed a little much to do that kind of thing in front of strangers and he said okay, but he seemed very sad, so I assumed he got the message.\nUnfortunately, he did not, and when I told him that a few friends were coming over to watch some videos, there he was again, but this time he was sitting at his chair and just said, \"Hi.\" It was an improvement, but he was still wearing his fursuit... I just told my friends it was for some kind of project and shrugged it off. We were watching YouTube videos on my laptop for about an hour and throughout that my roommate was talking to his friends quietly and would occasionally make strange animal noises and my friends started glancing at him.\nI didn't know what to say to him after my friends left, but this has got to stop. I don't know if it makes him feel more at home to wear his fursuit, or if he's acting differently because he's in a new place? I just don't get it and need some help getting him to know that he can't wear his fursuit while I have friends over, but I don't want to hurt his feelings. What do I do?",

      "description": "My family moved to Florida 2 years ago, I preferred to stay in Canada because I grew up here and have little interest in uprooting myself because they wanted to move. I would stay in the family home paying utilities, until I could afford to move out/find a roommate.\n\nI just graduated Uni and got my first permanent job. A few months before they left my little brother was rushed to the hospital where they found a tumor in his brain, it was small and he had a pre-existing condition which made it hard to diagnose as cancerous or not. Nothing was done about it as that would require major surgery, the plan was to monitor it and see if it grows before doing anything.\n\n\nAlmost a year ago, after they had been living there for a few months, the tumor became malignant. My brother had reached stage 4 and was diagnosed with a Glioblastoma. He was rushed to the hospital and had emergency surgery to remove as much as they can. I flew down immediately and stayed for 4 months while chemo and radiation treatment was on going for him. At this point my Mother the primary breadwinner had lost her job. \n\nI moved back to Canada and went back to work, my parents take care of my brother. Mom found a new job, Dad took a leave to care for my brother full time. \n\nMy parents say they can't make me move to Florida with them. My other relatives heavily imply that I should move and help care for my brother and my parents. I feel like I've abandoned them to face this alone at the same time know that I have no interest in living in the states, or how I would leave after the inevitable happens. Am I the asshole for refusing to move/leaving?",

Their relationship has been rocky to say the least. My friend is well aware that I don't like her boyfriend so I'm generally the one she always comes to to complain about him as she knows I'll probably agree. \n\nHowever, knowing her personally, I know she's not a very good girlfriend to him either. Shes very close minded and refuses to take responsibility for anything she does wrong. Because of this I tend to assume she isn't giving me the whole story when she complains about her boyfriend and if I question her she just gets mad at me. I also sometimes hear arguments from his perspective through other people so I know it can be her one sided view sometimes. \n\nThe advice I always give her is that if she's not happy she should break up with him, however that usually makes her go back on her complaints and say that it's just a rough patch. I can't prove this, but everyone that knows her tends to agree she's only with him because she's codependent and doesn't like being alone.\n\n A few months ago they broke up briefly and when she told me they were getting back together, I clearly told her that it was her choice but that I didn't want to listen to her complaints anymore because she's obviously accepting his behaviour. She didn't listen. She doesnt complain as much but she'll always drop into the conversation that he said something she didn't like. AITA for not wanting to hear it anymore?",

After a few minutes for some reason I just snapped and told them they HAD to get out of our seats or we get the security that was at entrance, they called me a little b***h for not sharing seats (in a typical NY accent) they got up and left our area, I felt really bad about it later because I don’t normally do this kind of stuff.

      "description": "So a little background; My sister-in-law lives with us while she's in school. She's almost 21, doesn't have a license or car so she gets rides from us, doesn't pay for the gas, doesn't pay us rent, doesn't pay for the food she eats. She has a job, but it's a job at the school she goes to and anything she earns goes towards her tuition. She has taken and used my makeup so much, without even asking, that I had to move it out of the bathroom into my room, and she uses my shower and face products.\n\n She has also rented movies from my Amazon account without asking, when she has access to all the streaming services my husband and I already pay for. I am on a fitness program and have certain healthy foods I buy for myself that are more expensive. She has been eating them, and has even taken them and put them in her mini fridge in her room for herself to eat. In spite of all this, her parents still throw a fit and claim her as their dependent come tax season. Her parents have also taken money from us and wrecked my car w/out paying for it, but that's another story. \n\nSo I purchased a locking shower caddy, put a pin on my Amazon account that has to be entered before purchasing, moved the rest of my toiletries to my room, and bought my own mini fridge with a lock where I will be keeping all of the foods that she regularly takes/eats from our fridge. If she gets hungry, that's her own problem. I know she gets a little money from the school to buy food from the store on campus. At her age I was renting an apartment, had a job, a car, and paid for all my own crap. I know that she doesn't have much money to buy her own stuff but she's basically a grownass woman that can't even drive, lives with us for free, doesn't have a regular paying job, and I don't believe she is entitled to my stuff just because she lives in my house and is broke. AITA for locking this stuff up to keep away from her?",

I contacted the company and they said to go to the airport anyway and talk to the gate agent. I talked to the airline and they said there are no flights out of the second airport that day. The company is telling me to take the flight anyway and try to make the connection with the risk of me being stranded. There is another flight out of my home airport that leaves at 5am and gets me there in certain time but this situation has caused a lot of inconvenience with me having to take time to go to the airport on my own dime coupled with the risk of being stranded in another city that I am contemplating just canceling or asking to reschedule.

      "description": "Me (32m) and my wife (31f) had our first child a couple weeks ago, a baby girl (we are thrilled). I know that Christmas is quite a ways off, but as I figured there would be some discussion about our plans, I brought up a few days ago that I would like our family to travel to mine for Xmas 2019. There wasn’t any serious fighting, but we argued back and forth a bit, deciding to table it for now.\n\nFor backstory, my wife and I currently live in Florida, my family is in New England, about a 2.5 hour flight away.  We live within 1 hour of all of my wife’s family that she keeps in touch with (including my in-laws 30 minutes away), meaning we spend the entire year doing birthday parties, Thanksgiving, Easter, etc. with them. I am totally cool with this, as all of us (myself included) have a great relationship with them. I miss my family a lot during these times, but we live here and I love her family so we always enjoy ourselves, no big deal.\n\nThus far, we have gone to New England for Christmas because she agreed that her family got everything else so it was only fair. We always made a point to have a nice little Christmas in early December with her family to make up for the fact that we wouldn’t be here. I think what bothers me about my wife’s reasoning this time is that she seems to want to stay this year out of fear of her mother’s reaction to not spending our daughter’s first Christmas with her. I am sensitive to this but just don’t feel we should stay only to appease her mother’s discomfort, as my wife puts this at the center of the discussion more than any feelings of hers that would keep us here. I considered that she might be using this to avoid talking about how she wants to stay for her own reasons, but we have a very honest relationship and discuss these things frankly so it’s very unlikely that’s the case.\n\nShe seems trapped between a rock and a hard place so I’m not pressing the issue, but barring something really important changing in her reasoning I can’t see changing my stance on this. Her family gets the other 99% of the year and I just don’t think it’s unreasonable to dig my heels in on this. ",

      "description": "There is a woman at my work who almost everyone likes but a few people can’t stand, including me. She is 50something hippie who is  deep into new age woo-woo. She lays compliments on thick to people whether she knows them or not and gives them gifts, which are often not cheap. Of course, a lot of people are all over that, but I don’t like it. It feels like she is doing it with an expectation that you owe her later in some way. So I have never accepted anything from her.  \n\nAwhile ago I got pneumonia and was pretty sick, and ended up needing a 2 week sick leave. One day I was checking my work email from home and she had emailed me saying she heard I was sick and she wanted to give me some “secret recipe love soup” (this is what she called it). I kindly said thanks but no thanks, because 1. I have a couple food allergies and don’t like to eat unfamiliar food (especially secret recipe food), and 2. I had zero appetite and felt like throwing up most times during a few of the days I was off. She could have accepted my refusal, but she replied saying oh her soup was vegan and she prayed over it to make it safe (wtf) and I could freeze it for when my stomach felt better. Again, I replied and said “again, thank you but no thanks. I really don’t want any, but appreciate the gesture.” She didn’t reply again, so I thought that was the end of it.  \n\nThe next day she showed up at my door with this huge tub of soup. This time I was less nice. I said, “Look, I told you “no,” twice. I feel like shit, and am going back to bed now.” I shut the door and saw the hurt shocked look on her face as I did so. Later that day she posted on her Facebook an motivational quote-type image that said something to the effect of “your feelings are not as accurate as my intuition”. I knew it was about me.  \n\nI’ve thought back on this incident a lot and I never feel bad for what I said. So, AITA?",

To my mind we were broken up and not getting back together, but I knew he still had hope for the relationship.\n\nA few weeks into our break and we hadn’t spoken since this conversation - on the phone or in person. I got really drunk at a friend’s party - blackout drunk, couldn’t remember a thing - and the next morning my friend asked if I could remember kissing a girl last night.\n\nI did not remember.\n\nThis was a different girl from before, and she regularly kisses male and female friends on nights out. \n\nI felt really bad about it.... but didn’t tell my ex.\n\nWe broke up officially two weeks after this, but again I didn’t mention the kiss.\n\nAm I the asshole?

      "description": "I'm getting tired of my own behavior btw, so why not let other people judge it. \n\nThis is gonna be very long and in depth i guess, just so you know. \nI wanted to find some reassuring words so I know what to focus on, so why not ask a couple strangers. \n\n\n\nAnyway, here goes nothing. \n\nI am too insecure to stand up for myself because i'm afraid how people will respond to my commentary and as a consequence of me saying what i think, it might backfire on me and they'll get mad or try to roast me, ect. \n\nThis is partially, because of my PDD-NOS, I won't be able to say anything back in return, because i process information a lot slower than other people. \nI am slow in the way that: I need to process what they said and when i finally finished doing that i have to come up with something to say. Which I am also very slow at because i have to reconstruct every word in a sentence so it will be gramatically correct and understandable. If I won't i might say things that sadly don't make any sense when put together. \n\nAt last:\nThere's this friend of mine who i don't really like, because she is two-faced (she said it herself, with pride). She's extremely judgemental of everyone around her, always complains about people around her AND because she always \nthinks she's important and therefore the center of attention. So fucking stupid I don't get it and I'm glad i don't because that could mean i would be just like her. Fucked in the head. She doesn't show this behavior every once in a while but almost every fucking day, fucking crazy how she van live like that. \n\nAnyway, let's get to the point.\nYesterday, I was at this party she invited me to. \nI went because I don't know how to say no (and I REALLY need to work on that ASAP). Needless to say, I however, did not regret it because it ended up being pretty nice and I am quite thankful she invited me. The party however, did not stop her from complaining about 2 people in her friend group (which i am a part of btw) and complaining about EVERYONE around her because they spoke a different language than her and were laughing about smth she ofc didn't understand.\n\nShe was saying things to me like 'I'm pretty sure they're laughing about smth pretty lame' and \n'I'm sure what they're laughing about isn't that funny'. I can't quite recall what i said in response, but it was certainly not what i was actually thinking (fun habit, ain't it? I never expected to be THIS insecure 🙃). \n\nImo her whole attitude and personality just revolve around this incurable amount of insecurity and the need to justify herself and every little thing she does. She also just loves comparing herself to me and ridiculing me. Saying she's way better than me and I'm not good enough at what I do (we study for the same occupation).\n\nP. S. If you wanted to know why I'm not talking to other people about it, i tried talking to my mother   about smth else my friend said. She replied with 'when are you gonna learn to stand up for yourself'. Which is true, so I'm not gonna bother other people with complaining anymore until i learned and my problems are valid. \n",

We used $12,000 of our money to move the home, set up, electrical, permits, etc. So, the only thing we got a loan for was $38,000.\n\nWe have lived there for about six years now and it was a starter home for us and we're ready to move.

I did some research on the land value and it was around $17,000.\n\nNow, my father in-law said he would like to buy the home, but for the price we paid for it, which again is $38,000. My mother in-law said she would do $50,000 to include the money we spent to get the house moved, etc, but my father in-law is against that.

      "description": "OK, so trying to explain this goofy situation in the least-jargony way possible: \n\nI'm currently rowing crew in college. It's a good bit of fun to get out on the river when the weather's nice, but I'm not incredibly into the whole competition part of it (meaning up to now I haven't much cared about being the best on the team or anything). The friend I joined up with is much more into the sport aspect of it; he trains super hard and has big regatta aspirations down the line. \n\nSo last week we had seat-races on the ergs to determine who we'd train with to get ready for the spring season. For the freshman the coveted spots are the four dudes who make 1st Boat (four guys with the fastest times). I wouldn't normally have been that invested but the cox (person who sits in stern and calls out the stroke) is a girl that I'm really sweet on. Making 1st boat would mean we'd be spending a lot of time together. Not at all unusual for a cox and a rower to couple up in the season.  \n\nSo during the seat race I'm next to my buddy on the ergs, and near the end of the race we're pretty close so I put the power on and edge him out. Now I'm rowing 1st Boat and he's not. He tries to be a good sport but he's appropriately pissed, mostly because he knows I don't care as much about it as he does. \n\nI won't lie; I feel like a real dickhead at the moment. Me and him aren't really on speaking terms currently (he's steaming), and I'm considering the fact that perhaps I've fucked up a friendship over something super petty. \n\nON THE OTHER HAND: I'm faster than he is. Arguably we've got a better team for it. Does the reason even matter? Am I an enormous asshole or is that just life?  ",

The trip to was fine so far but when we got their one of my annoying cousins (14) kept bother her. His father, my dad's brother, is basically a neglecting parent and you can tell the kids just wants attention. So she got nanoted by him and started shit-takjing him to our parents and even the family that we were staying with. Basically made the trip about her, again. We're in the airport and, as calmly as I could, I told her that I was disappointed that she acting so petty and that we had to run interference so that she didn't act worse to him face-to-face. I told her that the way things stand, I don't want to go on vacation (except family reunions and stuff) ever again. This isn't the first time we've talked about her behavpir and acting like the trip is all about her. I feel super guilty because now we're not sitting by each other and she's not talking to anyone.",

Now, I don't know the extent of the injuries, but it doesn't seem to be a big deal because he said in the post that he doesn't want the dog to go to a shelter and be euthanized just because he doesn't like kids very much. He said other than that the dog is super affectionate and playful. His son was 4. Now, in the comments this woman said the dog should be euthanized and I disagreed. I mentioned that someone without kids could take this dog and work with him. She kept saying that this is how accidents happen. (Meaning this is how children get mailed by dogs). I ended up stopping so I didn't get blocked from the group, but I believe that irresponsible owners and children cause accidents. NOT THAT IM SAYING THESE THINGS SHOULD HAPPEN. But basically I believe that this dog could be taken in and worked with, and could end up being a great dog. Am I the asshole here?? Does this puppy really not have a chance?",

      "description": "I’m almost 20 years old, and have been presented with the opportunity to move out of my moms house. I’d be moving in with my boyfriend and a few of our mutual friends, rent is $300 per person, including utilities (a steal around where I live.) One of the main reasons I want to move out is because since my parents split a couple years ago my mom has been treating me like a live-in babysitter for my younger brother. She has a fwb that she sees multiple times a week, where I only see my boyfriend once mayyyybe twice a week if I’m lucky. So I’ve informed my mom that I’ll be moving out soon and she was LIVID, solely for the fact that SHE won’t be getting $300 a month from me in rent. She said she can’t believe I would do something like this to her, and she cant afford to pay someone to watch my brother 3-4 nights a week. I told her that’s not my problem, but I will still give her $50 a month for my dogs food, and pay for when she needs to be groomed, because after all she is still my dog (I, unfortunately, can’t take her with me as pets aren’t allowed, unless it’s like a fish or something.) She demanded more money to “help pay other bills” and I told her that I was sorry but I have bills of my own to pay. She called me an ungrateful brat and is currently trying to prevent me from taking my stuff (which I bought) from the house, so I might have to call the cops to do a civil standby while i collect my things. \n\nSo AITA for refusing to pay my moms bills after I move out?

      "description": "Okay this one is complicated and long, since I feel like I need to be as detailed as possible. Throwaway account for obvious reasons, all names changed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I met a girl a year or so ago on Tinder. Let's call her Anne. Anne comes from a conservative christian family, and I am her first boyfriend. She's 18 and graduated but hasn't started college yet, and is living with her parents. I'm 19 and living in an apartment, sophomore year in college.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe start dating and everything seems great. We really hit it off. First time she comes over to our house, she's never kissed anyone before so I showed her what to do (she asked for me to guide her). We get more involved and I put my hand under her shirt, and she asks me to slow down a bit, so I immediately stop and we go back to only kissing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe continue to date and get more intimate with each-other. I always ask if she's willing to do something (kiss, take off her shirt, bra, pants, etc.) Sometimes she says yes, and sometimes she wouldn't respond as the thought about it for a while. To break the silence I would say \"please?\" and then she would agree, or say no, in which case I wouldn't ask again. Sometime we would progress from there, and she offered to give me a hand job, and I offered to finger her and she said yes without hesitation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue was, these lines shifted constantly. We would go from being hand-jobs and naked cuddling with  each other one night, to her not even wanting to kiss me the next. Her boundaries were constantly shifting, and I could never tell what was or wasn't okay. Sometimes Anne would ask to stop in the middle of an activity, and I would immediately comply, and not ask or try to convince her again in any way. The problems came up when she WOULDN'T tell me something wasn't okay in the moment. She would tell me the next day that the last night made her uncomfortable, or anxious, even though she had said yes at the time. Some nights she was totally fine with me touching her breasts, and other times she would tell me (after the fact) that it made her anxious. And then a few nights later it would be fine again, and SHE would be the one to instigate, undressing and giving me a handjob without me asking if she wanted to. I never knew what was and wasn't okay, and she wouldn't ever tell me. Anne and I had MULTIPLE conversations about how I was trying to be as respectful of her boundaries as possible, and that I wanted her to be happy and comfortable, but that she needed to tell me since I couldn't read her mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell anyways we broke up (never slept together thank god), and now she's been posting a lot of really awful things about me on twitter (not using my name, thankfully). She's claiming I was abusive and constantly did things that she didn't want me to. She specifically mentions how I would pin her down and watch her struggle (this was because she told me that being pinned down was a kink of hers, and liked being restrained). She's saying that I sexually assaulted her. Am I a sexual assault-er? I always felt that I was respectful and responsive to Anne's needs, especially considering her conservative upbringing and unfamiliarity with anything sexual or intimate. I just feel horrible and confused and really hurt by all this. AITA in this situation?",

      "description": "Ok. This is all going to sound quite stupid to some people, but I need to figure out if I'm an asshole or what. I don't think I am.... but I also may be wrong.\n\nI have the tendency of sometimes getting fed up with people, and almost wanting to drop them from my life. I had a friend once who when I was helping her with an art show, started treating me like her intern, even though I was helping her as a friend, not an employee. Because of this, I basically distanced myself enough to the point that I discarded the friendship. To be honest, there were a lot of other little things that she was doing that showed she wasn't a good friend to have, and was a dishonest person. So I know I'm not the asshole for that.\n\nBut now, I have another friend that I had started to consider close and whenever we speak the conversation is extremely self centered towards her. She went away to Italy several weeks ago, and she was constantly sending me selfies asking if she looked good, and telling me about all of the attention that she was receiving from men. I LOVE when people love themselves, but it got to a point where she was bragging and I started feeling annoyed. There was a point when she hung up on me without saying bye, just to upload something onto her Instagram story. When she was in Italy, she was constantly leaving her travel partner to seek attention from other men. Thing is, she's not a bad person, and she's gone through a lot this year, so I get why the conversation seems to be geared towards her life -- but when she asks \"how are you?\" and I begin talking about my day, etc, she gears it back towards her. She can spend an hour rambling about her, and her coworkers, her coworker's siblings, TBH SHIT I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT. This may not be on purpose, but it's frustrating. It may be because her group of friends since childhood praise each other, and maybe she wants the same from me but I don't really operate that way. I've decided to kind of distance myself the last couple days because I really didn't have mental space for her.\n\nAm I the asshole because I tend to want to just distance people from my life without really giving them a shot to make things okay or even let them know why they're bothering me?\n\nAm I overthinking!?!?!? I don't know!! I feel like I sound like a dumbass. Please let me know. Thank you.",

      "description": "So basically last year on my mom's birthday I spent all the time I could with her. It was a school night but still from the time I got out of school to 10pm I spent with her. Even though I had a lot of homework to do and 3 tests the next day I still prioritized my mom.\n\nWe went to the mall first where we spent some time shopping then after we went to grab dinner. We ate a very nice dinner at this Japanese place then continued to walk around downtown. \n\nAfter arriving home at 10pm I told my mom that now I had to do my homework because at this point I would be up until 4am. Keep in mind, my mom is extremely strict about grades. She often will yell at me for having a b+ so naturally she has high expectations for me. I had 3 tests to study for and at least 3 hours of homework so I needed to start right away.\n\nWhen I told my mom that I had to do homework she asked me instead to play a guitar song and sing for her. I am extremely insecure about my voice and guitar playing. Ever since I was little I was always teased for it so I haven't played a song and sang for someone in over a year. On top of that, I had a lot of work to do so I declined. She begged over and over and I told her that I didn't feel comfortable with it. Finally she played the \"why don't you love me\" card and I snapped.\n\nI told her that I did love her and it was extremely selfish to say things like that to try to manipulate me into doing things I didn't want to. I had done everything she asked up until this point for her birthday but just one thing I declined to do.\n\nShe started screaming at me about how I was so mean to her and how I was really the selfish one. She told me that she never felt loved by me still trying to manipulate me. \n\nThen she started screaming that it was her birthday and how I should just play a song for her. By the way, my mom was off on business trips my past 3 birthdays so I couldn't believe she was the one yelling at me about not feeling loved.\n\nThe whole night ended in both of us resorting to our rooms and not talking to eachother for the rest of the night.\n\nOn one hand I feel really shitty but on the other hand I feel like she was trying to manipulate me into doing something I was insecure about. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

(i was only leaving originally because once i was no longer a full time student i would have to pay a lot of council tax) \n\nthis all happened about 3 weeks ago and my friend was kept up to date throughout. he mentioned that he didn’t really know what he was going to do but never asked for help or started looking for a new place. \n\ntonight we were talking on the phone and the house got bought up and he said that he was stressed about it and basically felt that i had screwed him over. after the phone call we were texting and he got mad at me for ‘leaving him high and dry’ despite me telling him that i would be staying in the house 3 weeks ago. (context: usually students find houses in january to move in around august/september but houses are still advertised for students all year round. ie. it’s not hard to find a place)\ni replied to him saying that i was sorry that it was a shit situation but at the end of the day it’s not my responsibility to find him a place to stay. he then kicked off and started saying that as soon as he asks me  for help i don’t give a fuck about him despite him supporting me all the time (he does give me a lot of support but i also support him and have done for a few years) \n\ni’m having a bad mental health day so said i’d talk to him about it tomorrow as it was all getting very intense to which he basically said not to bother and that our whole friendship felt completely one sided and that i was using him for support but as soon as he was struggling i turned my back. \n\n\ni just don’t understand what his problem is and why all of this is suddenly my fault and i’m a terrible friend. i’m not going to move out of my house that i love so that he can move in. \n\ni feel like i’ve done a terrible job at explaining all this, a lot has happened really quickly. it’s all gone from 0-100 within the last hour and he’s gone from being one of my closest friends to suddenly wanting nothing to do with me. \n\ntldr: i was meant to graduate in a few months and move out of my student house but circumstances changed and now i am staying. my friend was meant to be taking over occupancy but is now really mad at me for ‘screwing him over’ and has turned the whole thing into an attack at me and is saying our friendship is essentially over.

I honestly think I may have a problem. Being around children makes me incredibly anxious, I get depressed and teary eyed. It fucks me up.\nAside from that, they're just gross. I cannot eat around them. It just makes me gag. I can't help it. I cant touch them (am I the only one who thinks they're all weirdly hot all the time?? Like feverish?) They just make me lose my mind. It's awful. Recently I found out an older cousin who I used to be close to (up until she had kids and everything changed) told her kids I didnt like them. I love them, they're my family, but I cant hang out with them. I'm nice and smile at them and try to chit chat but it's so awkward that they leave first.\nSo AITA for disliking kids to the point of feeling somewhat nauseous around them and avoiding them at all costs?

So we all have these inside jokes with each other - we joke about person B for not having a dad because he's black, but the thing is he does have a dad and he isn't some abusive alcoholic dad, in fact person B has a very functional family. We joke about person A's relationship between this girl because this girl is really weird to person A (like she would slap his ass and just casually put her legs on person A, even though he isn't comfortable with it), and I don't really know if he takes it personally but it doesn't really look like it because he just agrees with us and says that girl is weird. Now the inside joke on me is that the only sport I play is piano. I know this isn't true and I do play some sports, but this hits really close to me because growing up I was always thought of as the nerd who only studied and played video games, but for the past year I've really tried to improve my physical side. I joined this weekly run club, started doing a bodyweight workout regime (pushups, dips, pullups) and really grinded in basketball (which I'm still not even good at), but the thing is, I tried really hard and I'm still insecure about my physical side. Everytime they joke about me playing piano as a sport it hits a certain part of me and I just get really angry at them and sad at the same time. AITA for taking this joke so seriously?",

He told me he was going to try something else and he'd let me know. That was yesterday. \n\nThen today, he messaged me again and said that he wanted his money back. I read his message and decided to just ghost him because I know that they were working when I gave them to him - if you don't know already, PC components can be damaged by static electricity, so I always handle my components with care and static proof bags. \n\nI think he probably set them on a carpet/rug or something, maybe even dropped it, but if he didn't even realize he damaged it, what am I supposed to do?

      "description": "It’s a long one, TL;DR at bottom. \n\nHey everyone! So my mom has always been the type to use people for stuff that she needs. So she has always been horrible with money and needs to be bailed out. She’s been bailed out by my grandfather on her and my dad’s side of the family, and is always living paycheck to paycheck. Fortunately for myself I’ve been able to get a job that allows me to live comfortably and not worry about money as much. \n\nSo she works in an industry that she has to use her own car, and she ended up getting into an accident and needing a car. I had just purchased a new vehicle and told her she could buy my old one for dirt cheap aka $500. So I let her take the vehicle because she needs one for work. A couple months go by and I’m not trying to be pushy about getting the money, but I subtly remind her that she still owes me money for it. In the mean time she’s putting a lot of mileage on the vehicle and essentially running it into the ground. Then the reverse gear in it goes out, and she tells me I can have it back!\n\nNow I’m kind of frustrated, because I could’ve easily sold it for quite a bit more than the $500. I ask if she’s going to pay to fix the reverse gear, or just pay me for the Jeep and she says no. So I ask why she’s not going to and she tells me that she didn’t feel comfortable in it and that she doesn’t want it anymore essentially. At this point I told her that when she does stuff like this it feels like she’s just using me for me for my car, and that just because we’re family doesn’t mean she just gets my old car. She then tells me that she’s sorry for not meeting my standards for mother, and that I won’t have to deal with her since my girlfriend and I are looking at moving to another state. This is when I tell her she sounds childish and needs to grow up and get her life together. So AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Mom says she’ll buy my old car that I could’ve easily sold for more than I was selling it to her for. Runs it into ground, acts childish, and I tell her to grow up. \n",

I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?",

      "description": "In November I got my dream job in my dream city. My husband and I have been trying to get back to New England for a year now, with no luck. He was more actively searching because of higher income, but no offers came through until mine. \n\nI moved in December, and he started applying for jobs like crazy and got one in January. Slight pay cut, but we’ll be happier in our new city and near family and friends. \n\nI packed a lot before I left, and flew back 3 weeks ago to pack and organize more - house was a mess, he hadn’t cleaned since I left. I cleaned everything and packed even more. \n\nI wasn’t able to come back closer to moving day because of my work schedule... right now on my 14th consecutive day working, and have big events through all of March. \n\nI’ve done everything I can remotely, scheduling a cleaner and listing a ton of furniture on Facebook Marketplace (and dealing with the barrage of messages). \n\nIt’s his last night and he’s been having panic attacks, hurt his shoulder, and is generally pretty pissed at me. He said he’s been spending 5-6 hours every night for two weeks getting things ready and the most stressed he’s ever been. I’ve been trying to be extremely sympathetic/supportive/grateful, and offered to do all of the unloading/unpacking once he’s here. He’s quite traumatized from this experience and I can’t help but feel very selfish. \n\nOne big thing is that he packed a moving pod 2 weeks ago that should have had everything, and he missed a lot - so now we have to donate a lot more than we had planned on. I tend to be the pragmatic one in the relationship who can stay organized/sane during a move. \n\nNote: we are also selling the house, so he’s getting it ready for sale and dealing with contractors too\n\nTL;DR moved before husband due to job, he’s packing everything up himself and miserable. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "(35M) With some issues due to my past. I suffer from a condition that has wrecked my life multiple times after building it up repeatedly. Basically my health goes south and I lose the license, the job, the girl, then become depressed. The last cycle ended about 4 years ago.\n\n2 years ago I started a relationship with (27F) that I met earlier in that year while studying to increase my chance of employment. She approached me; I wasn't ready for a relationship but she had the same condition (not as severe) and needed to fix things too so I told her we'd do it together.\n\nWhen we met she thought she might be asexual but had a lot of trauma. She did increase the frequency, but we still disagree on it. There tends to be a week with 3x and then not as much the rest of each month (she tracks it, but I think it's less than it says). I'd like it to be 2-3 each week and think it's just a matter of effort; if she loved me it'd come naturally. \n\nShe also has issues with anxiety and depression. I've been depressed too and I think she just needs to get outside and do things more often to get better, but she says she's comfortable at the computer, knitting (what 20 year old knits?) or drawing/colouring in (which is childish and needs to stop). \n\nIn the last 10 months she went through a lot of therapy, got a job in the field we studied and was promoted at the end of her probation. She moved far away to do that (which I encouraged) and she's been asking me to move with her, but I don't want to lose my financial independence by moving before I have a job. I also don't want to limit myself to looking for work near her because there's not as much there, so I'm looking around back home.\n\nThe other thing is that she's ticked off all these goals (she's got the job, the house, the car) but she's not exactly happy. If I have to live with her moods wings or misery that would just drag me down and I can't have that because my life is about to improve so much. \n\nA few days ago she was trying to ask me when I'd be willing to move in (yet again) and I wouldn't commit to a date so she said she was done even though I tried explaining why I couldn't commit yet and that I do love her. The next day she asked for keys back/where to send my things and I asked her what was going on. She called me and I told her I thought we needed a cooling off period in case we changed our minds. I told her she has to be happier if she wants me to move in and she asked how she's supposed to demonstrate that. I suggested smiling more and sending me photos and texts of her doing happy things.  \n\nHonestly though, I'm not sure if this relationship is a good idea. I don't know if I  fear being stuck with her or losing her more. She's been crying that I've been killing her and need to make a decision, but I think shes overreacting to the situation and doesn't seem that worried about losing me or she'd have put in more effort. \n\nAITA for telling her \"I love you and I want a future with you\" just fix [problem] first when I'm not sure if I do want to be with her (at least until I know she's changed) or is it her responsibility to draw a line if I really am hurting her that badly? Just want some more opinions... ",

      "description": "This is my first post on reddit on mobile so mind the mistakes. Here’s the story. \nSo sometime last year I had this girlfriend that I didn’t like but for some reason I somehow gave my friends the idea that I liked her, so my friends and hers proceeded to brainwash me into thinking I liked her in while in reality I didn’t. Fast forward about a month later the school dance came up and of course I was pressured into going, the dance was awkward because this was a middle school dance everyone was hitting the quan i decided to leave a little, oh how was that a bad idea. Following is the text convo I can remember \nEx gf: hey where are you\nMe: I left early it was getting weird \nMe: can I tell you something \nEx gf: yeah\nMe: we have to breakup friend 1, and friend 2 were pressuring me to go out with you and I just couldn’t handle them\nTo my surprise it’s wasn’t even ex gf I was talking to it was her friend (she will be ex gf f)\nEx gf f then blows up my phone with phone calls telling me I’m a terrible person you should die in a hole and all that Jazz.\nThe next day at school I have art class with her as you would expect she told everyone in the class, the girl in front of me kicks my shin extremely hard and the class is over. Turns out her reign of terror isn’t over every day for the next year she tells me to die in a hole, granted it’s not the most threatening thing to say but it almost drove me insane with how many times I was told to die in a hole. And sometimes to this day I’m reminded of this \n\n\nSummary: broke up with ex gf because I felt pressured into dating, her gets kicked in my shin and gets told to go die in a hole",

      "description": "My kids are 8 and 5 and at a really great age for going places and enjoying family experiences. We love our zoo/museum/science center pass, last year we took some weekend trips to places like Oklahoma City's science museum, St. Louis for their city museum, KC for great wolf lodge.\n\nWe've talked about going to Disney World, they hear it's the best thing in the universe and there's no comparison. We live in the smack-dab middle of the country so it'd mean a flight. Then the hotels are expensive, the park passes are expensive, I hear the lines are horrible and the food is crazy, and the cost is absolutely blowing me away. We have had so much fun touring the midwest for well under $1000 a trip and that's when we seriously splurge! The idea of saving up $5-10K for a disney vacation means we'd have to go without a lot this year. No spring break trip or weekend getaways, hell we'd be going without clothes and restaurants, there is just not a ton of room in our budget.\n\nI'm starting to drop hints that there are other better things to do with money and we should never ever go. Just trying to talk them all out of it. There are better places, more responsible ways to spend money, there's starving kids in X, whatever excuse you want.\n\nI got to go as a kid. It was fun but not life-changing. My partner's family didn't have money to go anywhere, so he's never been in his life. He'd like us to make it happen, but he's not the budget organizer in our family.\n\nDid you go, was it your most amazing growing up experience? Is there anything else you'd have had your parents do with $10,000?  What was your favorite trip with your parents? Or if you are a parent, been your favorite trip as a family?\n\nWill I Be The Asshole for shutting the door on this idea?",

      "description": "Sry for my poor Grammar im on mobile + English is not my first language.\n\nSo today me and 2 friends decided to go visit the mall after school, after visiting Snipes (Shoes etc, idk if its only a German shop?) we decided to get some drinks and snacks I bought myself a Red Bull and a pack of Pringles and my friend bought himself a Monster. \n\nGoing to our train station, my second friend already left cuz he needs to catch another train, we see a begger.\n\n Maybe you dont know it but we in Germany got a big refugee problems bcs our goverment decided to 'open the Gates' so everybody can get it. Which was a very dumb idea looking back bcs how do they want to teach 1 million ppl German + showing them how our cultur works? The Result is that we got a ton of Refugees with no residence permit which leads to a ton of beggers. \n\nUsually they only sit there with pictures of there Families or a paper asking for food/water/money. I dont really mind them and i dont really care. But this Begger we met was another lvl. She came up to ppl Holding her Jar right in there Face asking for money. Zero fucks given if there are talking with somebody or are on there phone. So this begger came to me and my friend and asked for money i said no because 1. i only got 3€ left 2. I saw this women last week spending here money on cigarettes and im not gonna support that. My Friend also declined it and i thought she is gonna leave us and go annoy somebody else. NO She then tells me to give her my Red Bull + My Chips, she doesnt ASK me to give her my Food she TELLS me to give her them (\"Give me that\"[Pointing at my Red Bull]) Then she pulls my Friend and tells him to give her his Monster( He was on his Phone and was pointing with his back to her). I tell her to leave us alone but she still demends our food. Our train arrived so we just leave her and get into our Train.\n\nIm gonna be real with yall i hate beggers in general. In Germany nobody needs to starve or sleep outside because we got a ton of Social Houses and for Refugees our Goverment built a ton of Containers + they get 3 meals a day (All paid by Taxes the ppl who actually work need to pay) The only reason they live on the street is 1. They are to lazy to search for a job (That a must do if you wanna have the Goverments support) 2. They work for Criminal Gangs which send out Beggers to collect Money\n3. They are gonna spend that money they get on Alkohol Cigarettes or Drugs. \nSo im not gonna give a begger money in General. Telling one of my Friends about that Situation she tells me that i shouldnt have said \"No\" to her and gave her my Money and my Food (I asked her if she was trolling, she was not) Because this poor old Women needs it. So Reddit Am i the Asshole?\n",

But last night, I was super tired, worked a 9 hour shift and coached soccer for 2 hours, and I’m laying in bed trying to sleep. He starts watching videos on his phone, saying random things loudly at his phone, burping insanely loud, scratching his entire body like a fucking dog, shaking the bed, etc. I told him to please turn his phone off and let me sleep, and he was very sorry and turned it off. But literally all fucking night I kept waking up to the bed shaking and him scratching, burping and coughing ridiculously loud. He kept trying to cuddle me and every time he’d basically push me awake from cuddling too hard and I’d push him off. Around 5am I told him if he woke me up one more time I’d murder him. In the morning I kissed him and told him that I can’t do that again, my schedule is crazy and I need sleep but I still love him! He almost started crying, I feel bad but fuck man. I’m tired???? ",

      "description": "My girlfriend and I met when we were teens. 11 years later, I love her more with each day. She's the cutest, most awesome ball of sunshine and I make sure she knows it.\n\n\nI've always been interested in different states of consciousness, and I feel my experiments have been a net positive in my life. I tried weed as a teen and delighted in the mad horizons it illuminated. Though now I'm only interested in psychedelics.\n\n\n\nMy girlfriend hates drugs. She doesn't share my interest in altering consciousness and that's fine, she's a focussed, well put together person and I admire her for that. When we met I was taking a break from weed, so the issue never came up. However the next time I smoked, all hell broke loose. She ignored me for the day. She said she finds people who do drugs unattractive. I responded 'Not everything I do has to make me more attractive to you.' She said she's worried I'd become addicted. I got nowhere.\n\n\n\nAt this point I should've had the courage of my conviction - but I didn't. Instead I continued to experiment without telling her. Occasionally I'd raise the issue, but it would only cause arguments in an otherwise perfect relationship, so I kept it to myself.\n\n\n\nWe continued with no problems, and I'd occasionally scratch my itch in my own time. This worked until, inevitably, she found out. It crushed her. She described it as though our relationship were a tree we were growing, and I had cracked it right down the middle. I know I'm the asshole for lying. I decided to come clean about everything, and promised to be honest from now on.\n\n\n\nSo fast forward to 2017 - we worked out a lot of our issues and she even tried weed with me - not her thing but I respect her for trying. At this point though, I had still not tried any kind of psychedelic, and I expressed my desire to do so.\n\n\n\n'All of this reminds me of when you were doing drugs behind my back,' 'Why do you need to do this?' Nothing I told her changed her mind. She was adamant I stay away.\n\n\n\nBut I had to do this. Personally I would die unfulfilled without journeying into those realms. I told her I planned to do mushrooms. She didn't say much, and in the following weeks whenever I raised the topic she would shut down.\n\n\n\nThe time came and it was every bit as electric as I'd hoped. We found a beautiful park with a lake. I sat on the edge of the water, watching the golden expanse throb beneath me, the clouds twisting in geometric patterns, breathing every colour of the rainbow as the universe moved through me. Afterwards I felt like I had a new lease on life.\n\n\n\nI rang her and she started crying uncontrollably. When I came home she flipped out and I ended up on my knees begging her to see things my way.\n\n\n\nOver a year later, I feel ready to jump back in to explore again. I plan on doing LSD, and I'm working up the courage to tell her. \n\n\nI am at your mercy Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "Warning for petty teen drama. \n\nI have a small group of very close friends that I’ve known for years. We’re all the same age (18-19) and we’ve been through a lot together. It’s a really tight-knit group, but we’ve recently got a new addition, D. \n\nI met D during Freshers Week at uni a few months ago. A group of people from my course hung out during this week but separated when classes started, leaving me with one of my best friends who had started the course with me (F) and D.\n\nD wasn’t an unwelcome addition. She was really nerdy and seemed quite sweet so although my bones were telling me that something was seriously off with her vibes, I just ignored it. I tried to introduce her to my bigger friendship group and actually set her up with one of my best friends who is a sweetheart and very much asexual (we’ll call him M). \n\nEventually, though, the cracks began to show. She picked up my verbal ticks very quickly and even adopted them into her text style. If F or I came into uni wearing something cool she’d save something similar to her personal aesthetic board. She was super pretentious, derailing conversation to make a comparison to some ~obscure artist~ none of us had ever heard of. If I started a drinking game where I took a shot every time she mentioned something pretentiously artsy, I’d be dead in the ground. She would constantly boast about how she had been writing a fantasy novel for seven years. She’s a faux feminist who’s an “activist” in name only. She tries to appear to hold strong political opinions but doesn’t attend rallies or attempt to enact any real change in a place that has a ridiculously DIRE political climate (see: hasn’t had a government for over two years). \n\nMy friends were welcoming but all of them (except M) complained about her behaviour. The biggest red flag is her Pinterest boards. \n\nFor context, a few years ago, some of my friends and I each set up Pinterest boards to save #aesthetic things that remind us of each other. A few weeks ago D set up Pinterest boards for us, even after we had clearly said that Pinterest boards were something that only came about after many years of friendship and that we’d have to know her for longer before making one for her. One of the biggest red flags is how she treats sexuality. F is a lesbian and D’s Pinterest board for her is FILLED with really inappropriate nsfw lesbian images. However, F isn’t open about her sexuality and hasn’t actually come out to D. D’s just guessed that she’s gay. This isn’t even consistent behaviour because I’m openly bisexual and there’s nothing inappropriate on D’s board for me. Her Pinterest board for M is full of quite predatory things with a lot of 2013 tumblr textposts about how “asexuals can still have sex”. M is really open about his boundaries, and it’s well known that handholding is the most he feels comfortable with. Even kissing is a lot for him.\n\nIf I come to uni wearing something cool, D will go home and add similar items to her personal Pinterest board, so obviously she’s probably just trying to fit in. She’s thrown minor strops about “not feeling like a true member of the group and only being an addition”. I don’t want to be an asshole, and it’s quite obvious that she doesn’t have much experience with friendship. On the other hand though, I can’t keep going through life making people my personal projects. I feel like I’m going insane. AITA by wanting the friendship to die?",

      "description": "TLDR: I’m graduating with my MA next month and I do not want my 4 family members staying in my one bedroom, one bathroom apartment for the weekend. \n\nI’ve been telling my mom since last summer to get a hotel and now there aren’t any rooms left in the small town my school is located. It’s a 6 hr drive from my home, but my fam will be taking a 45min flight. They rented a car.\n\nI suggested they stay in a moderately sized city about 25 mins away. The hotel location is downtown and fairly priced. I spoke to several of my friends about this and they said I was being pretty reasonable. I suggested my mom do the same; she said her friends also say I am ungrateful and selfish.\n\nThis is why I think it’s torture. I told my mom that if she insists on staying in my apartment, I will rent a place while they’re here. Maybe I’m a bad person, but my family stresses me out. She said that if I’m not here then what is even the point of their trip?\n\nMy mom keeps saying that I just don’t want her to visit and she calls me selfish bc I don’t want her in my apartment. This is frustrating and straight up a lie bc she has stayed in my apartment many times. It is not a money issue; I know for a fact my family can afford a hotel without it hurting our pockets.\n\nAlso, I think it is torture bc me and my mother do not have the best relationship. I am bisexual, she is v homophobic. She’s calmed down since outing me about 3 years ago, but she has a long way to go.\n\nI don’t think I’m being selfish and a part of me feels like she didn’t even run this by another grown person to hear how wild she sounds. As of now she has plans of staying here with everyone and I’m stressed!  I can’t imagine 5 ppl calmly staying here.\n\nI grew up with a big family (3 siblings in a 4bdrm/1bth house) so I’m used to cramped quarters, but I feel like this is too much. I just want to be relaxed before my graduation. \n\nI feel like my family (specifically my mom) is not very considerate when they come here and I know I won’t be well rested. For example, she likes to have the TV on and lights when she goes to bed. Plus, she goes to bed late and will talk on the phone as long as she’s up. The little one wakes up early and due to the nature of children, she’s not very quiet. Usually I don’t have a problem with this, but it does give me horrible sleep. \n\nOn top of that, I know getting ready before my graduation will be a nightmare because I only have one bathroom and two mirrors in my home. I’m really good at doing makeup but it takes me about 1-1.5hrs. I know they’re going to rush me and I will feel ugly on my graduation day. And, they have a habit of running late for everything, so I anticipate being tired, ugly, and late for a very big day in my life. I am also scared that she will want to argue with me bc it feels like she argues with me over literally everything. \n\nAITA for not wanting my family to stay in my apartment?

She’s a changed person from who she was. Over time most people forgave her because she was a genuinely nice person just going through a rough time.  One friend (the one we’re talking about) cut all contact from basically right after she was exposed on the lie. 2 years later she starts saying how she doesn’t care about the situation at all anymore.\n\nNow on the the story: (P i’ll call the friend who lied and M will be the one friend who still isn’t on good terms with P)  M and i were talking about a little party for our other friend that we were invited to. I told her that P was invited. M got all pissed about her being invited to the party and started ranting. I bud in and say “aren’t you over that”. M still pissed said how she had to deal with P for 3 years (actually 1 year) and how P faked a suicide. lunch was over and M and i walked to class she kept saying how insensitive i was to say get over it knowing damn well she said she was over it not too long ago.

And allll this time my mum was rushing me, telling me to *hurry up* telling me she wants to go outside with the baby and im trying to get her to chill the fk out and hand me my baby because we do NOT need to go outside of the store and the baby will be fine if I just hold her for a darn sec and give her a bottle... yadda yadda basically corralling an unruly grandma :) not a big deal for me but deefinitely kept me busy and if I were to start texting my husband instead of keeping 1000 things under control, the baby would start crying and thats bad for both the baby and also for the customers to hear a screaming gremlin, (even if its a cute gremlin)\n\n\nBasically, my husband called me 3 and a half hours later VERY ANGRY that I wasnt responding to his texts. Personally I think that the reason why I wasnt responding isnt relevant if I was just [tryly busy] and also [only a few hours]. People are often busy and cannot update.\n\nAs soon as he called me on the phone I did pick up right away. He angrily went off on me for why wasnt I updating him. I told him that people are sometimes busy for a few hours and cant text and that this should be respected and understood but that did nothing to ease his anger. I would have updated him as soon as my hands were  free maybe 30 more mins into the future. His reasoning included:\n\n- that me and my mother are two adults. we could have definitely set aside a few moments for giving a heads up\n- he wasnt aware how long we'd be out in the city for\n- he was worried about his child\n\nam I the asshole here?",

One of our mutual friends needs a place to stay for anywhere from a fortnight to a month or longer. No problem. I went to set up our third bedroom which is the smallest but I've lived in it comfortably for a year before.\n\n  My partner stopped me and said the guest would be using my room. The guest had previously agreed they didn't care where as long as they had somewhere to sleep. I said I wasn't entirely comfortable with this arrangement because, other than sleeping and working, I spend all my time in that room. Partner insists on his way because it's \"only for a few weeks\".\n\n  Later that night he offers the guest the use of my bed as well. I point out I'm happy with him offering my stuff without consulting me. Partners replies that I'm just weird about people visiting anyway and he lets my family stay over all the time. He has a point, I don't like people I don't know staying in the house referring to an instance from a year ago. However I know the guest and am actually the one who offered. I just didn't offer my room.\n\n   I just feel this is unfair to expect me to pay half the rent while giving away my room to the guest. I can't move into the smaller room because we keep our cockatiels there. I had planned to move them into my room for the month or so. After all the fighting I can't stand to be trapped in the same room as him all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Partner gives my room to a guest for a month or more.

I have trouble judging what's socially acceptable sometimes, so if you decide to comment, please explain things so that even a robot could understand.\n\nSo there I was in my early 20s, a young woman with very few friends, only one of which lived near me. Let's call her Karen. Karen wasn't a close friend of mine. I always saw her getting into some kind of drama with one of her 100 \"besties\". Against my better judgement, I hung out with her. Through her, I got to know a dude she'd been friends with since kindergarten. At the time he was in a relationship with one of Karen's close friends.\n\nDude and I became friends. I found him attractive but obviously didn't wanna mess up anyone's relationship, so I was really careful to not overstep my boundaries and kept things strictly platonic.\n\nA couple of months later though, dude's girlfriend breaks up with him and tells him she simply doesn't love him anymore. Meanwhile, dude and I have become pretty close friends. So when he tells me what happened I did what every good friend does. I listened to him when he needed someone to talk to, tried to cheer him up, and invited him out to get away from their shared apartment to get his mind off things.\n\nWe quickly realized that we had feelings for one another. Things moved fast; too fast. He hadn't had time to get over his ex and I was an inexperienced fool. We had only been a thing for about two or three weeks and he broke up with me. Of course he needed space. I was devastated.\n\nThen I got a text from Karen. She was livid. How could I have dated one of her friends and not tell her?! So soon after the two of her friends had broken up, no less! She was disappointed in me, she thought we were friends. She was entitled to know about it.\n\nAll I could manage to say was that I didn't mean to keep it a secret but that things had been moving so quickly. I had been afraid that I might have just been a rebound and wanted to give the relationship some time before telling everyone, instead of telling people we're official to then go around a few days later being like \"oh lol, nevermind\". Besides, she definitely was not entitled to know every single personal thing that was going on in my life. I also told her I didn't appreciate her berating me like that, so soon after having been broken up with. I was not in a state of mind to deal with even more emotional stress.\n\nWe weren't friends anymore after that. She tried to contact me again after dude and I started seeing each other again, but I figured she just wanted to get all the info to start even more drama.\n\nPeople seem to take issue when their friends see each other. Did Karen have a point? Should I have told her, despite my insecurities about the relationship? Was she entitled to know two of her friends were dating?

      "description": "\nTLDR; my friend tells me that my ex boyfriend so I had broken up with two days before grabbed her ass two years ago, gets mad when I say I’m not ready to talk about that and turns my other friend on me for saying that\n\nSo a year ago I was going through a REALLY rough breakup when I found out my boyfriend of a year was sleeping with a married woman (a whole-nother story)\n\nBut anyways, a friend who went to school in a different city was in town for spring break and we and another friend decided to go to dinner, and I pretty much asked that we not talk about the breakup because I wanted one night away from it all\n\nWhen I asked my friend who was visiting, their answer was pretty much “no, because I need do tell you something about your now-ex”\n\nI was upset that they wanted to talk about him but we as a group used to be really close before my ex moved away for the military, and I knew that she had talked to him a bit after the breakup to kind of call him out of being an ass, so I thought it was about that\n\nSo we finish dinner and our other friend goes home and the two of us are in the parking lot, and I knew they wanted to talk about it and I was already choking back tears tbh\n\nAnd they told me that, about a year before we had started dating, my ex had grabbed my friends ass at lunch our senior year one day without consent\n\nHe had done the same thing to me when we were friends but we’re on the edge of “more than friends”, which was where they were st the time he groped her\n\nSo, my immediate reaction was “that’s just how he tests boundaries”\n\nI realized as soon as I said it that that was kind of an asshole thing to say, and tried to rationalize how he did it to me, and I just started bawling because I was so hurt by his break of trust and all, and kind of ended up in a blubbering rant about how hurt I was by how he treated me, and it didn’t surprise me what he did to her, and how I hope he burns in hell\n\nSo the night ends and I go home and almost immediately I get a text from a friend who wasn’t there ranting how he couldn’t be friends with someone who “condones that kind of thing”\n\nOf course I’m super confused and text my friend I had been talking to asking what was up and they just say “give him time”\n\nI literally had a panic attack because I realized he blocked me after sending that, and I couldn’t tell my side\n\nSo  I send the friend I had talked to a text saying I was sorry if I gave the impression I didn’t care about them because I did, and I just wasn’t ready to hear that but I was there for them (even though I felt they should have been there for me first)\n\nShe in turn sends a text about how she’s “angry, hurt, and couldn’t believe that someone who was my friend could say that”, even though I have no idea if they’re referring to the first statement I said or anything after it\n\nI haven’t talked to her since and don’t ever want to talk again, I know I could have said it better but am I in the wrong here?\n\nAITA?",

Anyway, a dude from my class found out when it was a few weeks prior and kept saying he was gonna get me something, like every time he spoke to me. I told him several times not to get me anything. \n\nHe hypes up the gift a lot before the day. (He's a bit of a hypebeast too, likes to flex.)\n\nDay comes. He comes up to me with a jacket wadded up in his hand and he tosses it to me and says happy birthday and all that. He proceeds to tell me that it's his old jacket and then immediately tells me it's worth £120.\n\nI try it on later in the day and it stinks and has dirt all over it, I say to my close friends that it's a bit weird that he's done this. It's like saying that you're gonna give someone a Ferrari and then give em a battered Nissan Micra.\n\nJacket dude finds out I said that and he's pissed at me. I try to explain why it's strange but he has none of it.\n\nJust to note : idgaf how much the jacket is or anything but it just seems like he dragged it from the bottom of his closet and thought (eh, that'll do). I got a box of chocolates from a friend's mum and I truly appreciated that so much more.\n\nSo anyway, am I the asshole here?",

She's supposed to be in at 8 and hasn't been in on time in...well I don't know how long. She works for a giant corporation and doesn't like to get up early. I told her I refuse to encourage being \"only slightly less late\" because we heavily depend on her job and her getting shitcanned isn't going to help us regardless if I was happy for her or not. It's not depression or something keeping her in bed, she just wants to sleep longer. She made the choice to work mornings instead of evenings (she used to work 1-9) and I think it's incredibly asinine to get mad at me for wanting her to actually be on time for her job rather than celebrate her being in her seat 7 mins late rather than 10 15 or 20. Because I didn't \"encourage her\" and only gave her \"negativity\" (which I view as just straight up realism, but whatever), she said she doesn't want to continue the conversation and she's crying at work. I view this whole situation as f'ing ridiculous, AITA?",

I found out the other day that one of my friends was inviting a graduate friend of his, who despite being in the friend group, I didn't like at all.\n\nWhy didn't I like him? He's very anti-gay (I'm using that phrase in particular because I believe his rhetoric surpasses typical run-of-the-mill homophobia) and I am gay (which only a handful of people in the group know). \n\nSo anyhow, I decided tonight to call off going with them (and to be honest, canceling last minute was kind of a dick move on my part) and one of my best friends in the group called a few hours later, very drunk, and was genuinely upset that I hadn't gone with them (keep in mind this is the same friend that invited the graduate who I dislike)\n\nSo, was I the asshole here? I feel really bad that I made my friend upset, but at the same time I know I wouldn't have had a good time if I had gone with them. Bonus if you can think of a way to explain all this to my friend.

      "description": "Bit of a clickbaity title but I'm not sure what else to call it.\n\n\nMy girlfriend and I have had issues with her family for some time, usually due to my frustration at how she would bend to their will without a second thought.  At the start of the relationship  (the first year was very difficult) it was really bad. With her, as a woman in her twenties, constantly needing to ask for permission to do basically anything.\n\n\n\nIt has improved a lot, with her becoming much more assertive and independent but one things still really bothering me. At the point when we had been living together around for around 7 months her parents  (who were in a longstanding legal battle with the US government over their citizenship rights) heard that the next hearing was going ahead and assumed they would win the case within that month,  despite me, my girlfriend, the lawyer,  and their oldest son trying to explain that this was only one step in a long process.\n\n\n\nWith this they decided they would spend their time before moving back to the USA  seeing the sights in Europe.  The problem was that they drained my girlfriends bank account to do it. (It was an account she made as a minor so her mom had access)\n\nWhen it came out that they won the case but another date was scheduled they exploded and blamed the lawyer and said it was his fault my girlfriends life savings were now non existent. \n\n\nAs I've said, over time she has gotten a lot more assertive and in return her parents have started treating her more like an adult. \n\n\nNow we're left being solely reliant on my income and savings and it honestly makes me furious.\nAny time I bring it up with her she says \"it doesn't matter\" and any time I voice my concern over feeling like I'm the only one putting resources into this relationship she blames her parents. But has not and refuses to ask her parents for the money.\n\n\nI know they aren't in the best position financially but it feels like I'm the one paying for it. Especially when at Christmas or birthdays she's lucky to get cheap low quality  clothes and socks, but her younger sibling (aged 21) who still lives at home is bought new phones/consoles and games even when it's not a special occasion.\nWith the excuse being \"well he works with your dad this is how we pay him\" even though he gets paid by their dad for the work he does. (Interesting side note: they pulled him out of school to start help working and now he's too old to finish high school and has no qualifications)\n\n\nSo, knowing that her parents are genuinely not in a good place financially, but they don't manage their money well, am I the asshole for wanting my girlfriend to demand the money from her parents because we shouldn't pay for their mistakes?\n\n\nWhenever we talk about it it always ends with me feeling terrible and just assuming I'm the asshole, but am I the asshole? \n\n\nAnd am I the asshole for expecting her to carry some of the financial burdens?",

I say borderline because I get a lot of hours, and in all honesty, I could be assistant manager if I wanted(I choose not to, because I want to leave this place already). The hours I work are usually when the manager leaves, or it's the weekend and it's busy enough to warrant needing people like me and the manager to work at the same time. reason being, I'm the one with the most flexible schedule and semi competent enough to do a bit of everything at work.\n\nthe thing is, the way people are scheduled, on weekdays, it's only 2 people working, which, aside from my days off, it's me and 1 other, and me usually having a semi long shift(usually like 2-9). that means, if I wanted to call in sick, I would have to know ahead of time, though given I tend to sleep and wake up late, it's usually too late, so I would still come in, but Generally get to leave early because the manager would have to find someone.\n\nmoving on, i already had to leave early twice last week, and thought whatever I had was gone, except since at least yesterday, it's gotten worse. my face ended up being red and dry, and I have a stuffy nose. my manager had me scheduled for long shifts this weekend, because on those days, he usually need 3-4 people, with him and me for the afternoon/evening (half of the people don't cook, even though they can , due to being too slow, so generally someone else does so).\n\nI don't like the idea of leaving my manager hanging on such a short notice, but I don't know how I'll be for this coming weekend. I also don't want to make it seem like I'm abusing being sick/trying to being lazy, but I barely gotten through last night with how I was. Given how I am(personality wise), I'm most likely going to come in either way,partly due to fear of losing the job out of making things harder, and at best, request to leave early if it gets bad, but that won't change the idea that I might get others sick, or that the manager won't be able to find someone to cover me, leaving the store short handed.\n\nWIBTA if I came to work sick regardless?",

Talking with him doesn’t help, and because I’m overworked and don’t want to spend my one day off hanging out with him (because I have to clean up after him or follow him up all the time re: his behaviour) he’s obviously feeling rejected and more isolated. \n\nI’ve suggested counselling, I’ve shared with him my own mental health challenges and how I’ve worked through them, and how I’m there for him, but with how hard it is and how angry and defensive he is to live with (and after months of little change) I’m pulling away emotionally and socially. Am I the asshole? \n\n",

      "description": "I have decided to move several states away from my family, and some of them are angry for \"abandoning them\"\n\n\\-My parents use to own a very successful business where from a very young age(around 8) i would be pretty much forced to give up many of my afternoons, most of my weekends to work at my parents business. It was difficult work, sometimes dangerous, and even disgusting. Sometimes i would have to pick up trash like used condoms, diapers with feces, and my parents would not provide me with any safety equipment. My only reward at the time was a reminder that i got to live in their house for free, and had food in the fridge.\n\n\\-I hated it, but my parents promised me a large inheritance soon after i graduated high school. Instead of giving me anything after high school, they gave my older sister $50,000 for a down payment on a luxury car, a small house, and money to open up a clothing store. Even though she never worked at this business, since it got started after she moved out.\n\n\\-To give you some context on how fucked up this situation was we lived in a luxurious house on two acres of property, and while my sister would visit in her super expensive BMW i would have a beat up 20 year old car. Instead of helping me go to college at a very inexpensive school they were OK with me working at McDonalds.\n\n\\-She is smart, but has no real business knowledge or experience. She puts my family almost a million dollars in debt, clothing store fails, her house and my families house foreclose due to money problems. We had to sell almost everything to get rid of the debt. I now have no chance of inheriting anything.\n\n\\-I know i sound self entitled to just want a successful business to fall on my lap from a young age, but if i wasn't going to get anything i should not have been forced to do that stuff from such a young age. I also feel justified to be angry since my sister didn't contribute anything to building this business yet she got handed a bunch of stuff. \n\n\\- i have a lot of bitterness, anger, resentment, and possibly even hatred towards my entire family. Because of all this i'm cutting ties and moving away.\n\nAm i the Asshole for\n\nFeeling resentment towards them?\n\nNot returning a small amount of cash they let me borrow when i was younger?\n\nfor moving away?\n\nsorry for my bad grammar, any advice or help would be appreciated.",

      "title": "AITA For being angry my roommate doesn't communicate with me instead of me just knowing when she's annoyed?",
      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom, I'll try to make this as short as possible, but there's a bunch of details that are important to this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: I am a college freshman in your average dorm room setting. My roommate and I get along well, we've never had a fight or argument and we have good conversations a lot of times. She took a gap year and saved up money so her parents are only paying for the tuition and room and board but everything else she has to pay for. I did not take a gap year but my parents are paying for tuition and room and board and I worked in the summer and winter break to save up some money. My parents are not poor, we're solidly middle class and recently because of my mom's surgeries and my brother's cancer treatments (he's fine now), we're really in a tough situation financially, again not poor or going to go bankrupt but we really have to cut a lot of stuff off that's not necessary. My roommate is very sociable, I'll call her Jane, and is good friends with a bunch of girls on the floor. I am more acquaintances with the girls on my floor, and I do have pretty bad social anxiety but I manage pretty well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProblem: So I was in a girl's room doing homework, I'm actually friends with this one person, when I heard Jane out in the hall with some other girls talking about me. Jane said I was the most inconsiderate roommate in the world and I was really shocked by this because I try to make sure I consider how my actions in the room will affect her. At the beginning of the year we also agreed that if we have problems, we'll bring it up nicely to each other and promised not to get offended since everyone has different things that annoy them.  She had some main issues:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. She said I don't pay for anything and since she's paying for everything but school herself, that I should just get my parents who, she said have tons of money to just buy it. My dad has really bad anxiety about money and I get yelled at for asking for anything, even things I need. Plus, the reason I worked is so I wouldn't have to ask for things unless they were big expenses that were necessities. She bought a trash can, swiffer, microwave, and water filter. I bought a fridge, recycling can, small vacuum, and the replacement filters for the water. It seemed like everything was pretty equal, but according to her because she thinks my parents are rich, I should be paying for more or that she thinks that she pays for more of the stuff? She said the fridge was shitty but it works and it's big enough for both of our stuff. Yeah, it's not as big as the nice ones with a separate freezer door but she said she didn't want to split the cost to rent a big one from the bookstore. The thing is, she has used the swiffer maybe once and she broke the trash can and threw up in it when she was drunk and asked me to get a new one. So I said ok because it's like $5 on Amazon. I clean the room every Saturday and she has cleaned maybe once, I know because the swiffer dust cloths are still mostly unused. I typically clean with the vacuum and wipe down the microwave and fridge inside and dust around the room. \n2. She complained that last semester I smoked weed too much in the room and it was annoying her. I was smoking like three times a day towards the end of the semester and sometimes she would be there, sometimes she'd be in class. But she also smokes in the room and in other people's rooms. She didn't tell me that it bothered her so much the entire time. She said that I didn't get social cues because she apparently would leave the room every time I would smoke but she leaves the room all the time to go see her friends when I wasn't smoking so I don't know how she expects me to get that. If she had a problem I would have preferred her to tell me, but she didn't. It wasn't until the start of this semester that she asked nicely for me not to smoke so much in the room because she doesn't like the smell when she's doing homework. I totally agreed and I had planned to not smoke so much anyway. I have smoked maybe once since the start of the semester and she wasn't even in the room. She gets high and drunk in other people's rooms several times a week but then acts like my weed smoking, which she does not take part in, affects her. I completely respected her wishes and texted her the one time I smoked. It really hurt when she said I didn't get social cues because with social anxiety, that's my biggest worry and it just made me think that maybe everyone really is tolerating me. \n3. She said that she hates that I'm always in the room and that it's disrespectful of her privacy. She said that because again, she thinks my parents are rich, that they should have paid for a single room if I am so introverted. But I'm not always in the room, I have morning classes and leave around 7:30 and get back around 11-12. I go to the gym for an hour and then usually eat lunch afterwards. I usually also will go to the library or some other place to study because I like to switch up my study spots. I also sometimes go to club meetings in the evening and those last 1-2 hours. I don't know where she's getting this idea that I'm always in the room. The thing is, she sleeps like 12-13 hours. I leave the room specifically so I don't have to tiptoe or be super quiet when I want to do homework or something. She sleeps during most of the time that I am out so when I am tired and want to be in my room, she's just getting up for the day. I totally get that we have different schedules and I don't mind leaving, I just feel like she doesn't recognize how often I really am gone. On top of that, she said something really insulting and condescending. She said that she gets that my parents want me to have a friend, but it's unfair to her and disrespectful of her privacy to make me get a roommate when I am introverted and stay in the room a lot. My parents didn't force me to get a roommate, I didn't want to spend an extra $2000 on the comfort and luxury of having a single room. I mean everyone wants that, but I chose to have a roommate, I don't mind having one, and my parents have never worried about me making friends, my social anxiety is bad when it comes to authority figures and large crowds and stuff. For her to assume something like that also was just rude. If she had told me that she wanted to work out a plan where we both could have more private time, I would have understood since our schedules are different. \n4. She complained about the fact that I lock the door all the time. In my house, my mom always would say that if you see the front or back door unlocked, I should lock it, especially if I'm home alone. It's just a habit I do when I would pass the front door and saw it wasn't locked. So I do the same in my dorm, if I go by my closet and notice the door's unlocked, I just press the button on the handle. I didn't realize that it annoyed her because it's not hard to unlock the door. When I know she's coming back soon, like the bathroom or getting a drink, or even getting food, I don't lock the door. But if no one is in the room and I don't know when she's coming back, I always lock the door. Also when I don't know when she's coming back and I am in the room, I lock the door as a habit and also because sometimes her friend next door to us will sometimes just walk in to see if Jane is in for her to hang out. I again, don't have a problem with any of the girls on the floor, but if she just told me that it annoyed her, I would start to remind myself that I'm not at home and I don't need to always lock the door. I feel very safe in the dorms anyway so that's not a concern. \n5. Again she complained about how I never leave and she wants to have friends over but she can't. But that's not true, I mean other people on the floor bring their friends in while their roommates are there and they just put in headphones or simply ignore them. Sometimes I know it's better to just leave and let them hang out, but I didn't realize that when I would put in headphones and literally just lay in my bed, I was annoying her. If she just told me that sometimes she wants to talk about private stuff with her friends, I'd find somewhere else to go. \n\nI don't know, I think that I'm mostly shocked by the fact that she never brought this up to me. And on top of that, there's tons of stuff that she does that annoys me that I am willing to just ignore because I can't fight everything. Am I the asshole for not noticing that my behavior apparently annoyed her? Am I lacking in social skills if I expect her to tell me about something when she's annoyed instead of just knowing? I mean the thing is, I know that people need to vent sometimes and I get annoyed that I don't have absolute privacy and silence sometimes, I think everyone feels that. But the way she was basically yelling about it and saying she didn't want me as her roommate seemed like it was more than just venting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Overheard my roommate talking about me when she thought I couldn't hear. She thinks that she pays for almost everything in the room that we share, and that my parents are rich (they are not) so I should have just asked them to get me stuff. I paid for the fridge, recycling bin, vacuum, and replacement filters, she paid for the microwave (which I offered to pay half of but she declined), trash can, water filter jug, and a swiffer. She thinks that my parents pay for everything but I have had to work as well because they only pay my tuition. She said last semester I smoked too much weed and it prevented her from doing her homework/annoyed her (valid complaint). But didn't tell me until the second semester, which I cut down from three times a day to smoking just once since I've returned mid January. She said I didn't get social cues because I didn't realize that when I would smo",

      "description": "Hello all, \nSo for context me and my girlfriend have been together for over a year now and whenever we have sex we don’t use protection of any kind apart from the pull out method. I’ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she’s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn’t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she’s right it doesn’t feel as good but it’s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there’s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I’ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there’s no point in even using it then. She’s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she’s being irrational.\n\nI don’t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we’ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she’s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?",

      "description": "Recently I opened up a bank account for personal spending, I had saved up ~280$ of entirely my own money from working, gifts, etc... and I was waiting for my next paycheck because I wanted to buy a Nintendo switch which I have been saving up for. I have an arrangement where I put 1/2 of any paychecks I get into savings account for college because I’m not out of high-school yet. I have also decided to start saving up for a car so instead of putting 1/2 my newest paycheck into savings I decided I’m going to be putting 3/4 of all future paychecks into it. So I got paid 80$, I kept 20 to buy the switch and left the other 60 to put into my savings, and all was turning out well. Until I mentioned to my mom that a package was coming, (before I continue, my mother owes me about ~180 and was going to pay me back it slowly) she asked what was in the package and I told her that I bought a switch, she went ballistic about how I should have told her before I bought it (in hindsight this would have been a good idea to do first, I’ll admit that) and that it was a huge waste of money, even though I told her that she could put the 60 I put aside + the 180 she owes me into the savings account. She then said about how she’s not paying me back anymore because quote “you just spent your money.” She doesn’t want to talk anymore and is pissed. I don’t believe I’m in the wrong because it was my personal money that I saved and I could freely spend how I wanted, and that I left more than enough (60 + the 180 she owed me) to put into savings for a car and college. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "There's a 12 year old boy who lives across the street from me. His sister and my daughter, both 8, are best friends. We've lived here for nearly 4 years now, and this kid has been nothing but a bully to my daughter. Mostly just teasing and name calling, but there has been the occasional violent threat. I've spoken with the parents several times and each time he seems to get worse. We've gone as far as talking with authorities about getting a no contact order against him.\n\nYesterday I had enough. My wife text me at work basically saying he's at it again. She's a teacher, so she's at home with my daughter for spring break. When I got home from work, he was outside. I walked across the street and yelled something along the lines of \"hey you, come here.\" For the next minute I yelled at the top of my lungs at him. I didn't touch him, I didn't threaten him with violence. I basically told him that he is not to speak, look at, or even think about talking to my daughter again or I will get the police involved. \n\nBy the end of my rant, he had tears and his eyes and was shaking.  I turned to walk away and found that I had gotten the attention of a neighbor.  He yelled and said \"he's just a kid, you cant talk to him like that.\" I told him to mind his own business because he doesn't know the whole story. I then went inside my home.\n\nWhat I didn't realize was that the kids parents were not home at the time and after I went inside the neighbor called the father. My wife then informed me that the parents were not home. So I decided that I would wait and talk to them as soon as they got home to tell them what I did.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later the dad pulled in the driveway and went inside. I walked over, knocked on the door and the daughter answered.  The dad was sitting at the table with the boy talking to him. After seeing me, and already knowing I yelled at his kid, he stepped outside and shut the door behind him. He was heated, he got in my face and began to yell, threatening violence against me if I do it again. I would take a few steps back and he would continue to step towards me. At one point I slapped his finger out of my face.\n\nAfter a minute things cooled down and we talked civilly. I explained the events of that day and he agreed that they were not appropriate.  I apologize to him for yelling at his son, though I honestly don't feel all that bad about it. He claimed that his son would be punished, but I feel as though he doesn't think that what his son been doing is all that bad, which is why the bullying continues. At the very least, I think I scared the kid enough to back off. ",

      "description": "Hi Reddit,\n\nenglish is not my native language so have mercy.\n\nMy girlfriend has a huge familiy. She has 7 \"real\" silbings and 2 halfbrothers. The mother lives with one of her daughters and her two sons from her second husband alone. My girlfriend, my daughter and i live pretty close to them. Only 10 min drive. The area is pretty rural. Bus and train come by every two hours and only in bigger cities who are like 20 min drive from us. The car of her mother broke two weeks ago. Nobody except me and her has a driverlicense.\n\nThats the settings of my story.\n\nSince her car broke down i helped her out. Driving her to the supermarket and getting some stuff when i come from work. She could do this while her 14-15 year old sons are at school with no problem. Bus and call taxi are reliable, but since its easy and am willing to help i just do it. Also she drove me 1 time every week so its kinda a payback even if i just gave her already money for this. She asked me to get her a really specific item and the store didnt had it so i just told her to order it online. Its some kind of paint. She lost it. First she tried to told me she did so much for me and i was ungrateful. She said that in a pretty aggressiv way so i didnt said anything. Than she went beyond and insulted me and said things which arent true. Since then i just stopped talking to her and dicided to dont help her out until she apologize. This was a week ago. Since now she didnt apologize even if we saw each other when i picked my girlfriend and kid up. I am sure she knows from my girlffriend that i am expecting this before we can work on getting things done.\n\nToday the 14 year son injuried himself at the schoolsports. His finger is blue. He did manage to get threw school and drove back to home after school. So he comes home and his helicopter come lost it and demands i drive him to the hospital. I thought its unnessary but i will drive him, but not her to the hospital. And hes old enought to tell the doctor what he has and to wait alone there and that i will pick him up afterwards. Since i had an appointment in the city it would be fine.\n\nThats where the shit hit the fan and everybody was mad at me. I dont like doing it but i just demand an apology for the stuff she said which was pretty insulting. (Fuck you, lazy ass etc.) Since i am the only one working fulltime its also just wrong. If she would call me personal saying it like \"hey i know stuff still shit but this is an emergenzie and we can talk afterwards\" than i would drive her even if i think its not urgent but thats not my buisness.",

I attended for the exercise and involvement and the structure that motivated me to exercise. I think that too many parents care more about about their kids' athletic performance than the kids do themselves. I love my kids and I care about their academics and fitness and wellness, but I just do not attend their games, for work or other reasons. I pick up and drop them off and attend concerts because they are academic and fewer, and may attend an occasional championship. I actually asked my kids whether or not they want me to attend. However, I thought that neutrally asking them might cause them to say yes if they did not mean out of fear of hurting my feelings and not knowing what I was asking (I used to pretend to care about stuff my parents did and say yes when I did not care), so while it seems biased, I told them that I will not be hurt if they do not care if I attend, and I just care that they are happy and do well, and while this may have skewed it, they said no.\n\nHowever, my wife, my wife's friends, and my parents are denying that that is the case, and believe that anyhow, part of being a parent is watching your kids' games even if the kids themselves do not care, but I disagree because I have different values and priorities.

Last semester I had a roommate, and since I made my decision on what college I wanted to go to super late, I had to be with just some random guy for a roommate, I’ll call him Dave.\n\nThe first day when I moved in, I found my room and realized that Dave had been there for an entire day before the official move in day and had taken over half of the room for all of his stuff. I didn’t say anything tho because I didn’t have much of my own stuff so it really didn’t bother me. \n\nNow, me and Dave got along fine, but in total silence.  At first I tried to at least exchange pleasantries, good morning, how was your day, etc, but I hardly ever got more than short one word responses so I gave up. \n\nAt some point like halfway into the semester, the RA has to do a check of our rooms to make sure we aren’t hiding pets or drugs or anything like that. When he did ours, all he said was that my side was really messy, and admittedly it really was.  I had loose papers everywhere, there were wrappers all over my desk and receipts from fast food places everywhere but I was always really careful never to actually leave food anywhere. The RAs comments made me worry that I might be making Dave uncomfortable with my messiness so I asked him if he was bothered by it, and he said, “ Nah, it’s cool.”  So I tidied up a tad bit, but not much. \n\nThis semester, I’m by myself bc Dave and some of his freinds got an apartment. His girlfriends old roommate now works in my building as a desk assistant and she told me that Dave constantly talks about how big of a slob I was and how it made last semester so unbearable for him. I’m gonna have another roommate next semester so I need to know, AITA?",

Sorry but I don't think I can make a TL:DR for this. \n\nContext\nMy girlfriend's mum passed away after struggling with cancer for 8 months in the new year. Very sad start to the year. We have been together for a year and few months. We are currently living together to save money and for privacy as we can afford to live in a 1 bedroom. Her parents and her sisters are 'aware' of me and that she's dating me but they do not know how close we are or what all we have done in the relationship. My family does not know yet as my mum has this expectation of marriage marriage marriage and can be a little controlling at times. Therefore i'm holding off on telling them until later this year. Why's that? \n\nBecause I will be going back to studies to a different city (I moved to this city where my gf is working because I got a job offer in the field I wanted (law) as a Paralegal. Law jobs are quite scarce and I thought this was a good way to get legal experience and make connections (both of which I have done) and also save money so when I go back to studying, I don't have to work part time and I can just study (previously I was working part time and studying full time and am half way through my degree). \n\nI am currently behind on my projected savings because I couldn't handle full time work and manage my food and expenses. in saying that, I am saving just probably 20% less than I had hoped. She's aware of this. I had 0 days leave left after the new year/christmas mandatory shutdown period. She's also aware of this.\n\nShe was (understandably) very upset when her mum passed away and was asking me to come overseas to be with her. While I genuinely wanted to, I couldn't because \n\na) I didn't have leave left, literally 0 leave. I could take bereavement leave for 2 days for partner's parent's death but that's about it and 2 days is not enough time to go overseas for a 12 hour journey and make it back in time for work.\n\nB) If I had to go, I would have to take unpaid leave for a week or so + last minute tickets were costing to be around 2500$. Which means that's close to $3500 gone out of my already down savings for study funds. For me to do that means I'm delaying graduation by 1 extra semester as I would have to work more than my 1 year contract to save that money.\n\nC) I couldn't lie to my parents about going overseas as they're from the same country. And somewhere down the line when they meet my gf's family (because that's the plan), they could and possibly would find out I had come to India and not told them.\n\nI was with her on phone, ready 24/7 to talk/text when this happened and tried to support her as best as I could. Asking her memories of her mum, her sharing photos. Admittedly, this is not the same as literally being there for someone.\n\nFast forward to today: we had a minor argument about something completely unrelated. And then she brings up \"even for my mum, I had to beg you\". I told her I explained why I couldn't come and had tried to be there for her from here. She said she understood (obviously fucking not otherwise she wouldn't be saying this) but her sisters' (2 sisters) husbands also came. These are sisters (and their husbands) who have been married 4-5 years minimum, are well settled in their careers with high paying jobs with no student loan or studies to save for. I'm clearly not in the same situation. I told her that if it had been my mum and the situation was reversed. I would have definitely wanted her to be there but no way in hell would I have expected her no matter what to be there and understood her reasons if she had genuine reasons.\n\nI understand I'm being selfish by caring for my money and scenario but am I an asshole?\n",

      "description": "My boyfriend (M20) and I (F19) have been together for 4 years and have never been on holiday together. I have wanted to go every year, he has expressed enthusiasm, I have planned it, given him loads of options, but he will just make excuse after excuse after excuse (can't afford it (even though he could easily), doesn't have a passport (get one then?), his mum won't let him (a complete lie, his mum is lovely and let's him do whatever he wants)). \nWe've been doing this over and over for four years, I've suggested every kind of holiday imaginable, I've even offered to pay even though I have very little money compared to him. I've also turned down my friends holidays because he's promised this is the year, and I've been worried I wouldn't be able to afford both, and ended up going on no holiday. \nAm i the asshole for wanting to go on holiday with him? I've tried to sit down and have a conversation with him but he just makes the same excuses, or says yes lets go, and then a few weeks later changes his mind. Do you think there might be a reason for this? We're in the UK so going to France or Spain is literally an hour away and costs very little. I always have people asking why we've never been away together and literally cannot think of what to say other than \"he can't be assed\".\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend refuses to go on holiday with me but never gives a proper excuse as to why.",

      "title": "AITA for knocking on my ceiling/my neighbor's floor (after trying to address neighbor directly)?",
      "description": "**Background:** I live in a big city, but in a residential neighborhood on a quiet street. I've been in my apartment for two years as of this month, and I've lived in this city for 10 years, so I have a good idea of what constitutes as normal neighbor noise. For the past year, I've been working from home Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm. My upstairs neighbor has been living above me for about 1.5 years, but she only started being noisy a few months ago. Also, I don't want to involve the police. Neighbor and I are both white, but we live in a neighborhood that mostly isn't, and I don't want to be the one who brings the police to our block. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The problem:** She plays music very loudly with heavy bass for hours at a time. To her credit, she doesn't do this during the city's designated quiet hours. However, the music is so loud that the bass shakes my apartment and I can hear her music over my own music (or TV, etc). I can even tell what song she's listening to (or use Shazam to have my phone tell me). This is especially a problem when I have to take phone calls or video calls for work, as I can't exactly drown out her music with my own while I'm on a call. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to make it clear that I know it's not reasonable to expect silence from neighbors, or to expect quiet 100% of the time. This lady is playing music at a volume you'd hear coming from a nightclub, not what you'd hear from someone who has their stereo up just a little too loud. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried knocking on her door while her music was up loud, and when she answered the door she had to turn her music down to hear what I was saying. I explained that I work from home on a Monday-Friday/9am-5pm schedule and asked if she could turn the music down during those hours, and even said I wouldn't mind loud music outside of those days/hours. (Note: That would leave her a good 7 hours of loud music time on weekdays, plus all of weekends). She smiled, apologized, and said she'd keep the music down while I'm working.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings were better for about a week. The loud music would start at exactly 5:01pm on weekdays, but at least I had my workdays! Then she went back to her old ways. I tried knocking on her door again, but she didn't answer. I asked the landlord to talk to her, and he assured me he would. Again, things got better for a week, but then she started up again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then I resorted to knocking on my ceiling/her floor with a broomstick. I only did it when her music was egregiously loud; it wasn't the sort of thing where I'd start knocking at the slightest hint of noise. That worked for a few days, but then one day she came banging on my door, demanding to know why I was knocking on her floor. She was really upset about it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI invited her into my apartment and over to my desk/work area, so she could hear how loud her music and bass were in my apartment. Her response was: \"I'm sorry, but this disturbs you? If you want peace and quiet, you need to move to the suburbs. That's no excuse for knocking on my floor! How am I supposed to live like this?\" I explained that I didn't expect complete silence, just for her music to be turned down (not even off! just down!) during my workday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer response? \"If I wait until after 5pm, then the other neighbors complain.\" I came back with: \"Look, maybe you're the one who needs to adjust your expectations around what it means to live in a city. I'm not the only one complaining, so the problem is you. Your music just can't be as loud as you'd be able to have it in the suburbs!\" She called me a bitch and stormed out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe music situation has gotten worse, and I explained to my landlord what happened between us. He keeps saying he'll talk to her and then following up after having the conversation. But he's so nice, I'm guessing she sees him as a pushover and doesn't think she needs to listen to him. I know for a fact she doesn't pay her rent on time most months and that she doesn't dispose of her trash properly, because he's complained about her to me. I have never been late on rent and when the landlord has to stop by to fix something, he always comments on how clean and nicely kept the apartment is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm at the end of my rope and I'm tempted to go back to using the broomstick. It's clear that knocking on my ceiling/her floor with my broomstick really upsets her, but AITA for doing it anyway, since she's being so unreasonable about her music? She can just keep her music at a normal-for-a-residential-building volume and not have to hear me knocking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, when it comes time for leases to be renewed (everyone in the building is on a June-renewal cycle), I plan to tell the landlord it's her or me. I'm saving to move out, so it's not a bluff. ",

My dad was here with me and his friend, who is helping us with our move turned up (unannounced, but it's helpful).  My dad had an appointment to get to, but knows I'm uncomfortable alone with his friend as he has angry outbursts and tells stories that make me uncomfortable.\n\nThe reason my boyfriend was meeting me was because I have been doing the whole renovation myself and he was meant to help.\n\nI said it was ok for my dad to leave as my boyfriend would only be 10 mins away.\n\nWell lo and behold, my boyfriend is an hour late with no warning and I'm terrified.\n\nI was so angry and scared, aita for being mad he wasn't on time?",

      "description": "So I'm going to make this as short and sweet as possible. I came up with a (admittedly childish) tattoo idea that ive kinda grown fond of. Growing up, Scooby-Doo and Batman were always my two favorite cartoons. Well in 2019, Scooby turns 50 and Batman turns 80. I thought it would be a neat little tattoo idea to have scooby doo wearing batman's costume. Now the wife, while thinking still liking scooby doo and batman is childish and a bit ridiculous, has never had an issue with me watching it from time to time or buying whatever the latest movie is, because that's just part of marriage. I don't hold her awful reality shows against her either. So while it's never been an issue, it hasnt ever been a mutual interest or one shes been able to understand.\n\nWell, she is absolutely opposed to the tattoo idea. I would most likely get it on like my calf or something, no where extremely visible, but not completely hidden either. She's said that she would really prefer I not get a tattoo of scooby doo. She doesnt like scooby doo and that's fine, plus she'd most likely have to see it more than I would honestly. I dont notice my other tattoos at this point while if I had one she resented me for getting, she probably couldn't ignore it everytime she saw it. But at the same time, the whole my body, my decision thing is there and while it's not some deep sentimental tattoo, I like the idea because of what it represents of my childhood and what I still like and want the tattoo. It's an idea ive had in mind for quite a while now so it's not just a spur of the moment thing either. It's not really an argument right now, but I could see it being one if I went forward with the idea. So WIBTA if I got the tattoo knowing full well she dislikes it?",

      "title": "AITA for expecting more from my SO?",
      "description": "My SO (24 F) and I (22 M) have been together for about three years and have been living together for about half of that time. Over the course of our relationship I have been working on a degree at university while waiting tables full time. Given that I make a good amount of money at my job (a result of working my tail off while at school and being hired at better restaurants) I am the main financial supporter of our household. \n\nFor a long time it wasn’t an issue, however for about 6-8 months now my SO has used my financial stability to allow her to work well below her means/ability (about 15-20hrs). Being someone who has never wanted to make finances an issue in a relationship, I have looked the other way but with my student loan debt looming, I’m worried about making ends meet. This is particularly frustrating because I feel like I can’t invest in my future or get ahead on my debt, in spite of having worked so hard to get to the place I am at. \n\nGiven so much of my time has been taken up by school and work, I’ve spent a lot of time freaking out that I couldn’t keep up on my household responsibilities (cleaning, laundry, etc.) without sacrificing time I needed for studying/sleep.  While in school I started having panic attacks over this struggle to balance my schedule and I was diagnosed with Bi-polar disorder. I am so appreciative for how emotionally supportive my SO has been while I’ve worked to become stable, which is a major source of guilt for me and reinforcers my habit of looking the other way to the issues in our relationship even though the majority of financial and. household responsibilities have continued to fall on me.\n\nI’ve talked to her multiple times about how I would like her to contribute more to the relationship but as soon as I see her get upset and/or cry I completely lose all my convictions and only want to take care of her. She has told me things would get better but they haven’t changed much in that time.\n\nAnother reason I am giving her the benefit of the doubt is her recent (~6 months) and current depressive episode she appears to be experiencing. I finally got her to see a therapist at the same office I go to (different therapist) last week but we won’t be able to afford her co-pay without her getting another job. I know how terrible depression is personally so I’ve spent a lot of my time during what is my last semester at uni compensating for things she’s fallen behind on. I’m happy to help and support her, I just feel a little slighted when she was the person who watched me go to classes/exams/ work mid-panic attack or walk in crying because I had to. I hoped her seeing how hard I had to struggle and work to get better and for the benefit of both of us that she would be pushing herself a little more. I know every case of mental health is different so I don’t feel comfortable bringing this up to her.\n\nAITA for expecting more from my SO? I love her to death but I am worried that with myself graduating next week things will only get worse because I am legitimately excited to have time to cook and clean again. She doesn’t seem to have any desire to contribute more financially however I need her to if I want to start paying off my student loan debt. These issues have caused multiple fights over the past couple of months and I feel terrible anytime I see them make her cry. I’m so conflicted between my personal convictions and my love for her and all it does is make me feel like an superficial asshole.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting to help train my roommates territorial dog?",
      "description": "First off, I’d like to make it known that in this current time of my life, I do not want the responsibility of a dog. I live in an apartment, am moving up fairly rapidly in my career/ work 50 ish hours a week, and I’d rather not have to arrange my schedule around a dog. With that being said, I grew up with 7 dogs as my mom used to participate in dog shows and I got along well with all of them. In short, I love dogs and will definitely own another in the future.\n\nAbout two years ago my roommate asked me if he could get a dog and without thinking, I said “of course man!” So a week or so later he comes home with a 3-4 year old rescue black mouth cur. This dog was immediately scared and has growled from day one. It had apparently been abused earlier in life but I’m unsure of the extent. I guess my expectations of him getting a dog were going to be a dog that wasn’t in this kind of emotional state.\n\nReluctantly, for the first few weeks I started feeding her, giving her treats, and I took her on a few walks. The dog is always good on the leash and out of the house but the moment she is back in her “territory” she is very aggressive and seemingly overprotective of my roommate and his room specifically. After a few weeks passed with little improvement, I became frustrated because this wasn’t what I signed up for and told my roommate he needs to invest in a trainer. He hired a trainer come a few times but suggested that I keep taking on more responsibility. That was just something I didn’t want to spend time doing.\n\nHe tried a vibration collar and admittedly told me he kept it on a pretty low setting. He said he stopped putting it on her when he realized she started to figure out how to get around its function. He doesn’t use it anymore. Since then, the extent of any form of training within the apartment setting has been him yelling “no” at her whenever she starts freaking out around me.\n\nIn regards to her behavior, she does a mixture of loud barking and growling right at me. If I’m in the kitchen, she will post her self halfway through his doorway and into the kitchen and inevitably keep barking until I either leave or shoo her back enough into the room to just get the door closed. If she hears any sort of sound I make in the apt she growls and starts barking. She has nipped me a few times as well, not recently but in the first year if I would turn my back to her she would run up behind me and try to bite my leg. She never bit hard enough to break skin but it is still very alarming for me.\n\nI have confronted him about a stronger shock collar for training or hiring a more diligent full time trainer but his argument for the most part is that I haven’t loved her or nurtured her enough. In the times where she does get close to me I always pet her but those times are rare.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice here. Am I the asshole for not wanting to take on this kind of responsibility? If he had just gotten a younger dog with less emotional problems this wouldn’t even be an issue it seems.",

She only wants to be with me and she doesn't like to have a conversation with other people nor being with other people when I'm with her, she completely isolate from the world and wants ro only be with me and I can't avoid feeling bad when doing things that I like because she feels bad when I'm not with her.\n\nI started to realise about all this at the beginning of 2019 because she got a little bit mad since I wanted to stay home and play some videogames instead of going to her house (to be fair, I Just bought my new PC and I was really looking forward to try it and I wouldn't have time other day due to work). Every time I start to tell her about my time playing video games or other interests of mine she completely ignore me to the point that when I stop telling her she doesn't even realise and immediatelly starts telling me about something that happened to her, so really all I do is shut up and listen to anything she wants to tell me. \n\nNow I'm not sure if I lost all my feelings for her or if I don't feel as happy and comfortable with the her as when we started to date, and really all I want to do is to break up so I can finally stop feelings bad for doing things that I like because she feels bad. \n\n(And I'm sorry for the gramatic, I'm still in the process of learning English) ",

Wanted to get some perspective from others. \n\nBackstory:\n5 year relationship broken off by ex-gf 3 months ago (Lived together, had 5 animals, very unexpected breakup), we met up a couple of times where I tried to fix things (3 times) but she kept saying \"I will think about it\" but I stopped when I found out she was in fact dating a guy 2 weeks after we broke up. Didn't talk for a while but met up about 4 days ago to give final bits and pieces to each other and I ended up telling her how much pain her actions brought me and that not even 6 months ago we were trying to work on the fact that she went on a tinder date(different guy) and she begged to fix the relationship but now she tricked me by leaving suddenly, it wasn't productive and she ended up getting in her car and driving away. \n\nThe next morning she sent me a long apology about being sorry for driving away and not talking, sorry for hurting me and she wishes that she could have done it better, she wants me to be happy and she does respect and care about me and that she is truly sorry. \n\nI ignored the message for 3 days because sending a text message to apologize after all this time was insulting and her actions showed otherwise and I needed to go no contact to heal. The next day she sent another message saying: \"I hope you are okay\". Unfortunately I did end up replying saying: \"Hey, I don't understand your intention with that message and I don't know why you are apologizing.\"\n\nI couldn't read her intent and was legitimately curious why she felt the need to apologize since I don't understand if she wants to leave the life we had for something else why apologize?\n\n\nAITA for rejecting her apology?\n\n",

I live with my mom so I understand I do not have final say on this but they asked me last like it was up to me. I said absolutely not. I dont hate dogs im just not a dog person. Love em their cute all that but its like having a kid which I wont have.  I made it clear my answer was no. I woke up and she was still here. That was 5 years ago. We have had countless issues where im stuck taking her to the vet or comforting her through her issues and my mom (the one who kept her) is gone with her bf at the beach or at a casino or sone shit. Almost every time something happens shes not the one taking physical care of the dog. Roxxy has been diagnosed with lymphoma she has a mass growing in her butthole and throughout her body. She started chemo yesterday. The symptoms the dog is having are beyond annoying to me. Constantly having to go out, then not go, only to come inside and shit on the floor. She pants and paces constantly unless shes drugged up but the side effects of them are also shit. Im just so fucking emotinally fried and my family is treating me like shit because everytime it comes up I have to remind them I want no part of it. Just because shes dying doesnt guilt me into changing how i feel and thats what they are doing to me. Pressuring me into feeling like shit because i seriously dont care. I just lost my cat of 16 years on christmas. She was the last pet i ever emtionally invested in. I dont not love my dog im just not invested. They are getting mad at me because im mad that this shit is happening. Telling me i will regret how i feel now later but i know i wont. Am I the asshole for being impatient and frustrated? I feel like im surrounded by stupid and I have no one reasonable to talk to about it.",

      "description": "Hello guys,\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for few months. We are in the same class in our college but mostly we spend time sitting together in class rather than spending time outside as our friend groups are different and we both want to give our time to respective friends. \n\nFrom the past week, we didn't talk much together because she was away on a vacation with her family. I met her yesterday and we just sat together for 2-3 classes. I said that I missed her and would like to spend more time with her, she agreed. She is a semi-professional dancer who has a dance performance coming up this weekend and she has to prepare a lot as she went for vacation. \n\nAt the end of the day, I asked if we can go somewhere for a movie or a date. She said that she has to practice and go to her mentor/tutor for final preparations for the upcoming performance. I asked if she can spare even half an hour for us, it would be great. She said no and it was quite understandable. I really didn't want to hinder her day because its her biggest performance yet. \n\nSo, today comes. I was genuinely happy in the morning that it was the first Valentine's that I am not single. I told her that I love her and miss her. She said the same. \n\nI went on to attend our regular classes which she was bunking for her rehearsals. One of our mutual friends, making fun of us, texted her that I am sad and lonely, which I was not. I was low-key proud of her because of her dancing thingy. Was I feeling lonely? Kinda. But I really thought she was very busy preparing.\n\nShe called me saying, \"Chris texted me saying that you are sad. Do you want to meet. I can make time for you out of my rehearsals, like an hour or two\".\n\nI said no because as I said, I really didn't want to hinder her day and suggested that we can meet later. 20 minutes later, I get a text saying that she is free and going out with her friends for a movie. This is where I lost my shit. I really wanted to spend time with her and have a nice time. And she just goes out with her friends for a 3 hour movie. When I asked where did she get all this time, she said that she was done with her rehearsals. I was fuming because she mentioned earlier that she didn't have time and she was doing me a favor by giving me \"an hour or two\". \n\nAITA for losing my shit and saying that she doesn't care about me and couldn't even give time for Valentine's but would rather go out with her friends as soon as she has time. I had a surprise gift ready.\n\nSorry for my English. I am still getting used to this language.\n\nTLDR: I lost my shit and said to my gf that she doesn't care about me when she chose her friends over me on Valentine's.",

      "description": "Me and my girlfriend of 3 years (she's 21, I'm 20) decided to go on a break 1 month ago. I won't go into detail but we both agreed that it would be for the best to take a break. We decided to let things cool off for some time and then give it another try. We went no contact for the first 2 weeks and after that we messaged occasionally. I moved back in with my parents as I wanted to give both her and myself space.\n\nYesterday we went out for dinner together and we saw each other for the first time since our break. We both felt comfortable and it was going pretty good. When I asked her if she had seen anybody since we decided to split, she looked very confused and said: \"No, of course not. Why? Did you?\"\n\nWell, last weekend I went to a party, and a girl that (apparently) has a thing for me started blatantly hitting on me. I ended up going to her place and she blew me and I went down on her. After that I went home. I wanted to be honest and I told her this, and she was upset to say the least. Every bit of progress we made that night was erased and she called me a selfish asshole. I told her that I thought it would be okay since we were on a break, and I didn't know that it wasn't okay to hook up with other people. She said that I should have known better and repeated what she said earlier.\n\nI didn't go out looking for sex, but it happened. I wasn't satisfied afterwards and I regret it, but I thought that it was okay. This morning I apologized to her through text and she said she needs to think and wants to meet up this weekend, but that it was still a dick move. \n\nAm I really the asshole here? \n\n",

      "description": "I was hired two months ago at a job to work as a receptionist and was postured to take on a role in purchasing shortly after I figured out the basics of the company.  Less than two weeks ago I discussed with my employer, the need to update their website and especially their logo.  I told them I would be interested in working on this project.\n\nBusiness had been slow.  I spent a lot of time waiting for the phone to ring.  Asked a handful of times of my supervisor needed help, but ultimately was no longer being offered much purchasing work since there was not much need to make purchases.  I spent much of my downtime re-familiarizing myself with WordPress and pulled together a basic re-skin of a theme that suited the business needs.  I also worked on a logo, which I had much more experience with designing.\n\nI learned a few days ago that I was being let go because I was “not doing anything”, even though I had readily accepted every task that was offered to me, worked on my own time after hours and often read from a dreadfully boring purchasing textbook when I had the time to, taking breaks from the WP install.\n\nAfter being accused (not literally said) of being unproductive, I showcased my work.  Everyone seemed moderately impressed, which was expected.  It wasn’t finished, but I was generally happy with what I accomplished as a beginner.\n\nNow, I’m still being let go and my company expects me to finish this project (which I was not initially hired to focus on) before my time is up.  I really don’t feel appreciated and have little interest in being diligent in getting this done.  They offered me a “\ncontractor” type role to finish the website, but the company is in a tough place financially and I’m not sure what they could offer or how timely they would pay.\n\nI really want to just leave it unfinished and tell them to fuck off next week, but I’m conflicted.  Any advice?/u/",

      "title": "AITA for maintaining my place in line?",
      "description": "This happened in the drive thru of a fast food place during a rush. This place has two menus to order from, but not much room otherwise. There was a single line of cars backed up to the road that split in to two lanes to order, then joined back up zipper-style to pay and get food. There was a white van behind me in the line of cars waiting to order. It'll be relevant in a minute. \n\nI pull up to the order screen on the left, place my order, then wait for the line to move. Everybody moves a car length forward and I'm behind the last car that ordered on the right, who is of course behind the car that ordered on the left before me. Zipper-style. I'm sure you guys get what I'm saying, just want to make it clear. The aforementioned white van is now ordering at the right screen and some other car is behind me ordering on the left. The window to pay is around the building to the left, so the nose of my car is at a right angle to the car in front of me's bumper. This means I have a fair bit of turning to do to get directly behind the car in front of me, so a vehicle coming from the right *could* cut in front of me, but that would be a dick move surely, right?\n\nWell you'll never guess what happened next! Yup, the white van jumped on that little bit of space to get ahead of me. I made eye contact with the driver (a late teens/early twenties girl), gave her a confused look and shook my head no. She smiled a little, then made a fake pouty face while dragging her finger down her cheek. You know, the classic \"too bad, so sad\" face bullies make when they're taunting someone. The passenger in the van (same age and gender) was laughing. I laughed too and looked away. \n\nShe gains nothing jumping ahead of me after ordering. The food is made as the order is placed, so she'll be waiting at the window as long as she would have been waiting behind me and my order will just sit on the counter taking up space while they finish making hers. She's setting the entire line of cars back the amount of time it will take for me to get my food after her. She's either too stupid to understand how a drive thru works or she's being an asshole on purpose. The way I see it, neither scenario justifies her getting away with cutting in line. \n\nLuckily, she hadn't secured her place in line as well as she thought, so when the car in front moved, I moved too, like they were towing me. The van lurched forward a bit then bounced as she slammed on the brakes and the horn. Once I was firmly ahead of her, she leaned out the window and yelled \"CUUUUUUUUUNNNT!\" When I got to the register window I double checked with the cashier that I was supposed to be next in line. I was 99.99% sure, but the way she was yelling and gesticulating behind me gave me pause. The face she made when she butted in certainly made it look like she was doing it on purpose, but she was over the top mad after. She kept yelling out her window at me but I couldn't hear what she was saying aside from \"you fucking bitch!\" and \" you fucking cunt! \", each said to punctuate whatever she'd said before. Anyway, I got my food and drove off, and that was it. \n\nI mostly feel alright about this, but I recognize it was petty and I should have just let it go. On the other hand, I usually let stuff like this go. I'm a total doormat most of the time, so I feel like this little bit of assertiveness was good for my self esteem, just as the opposite would have been bad. On the other, *other* hand, my kids were in the car with me. They didn't notice what was going on, but they could have, and maybe I wasn't setting the best example. Besides, if she was *really* crazy, she could have rammed the passenger side of my car trying to get in. Or any number of other possibilities. But then one can't go through life trying to account for other people's unpredictability. What do you think?\n\nTL;DR: Teen tried to cut in line, I wouldn't let her, she freaked out. Also, all of this happened in cars in a drive thru.",

      "description": "So this story started about a year ago, you, me and my friend, who i'll call Matt, love games. We really like playing them together and we enjoy making fun of each other for being bad at them. Eventually we started this stupid inside joke where wee'd call each other a \"posh commoner\" if we sucked at a game. It was dumb, but it was also funny. We did this back and forth on multiple games, and whenever i'd call him a posh commoner, he'd laugh. So I thought all was well. I was wrong. We started playing another game at one point, and I was doing a lot better, so I did the joke where I'd say he was a posh commoner.\n\nExample of joke:\n\nMe: How many items do you have?\n\nMatt: Two.\n\nMe: Agh! Posh commoner doesn't even have ten! Posh!\n\nThat's and example, but this time when I did the joke , he got angry and told me to stop, now of course I did, but he then went on this rant about how he had gotten sick of me telling the joke so much. The thing is, he laughed every time I did it! So how was I supposed to know? He had said stop before, but he would follow it up by calling me a posh commoner, so I never took him seriously. So, am I the asshole for telling the joke so much?",

Apparently he had not invited her over and didn't know she was coming and had got into the house because i forgot to lock the back door. A month later she called me crying about how sorry she was and begging me to forgive her. I told her i was never forgiving her before hanging up she then proceeded to call and text me begging for forgiveness forcing me to block her number. Along with being a huge bitch she is an drug user and spends any money she has on drugs even stealing eighty dollars from me and she had a dog that i suspect she might have killed due to her abusing the poor thing then it just disappearing one day and i just don't see her as someone i could forgive no matter what she did. Just for clarity my mom gave me up to my grandpa when i was bore due to not having enough money to take care of me and has refused to get a job and uses any money she guilts my grandpa into giving to her for drugs and as far as i know is currently homeless.

      "title": "AITA for asking a former co worker on a date (I think she's afraid of me now)?",
      "description": "I think this is going to be a bit of a long post, so sorry for that, I just want to provide as much context as possible.\n\nThroughout my undergrad/highschool I never had the confidence to ask women on dates, however I have had a girlfriend and have been with a few other women, I had just never made the first move (girls would either kiss me at a party or ask me to hang out). Last summer I worked with this woman who was absolutely beautiful (like the most attractive person I have ever seen in real life), I wasn't really interested in her initially because a close friend had past away (in hindsight I was probably depressed). Near the end of last summer I started talking to her and realized she was actually incredibly cool so I asked her on a date (for the first time ever), though I didn't explicitly use the word date and looking back at it now I think she might have thought I just wanted to spend time together platonically. What happened was were just speaking after work and she told me a really cool story about what she did that past weekend and I kinda thought (in my head) \"fuck, she's actually awesome I want to get to know her better\" so I said \"lets go get ice-cream and go for a walk Wednesday\", she said she couldn't Wednesday but asked if we could hangout Friday after work instead. I'm mentioning this all because I thought the fact that she wanted to spend time with me one on one, just hanging out and not doing anything specific, made me think that there was a solid chance that she was attracted to me last summer, furthermore she definitely did a couple things throughout our three months together that to me seemed flirty. We ended up not getting ice-cream on Friday, and I took her canceling on me as her not liking me; I only found out this past summer through a friend that she actually had a legit excuse (family emergency). About a week after her canceling that \"date\" (not really a date I guess, I just wanted to get to know her better before leaving) I flew across the country for my senior year of university. We spoke a little on Facebook, her apologizing for not being able to get ice-cream and telling me we should when I get back in town which again I took as a bit of a good sign (she reached out to me, not the other way).\n\nFast forward 13 months to a week ago and I run into her on the way to class (I'm going to grad school and she's in her senior year at the same college). I'm hugely embarrassed about how I acted, but I here it is. We both are in a meeting together (brief meet up from our internship, not really important to this story) and then I leave to head to class, she calls out my name and I stop so we can walk together. We make casual small talk about what out plans are and then get into an elevator together (I totally recognize that this is the worst place to corner a woman and ask her on a date and what I did was pretty uncool).\n\nI kinda just phase out for about 1-2 seconds looking at her, I know its a clique to say that I got lost in her eyes, but thats honestly what happened.\n\nShe looks at me and says \"what?\"\n\nIt just kinda slipped out and I said \"We should go on a date\". I wasn't planning on saying that, but I did.\n\nSurprisingly she didn't say yes or no instead she just said \"Why?\".\n\nThis was a total curveball for me and at the time I didn't know what to say so I said maybe the worst possible thing, which was \"Well I'm going to be back in \\[city name\\] for the next little while\". What I was trying to say was that I thought she was attractive in every possible way, and that now that we will both be living in the same city long term (instead of me just being there for my summer breaks) I would like to get to know her better.\n\nThen she said \"Well I guess we could meet for coffee\", but the way she said it made it sound like she was somewhat uncomfortable/ didn't really want to to.\n\nI didn't want to put her in an awkward position so I just said \"No worries, just take it as a compliment\"\n\nThen a couple more people got in the elevator and I just kinda stared of into space, looked at the time and said something irrelevant like \"well, sorry you're going to be late for class\" and she responded awkwardly with something like \"its fine\".\n\nAs soon as I got out of the elevator I was full of regret, she had told me that she had never been in a relationship the previous summer, and being as pretty as she was I would imagine she would have to turn down guys every week. I started to think (and spoke to a friend about this) that she was probably just feeling awkward about me asking her on a date and that she wanted to get to know me a little better than going on what I imagine would have been her first \"date\", especially considering that I hadn't spoke to her for more than two hours over the past year.\n\nThe bright side was I new that I would run into her the next day, so I thought really hard about what I was going to say. I was going to say something along the lines of \"I'm sorry for surprising you like that, you know as well as anyone that I don't have much of a filter sometimes, if you're still interested coffee would be nice.\"\n\nBut when I tried to talk to her, maybe the worst possible thing happened. Her and I plus three others were talking at a work thing (little thing for all the past interns again, not really important).\n\nI lightly touched her on the arm and said \"can we talk for a second?\" and she said \"No.\".\n\nAgain this was totally surprising and I didn't know what to think, I still can't understand why she wouldn't give me a minute (in a public place) to just let me briefly clear the air.\n\nSo then I said \"I just wanted to say sorry\" and she said \"its ok\" and I said \"I'll see you around\" and left.\n\nA week later I saw her at a conference, I didn't approach her and she didn't approach me (obviously). I don't think I will ever see again (outside of in passing).\n\nTLDR: Asked a girl I knew on a date, she said \"why?\", I decided to reject her offer to meet for coffee, I approached her a week later and I think she's afraid of me now.\n\nSorry for the essay, I do feel bad about this, I would appreciate if the criticism could stay constructive.",

      "description": "I (14M) live with my autistic brother (17M). He's usually not that bad. He functions relatively normally but it's noticable that he's a little different. However sometimes he has these violent meltdowns. He usually just screams at the top of his lungs and flails around a lot. Sometimes he tries to destroy stuff or hurt himself.\n\nHere's the thing: every time he has one of his meltdowns I can't help but at least crack a smile. I don't know exactly why. There's just something absurd about a 1,96m 17 year old wildly flaling around and having a tantrum like a ballistic toddler, picking up stuff but being too scared to destroy it because mommy would be mad. Or maybe it's the fact that it's so *stupid*. He gets mad over the smallest thing he can't have his way...like a toddler.\n\nI know that there is nothing funny about autism. I've lived with him long enough to know that. He most likely won't be able to get a job and nobody knows what to do with him. It puts a lot of stress on my parents and everyone around him. But despite this...I kinda enjoy his meltdowns. I try to hide it and just listen from a distance but still, AITA?",

This has made my life difficult in many ways, I have a hard time talking to people , especially if the situation is confrontational. I've also been good friends with a girl since the first grade, that we'll call her Amy. Many people find her annoying since she is so talkative. So, one day during a class I was sitting next to some people who weren't very fond of Amy. They started making fun of her and the way she talked. I couldn't find my voice to stand up for her so I just stayed silent. Amy was sitting at the table over with a friend of hers and they overheard everything and saw that I didn't say anything. She ignored me for the rest of the day, but when the day was over and we were leaving school, she came up to me with the same friend. They asked me why I didn't stand up for her and I told her that I couldn't find my voice to speak up. When they heard that they raised their voices at me and started to tell me that I used my anxiety as an excuse and I should just get over it. I was hurt to hear that and I didn't know what to do so, I told the entire story to some of my personal friends and they were furious. They later picked a fight with Amy, and she was enraged, she asked me why I would tell anyone about the encounter, I told her that I was hurt and I needed to talk to someone. She told me to get fucked and she hasn't talked to me since. I can understand why she would be annoyed at me, but what I don't understand is why she was so furious. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "This happened nearly a year ago but I am still suffering from repercussions hence I would like a bit of help.\n\nWe were final year college students and needed 30 hours of community service to get our degree. This is something everyone in our college had to do. Our college had some regulated services(teaching underprivileged children, helping out old age homes etc) which i enrolled myself in and she, despite warnings from me enrolled herself in an non-governmental organization with some of her other friends. \n\nHowever a month later, the other friends reported to a senior member of the non-governmental organization that she was actually not doing any work and got her fired. Coming to think of it, I supported her through that period but I am pretty sure that she actually did not do any work.\n\nAnyway she enrolled herself in the program I was in and we went out for two of the visits together. Since I was working before she joined, I completed my 30 hours by the 2 visits and she asked me to go to the last one.\n\nNow I would have gone, but these visits took up an entire day. Leave at 5am, return home at 5pm. Plus the travelling is the worst part where I had to literally travel 6-7 hours through muddy roads and farms. And thirdly my younger cousin's(5 y.o) birthday was on that day who just lost his mother and there was no way I was leaving him.\n\nI told her all of this and she listened calmly and then asked me to go fuck myself since I was never her true friend. I backed off thinking that she'll get back and it's going to be alright. However she stopped talking entirely to me and filled up my friends with stories about how she \"nearly died\" on that trip. I asked the trip coordinator, my other friends who went with her and nothing of that sort happened. Absolutely nothing.\n\n\nNow everytime we meet up, if she and I disagree on anything, she leads with, \"Oh well, I almost got killed on that trip which YOU did not want to come with me due to your selfish desires, so obviously you don't care about me...\".\n\nBetween friends it was cool once or twice and I shrugged it off, but now some of my other friends texted me and told me that what I did was wrong and she shouldn't have done that.\nI repeatedly asked her what happened on that trip but she always answers with,\"You won't understand. You are not a girl\".\n\nTo make it worse we have been friends from nearly the start of college and I helped her with a lot of stuff. I went apartment hunting with her, was on the receiving end of her long drawn out stories about her (ex)boyfriend, about her other female friends and whatnot and TBH I really cared about her but this incident has really crushed me.\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nI am sorry for the grammar, English is not my first language.",

      "description": "My dog is a little tiny 13 year old chihuahua, and she’s a very sweet dog. She loves to cuddle and lay next to you and she has never hurt anyone or anything. One of our family friends stopped by for a second to say hi, and they sat down on the couch and then his mother started talking to me. In the middle of the conversation this toddler picked up a pillow and threw it very hard at my dog. She obviously wasn’t expecting this, and fell over.!I immediately stood up and checked to see if she was ok, she’s old and fragile and we don’t want to see her get hurt. I said “now might be a good time to get going, (brother) and I have to get something done”. His mother got very defensive and started saying stuff like “he doesn’t know any better” “it didn’t hurt her” and “you’re over reacting”. Thankfully at this time the toddler said “are we going mommy?”, and his mother said “yes, it’s time to go (toddler’s name). \n\nFor anyone wondering, my dog is ok. I’ll pay the dog tax firsthand. https://i.imgur.com/colBSlZ.jpg\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "Let's start at the very beginning.\n\nA couple of months ago, I decided I was gonna wear a dress and heels to the Homecoming dance. So one of my super close friends lets me borrow a dress and a pair of shoes. I've known this friend literally my entire life. One of the jokes about me is that I act kinda dumb sometimes because (and this did happen) she kicked me in the head from inside the womb. \n\nFast forward to now, and I still have the dress and shoes. She got a boyfriend (more on him later), and is doing well. Until Christmas break rolls around. Over break, she posted something on her Snapchat story. It said something along the lines of, \"Everybody's fake, my only friends are...\" and then listed 4 or 5 people she talks to. This immediately sparks a reaction from several of her friends, including me. We point out the fact that every time she gets a new boyfriend, she gets too busy shoving her tongue down his throat to talk to us. Her current boyfriend is nearly 17 and is *still a freshman*.\n\nAll of our mutual friends, myself included, have stopped talking to her altogether. She doesn't try to talk to us, and this is fine. So one day, she has one of my friends tell me she wants her dress back. I say no, and that if she wants her stuff back she'll have to ask me herself. Then she goes and has her mom text my mom asking that I give her stuff back. I tell my mom what's going on, and she's on my side.\n\nAs of writing this post, we still aren't talking, she blocked my on Snapchat, and I still have the dress. But I miss her, and I really want to have her back in my life, even if none of my other friends do. Am I an asshole for keeping her things?",

      "description": "I’m a senior in college and I live with three roommates in an apartment. We’ve just finished the semester so normally all four of us would go home for winter break, and the apartment would sit empty. However, if one so chooses our college offers a winter term where you can pay to take sprint classes that last the duration of the break.  One of our roommates announced the other day that he plans upon staying over winter break to take a class, because he won’t be working so he thinks he would be bored otherwise. Naturally, this would mean keeping the cable/internet on as well as keeping the apartment much warmer than what we would leave it on were it to sit empty. Because of this, we asked this roommate if he would pay the cable/internet for that month (as nobody else would be there to use it, and we could otherwise shut it off if he weren’t there) as well as 50% of the electricity as opposed to his usual 25%. He did not take us even asking well at all. He essentially threw a tantrum, claiming that it was unfair for us to ask this of him and that he had signed up for the class under the assumption that we would split the bills evenly despite not being there (keep in mind, he could simply drop the class). So now he’s saying that he’s just going to commute instead of staying of winter term (biting off his nose to spite his face), which will be a way bigger hassle for him than it would be to just eat the $150 and be a five minute walk away from class. Are we assholes? It seems to us that our request was totally reasonable, and that our roommate was basically banking on all of us footing the bill for him to sit around over break. ",

      "description": "I have a friend (though, more of an acquaintance) in my group that has relatively high-functioning autism. He can be fun company most of the time, but he has this fixation with height. He's very proud of his own height (6'1) and loves to jokingly bring it up a lot - like pointing out how much taller he is than other people, or how short other people are in general, in a kind of gleeful way. He does this pretty constantly. We mostly just act amused by it, though it can get a bit tired.\n\nI have achondroplastic dwarfism, and I'm only 4ft tall as a result. I've gotten to a point were I'm content with my height, and I'm pretty relaxed about it. But, as you can imagine, my friend is all over this. He likes pointing out how short I am, or how I need to do things differently (like getting on chairs to reach things and such) but it has never crossed the point that I've found it offensive. I've just found it mildly irritating and a bit awkward. So I've never vocalised feeling uncomfortable about it.\n\nThe other day, I was heading to a lecture (that my friend was also going to), but I had missed the memo that the room had been changed, and that the lecture was taking place at the other end of the building. My friend, seeing an opportunity, comes up behind me (in the middle of the busiest corridor) cheerfully saying *\"Oh no you don't!\"* as if I was a misbehaving child, and yanks me off my feet, starting to carry me in the opposite direction. Everyone is staring and I feel my face flush red with humiliation. I *hate* being picked up, let alone without any warning. Something snaps and I twist myself out of his grip, making him drop me, and I turn around, losing my shit. \"WHAT THE FUCK! DON'T *EVER* DO THAT!...The fuck is *wrong* with you!?\" He looks nonplussed, and starts stuttering a defence about me going the wrong way. I don't listen and I storm off. I sit on the other side of the room during the lecture and avoid seeing him for the rest of the day. \n\nHis girlfriend (and our mutual friend) comes to me later in the day telling me he's sorry. \n\nAm I an asshole for snapping at him like that? I'm thinking I should have set clearer boundaries beforehand, and expressed that I don't like people picking me up. I was really fucking mad at him, and I know he was just trying to make a joke. But..yeah. I feel kind of bad about how intense I was. It went 0 to 100 pretty fast.",

      "description": " (Backstory) It all started 6 months ago. My aunt moved into my house because her father passed away. She didn't wanna be alone for that and it helped alot for her to be around family. During this time period I had to give up my bed for her and sleep on a matress. This is were the first fight happened.  She started to verbally  assault me so I got  mad and  stopped talking to her. Then the next day she was going to the university to study for her  medical exam  and asked me if I needed a ride . I politely declined  and said I would take the bus . This set her off , she  started to yell at me loudly  saying that if I hold grudges that long that I was gonna be a failure at life and bunch of other stuff. So I stayed quiet through this whole ordeal and kept my mouth shut. After she slammed the door and left my mom came to me. She demanded I say sorry to her. I got super confused and demanded why should I ? I didn't say anything wrong I kept my mouth shut. My mother then said that I should just apologize because I'm younger. well I did at the time  I did  apologize( now I regert it). Then the summer  trip happens, all of my cousins and family decided to go camping .  Fast forward a couple days into the trip all of  our  cousins are sitting around the fire bored out of there minds. I start to suggest game ideas  everyone is saying nah not that. Then my aunt chimes in and says that I should kill myself . Everyone  around the campfire stops and looks at her dumbfounded . I just quietly sit there for Abit and then retreat back into my tent without saying a word. A couple of days roll by and we all go home. \n\nNow about a week ago I'm sitting at home watching my TV shows doing nothing . My mom forces me to go with my aunt shopping. So my aunt asks for the location  of the store from me. I say location A is where  I think it is at. So we drive to location A and it turns out I got it mixed up. It was  somewhere else .My aunt goes off on me saying that I can't do the simplest things in life and I'm a failure . I decided to phone my brother to confirm the location . While  I am phoning my brother my aunt in the background is talking mad shit about me.  So I politely tell her ` excuse me I'm on the phone.` This sets her off and she starts to yell at me full on telling me to kill myself repeatedly. I've never felt such anger towards a person so I snapped and said why don't you shut the fuck up. I plug in my head phones and ignore her for the rest of the ride . When we get home she goes to her room and slams the door really hard. My mom comes to me and asks what happened. I calmly explain the situation to her and she then tells me to apologise. She says it's because I swore at her and she is way older than me.  Am I an asshole  for swearing back at my aunt ? \n\nTldr: My aunt gets mad and tells me to kys. I get mad and tell her to shut the fuck up.",

      "description": "Im a college student and games are my main source of entertainment. I usually play single player games but I enjoy playing with others too. I usually play on my PC and PS4, but my friends C and H play on Xbox and have been telling me to get one to play with them for the longest, so I splurged on Christmas and got one to play with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom since I got my Xbox up to this week I've had to initiate any game sessions with my friends and it wasnt often since we each have our own responsibilities. They have another group of people they play with and tell me they are \"always on\" but they really arent. This week H told me to download a new free to play game so the three of us could play together, we  did on Monday and I had a lot of fun. H said we could play again after he got off of work the next day, but then later clarified that he got off of work at 1 am, so I waited for him only for him  until 2 am but he was tired and  wanted to go to bed, which I 100% understand and wasn't mad about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday at around 8:30 he said he would be on to play, C said he would be ready in 30 min and H said he had a quick errand to run. So I waited, and then 10:30 rolled around and I asked where H was, he said he was running errands and would be back home soon. Another hour passed and I was tired but still excited to play, so I asked him again what was happening and he told me to get online. I got in a party with C and H and asked for an invite to their session, they told me to wait because they were in the middle of a game. I said something along the lines of \"You told me to get on and started without me?\" and C admitted that they had already played 2 rounds of the game before inviting me to the party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I turned my Xbox off and went to bed. H tried to invite me to the party again and I said no, I was pissed off that I had been waiting around for 3 hours fighting off sleep only for them to start without me. C jumped in to poke fun at H for pissing me off but I told him \"Fuck you too\", as I had been talking to him while I was waiting for H to return and he didn't tell me they were playing either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit that I'm not good at first person shooters and they carried me when we played, and I understand that they would want to play without me so they dont have to babysit me while I learn, but I would have appreciated it if they told me thats what they wanted to do instead of having me wait around without saying anything, and it was the second time H has had me up late waiting around for him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for being pissed of at them for starting without me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; My friends had me waiting around for three hours to play a game then started without me, AITA for being mad at them",

      "description": "I became friends with D, through a mutual friend from our hometown, right before we left for college. We became best friends over freshman year, and decided to live in a house with 6 other people for our sophomore year. \n\nOur first few months living together was great, but D started getting into selling psychedelics and coke from the deep web. At first I was OK with it since I personally think psychedelics should be an experience everyone should be allowed to try, but I’m wholly aware that it is a Class I drug. I hope to work for government after graduation, and so i don’t want to be tangled up. Then the breaking point for me was when I woke up and there were like 6 randos in our bedroom buying from him! \n\nI had a talk with him, to investigate why he was doing this. His family pays for his college without aid and he has a part time job for disposable income, and he even admitted he was just doing this for fun (D’s parents are ex-military so they’re super strict when he was in their nest) and to make extra money. He seemed adamant he wasn’t doing anything wrong, and that he wouldn’t get caught up. Then I had two more talks to talk him, and I really couldn’t move him, not even to stop selling from our house. This was the moment where I kinda just gave up on the friendship.\n\nSo I told him we can’t be friends if he can’t drop that hobby. I started doing more things in school and other friends, to a point where I would only go home to sleep. We probably talked/saw each other 3 times in two months? \n\nAnyways, so it’s time for us to re-sign the lease. I know three of my housemates are living somewhere else, so I recruited some of my friends to take their spot. I explained them the situation with D and all told me they will not want to live with him because of his hobby (and that they also don’t know him).\n\nSo one day, I asked him if we can have a talk. I told him that he will not be included in next year’s lease because of his hobby. He got pissed off, because he doesn’t really have any other friends, and it’s relatively late in the cycle, so it’s hard to find open leases. I told him I’m sorry, but people don’t want to live with a drug dealer. \n\nHe then goes to the landlord, and tells him I’m kicking him out of the lease arbitrarily. I know because his dad (a lawyer) wrote a letter to the landlord that was forwarded to me. I talk to D, I told him I don’t want to do this, but I reminded him that if pushed, I will not hesitate to tell the landlord, and thus his dad, the actual reason why he’s getting kicked out. He falls back after that. \n\n\n\n3 months later, D (still living with us, and still not talking) gets caught up after he sold to a narc on campus. D is not sent to jail (his dad is a lawyer and I think personally, white privilege), but is kicked out of school and is out of a drug registry. I find out a few months later that D was telling high school friends I ratted him out (I absolutely did not). Some ppl from high school still don’t talk to me, oh well. \n\nAITA for kicking him out? Should I have not given up on him?",

He hasn't known her for long, and he's complained to me about issues in their relationship more frequently in the last couple months. However, he's the type of guy to make rash decisions and is a \"hopeless romantic\" (his words, not mine). I tried to talk some sense into him respectfully, and honestly, as none of his closest friends have actually met this girl, but a few others think he should do it. Now don't get me wrong, if he really wants do it, I support him, and he already asked me to be the best man which I'll gladly do. However, I'm kinda worried that he's making a big mistake jumping into marriage so soon, especially after having a super rough year.

      "description": "AITA for asking a direct report to turn down their music?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I realize this is probably not worth posting, but it's been bothering me for months whether I overstepped... This is my first year supervising a team of 3-4 people, in an open office, white collar setting (think cubicles for days) for a fairly large company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I asked someone who reports directly to me to turn down their music. Probably about half of the office listens to music while they work, with no problems. But this one guy would consistently crank his earbuds up to like 9,000 and turn up the most ludicrously shrill wailing I have ever heard in my life. I sit probably 8-10 feet away from this person (not adjoining cubicles) and it was just needling me all day. And frankly, it was super embarrassing to think my team was acting so unprofessionally in front of everyone else. (I know, that last part was me projecting, as no one else actually mentioned it- so it's a bit unfair to blame my response on their well being.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo on the second or third occasion I asked him to turn his music down, that it was disturbing me 10 feet away, and to please be mindful of the communal work environment. He did not take this well. Demanded to see a posted decibel level he was exceeding, and that my draconian ruling was applied equally to others in the office. (Namely that two people more senior than me will shout the occasional profanities to express frustration at bad news.) I didn't really have any response to that last bit, cause, well they're more senior and I would have absolutely no business policing their speech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole for asking this guy to turn down his music? My rationale for a quiet office space was definitely partially based on my own projections of not disturbing other people, and I did definitely only apply this rule to people under me (with the understanding that people more senior who've worked at this firm for 5 years definitely get more leeway on professionalism than an entry level employee -Which I will admit, is unfair.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot to color the judgement here, but the reason this has been bothering me is that the guy was later fired (not by me) for entirely justified reasons relating to sub-par work product. He later cited a poor relationship with his supervisor, which really got to me, as I spent an inordinate amount of my time fixing this guy's mistakes, walking him through fixes, and generally investing time into him. Looking back, this is the only incident I can recall where I may have overstepped... ",

      "title": "AITA for Telling My Wife She Has to Quit Her Job?",
      "description": "Throwaway because I don't want this anywhere near my regular account and this is going to require some backstory that will probably be recognizable to anyone that knows me. Buckle up kids, this is a rollercoaster.\n\nMy wife and I have been together for over two years, dating for about as long before that. About two and a half years ago, before we were married, we were having issues and I considered breaking up with her. We never really ended up taking a break, but during that time I ended up sleeping with another girl several times, even after getting back together with my now wife. My wife found out and was justifiably upset. I'm 100% the asshole here.\n\nShe forgave me, and said she wanted to be with me again, but I later found out that she had at least an emotional fling (she claims they never had sex because she was on her period) with a guy she met on a trip with some of her friends to another country. Then I found out that she had been messaging explicitly with her ex after she had decided to stay with me. Again she claims that nothing actually happened and from what I read of their text messages it's at least plausible that she didn't. Who knows, but at this point I guess we're both awful people regardless. \n\n\n\nA couple months ago I stupidly allowed the same girl from earlier back into my life and restarted my affair. My now wife found out and was justifiably upset.  Again definitely an asshole again, but my wife spent about a month deciding if she wanted to stay with me anymore. We have a house together, share friends, etc. It was a month of me doing everything I could to try to get her to stay with me, sleeping on the couch, letting her have her space, doing everything I could think of to try to win her trust back.\n\nThe whole time I had a feeling that something wasn't right, but I definitely wasn't in a position to place blame. Still, I couldn't ignore the feeling and one night I looked at the notification on her phone. There was a text from one of her coworkers which didn't raise too many red flags so I just convinced myself I was being paranoid. Until I asked her who she was talking to and she said it was one of her best girlfriends. Now there are more red flags then a Soviet Union military parade. I demand to see her phone, and after refusing several times she eventually gives it to me and I find out that she has been cheating on me with her coworker since before I reconnected with the girl. Surprise, we're both still shitty people and probably idiots for staying together too.\n\nSo now we get to the real reason for this post. As soon as I found out I told her that if we were going to stay together that she had to quit her job. She graduated college not that long ago and had a job that she really hated before this one. This is the first job she's had that she really enjoys and she does well at it and I know how much it means to her. She told me that the department that includes the coworker are supposed to be moving out of the building the first week on the new year which was a couple weeks after I found out. I told her she could stay if that was true. The week before transfer time she told me that the plan had changed and that department with her coworker would be staying. I also find out that she is still in a group chat with the guy and another female coworker after I told her she couldn't talk to him again. \n\nSo we're back to she has to quit. She asks if she can transfer to another location with the same company. I agree she can stay if she transfers to another location. Another two weeks go by because her boss isn't in the office, until we get to two weeks ago. She asks her boss for the transfer and her boss takes a week to get back to her and tells her it isn't possible to transfer. In this time I find out that she is still in the group chat as well.\n\nSo now the question at the top of this post. I gave her until this Friday to decide if we're going to stay together or if shes going to find work somewhere else. We are fine financially if she quits and I have even said that she can keep working for at least a couple weeks to start looking for another job. I feel like I've exhausted every other alternative and at this point I'm ready to accept whatever happens, even if it means losing my marriage if she decides to stay at her job. So am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR; I cheat, she cheats, I cheat again, she cheats with a coworker and I tell her she can't keep her job if she wants to stay with me. Details above.",

I get it and respect that not all girls want to have sex the first time they meet someone. We hookup again and when I try to move down she stops me saying she doesn’t like penetration. Weird but okay I’m not gonna make any advances that she’s not comfortable with. Sex is something casual and fun for me and I like to be involved when pleasuring someone. But with her all it is is her giving me a bj and then getting herself off. It’s boring and my lack of involvement makes me not want to continue. I tried breaking things off by just saying I wasn’t interested in pursuing anything further bc I just got out of a relationship (which is true) and didn’t want to start anything serious. She then sent like 5 walls of text saying that she doesn’t have feelings for me, that she thought we were just having fun, and I was really good at making her cum. First off the wall of texts was a big red flag since I only met up with this girl a couple of times, and secondly if I barely get to touch her how am good at making her cum. Sex is something passionate but when I’m just laying there while she gets herself off there is no passion. Am I the asshole or would I be the asshole if I told her I didn’t want to continue because of the sex? I don’t want to hurt this girls feelings or pressure her into having sex but if I can’t do anything And not really enjoying it I’d rather not continue.",

      "description": "I live in Australia, and I have a lot of days where depression hits me where I don't wanna leave my house. But that's not why. I don't want to go outside because it's too fucking hot.  \nThese Summer holidays, I've been going outside a lot more than I wanted to, because I've been seeing people I haven't kept in touch with for months or years.  \n\nAnd to tell the truth, with a few select of these people, I'm not really interested in getting close and they don't seem to get the message. But I don't have the guts to cut contact or say I'm not particularly interested in being friends.  \n\nBut that's a different story - I have friends I do wanna maintain a geunine friendship with, but I'm getting physically and mentally tired of going outside constantly because it's too hot.  \n\nI'll usually exercise in the morning at home, take a shower and then I'm done for the day. I don't want to do anything else. I don't like the effort of getting ready to go outside. I don't like sweat. The air in my house is already dry so even if outside is cool, I'll come back to feel my skin lose all the moisture I just had. My house is also too tiny to have a lot of people in.  \n\nI explained to some of my friends about this and they said, \"I like the heat either but I want company. I like the company.\"  \nAnd then I feel bad because I geuninely don't need people as strongly as others do. Yes I like company, but I am too comfortable being on my own. Half of the people I'm friends with are lonely and don't have other friends, or I'm one of two of their friends. I like to think it's because I grew up barely seeing my single parent due to their work so I don't really know how to crave for company unless I'm in love. But even if in love, I'm a very independent person. I'm happy to talk with friends online and don't really require seeing them physically.  \n\nI just feel bad because my reasons are very minor, and I have difficulty relating to my lonely friends who tell me they're lonely.",

      "description": " \n\nWell, possibly bit of a long post, so beware. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI  suffer from tinnitus along with some other symptoms that have been  getting worse lately. It's been about two years for tinnitus, but other  symptoms have crept up in the past little while. One of those is what  doctors are telling me is depersonalization disorder so my brain can  handle the tinnitus, which is apparently common.\n\nThe  feeling is near unbearable sometimes and it puts me on edge most of the  time. Stress makes it worse, fighting makes it worse. All in all, I'm a  total wreck with this right now and no fun at all to be around.\n\nMy  girlfriend has been intensely supportive during this time. She's come  to the hospital with me, she's been a really great support. However,  because of the heightened stress levels, we are fighting a ton more.  Well, this morning I said something she didn't like and we just sort of  got into this massive row. When we fight, my symptoms get a crap ton  worse and I turn into a jerk.\n\nSo, I told  her that I need a bit of space. Just some time to get a handle on my  own mental health problems. I feel that if I don't do this, our  relationship is going to end up going to hell and it'll never get  better. I told I'm just going to sleep in the basement and do my own  thing for like two weeks. And in the end, the intended result is for me  to be better able to function. She's not happy about it, but she  accepted.\n\nWe bought a house together, we  adopted pets together, we have a life that we are fully planning on  building together. I still love her and she still loves me.\n\nCurrently,  she's crying upstairs. I'm just sort of.. letting it happen because I  don't think it's the best idea for me to go console her when we've just  agreed that this is what we're doing. She has abandonment issues and she  wants to know what scope of our distance is going to be. I've said that  I have to figure that out and I'll get back to her sometime today.\n\nAm  I the asshole for saying that we need some time apart? Am I a jerk for  thinking of myself? Am I an asshole for not being more attentive to her  mental issues?\n\nTL:DR  I want some time away from the girlfriend for my mental health because  we argue. Not sure if that makes me the asshole or not. This is a  terrible tl;dr.",

His anxiety got the best of him and was left by his fiancé and he had a breakdown and quit his job and got addicted to anti depressants. Around this time my parents became and I started making payments on their house and car. Along with making payments on his car so he could have it when he does figure things out and can get back on track. Fast forward about 6 months and promises that he’s going back to work all my savings were drained and he lost his car and continued in his spiral.  I continue talking with him and trying to get him in counseling and gave recommendations through contacts Iv made on my job to no avail. \nNow a year and a half later and my savings partly recovered he calls and asks will you co-sign my car loan (at one of those high interest no credit check dealerships) (and he also stated that he was ready to sign mine when I bought my first car though I didn’t end up needing it) so he can get his life back on track, I told him this is not something I can do I can’t put my name on that loan when I can’t trust that your serious about getting back to work but I can help with a taxi or something till you build up enough to buy a cheap car to get you to work consistently.  I thought this was a reasonable response but I haven’t heard from him in 6 weeks he blocked my calls and stated he did not want anything to do with me anymore. \nI am starting to think I was a big asshole by not helping him get back on track and considering writing him a letter saying that I will sign. \nThanks for listening ",

      "description": "Last year we had our daughters 3rd Birthday (bout a year ago). We decided to do it on a Sunday night (6pm) at a local restaurant. I was called by my mother a week or so prior and was told that she wasn't going to be able to attend as she worked the next day and with the drive (90 mins) it was a bit late for her. I told her that was fine. She was going to be babysitting for us maybe a week so she could se her then. \n\nOn my daughters Birthday we video called my mum and she said that she had a small party planned for her with cake and decorations. i told her no. I don't want my daughter having multiple birthdays multiple cakes and I believe that this can lead to kids getting a sense of spoiled entitlement. I don't believe in make up events.\n\nMy mum got very offended with this. Said that we excldued her from the event as we knew that she would not be able to make this time we set of 6pm with work the next day. Thing is, we put it on the sunday night as it was the only time I could get when EVERYONE could theoretically make it. We eventually got over it a few weeks later.\n\nThen we come to now. Next event is easter. I'm a shift worker and on night shift ending with me finishing at 7am on easter morning. Partner said that we should just do a dinner at our place, she would cook a roast and invite our parents and sisters. I said fine and sent out a message saying to come for dinner.\n\nFew days latter mum messaged me asking if it could be an lunch instead as dad was flying back at 7pm and were a hour from the airport. I've messaged back the following \n\"I'm not sure whta time dinner will be ready but I don't think itll work earlier than 5:30. that sounds too late, you guys are of course welcome to come earlier. And we can have some snacks and stuff\"\n\nfew days later she told me she doesn't think that they're going to make it. I asked why and she said that it was a long way to drive and that I should have a good think about who's getting excluded at these events.\n\nI've told her I was on night shift finishing early that morning and thats why I didn't want a big event at my house that early but she just told me to think about who was getting excluded again (I assume she was refering to my daughters Birthday)\n\nI really don't think im excluding anyone. Yes I'm sad that Dad can't come due to his work but its impossible to fit everyone in sometimes when he's down for 1/4 weeks. I do try to come down when my roster permits while he's down (though when i spoke to him he didn't mention it so I don't even know if he minds as such). I put it on easter's date and I put it at the time we could do. I don't really know what else I could do. \n\nI guess I could have messaged around to see what times work for everyone but If I put it at lunch time id be finishing work and getting maybe 3 hours sleep or so before I was up helping get everything ready....dinner means I get a decent sleep and still help.\n\nAITA for not making this a lunch?\n",

Gary is in a wheelchair and threw a fit and threatens to quit id he doesnt get an office.  They are awarded by sales volume. I earned 4th office but am not getting it because he says he requires it. The cubicles are so much easier for someone wheelchair accessible. The office is actually in convenient because even though it's wide enough you have to open three doors to get to the office. I saw him rolling around in the cubicle and he was kind of feeling it out. I bet he begs to switch if he can get past his pride.

I'd say we are more than friends because it's very flirty, we go on what I would consider \"dates,\" we sleep in the same bed after going out and on and on. In fact in light of what just happened, I'd say he led me on big time.\n\nSo just had a conversation at 3am after binge watching one of my favorite Netflix series that I thought it was time we take the relationship to the next level. He told me that he was happy just being friends. I said I wasn't and wanted more. He said that he just wasn't into a relationship with me. I said he had to to better than that. He said he hated to hurt my feelings and that he's just not attracted to girls who don't work out. I asked him if he meant because I'm fat. He said yes. I told him he was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever met and to leave. Since he left I've been spamming him and his Facebook with memes from my favorite bloggers like \"if you can't handle my size, maybe you don't have the tools for the job.\" \n\nHe finally clocked me but before doing that he said I was a huge asshole for making him feel like shit for his \"natural desires.\" I told him he sucked but I guess he didn't see it.

And know I am considering giving him money behind her back, in order to get more “Alone” time with him. \n\nBackstory: \n\nMy girlfriend (F24) and I (M24) have been together for 5 years and have more or less shared economy.   \n I am the youngest of 4.   \n 1 brother (Called B) and to sisters (there need no name for this)   \n She is a single child.   \n \n\nNow to the story: B and I have a very close relationship even though there are more than 10 years between us, B dos not have as stable economy as my girl find and I do, do to some mental hurdles which he has more or less passed now but in this down time he did end owing me (and there for my girlfriend) more than 228 dollars.   \n In the beginning we were training together but it stop since he could not pay for the bill at the local gym.   \n I missed these times and therefore I gave him without my girlfriend knowledge 200 Dollars to transferee to my girlfriend as if he wished to pay off some of his debt, (to be fair this was some money my girlfriend did not know I was in possession of had she known she would have used diffidently like adding to our saving of 4,565 dollars or a trip to a hotel or a diner of some sorts.)  So she would not get mad, about him starting at the gym and not paying off his debt.   \n I am now considering paying for half of my brother gym membership behind her bag in order to get my sparring buddy back.   \n I have talk about this with her but she think it is better to lent him the money and let him pay us back when he is done with his education, where I disagree and just want to spend time with my Brother, and I am not interested in drowning him in debt, but simply getting the time we both used to enjoy together back.   \n (I make more than my girlfriend even though that should not really matter in this dilemma)  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry english is not my first language ",

      "description": "So I work a job where I walk a lot.  I'm also a cheap bastard that buys cheap shoes at Walmart. I wear these shoes everyday to work and also when exercising.  As you could guess, they leave quite a stench when I get home, pop them off, and relax. I can smell them stinking up the room right now but I really don't mind it much.\n\nSo here's the issue, I live with my girlfriend and she hates my stinky feet.  She gets home from work about an hour after I get home (schedule varies), and once the waft of my feet hits her nose, she demands I wash my feet.  Here's the thing though; I feel for her, I really do.  I would wash my feet but I'm tired when I get home and I just want to relax.  Washing my feet requires me to prop up my foot in the bathroom sink and do some one-legged acrobatics while I scrub between the toes.  I don't always have the energy for that but I also hate bothering her with my stink feet.\n\nSometimes I do it, and sometimes I don't.  I mean it's stinky at first but then I get use to it, I just wanna sit down and watch some Yu-Gi-Oh man, so AITA?",

She doesn’t respond to me and I proceeded to assume I got stood up. About 3 hours later I sent a text that said\n\n&gt;hey just flat out, I’m kinda hurt you stiffed me. I would’ve been cool if something came up or even if you just didn’t want to go. But next time tell the guy ✌️\n\nShe responded after about 20 minutes saying she didn’t stand me up but simply fell asleep, and that I didn’t need to get defensive. She’d been up since early in the morning and crashed. I apologized and tried to explain that from my end it looked like she simply ignored me. She stopped responding to me after that and we haven’t talked since. AITA?\n\n",

      "description": "I have been living with my roommates Karen and Natalie in a three bedroom place for the last 6 months without much of any conflict. Our lease continues through August and we had already planned on living in our current place through August of 2020. We live in a college town which means property management companies start advertising properties in January and February, so to secure our unit for 2019-2020 term we had to renew our lease in January. \n\nNatalie is graduating this year and is not renewing to live with us for the 2019-2020 year which we have known from the beginning and agreed to which is all fine. Now, Karen has decided that she suddenly wants to transfer schools and will no longer be here for the 2019-2020 year. This transfer is not so she can change majors, it is to a different campus under the same school and the classes are 90% the same. She does not have friends or family that lives out there so it's not to be closer to them. Rent is also a lot more expensive in this new city she is moving to, so this move is not about saving money either. She has joked that she's moving to this new city so she can eat chicken  from this one food cart every day. This idea for her to transfer came up only a couple weeks ago after we made a day trip to the city that the other campus happens to be in.  \n\nI am frustrated with this because Karen on multiple occasions made it clear that she was going to live here even through 2020-2021 and we have already renewed our lease for the next year. I brought this up with Karen and she does not think this is an issue because she can just find a person to sublet. While this is true, I feel like it is unfair to leave me to live with two strangers and try to get them to pay rent and utilities on time when I had agreed to live with Karen specifically. Our roommate Natalie had been a craigslist rando, but it was fine because I knew I had Karen to help cover rent or bills in case Natalie turned out to be a flake. Now I might be living with two total strangers who may or not pull through on paying rent and being clean and good roommates for seemingly no reason. Am I just overreacting and being an asshole right now?",

I am aware that everyone deals with their mental health in different ways and that people express their difficulties differently. \n\nBut I have one particular girl in my immediate group of friends who to me seems very clueless about how common mental struggles are. In the past when me and another friend had told her about some of our friends and ourselves and the extent of their/our mental health issues, she was very surprised and said she \"had no idea\". \n\nShe often goes on various rants at school about how bad her mental state is and doesn't seem to have very much regard for how it sounds to myself and others who are struggling. While I do not think someones struggles should be belittled at all I find it extremely grating when she says things like \"I need to take a mental health day on Friday\" because she has had an increase in her workload. Just the other day she said she felt deliriously happy despite the fact that she had been having a rather rough week. She said she felt like she \"was in a depressive episode but was currently experiencing a 'happy depression'\" which really pissed me off. \n\nShe has done similar things for majority of the year, AITA?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend's mom is one of those neurotic, paranoid panicky kind of people. Anytime there's something that she doesn't know or doesn't go exactly to plan it's because the worst possible thing happened to cause it. This includes if a door to outside is left even slightly ajar and she doesn't see her dog sitting at the doorway watching whoever is outside. Immediately a \"OMG WHERE IS &lt;dog&gt;?! When's the last time anyone has seen her?!\" echoes throughout the house and massive passive aggressive mode if we don't drop what we're doing to look and call for the dog. 9/10 she's sitting by the door to the backyard looking out through the screen door in the sun or sleeping under gf's mom's bed.   \n\n\nAnyway, I was mowing the lawn, watering the flowers, sweeping the driveway as per her request (I have no problem doing this,it takes about 45 minutes if I stretch it out) and left the gate from the backyard to the front open as I brought the lawn mower, weed whacker, and the gas out. Unbeknownst to me her mom left her door to the backyard open for some reason, and when I'm bringing the gas back to the shed in the backyard she noticed that I didn't have to open the gate and immediately went into panic mode about the dog's whereabouts. But this time she also gave me an earful about being responsible/not being lazy, *this was all before she went inside to verify the dog was in fact missing*. But lo and behold we go inside and no sign of the pooch, so I actually start to get worried and feel kinda bad even though I don't know how I was supposed to know it would be outside. With a parting shot about maybe *someone paying attention* saw the dog walking down the street she leaves to go knock on the neighbors doors.\n\nIt's hot, I feel bad and pretty irritated so I go in the bathroom to splash some water on my face and think how long the gate was left unattended. While I wipe my face off I hear some scratches on what sounds like porcelain or ceramic and who's in the bathtub stretching like she maybe just woke up but the dog, who probably laid down to fall asleep cause the bathtub is cool. When I ask my gf if she used the bathroom last she told me that her mom had just put new towels in there maybe 10 minutes before she went outside to see the gate open. \n\nWhen her mom came back I offered to help look for another 15 minutes or so before I heroically found the dog safe and sound while making sure to ask while laughing, \"Haha who was the last person in the bathroom?\" My gf shot me a look and asked me afterwards if I put the dog in there, and confirmed no I didn't I found her but being blamed for losing the dog made me have no qualms about letting her mom stress out a bit more. She thought it was kinda funny getting tired of her moms nonsense but called me an asshole.  \nSo am I the asshole?  \n",

I've always been pretty close to my uncle mostly due to our love to gaming and action figures.\n\nWhen I was young I used to go to his house (it was 1 house away from mine) to play on his beefy computer with the latest parts on the market. From 9 to 13 years old I went there weekly or even daily, he sometimes even gave me some action figures.\n\nFast forward to today, I have my own computer and my own consoles and don't go there to play anymore (rather my age then having a computer). He now has a 6 year old kid, and they often come to my house for family gathering and stuff. Now my cousin loves videogames and his dad incourages it. He always go directly into my room to play Spiderman in my ps4. Now I don't mind him playing, I just mind him ruining my stuff. He has already deleted a few saves of mine and broke almost all of the action figures my uncle (his father) gave me.\n\nThe last time he came here, I locked my bedroom with all my stuff in it. He was pretty sad and being a bratty kid with a bratty mom, his mom asked me to let him in. I didn't and the rest of the day the house was filled with anger towards me. When the guests left, my mom confronted me telling I was selfish because my uncle always let me play his games and I can't even one day. I tried to explain to her that I knew what I was doing back then and wouldn't delete his things or even break anything, but she still said that I was selfish.\n\nSo, AITA for not letting my cousin play with my stuff?",

The course is limited to a certain number of students.

The other person related to this, I'll call her Karen (for meme's sake) applied in the first round as well but got rejected. \n\nIn the second round, it was fairly simple to get in because most of the students booked courses that occupy the slots needed for this course. I didn't because I am lazy (going through uni in 3.5 instead of 3 years) and no idea why Karen didn't, anyways, she reapplied. This time I also applied because I realized that this would be a quick credit-grab and also rather interesting (I do a lot of programming in my free time). As said I'm *fairly good* with maths (i.e. 100% in both math courses I took), so I got in and Karen didn't. Now Karen is mad at me, saying I stole the course from her because I didn't even need it (she knows about the course I took before). AITA?",

      "description": "Hey,\nThanks for reading, I'm using a throwaway account because this isn't a great thing to be wondering and in all honesty I'm hoping to be the asshole in this scenario.\n\nAnyway brief backstory, my girlfriend and I have been together a while now and have a child together, I'm early thirties and she's mid twenties.\nShe has quite a heartbreaking backstory involving a few horrific things that she has trusted me enough to tell me. Although she has a tendency to defend the people who have caused her the greatest pain. \n\nAnyway back the original reason I'm here. My girlfriends relationship with her father is almost childlike in its nature. Anything he says is treated as gospel, we can have a conversation about anything and I can make a suggestion and I'm told I'm wrong only for him to make the same suggestion and it's the best suggestion since sliced bread. She's horrendously jealous about anyone who comes near him romantically, full on family feuds with his wife, girlfriend on the side etc. The wife by the way isn't her mum. For instance the other day we were at her mothers and she made a comment about him moving back to where originally came from would be good so that way no one hes currently romantically linked to could see him and he wouldn't be having relations with anyone. Everyone at the table kind of felt weird, you could tell.\nShe has never dated anyone who is of the same ethnicity as her dad, she's mixed race, for the exact reason that is would remind her of him. She still on a near daily basis with siblings on her side ensures that everyone knows she's the favourite and daddy's little princess. It's almost gets to me how it's obvious she holds him in higher regard than our own daughter. Not obviously, just little things like being obviously more excited for his birthday when I've had to make sure the moneys there for our daughters birthday as she hasn't planned ahead, marking the calendar with only his birthday etc. \nLast year we had to make the annual trip to where he lives to be with him on his birthday, which coincides with a major holiday, only for him to be out with whoever and when I said let's go home and celebrate said holiday with our family, we couldn't, we had to wait for him to come back? Why? I'm not saying hes out of order he may well have had plans and she didn't ring ahead but it's her attitude to all this I'm interested in this scenario.\n\nIs this normal? Am I reading into this too much? I genuinely don't know, its certainly not normal within my family but then different doesn't mean wrong.",

In a word he described himself as wanting to marry a successful, wealthy, \"mentally stable\"\n\nI on the other hand am extremely introverted and find myself only making connections with, well the opposite of what he described as being his ideal wife.\n\nThis may seem like extra info but it'll come in handy in the conflict.\n\nSo we were looking at houses and all rating the houses, my brother strictly said he only wanted to live in a gated community. I on the other hand didn't.  \n   \nMy reasoning: I know this whole post makes me sound like a rich special snowflake but hear me out. While in the non gated communities they spoke less English they were far nicer than the gated communities and I considered being immersed in the language an opportunity to learn, plus I don't really like suburbia since it's so compact and everyone's always trying to interact with you its all just too nosy. I don't like gated communities because to me it feels like a contract saying, I only want to be able to interact with the people who can afford to live here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother's reasoning: From what he told me, he said he needed to fulfill his social desires and the only way he could do that was by living in a compact community like that. He said he liked the people in the communities more than out actually in Puerto Rico and he especially liked that they could speak fluent English (?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe called me un-empathetic, (something he calls me a lot)  towards his needs and said since I rarely go outside it shouldn't matter to me where we live but it does matter to me and I like not having people all around. I understand he's an extrovert and only likes to hang out in certain crowds and I'm trying to be mindful of it.\n\n  \nEven though my dad's going to be the deciding factor in where we live I can't help but still feel bad about what my brother said to me, I didn't want to cause him any emotional distress, AITA?\n\nSorry for the long post",

I initially thought he would divorce his wife and they could continue their relationship like a official couple. The thing is, he didn't. \n\nMy friend absulutely hates the wife, is calling her names and makes fun of her behind her back. I usually defend the wife, (I don't know her, but feel really sorry for her) since she is the only victim in this mess. My friend absolutely delusionally believe that she is his \"one true love\". The guy has no intentions on getting a divorce and the wife knows nothing. They don't have any kids (yet) but its still just beyond shitty.\n\nMy problem is that, allthough my friend is as nice as usual to me, this situation just makes me dislike her. I feel that she is showing a shitty white-trash personality towards other people. My respect for both of them is gone. I feel guilt and anger everytime I see his poor wife in town. Both my friend and the guy has no moral problems with cheating and dont't seem to be bothered by any guilt. \n\nThe last two moths I simply don't answer the phone when she calls (she calls a couple of times a week and the conversation is usually about him being an asshole and me telling her to dump him). My plan is not really to ghost her. I just need to get my mind straight about why I'm dumping her.\n\nAm I the asshole for dumping a friend about something that is actually none of my bussiness?

      "description": "For context - I've been with my boyfriend for about 4 years and moved in with him a year ago. His parents own the building we are living in, which is a house that has completely separate apartments on each floor (common in our city). We live in the top apartment and BF's parents and younger brother live in the bottom apartment. We don't pay for anything towards the apartment except utilities because his parents are very well-off and won't take money from us.\n\nSo my issue is mainly with BF's brother. His brother is in college and comes home for summer/winter breaks. This means he's home sometimes for a few months. Obviously, he doesn't want to hang out with his parents so he comes up to our apartment to hang out and play games/watch tv. \n\nThe thing is, he's up in our apartment ALL THE TIME. Every day. He only leaves to go out with friends. Even when BF and I aren't home, his brother spends all day upstairs in our apartment. \n\nI understand that this is also his residence and that he'd rather hang out in the \"cool\" apartment away from the parents. I don't want to kick him out because he's family, but I have social anxiety and his presence affects my ability to \"feel at home\" in our apartment. I've briefly considered moving out because of the built up stress and inability to relax. He and my BF are also messy people who leave their stuff lying everywhere and I feel like I constantly need to clean up after them both. \n\nMy BF and I have gotten into pretty bad fights about this situation several times because he thinks I hate his family / am trying to alienate him from them while I try to explain my perspective. He knows my anxiety issues but continues to let his brother come around. \n\nAITA for wanting to create space between us and his family in a home that I don't even own? ",

      "description": "Okay, so, backstory: I volunteer with a youth organization. This weekend, we conducted a physical fitness test to help the youth in the unit I mentor complete a requirement. There were several siblings (non-members) present, along with parents, most of whom either stayed out of the way or just followed along off to the side. They did a 1-mile run, crunches, a sit-and-reach, and pushups. If the siblings participated and weren't in the way, the adult leaders basically ignored them or gave them their results if they asked.\n\nNow, for the \"Am I the asshole?\" moment. We had 6 mats for 6 youth (the members of the unit). One of those siblings parked themselves in the middle of the group exercise area as we prepared for the pushup exercise, and when asked to move by their sister, who is a member of the unit, so that she could use the exercise mat he was sitting on, made it fairly clear that he wasn't moving and she would have to wait. She's not great at standing up for herself, so after I let the exchange happen, I stepped in and told him to move, because she was part of the group doing the exercise.\n\nHe apparently ran off to find his parents and told them that one of the adults told him he couldn't do the exercise (at least, this is how it was explained to me). After the adult in question (me) was identified by the parents by their wandering around and asking the leaders if they had told their son he needed to leave, this prompted a brief \"How dare you speak to my child like that?\" interrogation, to which I explained that I told him to move because we're here to help the youth who are, in fact, members of the group, and that if he wanted to do the exercise, we could make that happen, when the group was done. There was no yelling, there was no malice, there was no \"Go away, kid, you're not welcome here\", just a, in my view, polite, \"You're in the way of someone who is here to complete the requirement\" command to move to a sibling who wasn't part of the activity.\n\nSo...am I the asshole? I don't feel like an asshole. I would do the exact same thing to any of the other siblings who were there.",

      "description": "So we have a pretty popular restaurant that lots of people order take out from. Actually about 15 years ago when they first opened they had no seating, so it was all take out. Anyways as they became more popular and more people were coming it started getting really busy and crowded at times, they started letting people call in their order by phone so that a person could just show up and their order was ready. Now when they were very busy if you already called in your order, you wouldn't wait in a line with everyone else that hadn't ordered yet, if a person was ordering or at the register paying you let that finish then let them know you were there for your phone order. Once in a while the occasional new person would be all offended and give you the \"hey there's a line here\" nonsense because they were on their first trip to the restaurant, but for the most part every one knows how it goes there. \n\nSo, the other day I call in my order for my fam, it's like a $45 total because there's 4 of us. I get to the restaurant about 25 minutes later which is normally plenty of time, even when they are slammed the orders still come out in a quick time. So I go inside and head for the register like I have done hundreds of times. a bunch of people were in a line, I figured that was the line of people waiting to order. Right away 2 door dash dorks start in with the 'there's a line here\" crap. \"I called in my order\" i respond. They get all huffy about it but in my head I'm like this ain't my 1st rodeo so I pretty much pay them no mind &amp; proceed to the register. The girl behind the counter looks at me, I tell her my name &amp; she looks thru the orders waiting to be picked up and says mine isnt there. Then she asks me \"did you wait in line?\" I'm like no I called it in. Then she tells me i have to wait in line. I go there often enough that I know she is a new employee, and for the past 15+ years that's not the normal procedure. I was pretty irritated by the whole situation so i just walked out. Then I was thinking about it and I wonder if it was just because she was new, or were the 2 door dash guys making her feel pressured to make me wait in line, or am I just an asshole for leaving and not waiting or paying for the order. Just to clarify I have been back to the restaurant today, I called my order in, showed up, skipped the line with no objections from anyone and got my order and left. So AITA for leaving that other time?",

      "description": "It’s happening in some days, my gf doesn’t see feel it’s important. We have a trip unrelated with our relationship in which we may or may not end up together. She believes this should count because we may spend the trip together. Originally I had the plan to drive her around a few memorable places but then the trip came up so we have to go on it, and then after go eat to celebrate. We find out she works the day of. Understandable. Then I ask about Thursday, it’s a no because her brother has an event. That’s understandable. Friday we can’t because she works as well, thats okay. I ask for Tuesday, which I have plans to go out with friends to the movies but I haven’t told her and would just cancel for this special occasion, but she says no as she doesn’t want to wake up early and has to do chores and can’t go out after 5 that day for a reason which I won’t state but know it is actually really understandable. Saturday? She’s going out with her friend at 7, and the morning she’s waking up at 12 and then doing chores at 1 til 3, 4 is too late to take her out to eat while she’s going out to eat at 7. Sunday? Nope, family day so no time. I understand that she needs time for her family. I told her about a dance we could go to with her family so that we can dance a little bit and she can have some family time but she doesn’t want to as it is a school night and I would be interfering with the family time. Maybe tomorrow? I would be doing community hours but would cancel and let someone else take my spot for this special occasion. For a quick brunch? No, same as Tuesday. Next week? No, break ends and she doesn’t want to go during school days, that’s okay. Next weekend she’s celebrating a relatives birthday, that’s understandable. In 3 weeks? Maybe but won’t be as important to her, just a normal date. She says either the trip counts as our celebration or no celebration at all. I got kind of pissed, but of course I’m not going to blame her because it’s just time she doesn’t have so I’m not taking it out on her and haven’t showed her, just instead got bummed out. We were texting about it and she simply doesn’t see why celebrate it as it’s just a year. I said because it’s a milestone, I believe 1 year, 10 years, and 50 years of anything are the most important. 2 and 11 and 51 don’t hold the same “event-y” feel. It’s a ridiculous belief but it’s important to me and I don’t want to half ass it. She replied“🤷‍♀️.” All I said was “okay i understand” because we for sure aren’t celebrating it with anything other than the(maybe together)school trip. I haven’t exactly done anything like call her names or anything horrible as such, just annoyed her about when we could celebrate it. I feel as though I shouldn’t be bummed out for something out of her control.   \nAITA(Or in retrospect it should be WIBTA as I haven’t taken action) if I were to show that I really want a celebration?",

      "description": "Hey all, throwaway and first real post. Don't know why I'm using a throwaway, because anyone that knows me is gonna recognize the situation from a mile away. Also on mobile so bear with me on the formatting. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nBackground\nBasically, my parents had a car several years ago and I was told that when I started needing a car, it would be mine. Then, in my sophomore year of high school, they replaced it with another one they bought for $300. Since it took the place of the old one, I asked if this one would be mine when I needed a car and they said yes. \n\nFor $300 it was great, the only major repair it needed was new motor mounts. (Well, not really, but we'll get to that.) My brother drove us to school in it at first. I then learned how to drive in it, and everybody liked it. My dad actually took it on a road trip and it held up great.\n\nThat is, until, oil started disappearing. It wasn't leaking, the motor was just burning it. My dad told all of us (my mom, bro and I) that the oil HAD to be checked EVERY TIME before it was driven and added so we didn't destroy it. \n\nOne day, my mother needed to go to the store. She wanted to drive my (future) vehicle, but she didn't check the oil (more on this later), drove it a few miles on no oil, and blew the motor. It sat for several months, and my parents were planning on paying someone to haul it and scrap it.\n\nAfter those months I decide I wanted a car, and I had some money saved up. I didn't have the money to buy a car that would actually last, but I had enough to fix the broken down one. So I asked my parents if instead of them paying someone to haul it off if I could fix it and keep it for myself instead, and they said sure. (Note, I didn't act entitled saying \"you're getting rid of it anyway so you should just give it to me.\" I simply asked them if they'd be open to the idea and they said yes.)\n\nFast forward to now. \n\nIt's been about 3 years of hard working with the aid of my grandfather, and after rebuilding the motor I finally have it running. But the trouble didn't end there. I don't want anyone else driving it. Period. It's my baby, and after all the time, sweat, and my own hard earned money doing labor for my great uncle (About $1800) I'm not taking chances. However, I've told my parents if they ever need a ride they just need to ask and I will if I can, and I only ask that they come with me so if something happens I'm not stranded alone.\n\nThe problem now is that my mother doesn't like that. She doesn't have a car of her own, so she thinks that I should let her drive my vehicle. \n\nBut she hates it. She didn't say so before, but once I started rebuilding it and really cemented it as mine, she'd start saying things about hating it and stuff. \n\nBut she demands that if she ever needs to/feels like driving it I should just let her because she says so. \n\nI explain to her that I do NOT want her driving it because she destroyed it in the first place. She knew that she had to make sure it had oil first, but refused to check because she is \"a woman and car maintenance is a man's responsibility\" and thought that fallacy would magically make an engine run perfect with no oil whatsoever. But even then she could have asked my dad to since he was home, but she was too lazy to ask. When I bring up how this is literally wrong, an engine doesn't care who you are and running with no oil is going to destroy it, she refuses to understand it and still thinks that because she's a woman she can destroy an engine then refuse to accept fault, because she's a woman and that's not her responsibility, and I'm an idiot for thinking otherwise.\n\nHowever, she was also rear ended in a rental car in August, and due to some neck damage she should not be driving. So it's not even safe for her to drive. I bring this up too, but she won't even acknowledge this. The only time she does is when dad asks her to drive somewhere, then this \"injury\" becomes super convenient for her to say no.\n\nShe then demands that if she ever needs it she should be allowed to drive it, because it's still in my parents' name and they pay the insurance, and for my gas.\n\nNow, every time she brings this up, I very respectfully tell her if it's that much of an issue to just stop paying it. But I also bring up the fact that 1) They still pay for my brother's insurance, even though he now lives in another state and does not support us at all (understandably), 2) she would never even consider driving his car without his permission 3) Before he moved out, he lived here for 2 years after high school with no job, except for one that lasted a few months, flunked out of college his first semester and wracked up a ton of debt, yet they still paid for his gas and insurance 4) I just graduated high school in May, and finished trade school with my Associates in June with hardly any debt (I went half time for free in high school) and without having a working vehicle until December made it virtually impossible to get a job.\n\nWhen we get into these arguments about it, I make sure that I'm very respectful, even though she acts like I'm Charles Mansen. I also make it clear that I'm not forcing them to pay for anything, just that it'd be really dickish to stop compared to everything they did for my brother (who I have no resentment toward for any of this). I literally shut down all of her arguments just by calmly and respectfully stating facts. The result is always her screaming something, such as the whole theme for this sub, \"YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE SHUT UP GET OUT\".\n\nWondering what my dad thinks? He knows where I'm coming from, knows that I'm right, but just hits the yeet and dodges the conversation.\n\nI think she's really just mad that she doesn't have a car of her own, and she's spiting me because unlike her when I decided I wanted a vehicle I actually did something about it. She just plays the \"pity me\" game and complains about not having a car while doing nothing to help herself. Granted, she works all day prepping decals for a printing company, but over several years you'd think she'd at least try to figure something out.\n\nAlso, looking at how she treated my brother vs. me on the whole car situation, it's obvious she has little actual respect for me, and all the time and money I've put into it. I'm also fairly certain she's mad because I'm not just doing whatever she says blindly and actually calling her out when she has zero justification, and I have valid points to prove it.\n\nOverall, I'm not caving and letting her (or anyone else) drive my vehicle because I know she wouldn't care if she destroyed all my hard work and time, and might actually be happy to. I've worked hard on it and it is mine in every way except on the title (so far).\n\nTL;DR- My mom destroyed the engine of the vehicle that was supposed to me mine, and after spending $1800 of my own money and 3 years rebuilding it, she's mad I won't let her drive it because I don't want it destroyed again.\n\n\nSo am I really the asshole here? I'm not a saint and I won't claim to be, but I try as hard as I can to be reasonable but my mother still gets mad at me.\n",

      "description": "Well hmmm. My girlfriend of 6 months and I are on a weekend trip from Seattle to the Oregon coast, we're still in the car. My ex messaged me through Facebook asking about the dog we shared when we were together and we had a small chat about dogs, nothing about our current personal lives, just about the dogs we shared. (There were 2 dogs, we each got one). We exchanged pictures of the dogs and that was the end of the conversation. \n\nThe ex and I ended things about 6 years ago, so it's not fresh. My girlfriend gets jealous over nothing, it would seem that I'm not supposed to talk to women period. We have talked about this and she said that as long as I don't want to hang out with them she will have to deal with it. Well she got jealous, we had a little fight and I want to know if I'm in the wrong or not. Am I the asshole? Thanks.",

      "title": "AITA for kicking a girl off my Airsoft team because she refused to comply with our rules?",
      "description": "I am team leader of an Airsoft team. We have an official statewide ranking and there's a core of us who travel to play in national tournaments. I get that some people will think it's super dorky but it's my passion and it keeps me outside, in shape and with my friends. \n\n\nWe have a very strict \"military-realistic\" policy on our team in that we don't allow anime, video game stuff, fake swords, bright colors, etc... And if you want to be on our competition team, there is about $400 worth of uniform gear we require everyone to buy so we look professional and coherent. Again, this is us and people don't have to join our team. \n\n\nSo to the point, last fall this girl Madison got in touch with me to say she had just moved to town and wanted to meet people and asked if she could come to our practice. Airsoft is like 95% guys so it's not unheard of to have girls play but it's rare. When she gave me her name I was just a little curious so I did a google search and came up with her Instagram and she was (is) gorgeous, she's a literal model and a Boutine girl with about 100k followers. I figured she was just screwing with us to come out and get more dude Instagram followers by showing she was \"tomboy\" who could play with the boys. I figured that one day and a few shots with airsoft pellets would snuff her out real quick. I'm not just mentioning her looks and Instagram to be gratuitous, it's important to the story. \n\n\nSo she came out and to my total surprise, she fucking rocked it. She's actually a really good player with a good sense for the game and in the last few months she hasn't mentioned airsoft once on her Instagram. But needless to say a girl that looks like her is going to get a ton of attention on the airsoft field. We had a team meeting before she arrived that we had to treat her the same as we treat the rest of us and that we should have a rule for team spirt that no one try to date her. And I wanted to reiterate that we had to treat her exactly as we would any other member of the team, no exceptions.  Everyone agreed with this but even my oldest airsoft friends bend over backwards to be just a little bit friendlier to her if that makes sense. There is no doubt that in a highly competitive  sport that is 95% men, a \"hot girl\" is going to change the dynamic. It's not that I mind this at all because she was really good. \n\n\nSo my first big problem came with her just after new years when she came to the field with dyed bright red hair all done up in these little pony tail things. I told her that because of team rules, she was going to have to cover up her hair with like a camouflage beanie under her helmet. She said it was uncomfortable and took it off in the middle of a game. I called her out on it reminding her of the rules and pretty much my whole team told me I was being too much of a hard ass and I should lighten up. Even other strays (people not on a team) and other teams at the field that day came up to me and told me to chill out. After two years of having these rules, everyone was all of the sudden mad at me because I was trying to enforce the rules we all agreed on. \n\nBecause she is such a good player, we invited her to an out of state tournament coming up in March but I reiterated that I needed proof that she was ordering all the uniform gear from the various airsoft websites and it would be here in time for March. But after the hair incident I think she thinks she can blow me off because everyone will support her and she keeps telling me \"I'm working on it\" when I ask her. I mean it's literally as easy as going on a website and ordering stuff. That's all there is too it. \n\nSo things just got worse with her clothing and she pays zero regard to our military realistic rule and this past weekend she wore a fucking belly shirt and then was showing off all the welts to the other guys that she had gotten from being shot. She literally looked like a queen holding court with all the guys around her. \n\nI was so annoyed that her that I needed to talk to her, I reminded her about the military realistic rule, she said she was just hot and that she was sorry. I then asked her again about her uniform purchases. She said that she was working on it but not to worry, it would all be here. I was so fed up at this point I just said \"look I'm really sorry, but you just aren't a good fit for our team and you have to leave.\" Instead of getting mad like maybe I thought she would, she just broke down crying. Which means to everyone that was looking at us from afar I was the mean asshole making the pretty girl cry instead of just enforcing the rules we all agreed on. \n\n\nWell in like less that 5 minutes she had invites to join to other teams, pretty much EVERYONE on the airsoft field came over to tell her how sorry they were for her and how I'd always been known to be a hard ass.  And then my fucking team started turning on me. Of the 19 guys on our team 5 quit that day saying they were sick of my shit and the other 13 said they at least wanted to have a meeting this week to see where we were headed as a team. Somehow a rumor got started that I had yelled at Madison and that's why she was crying so the owner of the airsoft field iced me for 3 weeks because I violated his \"no abusive language policy.\" I've known the guy for 10 freaking years and spent thousands of dollars at his field and he iced me because of rumor. This is how crazy this has gotten. \n\n\nI think everyone on my team wants to either kick me out of the leadership position or quit altogether and form a new a team. To me, I was just enforcing the rules we all agreed upon and we all agreed that we would treat her the same. I think everyone thinks I'm an asshole. Our team meeting is tomorrow night and I would love to at least get some outside opinion on whether or not I'm an asshole so I know how to go into the meeting. \n\n\nthank you for reading. \n",

Initially I said yes but now it’s 6 hours later and I would really prefer to just stay home at this point so I told her I would get her an Uber instead (obviously I will pay for it as I said I would get her there in the first place). \n\nNow she’s mad and refusing to take an Uber and said she’ll just take transit instead and she won’t explain to me why. When I pressed a bit more for an answer she said she didn’t want to spend that long in an Uber but wouldn’t expand on that and just told me to stop talking to her.\n\nMy rationale, it’s nearly the same outcome for her if I get her the Uber but for me I get 2 hours of my weekend back that would otherwise be spent in traffic. We’ve already been spending the day together so I don’t feel like I’m ditching her by any means. I work 50-70 hours a week so  any down time is valuable to me. AITA?",

Today she began saying that she’s frustrated with the guy she’s seeing because he’s not texting her first and “he’s probably found someone hotter.” She then went on to talk about how she can never truly open up to men, claiming it’s not her fault that she can be cold/play games because she was hurt in the past. She always blames her exes for this. I’m totally sick of hearing her go on, nodding my head and pretending I agree with her. So today I said, “I’m sorry that you were hurt like that and you feel that way. But you can’t go into every relationship with the mindset that someone is going to hurt you. You are only going to get in your own way, and playing games is dishonest.” She and my other coworker did not take this well and began arguing with me.

He does but remains friendly about it, never really giving her a flirtatious vibe or anything like that. \n\nA few days later I realize Dana is in a separate class with me. I try to do a little mission and see what she thinks about my friend. Turns out she finds him \"nice\" but not feeling him in a romantic way. I let it go. I try to get my friend to learn some flirting style tips and even asked a female friend to give him some advice, it goes okay but not with Dana.\n\nThat weekend I go out for a little bit around the Delmar Loop shopping district area and run across Dana again at a record store. We chat it up a little bit about some bands we like and she invites me to her apartment to listen to some vinyl she just bought. Turns out we have lots more in common and things sort of escalate from there. Some things happened and while it felt awesome I did feel really guilty. My thinking is my friend never made a real move and it's not like me and Dana are like a couple. What do you guys think?

Well one of my friends took offend at this and started going off about how I was selfish and that she would never judge someone based on their height. She is 5'2 and I tried explaining to her that it isn't the same for her as it for me, because not many guys are actually shorter than her.

      "description": "So I’m (21m) currently in pharmacy school and for the past year or so I’ve been commuting (about 30-45 mins one way) to school from my place by myself. Colleague/friend (30m) who lived very close to campus ran into some financial troubles and had to move back home about 10 mins from where i live. He doesn’t have a license let alone a car so he asked me if he could catch a ride with me on school days since we have the exact same schedules. \n\nThis has been going on for around 2 weeks now - he’d uber to my place in the mornings and head to college then I’d drop him off home after (15 min detour from my house) and head home. He doesn’t compensate me in any way nor have I asked but I’m okay with this since he’s a friend. \n\nRecently though I’ve found myself wanting to make plans after college with friends at places away from our town. Not to mention that I pick up some extra shifts at work so he has to wait for me 2-3 days of the week to get out of work at 9pm. Several times I’ve hinted that he should catch rides on the way back instead with other colleagues who live literally right down my road so he doesn’t have to wait for me but he doesn’t seem to be getting the hint. Any of my plans, whether they be recreational or work related, are pretty spontaneous so I wouldn’t be giving him much notice but there isn’t anything I can do about that. \n\nA part of me feels like I would be an ass if I changed my plans suddenly on him but on the other hand, it’s my car, it’s my gas, there’s no compensation and I go out of my way to drop him off home every night anyways. we have no agreement on anything I’m just doing him a favor for the time being. I’m happy to continue giving him lifts but I don’t want my schedule to be tied up around me requiring to take him to and from college every day. \n\nWould I be the asshole?",

      "description": "Hey Reddit, \n\nI’m fully prepared to be the asshole here, but I wanted to get some outside opinions. \n\nSome context: I currently live with my grandmother and her boyfriend. They have been together for around 15 years. I am a University student, in graduate school for a master’s degree (2-3 courses at a time, each semester), and I currently work two part-time jobs (\\~20-30 hours per week each). My grandmother is retiring after forty-years at the same company. She is in her mid-sixties. \n\nMy mother has planned a retirement dinner for my grandmother. My mother has never been very responsible, but after a recent pay raise (her salary was doubled), she’s feeling a little less stressed nowadays, and thought it would be a nice thing to do for her mother (my grandmother). Tonight, my mother tells me the party is planned for a couple weeks from today, at 5PM. My graduate degree is only at night, so courses are form 6PM-9PM. Of course, the dinner coincides with the first class of the semester, and it’s about a forty-minute drive from the dinner to the campus. Weirdly, the University I attend structures their courses in such a way that this course is 6PM-9PM for eight weeks, once a week, with the last week being a final exam, meaning there are only seven lectures, so missing even a single lecture is fairly risky. \n\nI told my mother that I won’t be able to attend, and that I will take my grandmother out myself, later, when I am available. She then starts guilt-tripping me in our family group-chat about how I “don’t appreciate” my grandmother, and “why everything has to be about me.”, etc. \n\nThis annoys me particularly because I live with my grandmother, and the only reason my mother picked the day she did is because it happened to fall on her (my mom’s) vacation time, and she never asked me for my availability and jut assumed I would be able to drop everything for this dinner. I feel bad for having to miss the dinner, but I’m not really sure what my options are with the somewhat tight/rigid schedule I have. \n\nAnyways Reddit, Am I the Asshole? ",

      "title": "AITA - I am a dialysis patient and rejecting a potential doner has cost my Dad a large portion of his family",
      "description": "So, like the title says, I am a dialysis patient. For the last 1.5 years I've been doing dialysis to keep myself alive. As a young man of 19 years of age, having my cousin offer to be a doner was huge for me however things haven't quite worked out that well.\n\nFor context, my cousin is is a few years older than me, she's long since been the 'golden child' due to her being the oldest and only girl of 4 grandchildren.  At family meals her and her mother would hog the attention of my nan and grandad much to my dad's annoyance leading to a few small spats here and there but an otherwise happy family unit.\n\nThe problems arose with her several months into her vetting process to get her ready to be a doner. On this specific day she had text me roughly 9AM asking for some contact details for a nurse at the hospital. Admittedly, I checked the message, clearly showing her I had read it but did not answer right away. I had some dialysis supplies being delivered and they would take a significant amount of time to organise.\n\nAs fate would have it, that day I had been accidentally booked in for an appointment at a specialist hospital a roughly 1.5 hour drive away. The hospital transport arrived and I had no choice but to go with them and have this appointment. I had no mobile data on my phone and could not contact my cousin whilst I was on my way to the hospital.\n\nI arrived at the hospital and waited in the transport vehicle whilst the driver went to figure out the specifics of the appointment. The hospital I was at had a free wifi connection and so I connected to it to inform my immediate family of where I was as I had been home alone at the time. Almost immediately I saw that I had a message from my cousin and it was honestly one of the most repulsive messages I had ever read. It oozed sarcasm, was overtly condescending and proceeded to remind me of how much she had done for me whilst still having the gall to end with \"I love you (OP name) but I don't love what you're doing right now\".\n\nAll from leaving her on read for under 2 hours.\n\nAt the time, I saw huge flashing danger signs in my head. This woman was supposed to be giving me a kidney, how could I trust that she wouldn't hold that over me for the next 20 or so years a kidney transplant can last? I left that comment on read too whilst I formulated a response. Me, my girlfriend and my dad all chipped in that evening to write an admittedly condescending message that boiled down to \"Stop being childish and I can't have you donate a kidney to me in good faith\".\n\nSince then, she hasn't said a word to me or my family. Her family as well as my nan and grandad blocked all of my family and other than some less than friendly emails between my Dad and Nan there has been almost no contact. Neither side has shown  interest in trying to resolve the issue, this was well over 8 months ago.\n\nSo, AITA Reddit? I won't lie, I feel an immense amount of guilt. Whilst he won't admit it, I fear that my dad misses his mum and dad. They were a big part of his life and I can't help but feel responsible. I could also be living a somewhat normal life by now if I had just taken the message on the chin and not valued my pride so much. The stress I've put on my family with my declining health could have all been avoided. Apologies for the long post but this has been good to get off my chest. Thanks for reading \n\nTl;dr: Potential kidney doner gets annoyed after being left on read. She is removed by me from my potential doner list for being immature and this causes a rift in the family.\n\nP.S: That appointment? The one I spend nearly 3 hours both ways in a hot transport vehicle to go to? It never existed. It was supposed to be the week after but the transport company messed up. 😑😑😑\n\n\n\n\nStay",

      "description": "It all started when my best friend posted a screenshot of an instagram post, and my other friend called Him out that he is a cunt for taking a screenshot of someone's post, so I called her out and said that she literally does the same thing. She right away said that it's a joke, but I knew it wasn't, because this isn't the first time and she was dead serious last time and I told her this. She immediatly fired back with why am I so salty and things like that, and my response was that she's always hurt that everybody leaves from her company, but she fails to realise that what she does is wrong, and I gave her the example of why one of our mutual friends doesn't talk to her anymore, which was that she straight up called herself Allah. And when the guy who worshipped Allah blocked her, she messaged me saying how that guy is a cry baby, and she is right. She outright denied that she ever said these, even after I showed proof. And after that she started attacking me saying how I'm a loser, and how I will always be lonely, and I'm pathetic, and she brought up the problems I currently have with my family, and said nobody can be sadder than this man. So as a last thing I told her \"I will always be happier than you because atleast I see my faults\". And I left the group. After this I asked my friend if she said anything about the incident, and the only thing she said is that these are the early signs of autism. And around 2 hours ago I saw her instagram story, saying that everybody she cares about is abandoning her, even though she didn't do anything, and she's always to get hurt.\n\nI'm really on the fence here.  Obviously I didn't write down more personal things, but this was the core of the argument",

      "description": "   \nMy sister(25F) had a baby last year and I(29F) have not been in contact with her since she announced her pregnancy. Around the time our mother passed away she got pregnant, but her BF(28M) was in jail and she decided to get an abortion. I helped her through the process but never pressured her decision to get the abortion. Though I thought it was the right thing because this guy is a scumbag. After the abortion she called me a few months later (after bf was out of jail) to tell me she was pregnant again. Around this same time I found out that she had opened credit-cards in my name. I told her I wanted nothing to do with her until she got her life together and I haven't spoken to her since.  \n\n\nMy dad pressures me around the holidays to reach out to her and wish her and her baby well, but I just can’t do it. It’s hard because I know our mother would want us to be together, but I have to protect myself. She doesn’t care about anybody, steals from people, and manipulates everyone around her. So many times she has broken up with her BF, blamed all of her bad activity on him, and then gone back to him the next day after the family supplies her with funds to get back on her feet. And I’m afraid she will use the baby to get what she wants from me and others around her.  Please tell me I am NTA for choosing a healthy life and saying goodbye to my sister forever!  \n \n\nThe story is quite long and filled with mini-horrible details if anyone is interested. Seriously thinking about writing a book.",

      "description": "So I know a lot of these leave out information and are called out for such, so I’ll try and leave nothing out and answer any questions. So I’m 16, and yesterday my friend turned 17. He texted me in the morning to invite me out to the mall and the Dave and busters attached to it from 7-10 for his birthday. I asked my mom a few hours later because she was at the gym when I got the text and then went to our neighbors house when she got home. Then I asked and she said yes, and since my brother was gonna be spending the day with his girlfriend, she said she d drive me there and back. Eventually plans changed to having it begin at 6 and then to people leaving their houses at 6. My mom wanted to know where in the mall I was meeting them, and because no one knew, I just settled on one entrance. Then 6 came and she drove me down, and my friend texted me where they actually were, and I told my mom plans had changed and we were meeting up at the new place. She dropped me off and told me to text her when I found them, which is what I did, and then she presumably drove home. Anyway, we went to the mall and had a good time. Except a few of us had went straight to the face and busters, leaving the group I was with, including birthday boy and a friend, annoyed. When the group came to the main mall, they explained they had been waiting for another friend; and apparently; the friend of birthday boy that was also annoyed slapped one. I had missed this, probably happened while I was ordering food at the food court. Then, a little before 10, when she said she was leaving, my friends asked if I could get them rides home, and when I asked my mom if they could get rides, she said yes. That was two, and soon after a third asked, and they all said they were going to another friend’s house to continue the birthday celebration.  Because this is probably relevant, I am male, this friend is female. She asked how many people there were, and I said 16, which is how many there were. She said yes, and we drove off. The people were talking about everything in the back, and brought up this slap. Then we dropped them off and my mom asked if they were staying the night, and I said no, they were just continuing the party. She asked me if I wanted to join them, but since it was after 10 and she usually goes to bed pretty early, I told her I didn’t want to make her air up enforcement me, to which she said she’d just go to bed, and I’d walk home. This sounded more fair, so I said yes, and she dropped me off at the friend’s house. Then she texted me to say she was gonna pick me up instead, but I initially didn’t see it. Then at about 11:40 she texts me again and I say that I thought I was gonna walk. She says that it’s raining, and I say, ok sorry, and she says she’ll pick me up at midnight, and I say ok thanks, and leave when she says she’s there. She asks if everyone was there, and I say some of them didn’t come to the house. I thought that was the end of it, but a bit ago, 6ish today, my brother told me my mom was super pissed about it, especially being at the friend’s house so late and the slap she heard about. I haven’t been able to talk to her yet because I think it would be better to do so in person and I’m currently volunteering to make sure people don’t cut in line, but I’d like to know, AITA?",

      "description": "So, before I get into this, I have to give some background.\n\nLast year, he hooked up with a friend of his that we all knew. It was only a BJ, but he deeply regrets what happened and said he would never do it again. Everyone, including the “new” girl, knew about the exchange.\n\nLast night we went to one of our “new” friends houses. We got to know her after the past couple of months and we wanted to have a party. We get there, all four of my friends except me got super drunk, since they, including me, were lightweights.\n\nWe get into her hot tub and almost immediately they get handsy with each other. Me and my sort of sober friend pulled them apart since we both know it would be a bad idea considering his history. My sorta sober friend then becomes drunk and starts to not care. I’ve sobered up throughout the experience since I had very little alcohol, and don’t like alcohol anyways. After multiple occasions of them sitting on each others laps and getting handsy, and me having to break them up and being called a cockblock, we get out.\n\nWe start to watch a movie and they are sitting next to each other. I break it up and that’s that. After around 20 minutes I notice they aren’t in the room anymore. I go up to her room and they’re making out on her bed. I break it up, send him downstairs, and told her, “Really?”. I go back downstairs and told him that he’s a fucking idiot since it’s the same thing as last year. He didn’t say anything and my now drunk friend from the hot tub told me to calm down and told me that I shouldn’t care. I go to bed since I was done with the night, and woke up this morning.\n\nAnother detail I should add is that the girl in question thanked me throughout the night for me breaking them up when they got close.\n\nI’m 90% sure they didn’t do anything else after that, but I just wanted to know, am I the asshole here?",

      "description": "So, some context. This happened a couple nights ago at a convenience store. I walked in for just one thing. There's a homeless dude outside in a wheel chair that tends to yell at me when I see him. Bout a 100,000 people town but downtown you see a lot of the same people. I don't think I'm being targeted but yeah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go inside for one thing and sit in line. I see another dude standing next to the customers as they pay and quickly learn he's no ones friend but just another homeless. He follows one person out then comes back in to his post. When I go to pay I'm like aww fuck cause I know i'm bout to pay cash. I go to put my change in my wallet and all of a sudden he's two inches behind me looking over my shoulder. I just give him a quick glare and walk away. As I'm leaving I see two girls getting out of a car maybe 10 feet away but for one of the few times in my life I let the door close after me and don't hold it open cause I knew I was being followed. One of the girls says \"wow couldn't leave the door open\" Again I don't say anything but figure I'll just continue walking to work. Old dude from inside has followed me and says \"hey man let me talk to you for a second.\" I said no, I'm going to work. He told me to chill out before the store owner comes out with one of those really long tasers to get the dudes to leave (even though they still come back every night.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, AITA for just worrying about getting out of there and not being polite?",

During those years we’ve tried to make things work romantically, but things never seemed to go the way we’ve expected them to.\n\nDistance has always been a major factor. Right now we’re on opposite ends of the country. It takes me three days to drive to where he lives. \n\nHe asked me to come visit while I was going to be in his area. While I was visiting, he discovered that his psychotic ex/mother of his son had put her bill into his name illegally. His cable was shut off. Me being the awesome person I am, I offered to put the bill in my name until it got cleared up. The company had to launch an investigation which can take three months. In the meantime he’d have no WiFi. He works from home and needs a secure connection, so he’d lose his job.\n\nFast forward a few weeks. He talked me into moving closer to him. I sold off most of my belongings. I found a new job and secured an apartment. I dumped everything I own into this.\n\nThen he started ghosting me. No explanation. I sent him one text every few days just to make sure he was alright and eventually he said I was being clingy and annoying. Sketchy. A few days ago I saw him driving with a woman I didn’t recognize. Super sketchy, but I don’t want to jump to conclusions. \n\nI should also mention that a few days before the ghosting he came to visit me in my hotel. He was acting extremely shady. He didn’t like the fact that there was a bar there that locals hung out at just in case someone recognized him. He played a bunch of games wanting to make sure I was all dressed up 100% for him even though we were planning on going straight to bed. In hindsight he’s a major jerk.\n\nNow I’m stuck on the opposite end of the coast a thousand miles away from my friends and family. I can’t even get WiFi unless I transfer my service. Normally I’d talk it out, but seeing as it looks like we aren’t even on speaking terms I don’t see why I should go out of my way for him.  These past few weeks made me realize I deserve better especially since he’s been pulling BS like this for the entire time I’ve known him. Now I’m angry at myself for not seeing the signs and letting myself get taken advantage of. I feel like I need to do something semi savage to take myself back and cut him out for good.\n\nWIBTA if I quietly get his service taken out of my name? \n\n",

      "description": "I really love spicy food, and a lot of my day-to-day meals have some sort of spice to it. It's just what I'm used to and prefer. I'm also aware that my spice tolerance is typically on the relatively high/extreme end.\n\nAnyway, my \"meal-prepped\" weekday lunches (not necessarily healthy but enough to last a full week) are spicy, as you can guess, but a very decent/moderate level (at least to me). My workplace has a main communal kitchen and a smaller one that's closer to my cube, so I use the microwave in there to heat up my lunch. I often take it back to my cube to eat for a very quick lunch break, which a lot of people at my company do. At least several days a week, a particular coworker will repeatedly cough and comment, \"Wow, I can smell the spice from my office.\" His office is maybe 20-30 feet away from my cube. I don't know if my lunch truly bothers them or if it's just them making a harmless comment, but I wonder if it's the former. That being said... I haven't asked them directly because 1) it's my lunch, not sure what I'm supposed to do about it, and 2) I eat for maybe 10 minutes, immediately wash the bowl in the kitchen, and the smell does not linger.\n\nTo give you an idea, my lunch for this week was tofu + vegetable stir fry with maybe 2 tbsp of gochujang (Korean red chili paste), 2 tbsp gochugaru (Korean chili powder), 1 tbsp red pepper flakes... This is for the whole batch, and it's not like I'm putting capsaicin in my lunch!\n\nAnyway, AITA for eating spicy lunches?",

Me and my two other close friends ( J &amp; E)  were at ease that she was getting help.\n\nLater,one day she texted me asking me if I could take her to the hospital. I asked her what happened and told her I could when I got out of work. She didn't respond. I was frantically trying to figure out if sometime major had happened if I needed to leave work immediately. No reply (although she was \"online\"). She finally picked up J's call in the evening and told us she had a tummy ache and was taking rest. Alright we thought it was cool and went on with our lives. \n\nBut after that day she stopped texting us and even did not make eye contact when she saw E on the street. Yikes. A month later she reached out to us to talk. \n\nShe said she was angry that no one checked up on her when she was sick ( we clearly did try). She also said that her recent diagnosis was affecting the way she was feeling and her actions. I  explained to her that her lack of communication made it seem like she wanted space and that's what me J &amp; E were doing. \n\nShe starts texting back a little so I'm all yay no drama. All of a sudden she texts me thats she's mad I don't reply to her texts and snaps and told me I'm rude and mean. Yikes I check my texts and I have replied to every text, maybe not every snap but that's me with everyone.\n\nI call bullshit and I told her I don't have time to deal with drama. My semester was already stressful. In my opinion I don't HAVE to be friends with everyone.\n\nAll fair and good we don't talk now. She still communicates with J&amp;E somtimes but even they are tired of her shit and aren't that close.\n\nBut here's where I'm conflicted. If my friend's depression is what is causing her to act the way she is, am I being too harsh on her? Everyday on social media she posts sad quotes and pictures with dark captions and I'm concerned about her but I also think it's a cry for attention.\n\nShe doesn't have many other friends and I'm a little scared her feelings would lead her to do something bad. \n\nSo AITA for not taking my friend's depression seriously and not being there for her?\n\n\n",

I thought that was weird and at bed time went on tinder to look at her profile and saw a lot of recent activity. I had thought we where growing into more than what would allow for that.

      "description": "So to start off this is my first Reddit post and I'm only 13 so go easy on my grammar. So little backstory I lost my mom to health issues that I wasn't told about, and I never show my emotions so I was just a walking piece of sadness. I wasn't obviously sad but if you're around me enough you would be able to tell I'm hiding something. My aunt knows about the whole situation and she tries to be super supportive for me but it always felt pushed. Like she would be overly nice to me, it's almost been a year since my mom passed and she acts like it was yesterday and treats me like I'm about to start sobbing at any moment.\nI often get payments because I think my mom had some type of insurance that gives her children (under 18) money every month. It really helps me and my older brother/guardian get by in these hard times of him finding a good job. I never liked sharing information with her because she just instigates and over exaggerates, and I don't need that in my life right now.\nAnyway I'm doing fine and out of nowhere she just calls me and asks what I'm doing and I just casually say \"nothing really\" and she just says that's good, and here's the stinger, she asks where my brother is I tell her \"I don't know\" and she says \"he might be dead, like he might have gotten shot or something\". I instantly don't want to talk to her so I make some fake excuse that I have to get my chicken nuggets out of the oven. I live in the hood so she should know I'm sensitive to topics about people getting shot since tons of my friend's relatives get shot, and she just says it casually.\nI always thought she just wanted the money because of how fake she is in general, she will talk shit about everyone and anyone she can, even if it's minor. Before this happened I went through her phone messages (which I had NO reason to do and that's kinda rude of me) and she texted her son in a argument they were having \n\"If you don't (insert demand here) I will call the police and I put that on (my mom) and (my other aunt who has passed) grave\" \nHe didn't even do it and she did nothing about it, at all, so she put something on my mom's grave for no reason. The final and last straw was when she called my oldest sister talking about child protective services took me, so naturally because I love my sister and she loves me, she calls me.\nShe asks if I'm ok what I'm doing and where I'm at, then she tells me what I had figured already, my aunt was starting stuff for no reason at all again. \nTell me Reddit what do you think about this, should I call her and confront her about everything (I have a fear of confrontation btw)? Or should I just keep on ignoring her?\nAnd finally what you are all here for, AITA\nTLDR: I blocked my aunt who was insensitive and really fake out of my life, she lies about things and is pretty manipulative towards those around her.\nI think she is in it for the money though she may not be, AITA",

      "description": "For context my brother D is the oldest child, my sister H is the second and I am the third. My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he’s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn’t think what he did is wrong. ",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to apologize to my co-worker when he lost his own property?",
      "description": "First, I apologize for how long this will be. \n\n\n\nSo, I work in the auto repossession industry in a spotter car. I work day shift and the co-worker in this story works nights. We share a vehicle and both engage in common sense ways to help the other: make sure the tank is full at the end of our shift, report any damage or maintenance needs, etc. \n\n\n\nSince he’s on night shift, he has a powerful flashlight that he uses to spot cars in the dark. It’s totally necessary for him, I admit. He leaves his flashlight in the car 24/7 which doesn’t bother me at all. It’s usually dark toward the end of my shift so I use it occasionally as well. Well, at the beginning of my shift yesterday, we crossed paths as he was clocking out. He mentioned that the power steering wasn’t working so I’d need to change the PS fluid and see if that helps. I figured if I can’t get it to work, I’ll inform my boss as is protocol and we can arrange to have it fixed. \n\n\n\nTurns out, the car’s power steering is electric, not fluid-based so changing the fluid was obviously not an option. We have a spare car to use so I informed my boss of the issue, grabbed my essentials (AUX cord, phone mount, chargers, etc.), got in the spare car, and started working. My boss called me a bit later to tell me they were picking up the broken down car that day. Cool. \n\nFast forward to this morning. I have about a 45 minute commute to work, and he called me when I was about halfway through to ask if I’d seen his flashlight. I told him that the last I saw it, it was in the broken car. He asked why I didn’t grab it for him and I told him that, firstly, I didn’t know the car would be being transported for maintenance that day and, secondly, that it isn’t my property to do with what I wish. As far as I knew it’d been more problematic to move it from where he last saw it. My argument was also that he knew the car might need maintenance and thus may be likely to be out of town at our company’s garage for a few days, so really he shouldn’t expect me to have grabbed it if he hadn’t thought to do so either. \n\n\n\nHe threw a tantrum and said “Shit like this is why you paid all that money for a college degree and you’re repoing cars. You don’t fucking think things through.”\n\n\n\nI told him that I wasn’t going to stay on the phone to be verbally abused by him and that if he was searching for an apology he wasn’t going to get one. I could’ve been nicer, but I found the comment about my education and how I make a living to be incredibly insulting and unnecessary. A real low-blow.\n\n\n\nThis coworker is about 15 years older than me, if not more, so I’m pretty used to him thinking he knows everything and that he could never learn anything from me (despite me having better numbers than him and having done the job longer), strictly due to my age. I’m 27. I get that I’m young, but I’m also not 18. I don’t appreciate being patronized or looked down upon because I’m younger than him.\n\n\n\nAnyway, he filed a complaint against me with the company for “negligently misplacing his property”. When my boss called to discuss his complaint, I laid out the situation as it actually happened and my boss told me I’m in good shape and not to worry. He agreed that it’s crazy to label my having not moved something as “misplacing” it. \n\n\n\nFrustrated that I didn’t get disciplined, he called me again to demand I pay for his flashlight because he doesn’t believe he’ll get it back (which is based on nothing, our company mechanics are not going to steal his flashlight). This is a $40 flashlight and, while I could certainly afford to give him $40, fuck that. He told me he hopes I get fired and learn a lesson from what I’ve done. “Hopefully one day you’ll actually grow up.”\n\n\n\nI told him to go fuck himself and not to speak to me when I see him.\n\n\n\nSo, am I the asshole here?\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AITA for letting my mom come to stay with my Wife and I after having a child?",
      "description": "My Wife and I had our first baby, a boy, four months ago. It's been great, if not exhausting. My Wife and I have a great relationship, the only real problem we've ever had is housework. At best in the time I've know her it's been a 65/35 split with me doing the 65, most of the time it's been 80/20. This was something I could live with when it was the two of us but since having our baby she's almost stopped doing any house work other than things related to the baby during the day.\n\nI work 45 hour weeks, so not too bad compared to some people on here, but when I come home I'm usually exhausted. She asks me to take the baby when I get home so she can have some time to herself, which I'm happy to do, but then I also have to wash dishes, cook dinner, clean the house etc because she does none of it and if I don't do it she won't. I've tried asking her for help and expressed how exhausted I am and her reply is \"I'm exhausted too from looking after the baby all day.\" I know it's hard work but even if she just did some small things it would make a big difference but she won't do anything, even after I pleaded with her to help.\n\nSo here's where my mom comes in. I vented a little to her and she felt bad so offered to come stay for a couple of weeks (she lives across country) and help out around the house and look after the baby a little bit so my wife could rest. I was extremely grateful, thanked her and told her I would arrange it with my wife. Note that my Wife and my Mom have a good relationship as far as I'm aware, we don't see them very often but my Wife always has good things to say about her.\n\nWhen I excitedly told my wife she immediately got angry, said we didn't need help and we can handle it ourselves. I told her I was struggling and needed the help but she said to just get on with it. This made me upset so I told her if things didn't change in the next week I would be inviting my mom with or without her permission. The next week went by and things were the same, no housework done, she handed the baby off to me after work etc.\n\nI told my mom to come and she flew in the next weekend, my wife was extremely upset and yelled at me a little, I told her that this was happening and to \"just get on with it\". Since my mom arrived she's been very cold and possessive of the baby, it has been a godsend for me though as I've been able to relax a little after work and actually get some me time. We went out to lunch with one of my wife's friends (which we could only do because my mom was looking after the baby) and when my wife went to the toilet her friend said to me \"I can't believe you undermined her like that, she's really upset.\" I was a bit put off and said it was between my wife and I.\n\nTLDR; Wife and I had baby, I have to work and do all housework as wife doesn't want to/is too tired to do any.

      "description": "Sorry for poor formatting and/or any spelling mistakes in advance.\n\nI'm 16M. I have exams coming up and have assignments due which I used my laptop for. I used my laptop for writing these up, researching where needed and when I wasn't doing any of my school work I was either on Discord with friends or watching Netflix. \n\nA few months ago, I was doing school work on my living room table. It's relatively high up and my sister unless seated would not be able to touch it. I get tired after around 2 or 3 hours of doing my school work and I close it over, leave it out of reach to go to my room and sleep. When I wake up, I come back to see my laptop on the couch (other end of the room) with my sister next to it. I check my laptop, it's completely broken. Screen is half dead amongst other things.\n\nMy brother (13) had given the laptop to my sister to watch whatever nonsense she's into at this time and left her with it.\n\nI speak with my mum and she tells me it's my fault for leaving it out, that there's a 3 year old in the house. But as I said she could not get to it if she tried! \n\nI was mad. I've been using this laptop for school work for 3 years and now I have nothing to do school work on and my mum won't even let me use her laptop for my school work. \n\nI'm left to ask, AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for saying something about my roommate that I think she overheard",
      "description": "So, my SO and I have a roommate. I charge her only $500 all inclusive, meaning her portion of the light bill and everything else + rent is all in one. We live in a nice 3bed/2bath house, approx. 1500 SF. All things considered, she is a great roommate. Takes care of our dogs while we're gone or at work and she's home, cleans up after herself, and gets in cleaning moods like I do which helps keeps things tidy. Plus, we've been friends for like 7+ years and she's a really cool chick that I get along with and can just shoot the shit with.   \n\n\nHowever, I have had issues with her lately. At first, it was no big deal, but I feel as though she's grown too comfortable living all inclusive. The main issues are her either forgetting huge loads of trash that need to be out for trash pickup, leaving the lights on when she leaves a room or leaves the house, and running the heater too much. The trash will stink up the whole house, mainly because she will throw her old food out and it will sit there while we're both at work. Minor inconvenience, but still something I feel like she should have a little more responsibility over. In regards to the lights and heat, she knows, or at least by my assumption knows, that I am very frugal when it comes to saving $$. I constantly have to make sure lights aren't left on before we go to bed, and have to walk behind her in the kitchen/common areas. I don't run the heat unless it is god awful cold in the house, because we all have a shit ton of blankets and she has a space heater (of which I am paranoid about because she leaves the light on, who says she doesn't leave that plugged in). I have since justified turning the heater on for shower purposes, but for me - I turn it off as soon as I get out, she leaves it running for 30+ minutes longer. That shit costs money, and it's much more than my usual electric bill. I used to average $60 a month, maybe $85 in the summertime, and since she has moved in it has constantly been above $130. Highest was $190 and I almost had a stroke. It was understood that in order for me to continue letting her rent at only $500 that everything else be kept in check. Other than money reasons, would you not suggest it's common courtesy since she's renting from me and it's my house?  \n\n\nLast night, my SO and I had gotten home first, assuming roomie was at the gym. Nobody was home, we got in the shower, and then got out to go knock out dishes. We were talking about how it just aggravates me that I feel that simple requests go undone, and I said something along the lines of: 'she really has no idea what she's in for when she moves out because $500 all inclusive seems like a steal to me. I don't feel like I'm asking much. Her and (boyfriend) are in for a rude awakening when they come to find out they'll need to work 2-3 jobs and probably still live paycheck to paycheck (because rent in other places outrageous even being a college town). But to each his own'. Now, what I said I don't feel like was mean, but if she DID hear us, she also didn't get the full context of the conversation that we had in the car. I had an extremely bad day, so admittedly my tone probably sounded bossy and distraught. She's not the type to confront me about what she heard, but rather it will go unsaid and there will just be obvious tension. My SO was about 10ft from me in a different room, talking about a different subject, and then he heard her cough. Instant lump in my throat because I want to explain myself based on the misconception of what she may have heard.  \n\n\nNow, I've received feedback stating that maybe I'm just being an overly-OCD asshole landlord, but I don't feel as so. Maybe you can offer more feedback or offer similar situation that you have been in. I really try very hard not to be so nit-picky and asshole-ish, but I feel like my behavior and reactions are justified because it doesn't make sense to hike up my electric bill while her rent would not change.  \n\n\nThoughts?  \n\n\nTL;DR roommate has gotten very lax with her living responsibilities; I have voiced it to my SO many times; we were having an in-depth conversation about her, only to find out she was home the entire time basically and we are 99% sure she heard us. She usually chit chats here and there, and we didn't see her all night and she has left me on read all day. ",

      "description": "When I walk my dog in our suburban neighborhood, if she poops close to home I pick it up in a bag and set the bag next to the sidewalk.  We walk back the same way, between 30-45 minutes later.  I pick up the bag and dispose of it at home.  If she poops farther way or if we aren't walking back the same way, I carry it with me to dispose of at home.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been living in this neighborhood less than 6 months.  Dog poop is a problem.  People leave it in others yards and in the middle of the sidewalk.  It seems that one of my neighbors has a problem with my leaving the bag and returning for it.  She has not spoken with me but apparently has spoken to other neighbors about this concern.  In the past two weeks, my husband and I have both been approached by different neighbors and asked it we clean up after our dog or flatly accused of not picking up.  We came home from a walk the other day and found a pile of 10 filled poop bags in our driveway.  Then yesterday, on our VERY, VERY quite street a police officer drove by (I have never seen one in our subdivision) and stopped to ask how my walk was.  I had just retrieved the bag and was heading home.  His gaze linger on the poop bag.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole?  Is it wrong to leave the bag and retrieve it not an hour later??  It not that its a big deal to carry it, but with heavy gloves and the leash it is inconvenient and awkward.  I don't think I'm in the wrong but AITA?",

Texts wouldn't arrive until hours later, calls would drop within a minute or not go through at all, data just straight up refused to work because it would load so slowly, it would time out continuously. I was shown as having *some* usage, but in reality my plan was unusable.\n\nI documented with screenshots just in case, not really thinking I'd need any proof. But just in case.\n\nA week into my issues, I reached out to the company. They were extremely slow in responding, due to \"being inundated in requests\". By the time they finally got back to me, it was three months later and my original issue had resolved on its own.\n\nI asked if they could credit me two month's worth, since that's what I'd missed out on. Thinking they'd just give it to me, honestly. I've had similar faulty service with other companies and they're happy to just credit you.\n\nSince then, they've asked for proof, then told me my proof is insufficient as I was able to use my plan \"sufficiently\" according to their system, have gone weeks at a time of ignoring me completely, have suggested solutions that were irrelevant by the time they got to me, have been sending my request to \"other departments\" who would then also give me the turnaround.\n\nJust generally have been as unaccommodating as they possibly could be.\n\nFinally, they said fine, we'll compensate you. And then credited me half a month. \n\nI said thank you but I don't think this is sufficient compensation, seeing as I experienced two months of bad service and we're months into this conversation. They responded: normally we don't give anything at all.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting better customer service? I know usually people consider the customer the asshole for wanting more than they paid for. But I did pay for this?? They're making me feel like the villain, maybe I am. \n\nI've been polite in all my communications to them, I don't think that's the issue.",

      "description": "I (19F) have been worried about my best friend and future roommate (18M) for a while. He, I, and our other best friend (18F) are all college \"gifted kid burnouts\". We were all very accomplished in high school (before we knew each other), but also all miserable and without social lives or romantic/sexual experience. My best friend made up for lost time and has hooked up with 30+ guys in the 7 months we've been in college. I've always had a shame complex about sex myself, which led to me promising to save myself for marriage when I was 14. I only took it seriously for about a year, but because those attitudes are still there and I had no life in high school, I'm still a virgin in every sense of the word.\n\nI don't care if he's promiscuous, but the thing is that he has *no* boundaries whatsoever. He doesn't care whether we're in our dorm rooms, walking down the street, on a public bus- he will tell us all the gory details and not give a damn who hears. I don't have a problem with talking about sex (although there are some things I just don't want to hear), but I do worry that people can hear us in public and we seem classless. Between the hypersexuality and the burnout, being trainwrecks is sort of our \"thing\", and it's made us a joke to some other people (there's a story here, but I don't have the character space to tell it- if necessary, I'll elaborate in the comments). I'm worried that we're combining our worst traits together instead of our best.\n\nHowever, my main concern is that my friend's behavior is starting to cross the line from scandalous to unsafe. Then again, meeting strangers for sex is kind of unsafe on its own, but on several occasions he's put himself in danger- most notably, he got drunk with a stranger in a city he didn't know and ended up passing out on a train and waking up in a sketchy area. He's told me that he's had sex without a condom a few times, but insists that he only does so with people who are clean and that \"the risk is so low that it doesn't matter\". Whenever I tell him that a few minutes of pleasure isn't worth his life, he tells me that I \"don't understand and never will\". I'm risk-averse, although not as much as I used to be. As I said, I also had some negative attitudes towards sex. I get that he probably thinks my concern comes from that, but it's really not about the sex, it's about the irresponsibility. He doesn't react well to anyone telling him what to do, and I'm not trying to judge him for his lifestyle, I just really don't want to see him get hurt. Am I right? What can I do?",

      "description": "First Reddit post whew and it’s a long one so buckle in! TL;DR at the bottom. So my bf [21M] and I [20F] have been together for two years. About 6 months ago a friend pointed out to me that my bf’s been almost religiously liking a lot of stereotypical thirst trap Instagram posts (they noticed thanks to the activity tab that lets you see what the people you follow like).\n\nI brought it up to him and mentioned how it made me uncomfortable despite my worry that I was being overly controlling or overly jealous. He said he understood and wouldn’t do it anymore. Fast forward about 4 months and I notice that he’s still liking a lot of those thirst trap type posts AND is being regularly messaged by a girl who is being pretty clear that she’s interested in him (I noticed because my bf and I have each other’s fingerprints on our phones and p regularly use each other’s phones to look up info/music/YouTube videos/etc). I ask him about it and find out that he’s been regularly hanging out with her and was even late to a date 30 min because he was at her place dropping off weed. I doubt he’s doing any of this maliciously and more like he’s kinda just oblivious to how his behavior might be enabling her attention.\n\nWhen I move onto the social media habits again, he reacts dramatically saying “oh I guess I’ll just unfollow ALL my female friends then if it makes you so uncomfortable!” Note: the thirst trap instagrams don’t have any mutuals and they don’t follow him back, but supposedly he knows them somehow. I clarify that it’s not that extreme, I’m only uncomfortable about the obvious thirst traps and not his female friends. He gets mad at me but says he’ll fix it.\n\nFast forward to our 2-year anniversary a week ago, I’m using his phone to scroll through his insta feed and find a pic of a girl using just her hand to cover her boob, check the profile and notice he’s liked maybe 60-70% of her posts similar to this. A lot of my female friends also follow this insta but for her style posts and her vaguely motivational captions, but I dooon’t think that’s the case for him. I ask him about it and remind him we’ve talked about this multiple times already and he once again gets mad at me and storms off.\n\nAITA for voicing that him religiously browsing thirst trap Instagrams makes me uncomfortable and getting upset when he continues to do so despite telling me he’d stop?\n\nTL;DR I told my bf of 2 years that his pretty frequent browsing/liking of thirst trap Instagrams made me uncomfortable. He said he’d stop, continued to do it. Brought it up again, he got mad at me but said he’d fix it and reacted dramatically saying I wanted him to unfollow ALL of the girls he followed, even his friend. He continued to do it and got upset when I brought it up again. Note I wasn’t asking him to unfollow his female friends or girls he knew. Just the thirst trap instagrams who he had no mutuals with and didn’t follow him. AITA?",

      "description": "So, about a year ago i became friends with this gay dude.  Found out a short time later that he had a crush on me.  I let him know that i wasn't interested but that we could remain friends.  He was a fun person to be around and i had a lot of free time then so we hung out a lot.  His family was also very nice to me and often had me over for dinner and treated me like family.  His father even helped me get a better job where he works.  After a few months we became really close friends and i confided in him about a lot of personal stuff and really extended a lot of trust to him however he didn't let the crush go and became secretly obsessed with me throughout this whole time.  \n\nI ended up matching with this super cute girl on Tinder and we really seemed to be hitting it off.  So she gives me her number and we start texting.  Funny enough I come to find out she lives one street over from my friends house.  And my friend says he actually knows her, and that she jogs by his house all the time.  I try to meet up with her but her mother is dying of cancer and something always happens where she has to go be with her or help her when we were gonna meet up.  Of course i'm understanding of this i can't imagine what she must be going through etc.  She doesn't want to talk on the phone just keeps saying we'll meet up soon, this goes on for maybe a couple weeks, and things are starting to get fishy.  My friend tells me that he saw her at the store and started talking to her and brings me up.  She ends up hanging out with him a couple times when i'm conveniently busy or at work and then she would start talking about my friend with me and get super angry and stop talking to me for supposedly talking shit about him, even though i didn't.  But then he would talk to her and tell her what a wonderful person i was etc etc and she would give me another chance or whatever.  And i'm kind of getting fed up with this shit but at the same time I think that with her mother dying and all she's just having a rough time with it all.  So then one night i'm at my friends house and had a few drinks, so i'm staying the night and me and her are texting and she starts getting sexual.  But then it takes a twist when she starts to say that my friend, her and I should have a threesome.  Which i quickly shoot down.  So she says that I should just let him suck my dick and it would be real nice of me and that she'll make it worth my while etc.  So i'm weirded the fuck out now and know somethings up, So I confront my friend and he says he doesn't know he didn't tell her anything etc etc.  Still know somethings up, and I bring it up to one of his longtime friends and she tells me that he still has a crush on me and that he's catfishing me and that he's done this before.  So i immediately call him and confront him about it and threaten to cut him off cold unless he confesses the truth, and after 30 minutes of denying it, he finally confesses to making the whole thing up, he used some french instagram models pics and lied about her mother having cancer and everything.  \n\nTurns out he's a crazy compulsive liar.  So i'm furious and feel like a chump and don't talk to him for a week, he keeps trying to apologize and tell me he understands if i never want to talk to him again and he never meant for it to get that far he was only trying to make me feel good about myself that such a cute girl would be interested in me (which i don't need and it's a crock of shit) and all this i know i messed up crap.  \n\nNow his parents don't know he's gay and that any of this transpired and he tells me if i tell them why we're not friends anymore and out him that he's going to tell everyone what i told him (my brother is gay and my parents are super religious and would throw him out, and a bunch of other just personal things) And that if i embarrassed him he would do that to me and get me fired (His father is close friends with my boss and they talk as well).  So i tell him i'm not going to out him and end up staying kind of uneasy friends that drags on for a while cause i'm afraid that i'm going to lose my job if i cut him off, so that was 6 months ago but he's actually been better and his family has been very kind to me but I don't consider him a real friend, and i'm basically just pretending to be friends at this point and enjoying the perks (he has a pool) and knows a lot of people and cute girls i can get to easier.  He definitely has his issues but i think he might actually consider me a friend, I don't want him around long term but based on what i've seen how he's treated ex-friends i'm afraid of what he might do if i ditch him.  I should've just cut him off right after this happened but i didn't.  I thought i'd use him as revenge.  I'm passed that point i just don't care anymore but until i get a new job and other circumstances in life change I'm worried he might open his mouth, so i'm pretending be his friend to keep his mouth shut.\n\nSo, AITA for pretending to be his friend despite what he's done?  Even if he has (maybe) changed?",

      "description": "So this is an argument that comes up whenever my mom (50)talks about how she found out she was pregnant with me (M 22). The way she tells the story is that one night she got super drunk and the next morning she forgot to take her birth control because of how hungover she was. Now she says that she would’ve eventually married my dad if he asked but made it clear that I “sped things up by quite a bit”. She often tells this story to her friends when they discuss pregnancy. This has always made me uncomfortable but I think the worst time was this weekend. She used this as an example to my sister and her friends (F 17-20) about how if they’re not sure if they’ve taken their birth control that day to take another so they don’t get pregnant. To me I feel like she’s saying I was an accident and that if she had a chance to relieve that day she would’ve taken her pill so she wouldn’t have gotten pregnant. This happened this weekend and we  actually got into a shouting match about it. My sister and her friends dipped at this point but we argued for about 10 mins before I left. She says I’m over reacting and that it’s a cute story and not to worry about it. My dad thinks I should apologize but I don’t think I’m in the wrong. AITA? \n\nTLDR: My mom tells a story that makes it seem like I was a mistake and if she could go back she would’ve made sure she didn’t get pregnant with me. ",

      "title": "AITA for refusing to babysit for distant relatives, because they don't allow me to discipline their kids? (Majority of my extended family seems to think so)",
      "description": "I first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**",

(worth noting, we don't live together, the ice cream is very much mine)\n\nBf asks if he can have one, I say no that was the last one, he wants to share it, I do not because I am weird about eating foods other people have touched, some sort of anxiety thing idk. Anyway, he says I'm being selfish and mean and greedy, and he tries to take it off me. I push him off me, and he tells me off for hitting him and being horrible. I'm crying again now.\n\nIn the end, I feel awful and give it to him. After the fact I tired to discuss that his actions upset me and I don't think it's normal adult behaviour to be so petulant, but he asks me to stop because I'm upsetting him and it's not fair that I'm \"making out he's abusive\" and making him the villain.\n\nSo, objective observers, am I the villain? should I have just shared the ice lolly in the beginning? more low stakes than some of the stuff on here I guess lol\n\n",

      "title": "AITA - Dumping my GF after feeling abandoned",
      "description": "Story goes like this: We had been dating for about half a year (Give or take) and my gf at the time was doing theater in Bern. I'm not a big fan of it myself, but I did like her singing, so I would make time to go see her whenever she had practice or a show.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was December, and I had caught a pretty bad cough combined with mild pneumonia. Stayed at home for a good while, and ended up missing a lot of the performances she does around Christmas. Eventually, as I got better, she started to approach the subject of coming to a specific play of hers they had been preparing for a while. I was against it initially, since my cough had adamantly refused to go away, and my throat still hurt. Eventually I caved to the puppy-eyes routine. And on the day in question, dressed up like a conservative Eskimo and had a friend drive me to the station. Weather outside was awful, and as luck would have it the train stopped halfway due to \"technical difficulties\". I was going to be late. I called my gf to inform her of this, and she was livid. I had missed performances before, a lot of the time due to work or other shenanigans, and she would often accuse me of making up excuses to avoid having to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was very firmly in the \"I'm doing this for you even though I'm sick, so stop giving me shit.\"-Camp. She's having none of it. Eventually it turns into an argument and she hangs up in a huff. When I actually got there (Think it was about halfway into the play) the guy at the front is not letting me in. Invitation had been revoked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the play finally ended, and I got a hold of her, we were now both mad. I was feeling much worse again and really wanted to go home and she was still upset that I had missed all of the play. Eventually, she makes a big thing of leaving with an actor friend of hers, and leaves me standing there. And I don't have money for a ticket back. Cue an hour of texting, ducking into stores to not stand outside, and eventually getting hold of a friend, who despite the apocalyptic weather, came and picked me up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGF is not responding to texts. At that point, I actually got worried. Since the weather was so bad, maybe they had an accident? Nope. Around 90 minutes or so after the whole thing I get a pretty picture from a party they're having. Complete with guilt-trip inducing \"You could've been here you know.\" / \"I Hope you rethink our relationship\". That was the tipping point. I did rethink our relationship. When I got home with buddy, we rounded up all of her stuff and I told her she could pick it up later or the day after, and then get of my life. I made a point of ignoring all of her attempts at getting in touch afterwards, which I'll freely admit, meant I was burning all of the bridges out of spite. But I still absolutely believe this is her being the Ass, and I was justified. Am I wrong?",

      "description": "My two longterm best friends (lets call them B and C) and I have been talking about doing a trip to Peru together as a last hoorah since B and I will be moving away in a couple months to start new jobs. We haven’t really done much actual planning yet but we know we’re gonna go. \n\nC recently got into a new relationship a few months ago and has been in a serious honeymoon phase. Honestly, I didn’t really like C’s new SO because their relationship started off with her doing some sketchy things that hurt C, and also because the SO has never really tried to become friends with me. But I tried to respect them and give them space to develop their relationship even if I kind of disapproved (C is a great person, and honestly... I thought he could do better). \n\nSo anyways we’re finally planning our trip when C mentions that the SO has always wanted to hike Machu Picchu. C then says that they feel bad that they’re leaving their new SO for several weeks for the trip, and that they want to bring them. My immediate reaction is to say no, because this was supposed to be a friends goodbye trip. C then disagrees and says they just thought it was just any other trip together, and he should be allowed to bring his SO because we hadn’t planned anything official yet.  I was hurt by this but also upset because I didn’t like his SO and when they’re together they disappear into a bubble and ignore everyone around them. And I didn’t want that to happen on our last trip together before B and I moved away. Worst of all, C’s SO hadn’t even asked to come on the trip and didn’t have any idea that C and I were fighting about this.  \n\nBoth B and I are in longterm relationships, and we never planned on asking our SO’s to come because we both thought it was a friends trip. But C really feels they have every right to bring their SO. But I’m putting my foot down and saying no. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for considering ghosting my “friend”?",
      "description": "So, buckle up for a long story. \n\nI met my boyfriend 2 years ago, and honestly? We’ve had ups and downs. He was in a rough school, and being that he is pretty socially awkward, he ended up making the situation doubly difficult. I was pushing overtime in a job I hated as to support our relationship and my hobbies while he managed part-time during school. Well, he had a spat with our mutual friend over something trivial and they fell out of “best friend” status; but, not long before, said friend and I had loosely become acquainted. We’ll call him.....Charles. \n\nCharles and I shared a few similar interests like: cosplay, manga, anime, and big-tiddy anime women. He also made a point most often that he was NOT looking to seek a girl out after his last abusive relationship and WOULDN’T be because he’s looking to improve himself. Cool by me, I thought, because I’m happily with my boyfriend still and didn’t ever even consider him anything more than a friend. We talked a lot, exchanged numbers so we could carpool, and even hung out many occasions as a trio. My boyfriend, Charles, and I, that is. We’d all grab breakfast, Charles would tell me about day-to-day stresses and we’d have a laugh. \n\nFlash forward, my boyfriend graduates school and I get sick. Very sick. It turns out it’s nothing more than an unchecked gluten/dairy intolerance mixed with a bad combo of Too-Much-Stress-And-Not-Enough-Eating-itis. I’m on short term leave, and since my boyfriend moves to full-time work, Charles and I chill out more one on one.\n\nKeep in mind, things are still very platonic and trivial. Dude talks to me namely about OCs, his stories, his campaigns for us/his other DND groups, etc. It’s fun up until the point where he starts divulging personal information to me. I don’t care about discussing fetishes or one coping with them (I used to write/draw graphic furry porn for friends to help fund food money for cons. I don’t judge) and I made it a point to explain why I don’t mind someone explaining their kinks to me. Though, due to previous Nice Guy experiences, I did add that his kinks “were seriously not my thing” and ensured him not to worry so much what I thought because “Dude, you’re not my type. It doesn’t even matter how I feel about them.” \n\nHe gets shifty and quiet and we drop the topic, with the exception of occasionally bringing it up in teasing jabs or jokes.\n\nWell, another month passes. I officially leave my job, Charles goes through more Drama(tm), and I enroll in an accelerated Technician program with part-time work and part-time volunteering. My boyfriend and I move in together. I get a Wolfe Spider as a pet. My current fur-trio doesn’t care in the slightest. Life gets busy, and frankly? Between the two boys, I don’t have many friends. I’m just too over-worked. I spend 90% of my time with my partner, then 10% of the time occasionally messaging Charles.\n\nBad luck strikes again, my first car, which was pre-owned and mine for three years, ends up catching on fire. This one wasn’t my mistake, but our tower’s folly. Okay. Fine. Awful timing, I’ll go pick up another used car to last me a few years and then I’ll chug along. Well. The second car overheats and melted the motor partially; the overall cost to replace the motor is double the amount I’d purchased it for, so it’s a no-go there. Foolish me, I’d done a quick test drive on it, checked under the hood, and didn’t see any immediate red flags. Also, it was a dream model of car, and although older, looked to be in great condition so I think my bias got the best of me.\n\nFound out a fan was out of place, hence why it overheated. And, I had no warranty or insurance on it, so that money was lost. I’m out 2 cars, make significantly less money due to shortened hours/less wages, and to top it all off, I ended up fracturing my coccyx two days after I received the news over the phone.\n\nBut, after I got the first wave of “your cars are fucked, I’m sorry, ma’am” from the mechanics, I thought “Screw it, I’ll take a breather and grab breakfast with my only irl friend”. He’s worried, as I’m plainly distressed in text, and we meet up for breakfast a few hours later.\n\nIt gets weird. \n\nDude immediately goes off, talking in an almost dismissive manner to me and referring to me as “Mrs. [Boyfriend’s Last Name]”. It’s weird. I tell him to stop because it’s aggravating, we’re not married, and we’re not considering the option for a good while. Not till things settle down. He starts telling me about his OCs again, like old times, and the breakfast almost seems to be hitting a normal tune when he dead-ass stops and stares me down. He then mentions that he’s started this new work-out regime with added supplements that seem to really “pump him up”.\n\nTo which then, he adds,”They make me want to fuck you right now.” \n\nAs you can imagine, conversation thins out. We leave shortly thereafter. He insists on a “hug”, and I give a half-assed side one out of courtesy when I really should have declined. I’m super uncomfortable now, especially considering he’d mentioned once before about having a “rape dream”. It made sense at the time because his then girlfriend had a rape/non-con roleplay fetish, and it worked for them. Not me. Not my style. \n\nOf course, two days later, I seemed to have fractured my coccyx by falling flat on my ass from a very loving, too large puppy jumping on me. \n\nHe sends me some more OC shit that I’d mentioned sounded cool. I’m sore, I don’t reply. Next day, I’m working on getting my cars towed and scrapped. It’s hectic. I’m scrambling to find titles, pay the mechanic, organize school stuff, and figure out work plans since I work in a physical field and being physically injured kind of puts a damper on that. \n\nHe sends me another thing. I reply with “hey I’m busy breaking bones I’ll respond later” because I overdid it walking back and forth, assisting/talking with the tow man, and I’m stressed beyond reason. (Admittedly, I should have just left it on a “Sorry, just busy” note”) Not to mention, what had only been an ache before has since become a splitting pain along my back and in my leg. He presses on and on, trying to get me to discuss more of the situation, before finally resorting to asking my boyfriend. \n\nOnce he gets the news, he then proceeds to call me “overdramatic” and claim “It’s my loss” for not wanting to talk more about his OCs. \n\nI’m pissed and still at a loss from our previous “chat”, so Reddit.....what’s your thoughts? Am I the asshole for thinking it’s time to just drop this dude out of my life? Am I really just being overdramatic or is my being upset legitimate?\n",

      "description": "I broke up with him last January (over a year ago!) and it was... messy in a weird way.  We still had to live together until April when I could move out - he was surprised at my final goodbye, thinking that I'd be back after handing in my keys and taking all my stuff for some reason (him?).\n\nWe then had issues getting our deposit back, which resulted in communication again for \\~3 weeks every few days, after not being in touch for a couple months (he also deleted me on steam etc).  Deposit finally got sorted, so I thought that would be the end of it back in August.\n\nCome Christmas, he wished me a good one.  Same for new years, and then again for my birthday last month.  My issue - I've said thanks to them, and I remember last year he was super offended when I didn't wish him happy birthday despite him being a dick and we'd just broken up.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I be an asshole to just not message him?  I know he'll be offended and angry, but at the end of the day I don't want to communicate with him, but feel like an asshole because he's messaged me for every holiday, and he also doesn't have many friends to wish him one which makes me feel guilty about it.\n\nThanks!",

      "description": "I’ve (M18) known this girl (F21) for almost three years. The first year I had a crush on her but after some realization decided that she’s better to me as a friend. She’s a very flirtatious person, which isn’t necessarily bad in my opinion but she’d go pretty far with it even if she was in a relationship. She once said that she wishes she could keep all her guy friends on a leash. \n\n\nAnyway, she’s a “Christian” and she’s very hypocritical like telling her ex boyfriend to be more Godly then followed by her cheating on him. I’m a Christian myself so I personally find this behavior insulting to her Faith.\n\n\nBut then she tries to get with me, while she’s still dating this guy. They break up, she then starts dating this guy not even a month after and is still continuing her overtly physical flirtatiousness with every guy she finds attractive, including me. \n\n\nThis had caused her so many problems throughout the years I’ve known her and I’ve stood by her side as a friend. I was her most consistent friend and people consider me her best friend.\n\n\nThen the final straw: while we were hanging out I was showing our friend group music I was working on. One of the songs caught her interest and I confessed to her that the song was written about her when I had a crush on her. She gets a little teary eyed but we move on. Hours pass, we’re all having a good time, it’s getting late and I have to go home. She gives me one of the biggest hugs, but I felt something quite strange. She kissed me on the neck, with her current boyfriend in the same area. She did it in a way that might’ve been hard to spot from his position. \n\nI had no idea how to react, I know it was a kiss but sometimes I can’t tell if it was her or my brain, almost as if my brain is gas lighting me.\n\nAt this point I decided to not talk to her anymore. She’s been trying to contact me through calls and texts for 4 months but not once have I responded. \n\nKnowing her, she probably misses me, and is probably sad and confused (or atleast pretending to be confused, idk)\n\nI don’t wish the worst for her, but I felt like I didn’t wanna be involved in her shenanigans again. At the rate we were going I felt like I’d either become like her or end up married to her at 30.\n\nI felt like me giving her attention was enabling her toxic behaviors, so for her sake and mine I left.\n\nSo, AITA for cutting ties with her?",

      "description": "Okay so this is a bit of a long one, there will be a tl;dr though. \nI am a 17 year old female living with my parents, but in October a good friend of mine, we’ll call her S, was kicked out by her mom while she was sleeping over at my house. Her family is more than a little dysfunctional, mostly they’re just over dramatic stoners who act like high schoolers. \n\nS is 19, so she is decently independent at school and works for my mom now, at a nice jewelry store. Long story short, S moves in with me and we got her out of a bad situation as best as we could. \n\nS has not been grateful whatsoever, constantly complains, misses curfew almost every single night, doesn’t clean up after herself, has been disrespectful of our house rules (which we made sure she knew before moving in), has raised her voice and yelled at me in front of my mom, is causing her boyfriend to skip school and spend all of his money buying her fast food, and is upset that she’s gone from a size 3 to a size 8 because she won’t eat anything at home. \n\nI completely understand that she’s very stressed and I’ve always tried to be someone she could talk to, lean on, etc. But the constant stress from her actions has been emotionally draining for me and my family, and we think it’s time she leave and try to move in with her sister. Her sister said that she could move in with her but it would be inconvenient. It’s not like we would be putting S on the street, but she’s been so rude and treats every kindness like an expectation. \n\nI feel horrible, she really was a good friend and we all just wanted her out of her old situation but we had no idea she would act like this, I’ve done everything I can think of to be a good friend, and help in any way I can. I know her life is hard. \n\nWhat really became the head of the situation was yesterday she had made me late for school, again (S always wakes up late and refuses to leave without doing her makeup, she also doesn’t have a license or a car) and I complained about it to my boyfriend, who is best friends with her boyfriend. My boyfriend brought up that S was the reason we weren’t there yet again, and S’s boyfriend blew up in my boyfriends face, saying that we were both liars and that S had told him that I was always the late one and that I was an awful housemate. \n\nS then turned up to first period, which we share, and just started berating me about how I’ve driven a wedge between our boyfriends and they shouldn’t have to deal with our problems, and then said that I talk about her all the time and told me a bunch of crazy lies that she’s “heard me saying”. She said I treat her like the plague and that I make everything about me, despite the fact that I actively avoid bringing up my ptsd to anyone other than a therapist. She got really upset when I tried to defend myself by saying I don’t talk about her to anyone other than her, and that one offhand comment about her making me late for school nearly every day for three months. So then, she started to cry and loudly say awful things about me in front of a class of people at 7 AM. \n\nI was so angry and upset that my friend has acted this way that I just left and did all the work in another class period. My best friend told me that I’m not in the wrong because I’ve had several friends live with me, but none have treated me like this and My family has been extremely accommodating. \n\nI know this is all stupid high school stuff and I don’t even like talking about it because it feels so juvenile but, I can’t help thinking that my family doesn’t deserve this. I have a huge tendency to blame myself for things like this. I understand it could be because of her family and her stress, but it was a really humiliating experience and she hasn’t even tried to apologize. \n\n\nTL;DR: friend who comes from a bad home life moves in with us, breaks all of our rules, complains constantly, lies about me to other people, has convinced her boyfriend that my boyfriend and I lie about her, disrespects my parents, and attempts to humiliate me in front of 30 other peers. We feel awful because we did invite her here, but I think maybe she should move in with her sister and so do my parents.",

Did an unpaid internship for 7 months then a low paying position with another startup for 9 months.\n\nI've been struggling with finding a a better overall position and I finally passed the interview process elsewhere. They wanted to see some samples of my recent code so I took some basic code I've written from my current position and privately displayed it to their lead. Once they sent me the job offer, I put in my 2 weeks.\n\nI told my boss/ceo about the process and how I used some code snippets. He was cool with it at first but a week later, I guess he told the CTO and he flipped out.\n\nMy final day was Friday with the flexibility of working next week if I wanted extra $ but now they're cutting it down to Thursday. I'm told that I broke their NDA and if I asked permission it wouldn't have been an issue. They said the code that I shared was nothing critical but I still broke a legal contract. CEO said he could write a cease and desist letter but probably don't think they have to.\n\nCEO went on to say that he feels like he has the moral obligation to notify my future employer about this situation but at this point he won't. He personally feels betrayed by my actions.\n\nI apologized and mentioned that i may not fully understand their perspective. I didn't do anything maliciously but I messed up. I feel bad that he feels betrayed but I'm honestly feeling like he tried to make me feel as shitty as possible. Threatening future employment really hurt me.\n\nMaybe there's a perspective I'm not understanding.\n\nAITA?",

I knew we had a couple pints of ice cream in the freezer, and really was craving one, and mentioned that to see if that was preferable. She said no, she would rather go get froyo, which I was fine with so I agreed. About 5 min later, she asked if it would be ok to pick it up and bring it back to the apartment to eat, which of course it is. This is where the fight started. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince we were going to be bringing it home, and since I still preferred the pint in the freezer, I said Id like to eat that while she eats the froyo. I figured it wouldn't matter since we both get what we want and we are still eating dessert together. But apparently not. This led to a meltdown and me being called \"selfish\" and that I should just get what she wants and that what I wanted was not the same. Further, this led to her saying in the heat of the moment that \"things aren't working out.\" This morning things have cooled down but she still contends I committed some kind of terrible sin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still bewildered by this reasoning and why it mattered so wondering if others can give me some clarity. For context, the prior part of the day had been very stressful for the both of us, and I am suspecting that probably played a significant role in the reaction, although she denies that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey, so for context I have been dating my boyfriend for ~2 years and we have a “closed” (monogamous) relationship. All the people involved in the post are college-aged but very childish (which will become clear after reading the post).\n\nI’m actually very happy in the relationship and I think he is as well. He is definitely too good for me (haha) and I am very lucky to be his girlfriend.\n\nMy only legitimate complaint is with his opinion on physical affection. Apparently I’m being “such a tease” when I initiate physical affection but don’t want sex. It’s not like he tries to force me into it, but he is kind of pouty when I decline. I’ll just want some snuggles and maybe a kiss or two and then he’ll try to initiate sex. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but the best I have gotten is just tolerating him feeling me sexually and calling it “cuddling”.\n\nI kinda gave up on non sexual physical affection with him, but it’s pretty important for me personally. *Cue my genius idea of getting non-sexual physical affection from friends.*\n\nObviously it’s inappropriate to do this with people in public, so 3 close friends and I have these movie/snuggle parties at one friend’s house. \n\nIt’s really cute and I love doing them, but I am starting to have second thoughts about if this is appropriate to do in a relationship. In addition to group things, I have cuddled with a male friend when it was just the two of us. \n\nThere was never anything that was non-platonic, but things got really physical when we had a ‘tickle fight.’ I want to reiterate that there wasn’t even a little  sexual tension, I just feel like I may have let things go a little too far during the tickle fight. I feel extra guilty because I never told my boyfriend about these things because I thought that it would either only make him feel bad unnecessarily or he wouldn’t care.\n\nObviously I am planning on telling him what happened, but what kind of reaction should I expect? AMITA for doing these things? Would it be asshole-ish to ask if I can still have the snuggle parties but just be more clear on what is/is not acceptable to do?",

He’s just turned 21 and she’s 20. They live on the other side of the country and when I met G, I noticed a few red flags. She used to get ‘hangry’ and rage at everything. After she ate, she would calm down. One time, she snooped through my mums belongings and stole a pair of earrings because ‘they were just so cute.’ While she was here, she refused to wear a bra/underwear and would only wear see-through clothes or a tshirt. She has breast implants and likes to show them off.\n\nShe has been in debt for a while, because she was in three seperate car accidents (she faked all her hours before getting her license.) instead of paying off that debt, she’s become addicted to online shopping, considering it a great deal to get free shipping, or 10% off an item.\n\nA few months back she requested money off my parents because she became uncomfortable in the place they lived at. We later found out, it’s because she thought she was too cool for that suburb and wanted to live in a ‘trendy area.’\n\nShe has accidentally showed nudes around to my brothers friends. She flirts with his boss and other colleagues. She will not stop posting pictures of her in underwear on Instagram. Just this morning, she posted about buying a brand new iPhone! She’s in lots of debt to lots of different people... She doesn’t understand how to save money and had her credit cards frozen because she couldn’t make any afterpay repayments.\n\nI know B would be much better off without her... she’s trouble all around and my mother believes we have to let him ‘make the mistakes and learn for himself.’ I think that’s bullshit, I think he needs to be rescued from that horrible situation before he becomes homeless.\n\nSo tldr, my brothers girlfriend is in major debt, doesn’t seem to act loyal, posts sexually suggestive pictures, gets aggressive when hungry and is dragging my brother down with her.\n\nI desperately want them to break up so he can move on and start doin right by himself. Does it make me the asshole for hoping they split? Even if it would make my brother unhappy?",

He frequently buys old, run down cars (we have 7 cars at home right now, not a single one was manufactured in the past 10 years, most of them are 1980-2000s cars, 3 of them don't run. We also have 2 cars in the back yard, and neither of them run.) and he frequently brings in old furniture/refuses to throw away old furniture. This wouldn't be too much of an issue for me normally, I don't mind people's hobbies and if he wants to collect stuff, sure, whatever. The problem comes up because our home is extremely small. We have a tiny backyard, we have little to no room in our actual home because it's so crowded, and our garage has been turned into my dad's office space. To make room for all the extra junk my parents have, we had to build two closed off decks that have file cabinets full of things like plates, cooking ware, bowls, cups, tools, etc. Him buying any extra cars or furniture takes up what little space we have left. My mom and I have expressed this to him many times, but each time he just dismisses us and ignores us. He sometimes even shushes us.\n\nMy dad also doesn't work close to home. He works in NorCal (we live in SoCal) and we either visit him or he comes back home around 2-3 times a month. He came back for Thanksgiving on Wednesday. Today, somehow, he picked up a wood and glass display cabinet from who knows where, and I lost it. I yelled at him.\n\n\"Why do you even need these things? What the fuck are we going to do with a glass display cabinet? What are we going to put in there? And just because something is free doesn't mean you should take it. What if we want to move some place else? Have you considered that your shit would make it harder to move? What about your cars? You spend thousands of dollars on these shitty beater cars that you might as well just buy a new car at that point! This is a problem you have and you need to stop, because I'm fucking sick and tired of you bringing in shit that you never use!\" I also threatened to take an axe to whatever he brings in from off the street, and break the windows of any \"new\" cars he buys.\n\nAITA for screaming at him like that? I dislike his hobby and I think it is in no way helpful to us, but I feel like I could have been nicer about it or handled it better.",

      "description": "Made some girl really mad. \n\nMy college dorm has 6 washers and only 4 dryers. Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?",

When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don’t know how my parents didn’t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She’s come a really long way since then and I’m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I’ve never been depressed or self harmed so I’m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can’t even begin to imagine her point of view.\n\nHowever around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it’s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I’m being selfish by saying that because it’s not about me but it’s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I’m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don’t know how to fix this and I need to know if I’m being unreasonable.",

      "description": "Let me preface this a little. \n\nI graduated college a semester early and moved back home while job shadowing and waiting to get into grad schools. Since I have no money, my parents are actually paying for what I used at college (ie- rent, utilities). I have lived with my roommates for a couple years. Every summer, we agreed that the roommate who lives there pays the utilities that are fluid, meaning they change with amount of usage. These utilities are- gas, water, electric. \n\nSo, since I have moved home, my roommates are still wanting me to pay 1/3 of the gas, water, and electric. I said no because my parents are already letting me live here rent free and paying for what I use here. I also do not contribute to the usage of said utilities, so the **prices went down**. They said that they were not \"comfortable\" paying 50/50 because it was not fully discussed, even though we have done this the past two summers. AITA here???? I have not used any water, gas, or electric, so I am actually confused as to why I should be paying? I told them I would pay the bills that didn't fluctuate, because I thought that was fair since we all signed off on Wifi/cable. I am trying to discuss this with them, but they just don't respond, except for saying they are not comfortable paying it. \n\nAlso, just to add, one roommate has a bf that essentially lives there without actually being on the lease. He does not go to school, and sits in the house most dat. He uses MUCH more water, gas, and electric than me, so why is he getting it for free?\n\nIf anyone can contribute feedback or solution I would really appreciate it! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR i am not using utilities so why should I have to contribute?

      "description": "Hello. First-time poster on this subreddit. Whole story first, then a TL;DR.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA while ago my parents had the mother of one of my friends over. We're all pretty good friends, and talk as if we had been friends for a long time. My parents mainly invite them over for game night, but it's basically \"Smoke, chat and play a little\" night between my parents and my friend's mom, while me and my friend actually participate in playing video games. Overall, they're all pretty chill. So, while they were all playing Mario Kart on the switch (I sat out so my dad could play), my friend's little sister (About 1-2 at the time. Currently walking pretty well.) was trying to grab a PSVR headset that we had on a stand fairly low to the ground, and I would move her hands away. Now, I admit that I could've just moved the headset, but that thought hasn't occurred to me until writing this post. After a while of moving her hands away, she looks at me for about 5 seconds, smiles, and sits down, and lays down. Now she didn't do this very quickly, but to everybody who was staring at the TV (Which the PSVR headset and my friend's little sister was very close to) I could see how it looked like I pushed her, and she fell (Not to mention the fact that they were all high besides my friend.) They ask if I push her, (Which I deny pushing her) and about 5-15 minutes later, they leave and I get a text from my friend which reads: \"Dude staright you lied to your parents about pushing (Her sister). I saw you push her, and the fact that you lied about it makes me sick. THat's why we left early. You can't be treating (Her sister) like she is some dog. (Next text) I don't know what your problem is but don't ever treat (Her sister) like that again.\" Now, at this point I was very upset because I was worried about losing friends. I show my dad the message, and he sends one for me pretending to be me: \"I understand. I told mom and dad that I did after you left. I mad a mistake and was afraid to be in trouble. I make mistakes a lot and it's embarrassing. I'm very sorry (Next text) I want being as careful as I should've. Sry you're upset\" Now, I hate being wrongly accused of things I didn't do, so I was protesting with my parents that I didn't push her, and my parents were on my side. We made up a month or two later, but I denied ever pushing her with my parents. Whilst we were making up, I ended up saying that I was sorry for pushing her, even though I knew I probably shouldn't have, and still protested against saying sorry to my parents before they came over. Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Parents invited friends over. I tried to keep friend's very little sister from touching and breaking an expensive item. Friend's very little sister falls over while I'm trying to keep her away from the item, friends leave, and I get in trouble. Parents are on my side though. I make up with friends, but I am very angry that I have to apologize for something I didn't do. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Tldr at the bottom. First off a bit of context (also on mobile so I apologize in advance for formatting): \nI'm in 10th grade and recently had to do a group project in one of my classes. Now in the past, I had a friend (I'll call him Carl) who used to be my best friend (since 2nd grade). I'd say we had a little too many altercations over time to be considered best friends anymore but we still talk a little. \n\nSo first period, my teacher says we have to do a group project (we had to make an infographic type thing on a subject). Carl asks if I want to work with him, I say sure. First day, we do research, find all the definitions and stuff and we're done. The next day, I start on the final product while Carl sits there on his phone for the entire hour and a half. I tell him he needs to work on his portion at home since he didn't do it in class, he agrees. Day before its due, we have a midterm so we don't work on it in class. I tell him to do it since we only have one day left. Later that night, I call him (seeing that he hasn't done it yet) and tell him to do it or I'm taking his name off the project. \n\nNow normally, I'd be fine with finishing the project on my own and putting his name on it, but there was a LOT if information to cover. He says ok, but still doesn't do it. \n\nAt this point, I'm taking to my other friend who I'll call George. I mention the project to George and he says he completely forgot about it (keep in mind it's due the next day). I offer to put his name on the project and remove Carl's name (since I already warned Carl) in return for him helping me finish. He agrees, we finish the project (he did more work than Carl did throughout the whole week). \n\nNow the next day, today, comes along. The project is due at the end of the day, and I have not told Carl that I removed his name from the project. Selfish me wants to just let him get the zero as a wake up call to do his work but the other part of me wants to tell him so he can at least turn something in. \n\nSo the question is, AITA for not telling Carl that I replaced him?\n\nTldr; Friend asks me to do a project, makes me do all the work, told him I would remove his name if he didn't do his part, replaced him with other friend who helped me finish. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm M22, She's f20. Been together for about 6 months and she likes getting gifts so I knew she'd want something for V day plus dinner. I got her a charm from pandora for her bracelet and a ring from pandora, few roses, card, small teddy bear and a card and paid for dinner last night at a decent restaurant. She really liked all of this and I think I went over board but I really like her so I wanted it to be special for her. When we got back to my place I was kinda expecting her to give me a card or something at the very least seeing I just spent around $400 on her. But she just gave me head and we banged and that was it. \n\nThis morning I mentioned that it would have been nice if she got me something and she got defensive saying that girls don't usually get guys anything (she said that because this is my first relationship) and that she's a student and doesn't have that much money and I work full time making good money. I kinda got sad but said ahhh ok and left it at there but I've been being dry to her today and she's been calling me an asshole and pussy for wanting something for V Day. She is a student but her parents give her a lot of money and how expensive would a card have been $2? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

I sent him a message saying that I don’t think it’s fair how much I have to do around the house (because I have to do a lot and I feel like I have to fill the position of “housewife” when I’m at his house.) and he stormed into my room right after he read it and basically told me he thinks he has to do everything. I*have*been slowing down on how much I do because well I do have things to do and I’m just so tired of it, it’s been happening since 2017 and I was only 12 then, but I still do so much and he verbally berated me telling me how little I do and that he has to do so much and I’m just complaining over nothing and I don’t do anything to help  (and I did follow up with a sibling because I did want to make sure other people did see what I was doing and my sibling agreed with me that I do do a lot) but after simply voicing my complaints he went after me and made me feel like shit even though I know I’m doing stuff and then he told me I’m the reason he’s been so upset these last couple days (he didn’t mean it in a caring way, he meant it in “I’m a burden” way) and then he made some more passive aggressive remarks and slammed my door like a child. I’m 14 (barely) and he’s 54. I was really upset after that obviously and I started talking to my mom about living with her full time, I’m just so done with my dad, he demands that I do everything a maternal figure would do, take care of his son, clean his fucking kitchen, make dinner for 5 people just when he doesn’t feel like it. And he’ll make me make him like breakfast when he just doesn’t feel like cooking and he does it only to me, just me, out of 4 kids, he just chooses me. And then he tells me I do nothing. I hate his house and I hate him. Am I just being an asshole or is there any merit to what I’m saying? ",

      "description": "A bit of backstory: I (16f) started smoking about a year and a half ago after an incident with an ex boyfriend left me with some pretty bad anxiety, especially at school. I picked up smoking as a coping mechanism, but dropped it for a while in favor of vaping. When I dated my current boyfriend for the first time (May-Aug last year), I wasn't smoking very often because I was in a pretty good place, mentally. I picked it up again in September because stress and it's way cheaper to buy a pack of smokes than it is to buy a bottle of vape juice. \n\nWe got back together in January of 2019 and I can tell he wants me to quit, even if he won't say it to my face. I don't really smoke when it's just him and I, but he still knows I do it. I've been playing dumb as much as possible but I know he wants me to quit, but I don't want to have to argue it with him or try to convince him why I smoke, he knows that I've been through a fair bit of trauma and that school is a big source of anxiety for me. I go through about half a pack on a bad day, so my habit isn't nearly as substantial as some of the people I know.\n\nRecently, I filled my friend in on the situation, and he told me that I'm being a bitch for continuing to smoke and not stopping out of courtesy for my boyfriend, so I'm asking the good people of reddit to help me settle this one.\n\nAm I the Asshole for playing dumb about the situation?",

      "description": "For clarity my youngest sister was adopted from my family because my uncle and his wife both cannot conceive children. My uncle has three children including my sister that he has adopted from our side and his in laws. Uncle owns his own computer retail and repair shop, so hes well off.\n\nMy younger sister has always been a soft spot for my mom. Initially she didnt really want to give up my younger sister but had made a promise to her father that if she does ever give birth to another child that she would let her older brother adopt them. Being a woman of culture and of her word, when she gave birth my grandma took my little sister away making her my legal cousin.\n\nEvery year like clockwork, since my sisters birth my parents have always sent birthday gifts, christmas gifts, etc. My uncle understood and is cool with it, my sister always elated because theyre gifts. It never bothered me because i once took a trip home and we got along well.\n\nHowever, recently i feel like my sisters starting to become a brat about it. Her sister just recently gave birth and now that theres a new baby in the picture my uncle has tightened his purse strings so to say. Ive since learned that my younger sister, who used to ask for things through me, has now gone over my head to tell my older sister to ask my mom to send her things. I know its because i stopped relaying her message, but only because her requests came too often and were too expensive. \n\nMy mom and i argued because i noticed her online shopping had become ridiculous and she informed me that its all stuff for my younger sister back home. WHAT? i got mad because my mom doesnt even work anymore, and the rents gone up, and we just bought a new car. WE ONLY MAKE ENOUGH (me, my older sister, and dad work) to pay bills, buy food, and buy things for the 4 children in the house. I reminded her that my little sister isnt living in poverty, my uncle is much much more well off than us. THEY HAVE FOUR CARS, MY LITTLE SISTER HAS HER OWN CAR!\n\nMy mom called me an asshole for making a fuss about it since shes still my sister and i should WANT to send her nice things since she didnt choose to leave us. I made my mom cry cause i told her im cutting her off, and i know making my mom cry makes me an asshole, but aita for not wanting to send my little sister care packages anymore?",

She has made decisions that I strongly disagree with and all under the guise that she 'is an adult'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, my mom was getting food for my brother (14) and he asked if I wanted something. I wasn't sure who was getting the meal, but who would miss out on free food?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, all he did when I responded was give me the phone. It was my mom. She said that I had to give her a hug if she got the food and almost immediately I denied the fact that I wanted anything. I was planning to eat at home anyways. I said, \"If you want a hug, I want an apology.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat pissed her off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom there it spiraled into an argument, she denied her guilt in anything and refused to apologize. She started yelling at me over the phone which I responded with yelling back. Saying that \"she was the adult\" and \"I was the kid\". \"Everything \\[was\\] my fault\" because I didn't have better judgement. If you read the other post, you will find this is at least somewhat wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended the call with \"Have a nice life\" and hung up. Finally, my question is if I am the asshole for sticking up to my mom like that. It felt wrong and I have had a guilty feeling in my stomach since we fought. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Scream-argument with my mom on the phone following [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/agt1rm/aita_havent_spoken_with_my_mother_since_christmas/), she refused to admit guilt and I hung up, still not talking to her.\n\nThere is a tldr at the bottom of the attached post, too.",

      "description": "Hello fellow proctologists, thank you for your time and your help in figuring this one out. I’ve thought through it from a few different angles and can’t seem to find a satisfactory approach. \n\nSome backstory: A few years ago, on my birthday, I was targeted in a club and had my drink spiked. I was abducted by a pimp and delivered to two men who had paid for a prostitute. They raped me all night in their hotel room, and in the morning I stole some cash from one of them (my phone, wallet, etc were all missing at this point) and managed to pay for a cab ride home. I have not been back to this hotel since, except with police to identify the location. My birthday is the same week as Valentine’s Day, and I have just recently started “reclaiming” my birthday and celebrating again, so my boyfriend and I usually do a few fun things that weekend for the combined occasions. My boyfriend works in the entertainment industry, and in 2018 he started a small production company and produced his first short film. I am incredibly proud of him and excited to support him in his career aspirations. \n\nThe situation at hand: My boyfriend’s film has been accepted to a festival screening that happens to be on Valentine’s Day. I’m thrilled for him, and excited to attend the screening with him. There is a networking event afterwards, which is a very big deal for his industry and would greatly benefit him career-wise. He is a little shy, and I am much better at schmoozy networking party conversation, so I was planning to attend this with him afterwards for moral support and to encourage him to be bold and really go for it. I just checked the afterparty information, and it is being held at the hotel where I was raped. I do not want to go there, ever, and I especially don’t want to go there so close to the anniversary of my trauma. He knows what happened to me, but he doesn’t know that this hotel is where it occurred. I’ve asked him if he would be okay with me going to the screening with him and then heading home while he goes to the afterparty with his director, but he said he really wants me to be with him the whole night. To me, it seems like there is no way to avoid being an asshole here. \n\nOption A: I refuse to go without giving any specific reason why -- “I just don’t want to.” In this case, I show a clear lack of support for him and his career goals. I also run the risk of him trying to skip the afterparty in favor of doing something else with me for Valentine’s Day, which I think would be a big mistake. \n\nOption B: I refuse to go but explain why, and tell him I really want him to go without me. In this case, I’m worried that he will not really take advantage of the networking opportunities and will be worrying about me instead. After I initially told him about my rape, he had trouble sleeping and was upset for weeks. He is deeply empathetic, and I don’t want to put any negative, distracting thoughts and images into his head during the event. I don’t want him thinking about what happened to me and getting the wind knocked out of his sails. \n\nOption C: I just suck it up and go to both the screening and the afterparty and do my best to act totally normal. I’m worried that even if I try my hardest to be my normal self, my boyfriend will be able to tell that something is “off,” and will get distracted trying to comfort me. Alternatively, I could pull off the facade and everything goes great. Then we go home, and it’s Valentine’s Day, and he wants to have sex while I’m on edge from re-living my trauma all night. He would have no idea why I wouldn’t want to be intimate and I would ruin our Valentine’s Day. \n\nSo reddit, please help. Would I be the asshole if I pick any of the options above?\n\nTL;DR Boyfriend has an important networking event at the hotel where I was raped, I want to support him but I also don’t want to go. \n",

      "description": "\nA little backstory: \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for a couple of years now, and for a great majority of that time, things have been wonderful. \n\nRecently though, due to some issues related to trust, things have started to get a little rocky. For the last handful of months she's become obsessed with the idea that I'm cheating on her with someone she found a in-the-comments conversation that I had with on Instagram, two years before her and I met ( someone who, by the way, I haven't spoken with since we before we met as well).\n\nWhat started as questions about who this girl was/is slowly turned into accusations- accusations that I would be a \"liar\" for denying. \n\nDodging these false accusation, that hurt my soul to the deepest level because to betray her trust like that is totally outside of my character, has become an almost weekly event now, and this last time, I told her that I had had enough with the lack of trust and told her I wanted to break\nup.\n\nThis of course gives way to a tidal wave of statements like \"well have fun fucking [Susan]\", and \"I knew you were just trying to get rid of me so you could get with [Susan]\", etc, and then she said this, which I found particularly hurtful, and gave occasion for this post: \n\n\"You isolated me from all of my friends, and then you leave me!?\"\n\nWhat she was referring to in that statement was the fact that, on several occasions she has come to me sobbing about the horrible ways one friend or another has treated or is treating her. I always make time for her and listen intently, before commenting something like, \"well, that's not how friends ought to treat each other, so, if that's how it is, fuck her/him. You deserve better. You're worthy of more.\"\n\nSo what's happening is, now that we're breaking up. she's trying to accuse me of instructing her to cut ties with all her friends because I wanted to isolate her. Like I'm some control freak asshole, which I can promise you I am the farthest thing from. I always encourage her to hang out and her feeling free and trusted while she does is hugely important to me. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for \"isolating\" my girlfriend from her \"friends\"? \n\nTLDR: My girlfriend often comes to me complaining about this friend or that friend, how poorly they treat her, and how she needs new friends. My response has always been something along the lines of:\n\n\"You don't deserve to be treated like that. You deserve better.\"\n\nNow that we're breaking up, she's trying to bring up those occasions as attempts I made at isolating her from her friends. \n\nAITA for \"isolating\" my significant other from her friends?",

      "description": "So basically my brother, his wife, his son (M 14), and his daughter came down to our place to visit us, me and my girlfriend. So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because \"respect your elders\" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?",

      "description": "I'd like to say I don't think it's generally ok to offer other peoples food or speak for someone else but I feel like the context of this scenario makes it justifiable. The roommate has in the past offered my drinks such as milk/soda to people and said that I wasn't being a \"team player\" for complaining about this despite the fact I'm the only one who buys these things so it's always mine that get used. In addition to the roommate I live with two other men who weren't present for this story.\n\nAs further context to this the roommate in question constantly asks me for beer and has for that past few months since moving in always with the promise of \"replacing them once he gets the money\". I've probably gave him 20 or more beers in the time we've live together but I like to try to be fairly easy to live with so although it has bothered me he hasn't even attempted to pay me back like he said I haven't made a big deal out of it.\n\nFast forward to the other day and we had a few of his friends around for an evening of playing a video game that just came out. While trying to be a good host I offer our guests the drinks I know I have in the kitchen and at the end I remember the roommate has a few beers too so I offer them as an option, saying he probably wouldn't mind because he owes me a few anyway and in general it's been ok for others drinks to be offered to guests.\n\nAs I leave to go get the drinks including a beer I turn back to double check with the roommate anyway but mid sentence he starts telling me off and shouting at me  for being \"rude and presumptuous\" offering one of his beers and that \"Just because you gave me beer doesn't mean you now get to take my beer without asking\". I tried to explain that I was about to ask him but he continued to repeat himself without acknowledging what I said. To make matters worse the person who wanted the beer changed their mind after this and the rest of the evening was fairly awkward despite me trying to play it off.\n\nSo Reddit I'd like to know what you think about this scenario, I realize that offering someone else's food is generally asshole behavior but I feel like it was acceptable given this context and the roommate was being fairly unreasonable in how he reacted to this, I'm considering moving out due to this consistent pattern of it being a one way pattern of me putting more time and money into the \"team effort\" of the house.",

      "description": "I was recently in San Francisco for work and chose to stay at a hotel that was right next to my favorite cannabis dispensary.  I've been to a bunch of places in the bay area, but this one is my favorite.  The reason I like it so much is that the staff aren't super baked like a lot of the other places in the bay area, especially around Berkeley.   The online site is always up to date, I can place an order and go pick it up.  Online order pick up is a separate line so it's always pretty quick... until today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I go into the shop and,  as usual, go straight to the \"Online Pick-Up\" line.    There's only 2 people in line for pick-up, but about 10 in line for the regular ordering line.  I get into the pick-up line and the guy in front me says \"I've already been here 15 mins.\"    I look to see what's going on with the person at the counter and they are standing there with an iPad, slowly going through the entire menu, ordering things one-by-one and asking lots of questions.  While I don't have a problem with this in general, this was the  online pick-up line.   If they want to shop and discuss, I feel they should be in the  longer, regular checkout line.  \n\nThe guy that's in front of me gets tired of waiting and  says \"fuck this\" and walks away to go wait in the normal check out line.   I'm still a bit skeptical, so I decide to keep waiting in the pick-up line since... well, that's what I'm here to do.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother 5-6 mins go by and there's no progress being made and the lady is visibly taking her time as if there were no one else waiting behind her.  At this point I realize that if the guy in front of me was being honest, this has been going on at least 20-25 minutes with people waiting in line.   So I lean forward and say \"Excuse me, I'm just here to pick up, mind if I pass through?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point the lady in front that was ordering gave me an eat-shit look over the top of her glasses.  The attendant behaves as though I just told everyone to fuck themselves; she throws up her hands and shakes her head.  Then says \"She's in front of you, I can't just let you in front of her!\".  \n\nI play it cool and just say \"ok cool\" .  Fortunately someone else in the shop noticed what was going on and quickly helped me. The guy who was previously in front of me runs over from the regular line and says \"me too!  I have an online order too!... and have been waiting over 20 minutes!\", which was slightly vindicating.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion is: am I the asshole for asking to break in line and get my pick-up order?  I sure felt like one but when I think about it, I don't see how I was in the wrong.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurious to hear any comments!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So I'm going on a trip with my family, and we found out a year ago about this trip. During the initial planning we realized that there would be 3 free vouchers for these people to go for free. It was decided who would get these, and my brother was one of them.  \n\n\nFor the past few years though my brother's been a flake. He'll commit to going to something, only to not show up and you can text or call to see where he's at but he won't get back to you until 3-5 days later. So this was concerning for my parents and myself because if we use the voucher on him and he decides to flake, we A) won't know till day of and B) we would be out for the value of the free voucher.  \n\n\nMy parents asked him to confirm if he could go. His response was along the lines of \"at this present time I can say yes, but I'm not sure\". So not quite instilling confidence. Neither my brother, parents, or myself could cover the cost of his trip on such short notice, so ultimately they decided to not use the voucher on him and use it on me. This was a surprise to me and while I had paid off the trip I won't say no to the credit.  \n\n\nNow my other family are emailing me, and they're saying that I'm an asshole for being motivated to get the voucher as I'd get to go for free. Thing is though is since now I'm going from a double occupancy to a single, I'm only getting a portion back; and I'm paying my mom back for the deposit she paid for him. So it's not really a motivator here. Still, I suppose I just want to know for my own self whether I am in the right or not.",

      "description": "I’m confused at the moment. I just escaped an awkward, unfinished argument with my brother and his girlfriend. To preface this, my brother, his girlfriend, and I live in an apartment together and split the rent three ways. On the way home after being away with his girlfriend for three days, my brother texts me that I better have kept up with my dishes, as he knows I’m one to procrastinate on cleaning up after myself. I reassured him by texting back that I had cleaned all of my dishes after I had eaten dinner. He replies with ‘Since I made waffles and you got to enjoy them, it only makes sense for you to clean the waffle stuff’. The Thursday before he left, my brother left me a waffle and enough waffle batter in a large bowl for more waffles in the fridge. While they were gone, I ate the waffle and used the batter to make two more. Taking his reply to mean he wanted me to wash his waffle bowl he left in the fridge, I reply with ‘That doesn’t make sense, and I haven’t washed the waffle bowl’. This started an argument between my brother and I.\n\nMy brother believes that I should repay his act of kindness with kindness; that him giving me waffles and batter should be repaid by me cleaning up after him. He believes that if I refuse to clean the waffle bowl, it would be wrong.\n\nI believe that I shouldn’t have to clean any mess I didn’t make. My brother should be responsible for cleaning up after his own messes, acts of kindness involved or not. Him giving me waffles is irrelevant; he sullied the bowl, he should have to clean it. Had I known I was supposedly morally obligated to clean after my brother’s waffle mess, I wouldn’t have accepted his waffles or batter. For him to offer something to me and decide that I’m unspokenly indebted to him for accepting isn’t right.\n\nThey get home an hour later, and my brother’s girlfriend confronts me about the situation. She tells me she’s disappointed in me. She’s taken my brothers side, and has interpreted my disagreement with my brother as an attack against our friendship and our arrangement. She says it’s fine if you want to just be a roommate, only paying your side of living expenses, but for you to not contribute in this circumstance is unfriendly. I walk out of the conversation, as it quickly dawned upon me how badly this escalated and how she’s misinterpreted the situation. I’m going to bed now; I’m gonna have to think about how to handle this.\n\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for refusing to clean up after my brother’s mess he made making waffles, even if he gave me some?",

      "description": "Me [23f] and my fiancé [27m] are getting married in May. We did not invite my soon to be sister in law [23f] to the wedding. She just got out of prison. She was in there for a year, after years of drug addiction/legal issues.\n\nShe has reached out to my fiancé, saying she’s trying to live right and do better, which is great. There was a function at her halfway house that we went to because she invited us. This was the first time I had ever officially met her, and the first time my fiancé had seen her in years. \n\nI come from a small rural town. Back when we were younger, she really made a name for herself. Stealing from people, selling fake drugs to younger kids, the whole nine. She was “that” girl. She was “car hopping” and one of the cars she hit was my good friends dad’s, her or one of the people she was with stole his GPS. This friend ended up being my roommate in college, and her parents are invited to my wedding.\n\nA lot of our wedding guests will be people who grew up with us, therefore know all about fiancés sister. I don’t want our guests uncomfortable because someone who stole from them in the past is in attendance. My fiancé owns a contracting company, I sell real estate. We’ve settled down about an hour away from our home town, but I still sell houses in that area and he does quotes in that area all the time. Both of our livelihoods depend on our image. As I don’t want anyone thinking we associate with people like her. Lastly, I barely know her. I don’t want her attached to my special day in any kind of way. \n\nShe JUST got out of prison. Maybe she’s changed, maybe she hasn’t. Time will tell. I feel like a natural consequence of robbing people is that other people won’t want you around after that, and she should understand.\n\nAfter she discovered she had not received an invitation, she messaged my fiancé asking what was going on, so he told her we had decided to have just close family and friends. She lost it. Messaged us both saying she can’t believe we would be so mean, that we shouldn’t have “pretended” to support her recovery. My fiancé responded that our wedding day has nothing to do with her recovery, and we aren’t close due to her life choices. He received another angry message back.\n\nAre we the assholes?",

      "title": "AITA For Planning My Wedding?",
      "description": "At the beginning of this year my fiance and I started looking at wedding venues. My mother had expressed interest in the wedding planning so we included her in the process. Some backstory on my mom is that she is a bit of a helicopter parent. I graduated college back last May, have moved out of state, have a nice job, and a lot of independence.\n\nMy fiance had found a venue that she really liked and wanted to see in person. We invited both sets of parents although mine weren't able to make it because they are in the medical field and time off seems to be a rare blessing.\n\nWe went to the venue and everything seemed amazing.  We chose that we would have it there.\n\nMy mom didn't like us making that decision without them having seen the venue. We told them we would like them to come down with us to the venue another time before the wedding. My fiance got emotional over my parent's reaction and started to break down thinking that my family hated her. My fiance's family tried to intervene by posting onto Facebook extremely hurtful and threatening posts about my mom and how they are \"messing with the family\".\n\nThis obviously didn't go well and my mom pretty much went no contact and I was devastated. My parents said we were no longer invited to nights at their house anymore while in town.\n\nMy mom eventually blocked us.  When my fiance and I decided on a wedding date, I told my dad the date with an explanation to why we chose it. We told my parents before my fiance's to make sure that their schedules could fit. I asked that if there were any conflicts, to please tell us so we could reschedule for a better date.\n\nMy dad really tried for a couple of weeks to get us to mend our problems. It turns out she had just blocked us on Facebook so I kept trying to reach out to my mom in meaningful ways by saying how much I love her, how much I disagree with my fiance's parent's actions, and so on, but it did no good.\n\nA month or two passes and we are to today. A couple of days ago we set a date with the wedding adviser. We used the date that we had set a while ago and I texted my parents the update. My mom blew up not knowing that a date had been set and saying she can't make it. It turns out my dad had never told her the date when I had told him.\n\nMy fiance's parents figured a couple days ago that there is some kind of 3 day rule to signing a contract where you can get out of it so they said that if there is any time to change the date it would be by today. I have been trying to talk to my mom to get her to tell me a day that works with her but she has said over and over to not let her ruin our lives and we can pick a date on our own. I'm trying to talk to my dad at the moment on what to do and to pick a date with him but I feel like I'm going to pick a date today that my own parents won't be able to attend. I love them so much and I want them to attend.\n\nAm I the asshole?  I can answer questions.",

      "description": "I have a girlfriend, Amy, who I’ve been with for 9 months. The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn’t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa’s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it’s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it’s finally “our time” and that she’s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she’s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn’t feeling well and left.  \n\nYesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):\n\n&gt; Amy: It sucks that you’ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. \n\n&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?\n\n&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she’s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. \n\n&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I’ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I’ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. \n\n&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don’t think you’d cheat but I still think it’s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  \n\nThis went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. \n\nIt honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn’t have to go with Melissa but I don’t see any other way out of this. I understand where Amy is coming from but I feel like she should trust me to be appropriate.

      "description": "So to start things off, Im a high schooler and a while ago, I used my brothers phone to see my emails.  Big mistake, right?  So, then I logged off (or I assumed I did).  Simple as that.  Fast forward 2 months later, we're at my cousin's house.  We're having a small family meeting, and for some reason, they have to bring the \"kids\" along.  Each of us brought food along like the generous people we are.  So we go into my cousin's room to hang out.  Fast forward a couple of minutes later, we're talking about school and stuff.  I decide to try and change the subject because I don't feel comfortable about my situation in school.  Then, my cousin decides to bring up grades.  Now, I have pretty average grades, but everyone else has straight A grades, like the typical Asian family we are.  All of a sudden, my cousin waves his phone in my face and says now I have to show him my grades since he did the same.  I say no and try to change the subject. On the spot. My brother pulls up his phone, and my grades, using schoolloop and shows everyone.  I try my hardest and eventually stop him before he reaches my cousin.  Now, he calls me the a-hole and they repeatedly try to take it from me.  Now I sit alone while everybody shames me.  AITA For protecting my privacy?",

      "description": "Tl;dr at the bottom \n\nMy best friend of 8 years (we’ll call her Kate) and her bf (Roger) have been together for 3 years and have a house together. And they fight constantly. Not just your run of the mill arguments either, they are incredibly abusive to one another. \n\nI held in my feelings about Roger for a long time until, in the middle of them fighting, Kate came to me and said “sometimes I just want to leave him.” It took everything in me not to beg her to do so, and instead calmly said that I don’t like him, I don’t believe they treat each other with respect, and that she can do better for herself. She just defended him, rationalized and excused their behaviors towards one another. She basically said that I’m not in the relationship, so my perspective is invalid. I feel the need to mention that she’s 21 years old and he’s 40-something. \n\nThis blew up and manifested in other ways, and she didn’t talk to me for two weeks. \n\nShe finally called me and we talked for hours. I was telling her my true feelings that I’ve held in for the past 2 years. I don’t like Roger, even though I have tried. He’s been nice and cordial to me, welcomed me in their home, and has done nothing directly to me. I’ve been nice to him, hosted him in my home, went on double dates with them, tried to get to know him, and I do not like him. I’m not friends with Roger and would never associate myself with him outside of my friendship with Kate. Therefore, I do not want him at my wedding, and my fiancé feels the same.\n\nIt’s clear that she loves him and he loves her, even through the toxicity I’ve witnessed firsthand. My goal isn’t to break them up, I’m all about fighting for who you love and I have to trust and respect the decisions she makes.  I just want her to respect my feelings towards him. I want a relationship with Kate outside of her relationship with Roger. She can still come to me and tell me about their lives together, as I love hearing about her life. I just don’t want to be around Roger anymore or see him on what’s going to be the happiest day of my life with my future husband.\n\nAm I the asshole for telling her this and also telling Kate that I don’t want Roger at my wedding? The majority of guests will be family and I’m only inviting 5 friends (including her) and only one of those friends is married (they invited me to their wedding and I actually like his wife) so I gave that friend a plus one.\n\nTl;dr I don’t want my best friend’s toxic relationship at my wedding, just my best friend.\nDoes that make me the asshole?",

From the Air bnb, to the trip details, the tickets, what we're gonna eat. They just wanna give me the money and go. I feel like a travel agency and it has completely taken the fun out of this trip for me. I've been on trips with them before and its always the same thing. I end up being a glorified tour guide while they get to have all the fun. I just wish they'd have at least a little input. As much as it sucks, I'd be alright with being a third wheel if they just helped me plan the trip out even a little bit. I have talked to them about this, but they refuse to go look for themselves. The only response I get is \"If you don't want to go, we understand\" Thing is I DO want to go! I was super excited for this trip until they threw the whole thing on my shoulders. I'm tired of this trip already and its not supposed to happen for another two weeks. I'm pretty sure they know how I feel too but just don't want to do anything themselves. IDK ",

      "description": "I really just want my whole family to fuck off. I'm 15, so I know my opinion will change on this with time, but right now I really don't want to be near anyone in my family. \n\nMy mom has beaten me, cursed at me, threatened my life and livelihood, but still expects me to want to talk to her. A year and a half ago, I came home late from a track meet, so she locked me out the house and hit me with a broom several times when she finally decided to let me in. That was one incident that I consider tame compared to some of the other shit.\n\nWhen she caught me masturbating last year to JLo in my room and saw my 9 year-old brother beating it a few days later (WHILE WE WERE ALL IN THE ROOM) she concluded that I was sexually abusing him and that I had brought \"the spirit of fornication\" into our shitty apartment. She then asked, no, STATED that I WAS FUCKING MY LITTLE BROTHER. I stood up and called her crazy and stupid for even thinking that, and she said I was being disrespectful.\n\nI lost what little respect I had left for her then and there. Ironically, we went to a church sermon recently where the message was honoring your parents.\n\nI wanted to love my brother (half-brother actually), but I can't and I won't. I see too much of his father in him. I remember only a few things about his dad:1. he's from Liberia, like our mom 2.I saw him in bed with my mom when I was little 3. I saw his dick in the bathroom once, and told the judge that I was gay (erroneously, if that matters at this point) during the custody battle bullshit with my mom 4. He's kidnapped my brother on multiple holidays 5. I saw him pull a gun on my mom when she drove to his house to take my brother back.\n\nI'm not innocent in this whole thing. I've hit my brother and beaten him multiple times over the years (not one-sided, he often instigated these fights, but I was way out of line in my response). But it hurts too much to love him. I can't not think of his dad when I look at him.\n\nI want nothing to do with my dad, either. He hasn't done nearly as much to me (or for me) as my mother, but he's too similar to me. I can't talk to him since he's so quiet. That, and I hate him for just abandoning me and my mom.\n\nWIBTA if I just disappeared from all of their lives when I turn 18?\n\n\n",

      "description": "Excuse any spelling/grammar errors since I’m using mobile.\n\nTl;dr Parents want me to play piano for their friends, I refuse feeling that I was being used.\n\nBackstory: I have been playing the piano for upwards of 17 years now. I wouldn’t call myself a prodigy or even a professional but I’d still think I’m pretty good. I can play most songs by ear shortly after hearing them and I have played for a couple weddings for close family but thats about it. I hated doing recitals growing up and only did a couple because I had terrible stage fright. \n\nFor the past few years, during my families holiday celebration, my parents would coerce me into playing christmas songs on the piano for the guests. Usually telling me things like, everyone will enjoy it, or, it would make *insert relative* happy. My parents knew about my stage fright but would usually pass it off as me just being lazy and not wanting to perform. It would usually be one or two different christmas songs and then guests would start making requests for other types of songs. Even when I didn’t know the song, they would still pressure me by saying “You can play by ear, just listen to it a few times!” Most of these guests were friends of my parents and I didn’t usually know them too well so, because I wanted to be polite, I would play a few more songs and then slip away when everyone was talking. A couple years back I started to feel like I was being taken advantage of and that my parents didn’t respect my decision to not want to play. I started to feel that they only wanted me to play to brag to their friends. \n\nFast forward to last christmas, the same situation happened, except this time, there were about twice as many people as usual. My stage fright was higher than ever and after a couple songs, I couldn’t take it anymore and stepped outside in the middle of a song to take a breather and calm down. When my parents asked me why i stopped playing, I told them that I wouldn’t be playing for them again because I felt like I was being used. They started to call me selfish and tried to guilt trip me into playing again saying that they paid for the lessons but I refused and told them they would have to find another circus monkey to perform for them.

The race has 20,000+ runners but sells out pretty quickly and once it’s sold out the other way to gain entry is through fundraising for a charity. I chose a charity I’m genuinely passionate about and hit my fundraising goal. The charity mailed out some shirts with the name of the charity and the charity team. While I really like the shirt, it’s a bit large for me and not something I’ve run enough in to know how it will feel in a race or effect me with things like chafing. I usually wear the same set of clothes for races because I’m accustomed to running in them and I’m trying to run a competitive time to potentially qualify for the NYC Marathon.

So I relayed the situation, and they were fine with me going, but they adamantly refused to let his family pay for anything.  (Btw, for context, both of our families have the adequate resources to pay, so no one would be struggling).  HIS parents then adamantly refused to let my parents pay, and it was a back and forth till we settled on them paying for the tour and my family paying for the flight.

Could you please tell me if I am?\n\n I believe that blacks in general are better at basketball and football than all other whites. I’m cool with it. I’ve studied the stats. I’ve turned the TV on and can see with my own eyes but I feel dirty inside for thinking that way. \n\nI have 3 beautiful half Korean kids. \n\nI’ve said the N word in the past but not with any anger behind it. I’d compare my use of it to the way Chappelle uses it, because It sounds cool and makes me laugh. But then again who hasn’t said, “I’m Rick James bitch”! And God knows I don’t want to be rick James because He’s dead and I’m pretty sure if he were alive today and acted like he did back then the #metoo movement would be on his shit quick.\n\nI’ve sung and continue to sing along to rap songs while driving including the N word with the lyricists with no guilt. But I’v enough respect to not write it out here 🤔\n\nI believe that blacks and whites have the exact same opportunities today regardless of color. Equality of outcome or equality of opportunity?\n\nI believe saying MAGA is not racist in any way. If a KKK member is wearing a MAGA hat over their hood screaming “N word die”, I should not be associated with him just because I have a MAGA hat. I’m sure the same could be said about a Malcolm X hat back in the early to mid 90s? Young kids are very impressionable. \n\nI believe God before all others and thank God that Christianity is still very prevalent today in the black communities. I pray that that generation is dying out......is it? Any blacks from the south or elsewhere have an opinion on the youths involvement in Church???\n\nI don’t understand why it’s cool to shit on white people and their “race” for being white because it’s something that they can’t control but it’s not ok vice versa?

A little while after this, my mum tells me out of the blue that she and my younger brother will also be going on holiday in the same country as me, at the exact same time. At first it's no big deal, but this is proceeded by her asking me about my itinerary and whether or not I have booked accommodation yet.\n\nShe now wanted this to be a pseudo family holiday, with us three staying and doing things together.\n\nI had always intended for this to be a solo holiday (it's just my preference) and if I had wanted to go with family I would have extended the invitation. I have bought this up with my mum, and she just retorts saying I'm being \"mean\", \"why don't you want to spend time with us\", \"I never get to go on holiday with you\". Honestly I do sort of see her point, but I see them every day, and this is supposed to be a getaway and break from everyday life. She also expects me to handle the accomodation for us three, as well as find things for us to do (pretty much plan the entire thing). I have told her that I am not opposed to seeing them whilst we are there, but not the entire time, and would prefer I stay by myself. This is compounded with me already having booked a majority of my accomodation, some of which cannot be altered without incurring a fee. She doesn't seem to have gotten the memo however, and up to now is still trying to discuss the trip.\n\nAITA for having this mindset? Or if I'm well within my 'rights'?",

      "description": "Some background information is needed. My parents are divorced and have been since I was about 10 years old (I’m 21 and I’m the youngest of my family). I have an older half-brother (from my moms side) and two older sisters. When my parents got a divorce my brother went with my mother. I’m not sure the reason because I was a kid and haven’t really heard a solid story as to why. My mom isn’t well off. She definitely has some mental issues, but can live “normally”. My brother, on the other hand, can’t. He’s 27 and he is on the spectrum. He also has depression, anger issues, and possibly bi-polar. He lives with my mom and works from time to time, but is also i the hospital a lot. He mostly lives off my mom. Me and my sisters live with my dad, who has family money and a good paying job. Me and my two sisters are in college paid for by my dad and his inheritance. My two sisters are on their last year and one lives with my dad because her school is 20 minutes away from his house. \n\nNow for the YTA/NTA part.\n\nMy mom has trouble finding places to live and often gets kicked out of those places for good reason. When she does, she often asks my dad to come live at his place for a couple weeks to get back on her feet. She ends up staying well over the duration she gives at the start. \n\nMy siblings and I would have no problem letting her stay if she was out by when she said she would be. We wouldn’t mind if she stayed longer because not everything works out when you think it will. I get that, but she has been doing this on and off for the past 5 years. She’ll find a place, my brother will go into the hospital, she gets kicked out, then asks to stay at my dads place. \n\nMy dad is not the strongest person when it comes to saying no. My mom sometimes makes him feel guilty. My will say yes and then he will force us (now just my sister staying with him) to stay home all the time and “watch” my mom cause he’s paranoid and thinks she steals from him. He has cameras up all over the house. When she finally find a place to live and leaves he’ll complain that something’s missing and that she stole it until my siblings or I yell at him to stop because we don’t care anymore. \n\nShe is asking again and this time it is just my sister at home who has to take care of two huskies, her last semester of college, and basically everything around the house because my dad is a recluse and barely come out of his room anymore. She can’t stay all the time to “watch” mom for him. She wants people to come over and hangout but doesn’t feel comfortable with my mom around. \n\nThere is a whole lot more that would make you understand better, but I don’t think reddit wants to hear my dark, sad childhood. \n\nAnyway, AITA for standing with my sister and telling my mom she has to find another place to stay or go to a homeless shelter? \n\n\n(I’m reposting with proper character count. I apologize to the people who already commented.) ",

      "description": "Alright here goes, \n\nI’m in high school, recently one of my good friends (Jack, 16) started dating a new girl (Karen, 15) who he then added to a group text with 11 other mutual friends. \n\nThey immediately start talking about drug use, initially just vaping and smoking weed which isn’t a foreign concept to any of us. Eventually his girl “Karen” starts talking about cocaine and how much of a rush it is. Naturally that raised some eyebrows and I asked “are you joking right now? I can’t tell” and she assured me she was serious. \n\nI asked Jack if she was kidding and he backed her up and said they’d both done some lines. I said that that wasn’t a great idea and they should probably stop, which caused him to get angry and tell me that I need to respect other peoples decisions because they weren’t doing anything wrong. \n\nI told them there’s a lot wrong with doing coke in high school. I was pretty fed up at this point and after some back and forth said “ok then have fun with your coke addict gf”. Jack got really angry and said they were joking the whole time and demanded an apology, which I refused. \n\nI told him that I stand by what I said and I’m glad that none of it was true. My friend “Laura” defended my position and said I was just concerned about him doing those types of drugs and “Karen” told her to “fuck off and stop being a bitch”\n\nI further said that I wouldn’t apologize because all I had done was believed what he’d told me. Jack told me that he wasn’t surprised one of our mutual friends had cut me off weeks before and everyone has an issue with me, adding that I should “fuck off”. Eventually things died down, jack apologized, but there’s still some tension.\n\nTLDR: my friend (16) and his gf (15) lied and told me they were doing drugs like cocaine and acid, and got extremely angry when me and several mutual friends said it was wrong.

      "description": "I live the furthest from town out of all my friends so generally like to drive myself around to get to places as public transport takes twice as long. Going the fastest route will get me home after a night out in about 40 mins. \n\nNow, a lot of my friends kind of live on the way home....only if I drive another route and not the fastest route for me. If I choose to give 1-2 a lift home, this will add maybe 20-30 mins to my journey home (as I’m not going the fastest way home). I honestly do not mind this at all.\n\nHowever, it’s when 3 or 4 friends want a lift home too, this will easily add another 15 mins per person, meaning it will add another 1hr to my commute so it takes me 1hr 45 mins instead of just 40 mins or so. \n\nAITA? \n\nIt makes me not want to go out and meet up with my friends because I don’t want to catch public transport back home (long commute), but I also don’t want a long commute having to drive all my friends home. (You can’t exactly say “I will drop only 2 people home, but the other 2 I won’t”). I’ve thought about dropping all my friends at a more closer area to their home so they can catch the cab home (and at a location that’s on the way home for me), but then if it’s late at night, I feel bad I might be putting them in a risky situation. \n\nI just feel burdened by people always wanting a lift home. \n\nAITA?\n\n\n\n",

She had to move a couple of hours away for work, and we agreed to try long distance. Cut to today, and we’ve been dating over two years. We see eachother maybe once a month, so for the rest of the month it’s a little lonely. I (as many other men in their early 20s) get in a sexual mood more than once a month, and try and get my girlfriend to sext with me. However, most attempts end up with her being busy or just flat out not wanting to do it at all. Her reasons are either that she doesn’t enjoy taking pictures of herself or that she isn’t good at talking dirty. I’ve voiced my concerns to her before and she said she’d try and work on it, with no results. So, AITA for not being satisfied with once a month sex and maybe once a month halfhearted sexting?",

      "description": "Im not sure how to talk about this so imma just jump in. So my GF (21) and I (23) have been dating for 2+ years now. Im am her first long term relationship. After about 6 months of being abstinent, we attempted to have sex for the first time. Long story short she couldn't get comfortable and we just went to bed. She went to her doctor a couple weeks later and they established something was going on down there for her. Not sure if a uti, or a yeast infection, or what as shes gone through multiple attempts to fix it but its yet to go away. \nSince then, we've tried a few more times but the same thing. She can never get comfortable with me inside her, and after about 10 seconds shell just tighten up to where it fucking hurts. So we just call it quits. Recently (~6 months) we haven't really tried again, mostly because I feel kind of defeated and tbh knowing your gf cant get sexually comfortable with you being in her sucks ass. Plus I'm always the one who initiates any sexual acts, she very rarely is the initiator. And it's not because I'm too big, trust I watch a lot of porn and I know I'm on the bottom of that call list for good camera looking dicks. So really for the past 2 years we've been getting by with blowjobs and fingering. Which I am cool with, and told her I'm cool with as long as we're actively working towards bettering our sex life/finding out what's wrong. \nBut about 4 months ago she was diagnosed with depression/anxiety so we've been dealing with that and recently shes been getting much better. But even since she was diagnosed, the blowjobs I get have practically zeroed out. The only time we do anything is after I ask her a couple times, not one after another but once on Sunday, again on Wednesday, then again on Saturday (i ALAWAYS have to ask and shes NEVER offers to do it but that's another conversation) and then if she does do it, its preceded by complaining about all I care about is getting off and dont care for her, which half the time makes me change my mind and just decided to go to the bathroom and get myself off.\nAnd yeah thats about it. Recently I've been debating about breaking up with her as I've yet to have sex with anyone for about 6 years and am tired of waiting and feeling bad about asking for sexual favors. Tbh when I think about sex with her, it just makes me sad now because of all the failures that we've had, that it makes the prospect of a future with sex still seem lowkey not as great as I first thought when we started dating. What happens when shit is fixed? Am I going to spend the rest of my life asking to have sex or a blowjob or anything? And I'm not saying asking for consent sucks, because I always do and shit i want to try out later on requires trust and consent, but rather having to go and ask my gf if we can do sexual stuff together every single time and never being asked/initiated on sucks ass.",

On Saturday, I came back to our apartment and Shrek was noticeably moldy. I picked him up and he was squishy, so I threw him away. I didn't think anything of this at the time.\n\nHowever, when my roommate got back, she was very upset that I had thrown away \"her son\" without letting her know. At first I thought she was joking, but she's actually mad at me, and any time I try to talk to her she just leaves the room. I tried to explain that he was moldy, but she's upset because he was hers. I guess I didn't realize how important that orange was to her.\n\nSo, AITA?? ",

      "description": "Hi guys, I am a lurker here from a couple of months and I would have never thought of writing here. Long story coming.\n\nI have a GF, both of us are 25 yo, usually we see each other 3 evenings during the week, saturday evening we sleep together and all the day during the Sunday.  She basically does not have any interest other than seeing me and she see her friends very rarely, like maybe once every month or 2 because at least one of them always something else to do. I took up again MTG the card game a year ago. I played at first with a friend of mine casually then contacted other 2 old friends that also played and we started to do it more \"seriously\". I am not traveling to do the world championship or anything but if there is an event nearby we sometimes (rarely actually) think to attend it. We actually did 2 times.\n\nNow the thing is that I work Monday-saturday. His event are at Sunday. There other 2 times that I played my GF made me clear that she was upset because she want to spend the Sunday together. \nIn fact the first time we started in a small shop and the event ended  at 14.00, at that point I hate an hamburger and went straight to her.\nThe second time it was a bigger event so i was eliminated around 17.30/18 at that point once again I went to her (she was with her family) and spent the rest of the evening with her family and then alone with her.\n\nNow I want to participate at another event like this and I took the saturday off work to stay with her to \"compensate\". Now she is super mad that I want to participate, she says that I should spend every Sunday with her, that if I go I won't be one of her priority anymore. \nShe says that I already see them one evening every week so that should be enough and I should spend the rest of the time with her. \nI tried to like meet each other in a middle ground like I will do this only once every 2 months at max, I will ask more saturday off work to spend some weekend just with her somewhere. \nNothing she was super mad, started to cry saying that she might agree to something like 2 events per year and that it was still too much. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to participate at this events with my friend leaving her alone?",

She has a habit of walking around in just a tank top and underwear. Sometimes she just hangs around in a towel for hours after showering instead of getting dressed. \n\nIt’s not a huge deal but I suggested to her that she should really start using her robe if she doesn’t want to put something on. She asked why and I said it’s not entirely appropriate to walk around half-dressed in front of her father now that she’s a young woman. \n\nI am very direct when speaking and I think her feelings may have been hurt. My husband ended up walking in on the conversation and asked why she was pouty. She told him and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes, but he didn’t say anything. I brought it up with him later and he was just like “can we talk about something else?” Clearly he didn’t want to have the conversation so I dropped it with him. As for my daughter, she’s been fairly quiet today, which is unusual for her. \n\nWas I wrong to say something to her about this? ",

      "description": "I've been friends with X since I was in highschool, and now we're both well into our twenties. We've always had some common ground with video games, computers and smoking weed together. X always did have an appetite for weed, smoking whatever you put in front of them and always yearning for more. \n\nIn the past few years I've taken up growing weed, both as a career and a hobby. Now, X really likes this because that means he has access to what I'd consider top shelf cannabis, and at an extremely reasonable rate to what he's used to. \n\nIn the past year or two we've become better friends and I trusted him enough to housesit for our pets and my several plants while my SO and I went on a 5 day vacation. I paid X in weed and they were happy. We came home and all seemed well.\n\nWe went away again recently for a long weekend and X was happy to housesit in exchange for more weed, to which I accepted because then I don't have to pay out of pocket (we don't have a lot of money and are trying to save). X asks if I can pay him in advance so he has something to smoke while I'm gone, and I have no issue with it. I tell him \"there's beer in the fridge and a grinder with weed in it for the weekend, enjoy!\"\n\nWe come back from our trip and notice that our pets litter boxes aren't cleaned as well as we had agreed upon, and that some of them don't have water and very little food. Now, we don't know how long that went on. The sink is stained with black residue from cleaning out a filthy smoking piece, which irks me, but whatever. My SO is upset because the one litter box is very dirty and that just isn't what we agreed on or what we 'paid' for. My SO wants to indulge in some weed and go to bed, and we can't find some of our pieces. Turns out they were in the freezer because X is notorious for trying to scrape them clean for whatever kief/crumbs they can. I go to get weed from a jar and it's empty. I'm 99.9% sure I left a sizable amount in there before we left, and X would have known it was there. I assume they smoked it all and I'm peeved at this point. I look at my personal stash and find that X has dove into that as well, without permission or a heads up. \n\nI confront X about this and they admit to taking some of personal stash, but won't admit to clearing out the other jar. I tell X I'm not comfortable with having them around anymore and that I wish them all the best and he thinks it's a harsh treatment but respects it if that's what I choose.\n\n\nIt feels like the relationship is one sided, with me giving X unfiltered access to inexpensive, quality cannabis and always having a place they can come eat a warm meal and smoke to their delight. Maybe I enabled them? I'm torn. \n\nAITA for ending the relationship because they possibly got too comfortable and took some of my things without permission? \n\n\n",

When i do this i always bring my backpack and put my JBL Flip 4 speaker into the little cup holder thingy on the side of the backpack. I then turn it all the way up and ride around town blasting rap music. I wouldn't say it's obnoxiously loud but if you were on your driveway and i rode by you would definitely hear it. But it's definitely not like the entire neighborhood can hear my music. I also never do this past dark. \n\nThe main reason i do this is because i want to listen to music and if i use earbuds i can't hear cars coming behind me at all but when i do this i can definitely hear cara a lot more and i feel more safe. Of course i don't have to turn it all the way up to hear it but i like to have it pretty loud so i can get turnt up lol. \n\nAnyway the other day my neighbor told me to stop blasting my shitty music so i flipped him off and kept riding.

      "description": "I work as a host at a restaurant in an area affected by Hurricane Michael. There’s a curfew on the area, which causes businesses to close early so that their employees can get home before the curfew goes into effect. \n\n\nAbout an hour ago, someone called to ask if we were still open. We were actually just about to close, but because the people on the phone said they were only five minutes away, the manager they could come on in and then we’d be done. \n\n\nFast-forward about ten minutes. It’s been a slow night all around, and there’s no sign of the folks who called to ask if we’re open. Someone else calls to ask if we’re still open, and my boss says to go ahead and close for the night, then wanders off to handle managerial matters. I tell the person on the phone that we’re closed, then start to wait for our remaining guests to leave so I can do my closing work. \n\n\nAnother ten minutes went by, and the people that called twenty minutes prior arrived. I told them that, unfortunately, we were closed for the night and explained that we had to give our employees time to get home before curfew. They were upset because they were told they could come in, but didn’t try to contest me once I re-iterated that we were closed. I felt bad about it, but I didn’t want to catch hell from my boss for seating someone after closing.\n\n\nContrary to my fears, my manager instead chewed me out for turning them away. I explained that I was only doing as she said, and that they arrived a whole fifteen minutes later than what they told us. She understood, but told me that I ought to use better judgement, and that now she’s going to catch hell for telling guests to come in only for them to be turned away upon arrival. She claims I should have seated them because they called ahead. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for turning them away? Obviously it would have been better to seat them, but hindsight is 20-20.

I say \"friend\" because like most friendships it stared out nice.\nShe used to compliment me alot but slowly she complimented me less - Now, I'm not an egomaniac that is obsessed with people constantly praising me, I wasn't bothered by her not complimenting me I just thought we might be drifting apart. I tried my best to reconnect with her and make an effort but she was cold and distant went i talked to her. I shrugged it off and just boiled it down to her just hanging around different people.\nAt the time this was all happening we had a mutual friend - Harriet - who i had gotten closer to over a few months. Harriet was Jess's best friend so she would tell her all her secrets - including mine. One day, Harriet told Jess that i had got off with Jess's friend's cousin - Jess's friend will be called Katie - and we made it very clear that she COULDN'T tell anyone ESPECIALLY not Katie. The first thing she does is tell Katie which is where this started.\nJess started to stay nasty things to me at random and pass it off as a joke. She'd say things like \"you're just funny looking\" \"your teeth are really bad\". I told her that my teeth were my biggest insecurity and she proceeded to pick on it. She did this thing where she would say she didn't like something about her self - say her teeth in this instance - and encourage people to say things like \"well at least you dont have teeth like her\" or picking on me for my ethnicity which im understandably quite sensitive about (I have some Japanese heritage). \nShe would do this for weeks without any retaliation. She would say things like \"you're clapped\" \"I can't even see your eyes\".I confided in my other friends about it. Some of them even said they had had similar experiences with her.\nThis pushed me to my limit and yesterday it all came to ahead. Jess is insecure about her weight - I.Dont.Think.She.Is.Fat. - and she constantly talks about loosing weight and going to the gym etc. I approached her and said \"I'm jealous of your eyebrows.\" she then retorted back at me \"I'm not jealous of anything on you\" OK then. \n\n\"If i were you i'd be jealous of my weight.\"\n\nShe then grabbed my water out of my hand and drenched me then ran off and started telling everyone i called her fat and what a terrible person i am.\nI needed to say something back or I think i would have lost my shit.\n\nSo... Am i the asshole?",

      "description": "My girfriend called this act \"minor cheating\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome background info:\n\nI have a female friend who I know since a long time, and we meet occasionally (like once every 1,5 months). We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.",

      "description": "I wouldn't actually word it that way.\n\nMy girlfriend is anxious about her undergraduate dissertation and her body. Ive helped her a lot with editing her diss, but every day shell text me 5-10 times how stressed she is about it, and every time I ask how I can help she says 'I dont know.' Every time she says shes stressed it stresses me out. Ive said I wanna help but that she should be more specific about her needs. I frequently give every tip I can to help her manage her stress, but it feels like it goes in one ear and out the other.\n\nShe has trouble focusing and I sympathise, but its tiring when Im working with her on her diss and she says 'we need to fix this part' and I say 'ok whats wrong with it?' and she just says 'ugh I dont know'. The only thing that really eases her stress is when I completely take over and do huge chunks of work. But there have been times where Ill edit a bunch of her work and shell read over it say 'ugh this is such shit...sorry I mean the part I wrote, not what you did.'  Today while working she started hitting and pinching herself. I stopped her. She wasnt out of control or anything but it was sad and scary.\n\nShes always had poor body image but its flaring up. She calls herself fat at least 10 times a day. she equates it with ugly, and I think shes perfect and has a warped view of herself. She goes to therapy every 2-3 weeks but the guy said 'youre not fat at all but you're not dangerously thin either', and I think a professional should know better than to say that to a person who aims to be extremely thin. She's asked me for meal plans and if she should get liposuction. I feel hurt and uncomfortable because I don't want to feed into her negative thoughts.\n\nI frequently need to validate her. She talks about being hungry but says 'I already had two pieces of bread today, I can't have any more than that.' I feel all I can say is 'of course you can have more bread' because I believe that. She calls herself stupid, dumb, fat, needy, annoying, boring often. She's none of those things in my eyes and I tell her but it doesn't seem to help. I love her so much but this is exhausting. My mental health has taken a backseat in the relationship and my own head. (I know its normal to put others first at times and that relationships aren't always 'even', but I'm worried this is unhealthy).\n\nI want to be there for her but I also dont think this is healthy. She seems happy as long as I'm doing her work for her, but it's hers to do. She keeps saying hat she needs to stop using me as her dumping ground and I've said I want to be there for her but I'm concerned by the amount of negative things she says. I suggest journaling but I don't think she has. She says all of this will end once she hands in her dissertation in a few weeks but I'm not sure if I should stick it out or confront her. ",

      "description": "My GF (20F) and I (22M) have been together for about 3 years. We have been playing the long distance game for about a year now, as she moved about 3 hours drive to the city to be with her family, while I stayed due mainly to work as well as my family being here.   \n\n\nAt the moment she is searching for work after being made redundant, but has been unemployed for nearly 2 months now.  I have been working full time, as well as working a 2nd job part time a few nights a week to get ahead on my finances. My life at the moment is basically stretched between work and sport, while hers has been netflix and helping around the house while her family work. However I have been trying my best to visit, and over the last few months have been visiting fortnightly to every 3 weeks or so, while due to her financial situation she's only come down a couple times, one of which was she hitched a ride with a family member who was coming down to visit some family friends, but only stayed the night. I understand her lack of visits due to her finances, but I have offered quite a few times to pay for fuel so she can come and visit, which she declines because she doesn't want to take my money.\n\n\nShe is coming back to my town for 3 weeks to be paid to housesit for a family friend of hers, which is only feasible due to her lack of work. We will ideally be spending a fair bit of time together while she is in town, but she is only coming for the housesitting job, she wouldn't of come otherwise.  \n\n\nThe last time I went to visit was 2 weekends ago, when I was in the city for a work function, which she was my +1 for. I haven't visited since as I knew she was coming to my town anyway, and I plan to make the most of having her around so I thought I would use the weekends before to get stuff done. I have a big family holiday coming up in the start of May, and so am preparing for that, while also trying to actually take time out on my weekends to play sport, help out around the house (recently helped my dad with a paving job at home) and just bum around, stuff I can't do when I'm visiting my GF. It's a bitch driving 3 hours there and 3 back, and is generally quite an expensive weekend factoring in fuel, meals and entertainment.   \n\n\nLast night we had an argument about how over the 2 month period between March and April I will only spend 1 weekend at hers, while she is going to be spending 3 weeks in my town. I told her that's a bit unfair as she will be coming down so I don't have a reason to drive to her house, but she told me that she just doesn't think I visit enough. I told her she needs to understand I have a life outside of our relationship, and that due to her work situation she is able to get things done during the week, while anything I want to do outside of work is generally reserved for weekends because I simply don't have the time. She just replied with \"whatever, night\" and ended our phone call.   \n\n\nReddit, AITA for not visitng?",

      "title": "AITA for not messaging the dog sitter",
      "description": "Long back story \n\nMy puppy Attila is a 6 month old is a great Dane x bull mastiff x ridge back. 25 kg at the moment. We live in an apartment but he is taken to the dog park twice a day for at least an hour and after that just likes to sleep and cuddle. If he isn't taken out then he starts chewing things, being a puppy and all. \n\nSo last week we had him booked in with a pet sitter for a night. Let's call him Jeff. Jeff also lives in an apartment but said he had greyhounds before so understood big dogs in apartments. Dropped the puppy off and Jeff seemed nice. But had left some cat food out so Attila ate that... I messaged Jeff in the app with my phone number a while after and asked I'f everything was okay. Never heard anything back. \n\nThe next day, I had said I would pick the puppy up around midday. So I messaged at 12 saying I would be around at 12:45 if that was fine. Heard nothing until 12:50 when Jeff said \"sorry come now\".\nSo I drove across and knock on the door but there was no one there and no dog. Waited outside for a bit then Jeff comes down the street with Attila. It was 30 degrees outside so that's not the best conditions to be walking a large puppy. When we go up stairs to get the dogs things he pulls a key out from behind a pipe, weird to show a stranger where the spare key is.\n\nI ask Jeff if he can do this weekend as well as I needed to go interstate for family. But that I was leaving at 7am so could I drop the dog off at 5am or I would book the day before and drop him off in the night. I was told no the morning is fine.\n\nSo I book this weekend, ask Jeff again if 5am is okay and am told it's fine.\n\nFriday morning comes around and I drop attila off. At the airport I realise I forgot to pack a breakfast for Friday. So I message Jeff and ask him to give him his dinner kibble for breakfast as he has extra pasta and veggies packed for dinner, along with his treats and pig ears. Never hear back.\n\nFor the rest of the weekend I don't hear anything until today. When Jeff springs on me that he is going to a birthday party so he will leave a key under the mat. This annoyed me cause he didn't mention this to me before and I was under the impression he would be with the puppy. Jeff also tells me that he has gotten some more dog food that he gave to attila. Now usually if you suddenly give a dog a different kibble it can make them sick. I didn'tmessage back since I was pretty annoyed.\n\nMy flight was delayed so I was back an hour later. I get to the apartment and there's no key under the mat. So I figure Jeff must be home. I knock on the door but get nothing but puppy barks. So I guess it was lucky I saw where the pipe key was so I could get in.\n\nIn the apartment there is no water in the dog bowl and heaps of shit laying around like underwear. Perfect for a puppy to eat. So I'm pretty pissed off. I don't send a message i just take my puppy home to give him some love, I figure I will message him tomorrow.\n\nAn hour later I get a message saying how unfair it was because Jeff left the party early since I hadn't messaged him. Basically I wrote back saying he could have tried to contact me before leaving and that I won't book him again.\n\nThen the messages come flooding in saying how Jeff has done so much for this dog. That he sent me so many pictures. Jeff then tells me attila has peed on Jeff's bed and destroyed so many things. That I was rude for a 5am drop off and afternoon pick up. That he was so stressed out about the dog being in the apartment that he had to leave a friends 30th.\n\nBeing a dog sitter I would have thought some collateral damage was expected, especially with puppies around. Unless you dog proof which Jeff doesn't.\n\nSo am I the asshole? ",

      "description": "A bit of context:\n Im 17, last year of high school, i live with my mother and sister. My father isnt really around, normally hes gone because of work.\n My sister is 13 and in the the last year of middle school.\n\n The chores in our house are separated between me and my sister. My mother doesn't really do much(cooks once every week or more) even tho she stays at home.\nTo be fair i cant say she does not work tho, but its somewhere in between, she does work but she has plenty of free time.\n\n I wash the dishes daily(takes me around 25-30 mins in good days),I go buy whatever is required(doesn't matter if I have to buy 1 or a list of things, takes me around 30 mins in the best days and can go to wasting half a day on really bad days) and i have to clean the bathroom on cleaning day.\n\n My sister has to cook(when there is no cooked food in the fridge), and by cooking i mean pasta or rarely sweets, and do the rest of the house on cleaning day.(the house takes around 2:30 if done properly and cooking takes 15 mins)\nSo realistically she does not do much most of the week, since she maybe cooks twice a week.\n\n So today like any other day(still in vacation tho) i wake up, wash the dishes ,do some homework, go buy food and around 8 pm i finish everything and go to my friends house(i do live very close to him).\n\n At 8:50 tho i get a call from my sister to come wash like 5 dishes cuz she wants to do pancakes. I say no because i already did my job today, and i tell her she does not need them(besides the pan), and that they wont ocuppy much space either. Plus why should i waste 15 mins to do what she could in 5?\nThat aside, she gets mad and tells me she wont make any for me.\n\n Around 10 pm i get a call from my mother to go buy some things necessary for the pancakes because she forgot to tell me earlier when i went the first time, at wich point i am forced to abide since they are necessary ingredients.\n\n In the end i do get 1 pancake, but its not the first time im asked at 10 pm to go buy some forgotten thing or to come wash some god forgotten dish(happens pretty often).\n\nBut i do have to be fair at least. My sister does do a lot for her age, but im not some stone golem, I wont compromise my free time(and we're talking about max 4h of free time) and happiness for unecessary things. Plus one philosophy I try my hardest to uphold is less effort for all, if can do something that aint my job with less effort than somebody else I will do it(if its NECESSARY). But i expect the same thing in return, otherwise I wont.\n\nTl;dr So to close this off, AITA for not wanting to come home to wash 5 dishes, when my sister could've washed them herself in less than half the time it would take me?",

      "description": "My (22m) girlfriend (22f) and I just started playing words with friends. We had 2 games going. Last night in game #1 I played “retailed” which used all 7 letters and I was pretty excited about. I played it and messaged her “FUCK me the fuck up. 7 letters bam” she replied with an eye roll. So the next turn I see I can play “bitch”. It was a good word and I probably would have played it either way but I thought it was even funnier given what just happened. \n\nShe messages me “you’re going to play 7 letters, have me watch it, message me, then play bitch”  me: “that’s right”\n\nSo it’s also 2 am her time and she had to be up at 7 so I also say “you gotta go to sleep soon”.\n\nNow the next morning (today) she’s only playing in game #2 and not touching the old game. I ask her about it and she says “it pissed me off in a not funny way last night”.\n\nI’m annoyed and don’t think I have anything to apologize for, it’s a game, we were having fun, but am I actually being an asshole?",
