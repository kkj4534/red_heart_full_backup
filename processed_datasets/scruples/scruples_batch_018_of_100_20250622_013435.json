I've been going out with this girl since valentine's and I feel like we've really hit it off.  Our convos are fun and I feel like there's no boring parts or downtime. \nSo I took her out to dinner last night and she insisted on drinks after which I obliged. The beer was starting to make me have to go to the restroom so I went to do my business. However, on my way back I saw that she was on tinder and literally just matched with someone. \nI was in a bit of shock and quickly sobered up and took her home and I've been feeling like crap ever since. \nWIBTA for just ghosting her at this point?

      "description": "Hypothetically speaking: I met a guy on Bumble. We had a few sexy flirts by text and his pics look really great in his profile. We set up a coffee meet and greet this Thursday afternoon, with the understanding that I’m looking for an FWB. I found out his name so I did a little social media investigation. Looking through his insta I saw links to the crossfit studio where he works out. And his studio has a group picture of some of the members and trainers. That’s where I saw him standing in a group, not as tall as I thought from his Bumble pics.\n\nSo if I tell a little lie to get us out of this date so we don’t waste each other’s time, is it really that bad? I’ll probably say something like “hey I actually met someone really cool and he wants to try being exclusive. I’m sure you are awesome and the next girl that snatches you up will be so lucky!”\n\nPro: lets him off the hook with dignity, spares his feelings, no waste of time\n\nCon: a lie\n\nCounter-con: sometimes you have to lie a little to spare people’s feelings",

      "description": "I haven't confronted my friend about this yet, because I'm not sure if I'm just being a fucking idiot. This has been going on for a couple years now.\n\nWhenever we start a new campaign, I almost always announce my character first. Then, when my friend announces his, it's always like he's trying to build into the same niche, but *more*. \n\nFor instance, when I announced a buff/healing build witch with a medical background, he immediately announced a hyper-heal specialist cleric. I thought, oh well, a little annoying that I never actually get to do my doctor gimmick, but cleric isn't an unusual choice.\n\nNext, It wasn't so much a mechanical issue; it was \"my character is a tiefling from [specific place], where she owns a house\". Next thing I know, he's a tiefling that lives down the street from me, despite the fact our characters could quite specifically be from ANYWHERE in the world and didn't have to know each other. And I thought, oh well, no big deal, bit weird that he made himself my neighbour for no reason without discussing it with me, but it's not a problem.\n\nThe next campaign, he announced his character before me. I deliberately picked a different niche to avoid that overlap. Unless his character dies, he won't get the opportunity to mimic me.\n\nWe're getting ready to play another campaign (we run two at a time, alternating each session), and I announced my character before anyone else. We use some 3rd party mechanics that I won't get into, so I'll phrase it simply: I'm a \"spear dancer\" rogue-alike with heavy emphasis on social skills, a \"face\" type character, and being more or less a rogue I'm a skill monkey too.\n\nMy friend announces his character and he's... A skill monkey bard with high socials and specialising in spears. Sure, bards have a lot of overlap with rogues. They're CHA mains, so their social skills are high!  But the spear speciality on top really makes me feel like he's muscling me out of my niche! He could be anything, and but he always picks something that's almost the same as me!\n\nHe's also on the spectrum, so I don't know if he's doing this deliberately or if I'm just being overly sensitive. But I'd like to just PLAY a character without feeling like I'm competing for my own gimmick for once! Am I the asshole here?",

Very very annoying. \n\nBackground: We work in customer service and Tim has to follow every single female customer he sees around. He flirts with them outrageously, and doesn't back off when they ignore him or ask him to stop. He has gotten write ups for doing this but we're critically short on staff due to holiday season so our manager decided to keep him on till New year. \n\nTim also walks around telling people he's a boxer. Flexes any chance he gets and talks about all the guys he knocks out at the gym near his house. He talks about all the women he's slept with constantly. Non-stop. He follows us around and just talks without break. If the rest of us talk about motorcycles, he talks about his \"Hayabusa Ninja\" immediately. if we talk about movies, he talks about his auditions in Hollywood non-fuc*ing-stop. You get the idea of what kind of guy he is. Always has to talk about how great he is. \n\nYou may think I'm exaggerating, I'm not. We all try to ignore him as much as possible, but it gets so hard sometimes. \n\nSo, to the fateful day. Yesterday I'm talking to a co-worker in our break room about starting to work out. I want to buy some workout stuff and I'm asking his opinion. Tim walks in towards the end of our conversation and turns to me and says, \"no need to buy anything brah. Just let me train you on my level.\" \n\nThat was it. I blew up on him. I said something along the lines of \"I'm tired of listening to you, shut the f up, f off, nobody here takes you seriously you massive tool.\" So Tim calls me an a hole and leaves the break room. \n\nToday I was written up by a supervisor for harassment and found out that Tim quit this morning after complaning. I feel kinda bad. AITA?",

      "description": "Hey so this is fuckinggg me up mentally and I really need to know what other people think, although I’m pretty sure I have a good idea of my standing.\n\nEssentially I met this beautiful girl on tinder, she was really cool, had a couple dates, met her friends. She was REALLLY into me (told me first date felt like a movie, has a lot of love for me, etc etc.) Now whole I really did like this girl, I’m in college, I work full time, and I have a bunch of other stuff going on I’m my life. I didn’t think this through and asked her to be my girlfriend early on because I could tell that’s the type of person she is, and she seemed kind of insecure I was going to ghost her or something, so I asked her to be my girlfriend. Mind you, this is my first real relationship. Almost instantly I felt like this was a mistake. I figured asking her to be my girlfriend would entail the same things we had been doing before, just that we were exclusive, and I did this because she was that person in my life at the time, and I knew I wasn’t going to be pursuing other girls so I guess I asked her out to ease her mind. I now know this was a terrrrible mistake but whatever.\n\nAnyways we dated for a couple weeks and she was going to a festival in New Orleans with her friends and invited me. I payed my way for everything and chipped in whenever possible. The trip was a real test as our car broke down and we wound up hitchiking to NOLA, and really just had an amazing and magical experience  throughout the entire trip, and I felt like we all grew very close, both her and her friends.\n\nAnyways, my girlfriend, while I reallllly liked her, lived an hour away from me, so I didn’t always have time to see her (couple times a week at best) so understandably she wanted to text/FaceTime a lootttt. I’m busy, and again, while I really like this girl, I have other relationships with my friends and family that I cannot just drop to spend all my free time talking to her. Also, while I liked this girl a lot, I could tell she was Into me on a whole nother level. When we’d drink she would say things like “I’m not in love with you, but I love you” and then get really upset when I wouldn’t say it back. There were other things, but the gist of it is while I liked her, she liked me a lot more, and I didn’t want to lead her on. One day she got pissed because I had to hang up to go do something and while this happened frequently , it really annoyed me this time, and I took a day to really think about the relationship and talk it over with some people. Anyways, I came to the consensus that I wish I had met her as a friend first, but since we are way past that point, I needed to end it here. Because I literally felt like this girl was falling in love with me and I didn’t reciprocate those feelings, I didn’t want to drag her along and play with her emotions. I had a talk with her explaining my side and how I would love to remain friends, but right now a relationship is not going to work with me, and she didn’t seem to take it very well. (Almost seemed like she was trying to convince me not too)\n\n\nI feel like a dick, but idk what to do at this point. We talk a looot less but it seems friendly enough. Have yet to have the final talk with her really explaining my mindstate, but I would just like to double check I’m not a compleeete asshole. \n\nI feel bad breaking up with her just 2 weeks after she took me on a trip that changed my life for The better, but I know deep in my heart that while I like this girl, this is not the one, and she feels differently and I just don’t want to have her thinking I care more than I really do, as harsh as that may sound.\n\n\nOh and also she said earlier in our relationship that she would never have an abortion, and then got upset with me when I said I was going to start using condoms since she’s not on BC. Not sure where that plays in exactly, but I kind of took it as a warning sign and a clue that I may be doing the right thing here.\n\n\nSo anyways, am I the asshole??",

Last night I couldn’t take it anymore and just stormed upstairs and I’ve been up there since, refusing to talk to anyone who tries to talk, since the adults all start drinking as soon as they wake up.\n\nI feel like I’m being guilt tripped into thinking I’ve ruined the party because I refuse to participate in anything with family. AITA?",

      "description": "So just for some background, I'm a minor but I have a job, paid for my car, and was paying for this. I need to do some relatively normal maintainence on my car and buy a part that costs about $100. I chose one from a manufacturer that I know would work and was ready to buy it last night from a website that I trusted but my mom wanted to see if she could find something better.\n\nSo I see a message this morning that she bought it and I could pick it up. Whatever, it's $5 more but it's ready for pickup now vs shipping. So I talk to her to double check if it's the right thing, because it's not very easy to find the specific part because they're all very similar. I found multiple people on the site she bought it from saying it didn't work on the advertised car and caused issues, but also people that said it was fine. So she said we could ask the people at the shop about it, I agreed that it wasn't a big deal and everything was fine.\n\nAt the end I said something along the lines of \"Hey, I don't have any issue with this purchase but in the future could you double check with me before making big purchases like this for me?\" This resulted in an argument with her repeatedly trying to defend herself buying this part, which I kept stating I had no issue with, and calling me ungrateful. She refused to acknowledge that I understood that this part was confusing and I wasn't upset about this specifically and that it was just a general request.\n\nLet me know if anyone wants me to explain something more because I'm genuinely not sure who's right here. Should I have waited or just not said the last thing at all? It doesn't seem like a disrespectful request or anything to me so, reddit, AITA?",

He asked me if I would take the loan for him, with him paying it all, not expecting me to pay any. The main problem is, I don't really want him to get this computer, especially since he has no money saved up. I said if he would save for a least a month or two I might actually do it, but he's set on getting it before February or not at all. When his mom got involved, she was really upset that I wouldn't just do it for him, and how if I was concerned about my credit that's not a good reason because his will affect mine when we're married anyway. That's not even why I said no, it's mainly because I *really* don't think I should get it yet. He wasn't even upset that I wouldn't do it he understood, but she acted like if I didn't do it it must mean I don't even love him",

      "description": "Using a throwaway because these friends know my reddit account.\n\nFor some perspective, my friends and I are all college students and are majority sophomores that all met here. At the beginning of our friendship, one of the couples in the group, let’s call them Jack and Jill, seemed to have an unhealthy relationship. Jill would continuously ridicule Jack, calling him ugly repeatedly and asking other members of the group to make fun of him with her. She would threaten breaking up with him and constantly hint towards expecting to break up with him anyway. In one particular moment, Jack tickled Jill while studying and when she moved away, her new laptop fell on the ground. She screamed and yelled at Jack even though her laptop was absolutely fine. She then ranted for like 10 minutes and cried for 30 more minutes after Jack repeatedly apologized and showed her that the laptop was okay. After that moment, she began blaming Jack for the next 3 months that he ruined her laptop, guilting him for something he didn’t intend to cause. Although I wasn’t there, one of the friends in our group actually witnessed her hitting Jack and crying about it for awhile, but she still got physical because of an argument. My friends and I started to notice how her words were affecting Jack and we were concerned for the health of their relationship and the relationship of our group because we were all becoming very uncomfortable.\n\nIt’s important to note that none of us felt that Jill would want to intentionally hurt Jack, we just thought that it was possible she was unaware of how she was affecting him and everyone else around her.\n\nSo, we reached out to Jack individually because he had asked if anything was up. We told him that we were worried that their relationship was unhealthy and he denied the claim. We asked him to hear us out and we listed a few examples of the things she was doing that we thought were unhealthy and we even used some of our personal experiences with abusive partners that were very similar (another reason we were worried). We wanted to tell him without her there in case there was a more serious reason to be concerned and she might’ve shot down everything we said. However, Jack proceeded to tell Jill who was very upset by the accusation and told all of us that her and Jack have a very open dialogue on the things that they might say that hurt each other in private. The rest of us backed off, telling her what we were concerned about but said that we were happy they discussed it. \n\nFast forward about a month later and Jill has sent lengthy messages to me about how uncalled for it was for us to accuse her of being abusive (which was of course implied but we were careful to not use that word) and angry that we spoke to Jack rather than her about the issue, expecting an apology. I explained to her that we would not apologize for looking out for our friend and that we went to him first out of a concern for him. She is claiming that we went into a situation we didn’t fully understand and she didn’t think she could be friends with people who could think she’s abusive.\n\nJack is fiercely devoted to Jill and also sent a message to each of us, calling us assholes who were rude and unfair to Jill, saying he would never want to be friends with us again because Jill deserved better treatment from us. All of us are confused because the whole conversation was for his safety, but knowing Jack is very attached to Jill makes more sense.\n\nMy friends and I feel as though we are in the right, but we want to hear more perspective on it because maybe we didn’t handle the situation in the best manner and actually are assholes.

They haven't made their way into my fields yet but I've seen them taunting another neighbor's dog and hanging on my fence so it's probably just a matter of time. I'm wanting to go over and introduce myself, do the whole polite welcome to the lane bit and ask them to please not allow their children to climb on my fence or enter my property. My boyfriend tells me this is rude and kind of a dick move and if I do that I'm not being very \"neighborly\" or \"welcoming\".\n\nI see this as a safety issue. In addition to the pond, the creek and all the rusty old farm equipment in the barn I've got 2 horses that were late-gelded breeding stallions and can be aggressive if not handled properly plus with this being spring the mares are coming in season which escalates their behavior. Pasture squabbles break out, especially if the horses are competing for human attention or think treats are involved. A hoof to the head can be deadly for an adult let alone a child. In my state horses are considered an attractive nuisance same as a swimming pool. I am appropriately insured as are my animals, my fences are secure, my property is posted, my gates are locked. Fences are easily climbed though and signs have been known to be ignored.\n\nWith all that considered, I'd rather look like an asshole to these people than take a chance on their kids getting hurt or worse. My boyfriend thinks I should just trust them to be respectful of the fences and signage until they give us reason to believe otherwise. I'm rather apprehensive about this approach and of course would be very polite entering a discussion with them about this.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I went over to them, said her welcome to the neighborhood so glad to have you here and btw please don't allow your kids in my fields for their own safety? I'd find a better way to say it to them obviously.",

      "description": "So this happened a decent amount of time ago but I finally want to get a definitive answer from randoms because people I know will just side with whoever they are friends with.\n\nSo basically, there is this one girl at my school, we'll call her L.  L has basically continuously had a boyfriend since age 13.  She sent nudes at 13, lost her virginity at 15, over the past 4 or so years she has dated 15+ guys that I know of.  A notable thing is that she lied about losing her virginity for several months until she broke up with the guy she lost it to and he called her out. \n\nAnyways, this whole incident started after a particularly volatile series of events in which L lead on a boy for about a month, the boy finally stopped caring and got with another girl who we will call D, and L contacted D's ex-boyfriend claiming that D left him for the other guy.  Obviously, this created a giant rift between the two and via snapchat, they both started being super passive agressive towards each other and literally recruiting other students to post passive agressive messages on snapchat for them.  The whole thing went down as legend.\n\nLong story short, D had the majority of support, including mine, and L went into some kind of social exile.  Anyways, literally a day after L had many of her friends turn against her, and she lost the man she was trying to go after, I get a message from her asking if I want to fuck.  I thought it was some kind of joke at first, but it became evident that she was dead serious.  In my eyes, I was clearly some kind of second.  Some kind of backup that she would just go to if the first guy she was trying to get with didn't work out.  Also I don't know if this really matters but I dated L when I was like 15 so it's not like this was a first time thing.  So, instead of indulging her at all, I told her exactly as follows - \"Fuck off you slut.  Find someone else to deepthroat.\" Also I had a gf at the time, which I'm pretty sure she was aware of, but not certain. Now my question is, AITA for saying this?  In my eyes, I feel that I was justified, but I really don't know given that words like slut can have so many connotations and be really hurtful.",

When I was younger and used to stay at my grandparents she used to call me fat for no reason and she would just stare at me as I broke into tears and as a result of this I started starving myself. Now I've mostly put all that behind me but even now she still says mean things and makes me feel bad. One time I put on dark lipstick because I wanted to cover up the dark scars on my lips gotten from my lip picking habit and when she saw me all she said was \"why did you put on lipstick, you look like a...\" she didn't complete her statement but I just knew it wasn't anything good. All in front of the Uber driver. I felt so bad and embarrassed. Now I don't talk to her because I'm tired of being talked to like I'm nothing. She doesn't ask me to hang out anymore and one time she said that what ever she did that I should just keep in mind that she's a human being and she's not perfect. I feel bad besuae I don't like keeping malice but also I'm tired of being treated like crap. My brother says I should let it slide but I can't. Please help.\nI'm 23 BTW. ",

      "title": "AITA for trying to help my cousin have a normal high school experience?",
      "description": "I (20F) am in my third year of university. I have a cousin (17F) (I'll call her \"V\") who lives with her parents (my aunt and uncle) about a 15 minute walk from my apartment. I've been in university for the last two years, while V is still in high school.\n\nWe both have parents who are culturally and religiously conservative. While I was in high school my parents were very strict around issues such as schoolwork, dating, socializing etc. Beyond attending prom with a friend from church, I did not go to dances, parties or any of the usual high school social experiences. At university, I intentionally decided to live on-campus in an effort to start charting my own path.\n\nI knew that V was dealing with a similar high school experience to my own, so I had her over to my dorm a few times in my first year to hang out, since her parents would permit that. In truth, I was also insecure about making friends and a bit lonely in the dorm initially. Over time she and I became friends with two of my roommates. We began to hang out together as a group. I think she appreciated having a chance to relax away from the stress of her home life. In my second year, my friends and I got an apartment off-campus. V would come along to parties and would come out downtown with us sometimes. It also evolved into me being a cover for her - where she would tell her parents she was visiting me, but really got a chance to see her own friends. We would coordinate our stories and ensure the same lies went to both my parents and hers.\n\nBy the end of my second year my friends and I would often go out 3 or 4 times a week. My life had become quite chaotic - I would often get home at 1 or 2 in the morning, completely drunk, and somehow crawl to class in the morning, sometimes having snorted something to get me going. Guys came and went too. I thought I was just having fun, but it was quickly unmanageable. V would hang out and drink with us and sometimes we would get high together. I treated her like another university student, as she was always so smart and mature. \n\nThis year I've cleaned up my act. My grades are up, and I'm in a much better place mentally. V, however, is not. The last few times we went out she was wasted before we even got to a bar. A few weeks ago when I had her over for dinner she was wearing the skimpiest dress ever and it was clear she was on something. Her insta is full of photos of parties and her in crazy revealing outfits. \n\nThis week her mom called asking if I can talk with V. She said she thought V was drinking and hanging out with boys. I think she only knows maybe 20% of the story. I avoided mentioning any of this history and just said I would talk to her about it. Another lie. \n\nI know that she makes her own choices - she turns 18 soon. However, it feels as though if I had not invited her into my life, partially for my own selfish reasons, she would be in a better place in her own. I think it was too much too soon. AITA for enabling all of this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I told her that she always annoys me whenever she says things based of of 0 facts or some random facebook article and it really fucking annoys me. I also told her that I only visit her because I feel obligated because she keeps pulling the \"If I die nobody will notice until they smell my dead body\" card and that made her cry. It's obvious she just wants someone there for her but the guilt tripping and being the instigator for 99% of the family problems (Her son -my dad- doesn't talk to her anymore and doesn't let her see his other kids -my stepmom- because she is really pushy and control freaky).

I'm not trying to make either me or her the \"asshole\" I just want to know where a third party, aka relentlessly honest reddit, stands on this. This way I can find out where the problem lies so I can try to fix this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my long-distance girlfriend are two very complicated souls for sure. She deals with the backlash of an emotionally manipulative ex-boyfriend and various issues with anxiety, depression and paranoia. I personally suffer from diagnosed moodswings, depression and I'm on the spectrum.\n\nDiscussing emotions, particularly negative ones, has always been hard for us. Especially if they are negative feelings towards one another. We both like to avoid confrontation at all costs which, of course, isn't healthy but it's simply how are brains are hardwired to process negativity.\n\nLately I've been trying to get over my urge to avoid confrontation and trying harder to work on our relationship. This involves a lot of internal confrontation with myself but it has also forced me to be more honest and open about my frustrations. One of which being that I feel like I have to dig to find out whether she is frustrated with me or not. This has led to me feeling insecure about myself and always wondering whether I am doing everything wrong or not.\n\nIN HER DEFENCE:\n\nI am a deeply troubled person. I've not been stable lately. Moodswings, work, school and issues at home have got me pretty fucked right now. To make matters worse I'm a pretty sensitive guy who struggles with regulating my emotions so there's a proportional chance I am making this way bigger of a deal than it actualy is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love this woman to death and please, if any of you could help me identify whether this is solely on me or not it would be a tremendous help.

      "description": "So i know we are like nearly a month post-christmas but i have literally been stewing on this since then and I am no closer to figuring out if I am an asshole or not?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner and I have been together for nearly 3 years(anniversary in March) and he has lived with me in my parents' home since 6 months. He is very well accustomed to how my family operates, what is expected of us on events and how much effort goes into events such as Christmas, Birthdays, etc. I also worked with his Mum (how we originally met) so I know her pretty well and know how their family works and it is very similar to mine. Both of our Mum's put a lot of effort and planning in to events, it's very important to them that everyone has enough food, presents etc. \n\nLast 2 Christmas' together we have been at my family home for Christmas morning and lunch, and been to his family home for Christmas Evening. This year we discussed and planned as i'm sure all couples do, and we agreed that normally we are still full from a late lunch to eat dinner, so this year we would do breakfast at his rents, and late lunch at mine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe arrived at his family home around 9am and did presents and all of that. We were told we were waiting on another family friend who was coming before we could eat. She arrives at 11am and the food starts coming out after some greetings, Lunch food, not the breakfast I was expecting. We eat, we hang out, we talk and laugh. All is well. It comes to around 1:30pm which is around the time I expected we would be leaving to go to my rents (we usually do late lunch at my place around 2pm, it's the same every year and my partner often jokes about the fact that its always a \"late lunch around 2pm\"). My partner gets another drink and is showing no sign of being ready to leave. At this point I am getting a bit anxious. I text my Mum and tell her that they can go ahead and eat without us, we might be a bit late. \n\nMy partners Dad starts saying \"your Nan said it would be nice if you could go see your Pop today and play a game of pool with him, would that be okay?\"\n\nAt this point I am ready to cry, my face has started to show my anxiety because my partner keeps looking at me and getting cranky because he can see I am upset. Without consulting me or discussing the situation, he says \"yeah it is fine, we will go over there\". \n\nHis grandparents only live around the corner so it is not a long trip, but we end up going there and not leaving their hous until 4:30pm. \n\nMy family are furious because they waited all day for us before opening presents and eating food, and had they known we would have been that late they happily would have arranged for Christmas DINNER. AND might I add that when we discussed plans with his Mum, she specifically suggested Breakfast because SHE knew we had late lunch with my fam. \n\nNot once during the day did he check with me to see what time we had to be at my rents, or if we were doing okay for time or if it was okay we were running late. \n\nSo here we are, a month later, we haven't spoken about it since and I am still mad. I am mad that he had no consideration for my family and the fact they had planned their day around us, I am mad because he had no consideration for me and how I might feel, I am mad especially because I feel as though he knew exactly what he was doing and intentionally put me in that position because he knew I wouldn't say anything in front of his family on the happiest day of the year. \n\nAM I THE ASSHOLE FOR BEING MAD?

Despite that, I have the capacity to understand and respect that some people don't like dogs that much or at all.\n\nFlash-forward to the past few months, I've been feeling really homesick (I'm finishing school abroad), stressed because of highschool, and I've been missing my dogs a whole lot cause being around them would relax me. Since my other friends are dog lovers, I talk to them from time to time about my dogs and how much I miss them, sharing pictures and stories, and its kinda my way to cope as well. Usually, this friend would stay silent while we talked like this (understandable), but I started to sense that she probably felt left out so I decided to change topics or talk about it as minimally as possible.\n\nOnce she asked me why I loved dogs so much, and I decided to patiently explain to her why (they relax me, are really cute, etc). I almost took it as an opportunity to get closer to her in general because she and I were the most distant ones in our friend group. After I explained, she just shrugged and said in a joking manner \"eh, I always liked cats better\". It just felt so dismissive of the topic, and really rude considering I basically opened up to her cause my dogs have been such a big part of my life growing up. I felt that maybe I was just being dramatic and shrugged it off, but the interaction has stained my view of her ever since.\n\nRecently, because it's near the end of the school year for me and I also have to start applying to colleges, my stress has been a lot worse and so I miss my dogs even more. Because of this I've been talking about my dogs a lot more, but I do try to be considerate and only talk about them to a select few friends at a time so she wouldn't feel left out. Even then, she'd still make faces at us when she'd see pictures of our dogs or overhear us talking about them and makes comments like, 'oh really youre talking about them *again* /u/byulkong?' or she'd express how much she doesn't get the appeal but it's not like we were talking to her or asked her opinion anyway, and not only is it really annoying but it's the last thing I need right now. \n\nLike, what did my dogs ever do to you that you feel you need to assert how much you dislike them in every other conversation I'd have about them?? It's really starting to piss me off, and I just have no time or the mentality to deal with it right now. So... WIBTA for cutting her off? Or is it too much of a petty thing to do? ",

      "description": "(For context I am 15 yrs old) Every week starting from about Wednesday or Thursday (depending on if he’s working, which for the last couple months he hasn’t been) my older brother (24) binge drinks non stop until Sunday afternoon. As he does this he goes all over the place. From the pub, to a friends, to our house etc. and I absolutely hate when he’s in the house with his friends. They usually stay in the kitchen, and I usually stay in the living room. They can be loud and I don’t really feel comfortable when they are there. Not to mention there can sometimes be hash and cocaine, And can get themselves into a right state. My mum usually goes to bingo on a Thursday so a lot of the time it starts then. I tell her that I don’t like them there and that I feel very uncomfortable, but she just tells me that he has the right to have friends over and that I’m being horrible for not being okay with it. We have quite a big shed out in our back garden. It used to be lovely, but the years of partying and drinking in it has ruined it. My other brother and him sometimes go in there with their friends but not often. When I ask my brother or mum if he and his friends can at least go out to the shed to do their thing, my brother says that it’s too cold and my mum just gets stressed and tells me to stop overreacting. There is a heater out there, but it costs about €4.00 an hour and if they want to turn it on my mum demands they pay up. So they always end up in the kitchen. My mum also says that she’ll be home at 10:30 and will kick them out if they’re extremely drunk, but she never does. She’s a very naive person and can be a bit of a pushover. He also always says that its only him and like two people but more of them always end up coming in. When they’re there I feel so uncomfortable walking into the kitchen. So help. am I overreacting, or are my feelings justified?",

      "description": "Many years ago I was a drug addict. I ended up homeless, penniless and majorly depressed. My older sister, Jane, told me to figure my life out and hung up on me. My oldest sister, Ann, drove down to pick me up and she gave me a place to stay. I think she saved my life that day. I ended up staying with her rent free for 2 years. During that time she also helped me in my personal life, kept me away from my abusive ex and addicted friends, found me a full time job and straightened out my life. I owe her so much. I'm thankful for all she did for me and that she didn't give up on me that day. It's been a few years since I moved out but we're still very close now.\n\n​\n\nWhen Ann got married I threw myself into the wedding planning. I wanted to repay her kindness for me. I bought and decorated her wedding shoes, sewed her daughter's dress for the wedding, baked her wedding cake, cupcakes and eclairs for her guests. I also DIYed her centerpieces for the tables. I was very involved in her wedding. Now Jane is getting married and she expected me to be as involved in her wedding as I was with Ann, but I'm not. I'm tired from working and I just don't want to bake a cake and other desserts for 70+ guests again. I told her she could reuse the centerpieces for her wedding but she wants completely new ones even though I kept them in really good condition. When Jane found out that I'm not keen on baking or crafting new center pieces for her wedding she complained that I was being unfair and showing favoritism. She tried begging but I continued to decline and said the reason I helped Ann with her wedding so much was to repay her kindness during the time I was homeless. Now Jane thinks I'm punishing her because she didn't help me out when I was homeless. That's not true. We buried the hatchet and forgave each other a long time ago. I thought I would ask strangers if you think IATA?",

      "description": "Not long ago, my (now) ex-girlfriend, me and her teenage daughter were playing badminton in our front yard one night when someone pulls up in their vehicle. We come up to them at the end of our driveway and chat for a while. They're a middle-aged couple who just moved in a couple houses down, and they have a teenage daughter as well -- to which my ex excitedly introduces her own teenage daughter and welcomes them to hang out together sometime. \n\nThe entire time, I stood there awkwardly waiting for my ex to introduce me, but that never happened. I confronted her about it later, and she sternly disagreed with me saying that I should have introduced myself to the new neighbors. I was completely flabbergasted by her reaction, and I really didn't have much to say in response to her opinion on the issue.\n\nI can't say I've ever had a situation like this happen in my adult life. I just feel that if you would introduce your daughter to someone new, then you would also introduce your long-term boyfriend, who is also standing right next to you, as well. But hey -- if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong. I would just like some clarification on this social situation. \n\n",

But it's 4 years and she's more fanatical than ever. She doesn't drink milk and eggs either. I think it's stupid and dangerous for your health, and she's obviously missing nutrients, but she refuses to see logic and reason.\n\nNormally it doesn't affect me, but she sent out the invitations for her wedding and told everyone that there would be a vegan caterer. This is where it becomes a problem. I don't eat vegan food. Never have, never will. The only people who are vegan are her, her fiance, and some of their friends. Our parents agree with me that she can't do this, and exclude everyone. I tried to talk to her about it but she said it's not about me, and I'm being selfish about her and her fiance's special day. Yeah it's not about me, but she's alienating everyone going to her wedding, and basically saying she's better than us. Why can't she just serve her and her friends their \"food\" and let the rest of us eat normal food in peace? How hard would that be? I want to put my foot down and tell her I won't go otherwise.\n\nWho's the asshole, me, or my sister who refuses to compromise at all and make her guests feel welcome.",

      "description": "Trying to accurately represent both sides here. So today is a national holiday where I live and my husband got the day off from work. This is special because a) I also work M-F and he works weekends, so it's rare we have a day off together; and b) our 7-month-old was sick recently and he was the one who stayed home with her for, so he hasn't had a day off in a month as he has been catching up since that time.\n\nSince it's a holiday and also my birthday tomorrow (but he'll have to work tomorrow), I wanted us to go out to lunch as a family. To exemplify how rare this happens, the last time we were able to all three go out together was in October. Yes, as in 2018. And *that* was our first family outing... so suffice it to say family time doesn't happen often and I want to take advantage of today.\n\nHe is refusing to go because he said he's tired from work, and has a toothache. Okay, so this is a legit toothache, but here's the thing. He has had problems with the tooth for a year. He does nothing about it (actually, he has to get it extracted and a whole bunch of dental work that we can't afford has to go along with that, so we're just waiting for the magical day we can save the money for that surgery until he can get the tooth out). \n\nSo while I understand that having a chronic toothache sucks, as does working all the time, I also think it's important to spend family time together. It's not like I'm asking him to take us on a huge excursion or anything. It's lunch. At a cheap café. Like, soups and coffee sort of deal. And he can't be bothered/tooth hurts too much.\n\nThis is the only thing I've asked for for my birthday, because we can't afford presents now that we have the baby and all. If we don't go today, who knows when the next time he'll have off will be. Could be months down the road before a day off for each of us coincides again on the same day and we can do something with our daughter.\n\nI should add that he is an *excellent* father - at home. He does more than his fair share of babycare, housework cleaning, etc... But it all stops at the door I take her to daycare and pick her up by myself M-F (b/c it's on the same side of town as my workplace), I take her to playdates, I take her to baby classes and the park and basically all of her socialization outside the house is just her and me alone, whether or not I'm tired from working all week, whether or not I'm sick or have a headache or something. It's like at home we're this great family unit but outside the house I'm a single mom.\n\nSo who's the asshole here? Am I being unreasonable for insisting he go to lunch as a bday present to me (and to spend time with his wife and kid) even though he's understandably tired, and has a legit toothache? Or is he making a mountain out of this toothy molehill?",

      "description": "I’m a 26 F and Indian. I grew up in a culture that prioritizes family above all but I’ve never been close to my parents. My mom used to abuse me physically, verbally, and emotionally everyday growing up and my dad would occasionally stop it but overall still let it happen. He was too worried about his own problems. I felt like I was punished for everything- getting less than a 95 on a test, my younger brother (10 years younger) getting hurt while playing, for eating an extra serving of food, for asking my mom for something after she and my dad had a fight with their families. I remember wondering everyday if today would be my last day on earth. Either they would end me or I should end myself and save them the effort\n\nI could go on but there’s a couple incidents that I just can’t get over and I feel bad for. I was probably around 13 or so when my mom chased me around the house with a knife in her hand. She eventually got tired of running and told me to come to her instead so that she doesn’t have to put in the effort. I don’t remember what I did to upset her but after then I never felt safe. \n\nI knew I was always unwanted. My mom used to always tell me that she could have left her miserable marriage had I not been born, or born a girl. I guess there’s a greater  stigma of leaving a daughter than a son\n\nI look around and everyone else around me is happy to be around their family. I put on a happy face but I just don’t feel like I can trust my family. They’ve done a lot for me like buying me a car, paying for some of my college fees, and letting me stay with them after I graduated. Everyone around me is telling me to forgive the past and put in more effort to be like those families. AITA for not wanting to do that? I’ve learned to be happy alone without them but they’re still family \n\nThank you for reading. \n\nHere’s a TLDR for this long post: parents were abusive growing up. Relatives, Friends of parents and coworkers tell me that I need to get over it since it’s a part of parenting and try to be that happy family I want",

      "description": " Me \\[33m\\] and my fiancee\\[30\\] have been together for 5 years. I recently proposed and we are currently working on a guest list. She has a friend who has never really been nice to me, barely acknowledging me or speaking to me. My fiancee has been trying to distance herself from her, as she has demonstrated toxic behavior before. My fiancee has had many one on one conversations trying to be constructive but this resulted in her trying to self victimize and turn our friends against us. My fiancee has always given her the benefit of the doubt throughout the friendship but is exhausted by it always being about the friend. I don't want this person exacerbating our stress during our planning and potentially ruining our wedding day. After it seems like my fiancee has gotten over it, the friend is back to her toxic ways. I don't want her to come to our wedding, and my fiancee is having trouble telling her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is a good way of telling the friend? Is this reasonable on our part? Would I be able to just tell the friend myself? I feel like I should step in because my fiancee falls for her friends bullshit and knows she has a tendency to do this, but it keeps her from truly ending the friendship. Our other friends have begun to distance themselves from the toxic friend, but she is clinging onto my fiancee despite not changing her behavior towards anyone else.\n\n \n\nTldr: is it fair for me to tell fianceés guest she isn’t welcome because she is not nice to me, the groom?\n\n ",

      "description": "I'm 40, and though I have had some relationships, I've never really felt comfortable in them. I enjoy the company of others, and I enjoy intimacy and sex, but I'm a huge introvert that likes to spend much of my time alone. When I'm in a relationship, I start to feel bogged down and a desire to free myself. \n\nIn the past, I found myself in over my head in relationships, so I've learned to be honest and up-front with potential romantic partners. \n\nThese days, I just enjoy living my life (work, health, reading, finances, travel, etc.). I am still a generous, loving person who cares for my family and friends. \n\nI sometimes have romantic \"flings,\" especially with younger women. I am not saying this to brag -- I find that younger women are more open to temporary situations, and women closer my age often want more. I have dipped my toe into \"sugar daddy\" or \"compensated dating\" relationships too. So far, my experiences have been pretty positive. \n\nAnyway, am I an asshole for being this way?",

      "description": "So this happened years ago when I was 18 and she was 17. (I'm 22 now)\n\nI found out she showed another guy nude pictures of herself when I wanted to prank a coworker of hers by pretending to be her on her phone. Except there was a conversation above about how he appreciated that she showed him nude pictures of herself (in person), and she was like \"No problem, I'm an open book\". This was while we were in a relationship.\n\nObviously I was upset by this so I confronted her. She didn't say anything and just looked like a deer in the headlights she began to cry and I stormed out and drove home. I got a couple messages from her friends telling me how awful I am for walking out on her because \"It was only 3 fucking photos!\" and that it was apparently an *accident*. There's no way in hell I was believing that. These messages ramped me up even more.\n\nI decided to message friends and group chats to tell them the news. In one group chat I said something like \"Welp, now that that relationship is over.. anybody want nudes?\", \"I'll sell them for a dollar\" and shit like that. (This is the AITA part).\nI wasn't actually going to do it. It was just a heat of the moment joke.\n\nThe main reason I felt this was acceptable was because I wanted to make it bite her in the ass for being so \"open\". Kinda like a \"How do you like it now?\" type of thing. I didn't end up showing anybody any nudes.\n\nThis was a *massive* group chat with a bunch of people from our high school and a girl who isn't friends with either of us reached out to my ex and told her what I said. This girl was on my ex's side and turned a bunch of people against me. They even emailed my mom telling her what I said.\n\nAITA for what I said? Who's the bigger asshole here? \n\nTL;DR\nEx showed nude pictures of herself to coworker, I said on highschool groupchat \"Anybody want nudes of her?\". Didn't actually send nudes, and got hate from pretty much everyone except my friends.",

She never seriously gets mad at anyone and is just a chill teacher. However, she took my joke as me calling her stupid (it wasn't even directed at her and even if it was, I wasn't seriously calling the examiner stupid).\n\nShe makes me sit down and starts screaming at me about how she won't take \"being called stupid\". I end up crying silently for the rest of the class, and despite me wishing and wishing she wouldn't, she asked me to stay back afterwards. I end up having a full blown panic attack while she's all like \"Why are you breathing like that?\" \"I'm not mad at you\".\n\nAccording to her, all is forgiven and forgotten and it's not a big deal.

      "title": "AITA Considering giving away a friends furniture",
      "description": "This story starts two years ago, I was moving into a new place and so was my friend's ex. Her ex had been using her patio furniture because she lives in an apartment with no outdoor space, but now he was moving and could no longer keep the furniture. She was feeling stressed because she was going to need to put it in storage, we live in DC so this would cost about $100/mo. She had shipped it over from Germany and paid an insane amount for it, so it had sentimental value even though it looks like something you could buy at Target. I told her my place had an outdoor space if she wanted to keep her furniture there. She said great and so began how we were going to get it to my house, she was talking about me paying for a truck and I told her, I wasn't that interested in the furniture so I didn't want to pay for a truck but if it could fit in my car I could help pick up. She ended up finding a friend with a minivan and delivering it. One year went by and I asked if she wanted it back and she let me know she re-signed her lease and still couldn't take it. Sure, I was fine having it another year. My backspace is surrounded by cement and not sunny so I, unfortunately, have never been able to make use of the furniture except to go out and wipe it down on occasion. So now comes around this year, I am moving and tell her on 10/23 that I'm moving out 12/20 and would need furniture gone by then. I send her a few texts between and she finally agrees to pick it up on 12/16 with her friends minivan. The 16th comes and I am getting berated with texts, it's raining, her friend bailed, she needs to rent a truck, are the cushions wet? She can't pick up because the furniture is wet and it will ruin the rental car (Who would rent a car vs a small moving van?). So she says she will have to figure out another day to pick up and asks about my move on 12/20, now I specifically lied about my move date because I knew this would happen. Who would want someone to come to their house and get in the way of movers. I told her I was moving Friday 12/21 and so she could pick up anytime until then but forecast is rain on Thursday so I'd recommend Wednesday. I don't hear anything from her. I then have a thought, maybe she doesn't even want this furniture, she hasn't actually used it in 4 years and I recall her thinking about selling it before I offered to take it. I send her a text, saying it seemed like she was stressed out, and if she didn't want it, I'd be happy to post it for free on a community site. I see the text was read with no response and an hour later send her another text asking her to let me know what to do because I'm really stressed with the move and want to figure this out. She sends me a super angry text telling me the furniture was a loan and how dare I think I have any right to give it away and that I better be drying out the cushions for her to pick up. AITA?",

      "description": "So there’s this girl, I’ll call her A, that lied about this guy sexually harassing her I think for attention. So she said in a GroupMe or 20 that this guy was harassing her and stuff, but we eventually found out she was lying. She even admitted it herself. Now she has lied in the past too, about what I honestly don’t know because she is actually a good liar, but she has said she’s lied before. Maybe that’s a lie :/. \n\nA while ago she started dating my best friends ex and he is straight up abusive, racist, and sexist. Now we told her this, but she kept saying “oh he’s different with me” and things like that. Eventually they broke up, she even said he said something racist towards her then said that he didn’t  later on.\n\n\nAnother time she said this guy hit her and while he did, it may not have been as hard as she previously said (I don’t trust her anymore). I cut this guy out of my life because of this and the fact that he already made me uncomfortable, I just didn’t have a reason to stop talking to him yet.\n\nNow recently, I said that I was mad at A to one of my friends, let’s call him B, and basically he didn’t know what was going on (this is just the gist of things, I can explain more if you ask) and he found out why via me saying something in a group chat. Now he is mad at A because of what she did, and then he and a few others talk to her about her problems and why what she did was wrong.\n\nNow on the bus she apologizes to me, but I didn’t think it was genuine. So I said I can’t accept her apopgu because of that.  Now this girl hears (mutual friend of A and I) and asks to spill tea, I said I’ll message her on insta because I don’t want the entire bus to hear. I just said that she lied about this guy sexually harassing her and that I think that she doesn’t understand that what she did was wrong. So A then proceeds to message me saying and basically said that I was trying to make her lose all of her friends. I said that was a lie because that wasn’t my intention, but then I realized that it may be what I’m doing without realizing.\n\nI screenshots the accusation to a group chat (who also know about the situation and were already annoyed with A in general, the chat was actually made to make a secret poll to remove her from a chat on the day she lied about the guy just before she started talking). And we just discuss it.\n\nWhile A and I are still talking she keeps saying how she’s trying to change, but she also said that with the previous things and hasn’t. She also lied about not talking to my friends ex when she in fact was. So I keep saying that I can’t believe her. She keeps asking for help, but I say that she isn’t going to listen. B and the others lectured her earlier, that was help. They talked about what she did was wrong and her problems, but she just said she didn’t feel well. So eventually I just said you can’t expect others to change you. \n\nI’m sorry for this crappy writing my brain feels spaced out and I’m just so stressed from this situation. Please ask questions if you have any.\n\n\nI feel either that I’m in the wrong or I’m being emotionally manipulated \n\n",

We had to get into small groups and present our essay ideas (for our final projects) to our groups for about 10 minutes. After this is a round of feedback from each of us to the presenter. I am arguing in m essay of how ugly people count as an oppressed groups. \n\nIn my group, there were two other males and one female. After I presented my group, the female (let's call her Carly) REALLY didn't like some of the points I brought up, one of which was that ugly people have a harder time navigating social situations, including friendships and dating. She took that to mean that ugly people are owed sex and called me out for saying that \"incel shit\". Everyone else was quiet. I countered some of her points, and we moved on to the next presenter.\n\nHis topic was on how oppression is necessarily performed by individuals, not groups. Well guess what? Carly's essay was the exact opposite. After he presented, they went back and forth for quite a while. Then the other person in our group presented his topic. Carly was looking at her  phone the entire time. After he finished his presentation, Carly was still stuck on the other guy's essay, and went back to criticizing that. Things got heated, and eventually, I talked over them and said \"Look, chill the hell out and let the presenter get the feedback her deserves!\" Carly glared at me and muttered \"asshole\". She did not speak to me at all afterwards.\n\nDid I handle this well? Was I too tough in my attempt to restore order? AITA?",

Two of the doors only have a chain lock. Some of the carpeted room, the carpet isn't even attached to the floor, it's just been laid on top of the floor. There isn't a hose spicket outside.

      "description": "Throwaway account. And on mobile. My apologies.\n\nSo my bf and I have been dating for about 8 months now, and things are going pretty well. His new job, however, leaves him tired pretty much all the time. He works early mornings (3am-11am) on weekdays, and I work as a bartender on Thursday-Saturday nights. I'm also a college student, so hanging out on weekdays is not really possible. So trying to find time where we're not both stupidly tired is really hard. We've worked out at least that he's the least tired on Fri/Sat nights so he doesn't have to wake up the next morning. So whenever I have a night off, I go see him.\n\nThe problem is we don't go out. When I'm at his place, I mostly just watch him play games with his friends. If I bring my PC over, we can play together, but otherwise I need to just find/bring something to do. We have an old Wii that I normally suggest we can play games together on, but often he refuses and goes back to his Pc. We do watch Game of Thrones together, but that's normally a few episodes just before bed. \n\n\nFast forward to last weekend. I was rostered on for the whole weekend, so I got someone to cover my Friday shift. I went over to my bf's place and...same deal. I watched him play with his friends. (I didn't bring my PC. Normally if I'm only over for one day I don't bother). It's pretty depressing to be sitting next to someone you love and think \"man I would rather be at a job I hate right now.\" So I spoke up. I told him that I took time off work tonight to see him and that we should spend our time doing something together. \n\nHe got really defensive. Told me that he didn't think I wanted to do anything 'special' and that he just wants to play games. Anyway, he (reluctantly) shuts off his game, we make dinner together, watch some GoT together and then go to bed.\n\nOn one hand I'm happy I finally told him that it bothers me, but on the other I completely understand his situation. With his job, he doesn't have a whole lot of time to play games and I'm wondering if I was too pushy. I should've just gone to work and not guilt trip him for something that he likes doing, right? But I mean, I play games but I set time aside for them. My brother is a pretty avid gamer but when his gf comes over, they go out. I don't know if I was in the wrong for speaking up. AITA? ",

Incident # Uno: \n\nIts the first day off I've had since we moved in together a month ago and I've spent the whole day cleaning the house and preparing a romantic candlelit dinner for the two of us. 6:30 rolls around when he should be getting home from work and I finish getting the table set and give him a call to find out his ETA. He answers the phone and tells me he actually currently at dinner with a friend and forgot to tell me he made other plans. I ask him to let me know in the future if he's not going to be coming home after work at which point he gets mad at me for ruining his night out with his friend.\n\nIncident number 2:\n\nWe made plans a couple weeks ago to spend today together as it was the only day in the past few weeks wherein we were both not working(we even added it to our shared calendar) . Im waiting for him to get home from his parents when he texts me telling me he's going to be going out for dinner with a friend at which point I remind him we had plans and he gets mad at me for not reminding him about it the night before and proceeds to tell me I'm a black hole and nothing he does is good enough and it's my fault he made other plans because I didn't remind him that we were supposed to be having a date night...\n\nAm I the asshole for getting upset when he makes plans with other people and doesn't tell me about when I'm expecting us to be doing something together?? I wouldn't even be mad if he told me the day before but finding out an hour before we're supposed to hangout or as I'm putting dinner out is making me. Furious and so sad",

      "description": "This happened yesterday.   Driving to a destination an hour away along a busy 2+hov road during rush hour.   I'm in the HOV lane and things are moving slowly but they are moving.\n\nWe hear sirens and soon see a police SUV coming from behind in the HOV lane with us.  This HOV lane is to the far left.\n\nEveryone knows what to do and I and the other drivers immediately pull hard to the right entering the middle and clearing the HOV lane allowing the cop to pass.\n\nNow it gets interesting; a minivan leads a column of cars that is trailing the police car about 50 yards back. The column of cars looks solid and they are moving at a fast enough clip that it looks like it's going to be a bitch getting back into the HOV lane.\n\nNot wanting to 'lose my spot' I pulled back into the HOV lane.  Now the white minivan was only moving about 20-25mph and had plenty of time to stop but I did not merge at speed, I effectively forced them to brake.  I had my kids in the car but I felt that the white minivan had plenty of time to slow down.\n\nI pulled in front of the white van and proceeded slowly, letting everyone else ahead of me get back into the HOV lane and we proceeded as we were.\n\nNow I would NEVER do this in a normal traffic situation, but it really seemed like this column of cars was taking advantage of the situation. \n\nBoy the white van was NOT happy.  They laid on their horn something fierce.  I gave them the bird out the window.  They unleashed a tirade of invective.  I could hear the woman clearly screaming that she'd kill me and that I was fucking dead.   I gave her another bird and that was the end of it.\n\nAt the time I felt like I was in the right and fuck that lady for trying to ride behind the emergency vehicle and fuck the rest of us but I realize that maybe I'm the asshole here.  What say ye all?",

I have brought these children's to my parents, but they're basically saying i'll get over it.\nI have an older brother who has his own apartment and has already said he would let me live with him, but my parents have said no. In my state, if you are over 16, you can leave home without your parents consent. If they do move into that tiny home, I want to leave and go to my brother's. I wouldn't cut them out of my life or anything, it would be just the same as if I was moving out, just earlier than usual. \nWIBTA for telling them this? ",

      "description": "In May 2013, my husband and I agreed to let my then 18 year old sister live with us while she went to college. We are both 10+ years older than her and worked two jobs while going to school so we know how hard it can be. We told her she had five years max to get a degree and move out. No rent or utilities were ever charged, she just had to buy her own her personal items like toiletries and snacks. A year ago she informed us that she would not be graduating before the five year mark so we gave her 6 more months til Jan 1st 2019. She did graduate in December!!! However she is still here and avoiding us at all cost. Locking herself in her room, ignoring our repeated knocking on her door/calls/text, and sneaking in and out the back door. She hasn't spoken to either of us in 3 weeks. I don't think she has any place to go or any money saved but at this point I don't really feel sorry for her. I feel like I'm being used. I've called and made an appointment for a locksmith to change the locks on Mon. My family says it's terrible to just kick her out but none of them are willing or able to take her. Even my friends are saying I can't kick my own lil sister out on the street. Everyone says to give her a few more months but we already extended the deadline once. \n\nTL;DR Agreed to let lil sis (23 now) live with my husband and I for free for 5.5 years until 1/1/19. That day has passed and she is still here and avoiding us.  I have scheduled to get the locks changed on Mon. Do you agree with my family and friends that I can't kick out my own sister? AITA?",

I didn't yell at him or anything but he definitely didn't appreciate me arguing back. I'm wondering if his rule is actually pretty reasonable and I was being a lil bitch by arguing back, or not...\n\nI'm a 19 year old girl and my dad has always had the rule that whenever I see a friend outside of home I have to give him the friends name and telephone number, or I can't go out. I guess this is pretty normal. But I'm 19 now, technically an adult, and I feel really uncomfortable asking my friends if I can give their phone number to my dad... The reason I ask is because it has happened that he calls them, if I'm not picking up. (I almost always pick up my phone, except for the rare occasion when I didn't hear) My friends are 19-22 years old and find it weird if my dad calls them to ask about me or even just feel uncomfortable if my dad has their number. These are people from my new school that I hang out with but they're not THAT close to me yet. \n\nI guess it's a safety thing. But I hate this rule and I wish I could see friends without giving him their number. I tried to tell him the reason I didn't want to do it but he said that I couldn't go out unless I did it and that it was absolutely necessary. \n\nI know he cares but ughhh, I think he's behaving ridiculously tbh. \n\n(Oh also, I've never been drunk or to a party or done anything \"wild\" to make him distrust me!)",

      "description": "It’s long distance, we were having a super lovey dovey 3 weeks of texting back and fourth planning about the future. Sometimes she would initiate less sometimes I would, that’s fine.\n\nThough for over a week I noticed she stopped wanting to advance convos and replies with one liners, additionally there was no imitation this whole time. So 3 days ago I decided not to text her and nothing happened, so I asked if all’s alright she’s just like ‘yup, you?’\n\nAfter 3 days of silence are you kidding me? So I asked her didn’t she feel it was weird that we haven’t texted in 3 days, to that she said ‘no do you?’\n\nThis is coming from the same woman, who from the rest of the month couldn’t stop texting me every 2 hours without saying how much she misses me.",

      "description": "I have a fairly long hair. It’s a bit up my waist and it’s also one of the few things I am confident with in my appearance. For the standards of the place where I live, it stands out a lot.\n\nSo, every now and then, people talk to me about it and the subject of cutting it always comes up. There’s two scenarios that might happen in this kind of conversation.\n\nThe first one is when somebody suggests that, if I ever decided to cut it, I should donate the hair that I’ve cut. That one doesn’t bother me, since it’s implied that I would have wanted to cut my hair in the first place. It’s clever, since it would be kind of a waste to not donate the hair, and I always agree with the person that I would do it in that case.\n\nBut the second scenario bothers me A LOT\n\nSometimes, people will just come to me and say “you should cut it to donate, since it’s so long”. I get uncomfortable in this case because I don’t know what to say. People just straight up tell me what to do with my hair and it makes me feel bad. \n\nAlso, how should I answer that? The person is suggesting for me to do a good act, if I say that I don’t want to, I will look like kind of a selfish person. I just don’t feel comfortable cutting it at the moment and the amount that I cut to maintain it is not enough to donate.\n\nOne of these days, somebody said it to me, with really similar words as those I used above. I got upset about it and told them that I didn’t want to because I was not comfortable with it. I also said to them that it was not a nice question to make. They treated me like I was an asshole and I have been thinking about it.\n\nSo, am I the asshole? Am I being insensitive or selfish?",

      "description": "Backstory:\n\nMe and my friend, who I will call Emily, have been best friends for 2 years now and there has always been something between us. Up until a couple months ago when we kissed (FYI I'm 14 so yeah kissing is a lot more of a big deal then it normally is, and yes it was a proper kiss, not just a peck). Anyway she rejected me for her abusive ex (long distance and I think I is 16-17). Things were done between us until some other stuff happened...\n\n\nSo now to the point. My other friend who I am now something more than friends with (I am planning to take her on a date, let's just call her Emma to make things confusing) used to hate me and talked shit about me behind my back occasionally. So Emily tried to shut her up and defend me (I don't really have a problem with Emma talking shit about me or Emily backing me up). Emma kept hating me until we actually started talking to eachother as friends when there was a spark between us. We understood eachother in a way no one else ever has done before.\n\nNow I'm a massive nerd and am in no way popular and have been told I am a nice guy and Emma can be pretty bitchy (sorry!) but she does have quite a few mental health issues and a lot of childhood trauma from parents and stuff.\n\nSo my friend says that I deserve someone better but I don't know, Emma has really started to seem a lot nicer and has started to turn her life around.\n\nAITA?\n\nWas Emily dropping hints?\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nI will answer any of the one or two questions that hit this post because why would it get popular?",

      "description": "Me: Male, in my hometown to help my mom do some stuff, decided to go to a local watering hole to see some familiar faces.\n\nOther Guy: Male, off-duty bartender at said local watering hole, inebriated, seems to be well socially connected, at bar with some of his friends.\n\nOther Guy and I have no previous history.\n\nOther Guy and his girlfriend are having an argument, they are both visibly upset. Other Guy starts to loudly tongue lash his girlfriend at the bar. I sense the distinct tone of a man intent to crush a significant other with his words.\n\nI tapped Other Guy on the shoulder and tried to tell him he doesn’t have to talk to another person in such a destructive manner. I’ve lost people I care about partially because I thought this was the only way to have my feelings heard. Other Guy brushes me aside (“You really want to do this right now?”) and I walk away.\n\nFifteen minutes later I return to the bar for beer #2. Other Guy’s girlfriend has left in tears. I meander about nursing my beer and eventually take a seat at the bar.\n\nI look around to see Other Guy holding a shot, standing with his friends, staring at me like a junkyard dog two sheets to the wind. I’m not sure if he’s so much staring at me or through me with the thousand-yard stare of a traumatized war veteran.\n\nThis makes me uncomfortable. I ask why he’s staring at me. He drinks his shot, continues to stare, no reply. I don’t back down, ask if he really wants to go about this that way, and again ask why he’s staring at me and what he has to say.\n\nOther Guy brings up our previous interaction. He tells me I don’t know the whole story. I try to explain myself, and he continues reminding me about how I don’t know the details. He asks why he should care about anything I have to say. I tell him he’s the guy making an ass of himself yelling at a girl on the verge of tears in public, and that I just want to tell him that he doesn’t have to hurt people.\n\nThis does not go well. He walks somewhere else inside. I drink a couple of waters and close my tab. I run into him on my way to the bathroom and attempt to apologize.\n\nThis doesn’t go well, at all. He believes I suspect he’s physically abusive. I don’t, things seem to go better.\n\nHe starts to tell me that I shouldn’t go about getting into other people’s squabbles. Others may be violent. He and his girlfriend have a history of mental illness. It’s 2019, and women have more rights than they ever have.\n\nI try to accept his points and apologize while making my point that when you unleash these salvos on people you love, it hurts them. It hurts you. Eventually, an on-duty bartender steps between us and tells me to leave. I comply immediately.\n\nWhen I get home, Other Guy is a suggested friend on Facebook. I sent him a message to apologize with no caveats. I offer to buy him a beer if I see him again.\n\nAm I the asshole? I suspect we are both assholes.",

      "description": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnglish isn’t my first language so sorry if I make your eyes bleed.\n\nToday was the first day at college. I arrived early  to my class , so i was waiting in the hall with a friend. Then,  we saw a guy with a green staff and that looked lost (he was partially blind) I asked him which classroom he was looking for and discover he is taking the same class as me, so I invite him to sit  and wait with me.He was happy to have a “friend” in his new class, and since is a subject with lots of work to do in group, he asked for my number  and, stupid me, I gave it to him. \n\nThe guy kept physical contact with me ALL THE TIME: he was sitting really close, and he had his hand in my leg or in my shoulder in a “casual way”. I figured that since he was blind, maybe from birth, that was natural to him,. But  he did that ALL THE TIME. And he didnt do that to my male friend, that also was chatting with the creep. \n\nHe said he remembered me from first year and he started listing all the subject I took in 2017. I didnt remember him, since we never talked before. It was kind of weird, but hey, maybe the guy has good memory or something.\n\nHe suddenly asked me if i had a boyfriend. I asked him why he wanted to know that and he said“Im just trying to find a topic” . Ok I guess\n\nHe then said that it was good that i was his “friend” so I could guide him to his bus stop and be on his team and help him, things  that at this point I really didnt want to do. \n\nA moment later, is time for our class to start, and I walked towards the classroom with the fucking creep with his hand on my shoulder. I mean, blind people do that all the time, but this guy was being super creepy. I was using an sleeveless shirt and  he was always changing his hand position to touch the exposed part of my skin,.He rubbed his fingers slowly against my back, like he was CARESSING ME. I was pretty creeped out and I looked at my friend for help but he just looked as confused as me. Ok, the guy is a certified creep. But disabled. How do you deal with a disabled creep? He then started doing LITTLE MASSAGES.  I told him to stop, he does so but never lets my shoulder go.\n\nAt the end of the class, i sneaked out with my friend. I didnt feel guilty because there was some people that greeted the Blind Guy, since they knew him from other classes, so that means that there was other people that could help him. \n\nLater I noticed I had a lost call from him and lots of audios. I only heard one that was something like “Please, next time remember to wait for me to help me,  I cant wander much alone…” and other things that made me feel guilty.  I mean, I leave a disabled person alone in a ninth floor. \n\nI will try to spend the rest of the year acting like I dont know him because he really creeped me out. In fact, right now I think that I was really soft with him and should have scaped way before. I just blocked him cuz he didnt stop sending me audios.\n\nBut tell me, Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "I'm sorry this is long, please bare with me.  \n\n\nSo we've been together for three years, I'm 26 and he's 31. We're both pretty fucked and underdeveloped due to our childhoods and history, but we've been trying to grow together quite a bit. I really see a difference with us being together.... But since we've been together he's been inspired to go from hobby to hobby (woodworking, machining) to try to find a way to work himself out of his rut that he'd been in ten years prior to me. He'll investigate the hobby and invest in the tools to the umpth degree and then really never do much with them and eventually move onto the next hobby. In the end this has put him in good small lump of debt that causes him constant anxiety. That mixed with a soul sucking job of being a tow truck driver, mixed even more with his multi year rut has caused him to be very desperate to make money so we can eventually buy a home. He had gotten into Ebay, but is having a hard time figuring the taxes and fees and again, feels stuck.  \n\n\nSO, we live in a state that you can't buy cannabis (bud, seeds, nothing), BUT you can have it and grow it. So you just have to some how magically make it appear. The police here don't really care that much about cannabis sellers either when there's a heroine epidemic. So the boyfriend now has it in his head that now that we're going we can sell enough that we can both quit our jobs (even though I need the benefits and insurance) and just grow and sell. He even has a master plan of how to funnel the money in an online sale sort of way to get it taxed and make it more legit! Which I was not too pleased to hear about. I don't mind selling a little bit, but I don't want to go to jail, and the moment anything goes online it makes any illegal thing you do ten times worse so far as I know!   \n\n\nAfter expressing my displeasure and even saying no to the money funneling he started acting as if I was just being stupidly paranoid. As if there's no way we'll ever get caught or go to jail, and even if we did we'd just figure it out! Maybe he could! But I want a legitimate life, I want to actually be able to buy a house, have a good job. HE could find a job after jail but I certainly couldn't in what I usually end up doing. I'm so distraught that I'm contemplating breaking up with him even though I want to spend the rest of my life with him, I just don't want to fuck it up by jumping the gun. I would love to turn growing cannabis into an actual job, but we have to wait until it become legal to do so.... Am I the asshole, is there something I'm not seeing?",

      "description": "I couldn't think of a better way to word the title but well here it is - would I be an asshole if I left the girl I'm dating because she refuses to see a therapist? \n\nOur story starts in 2014 when we started a relationship. We agreed to an exclusive serious relationship. It didn't take long for me to realize that she wasn't being faithful but it did take long for me to finally confront her about it. Essentially, she told me I was being paranoid and adviced me to see a therapist. I broke up with her but we stayed friends which led into about 4 years of on and off relationship madness. \n\nAt the end of last year, we ended up deciding we should try things differently and just date without exclusion. Honestly things got a lot less stressful and she had become more open about telling me about anyone else she was interested in. I liked this mood. \n\nRecently, she's been getting depressed every time the topic of sex and partners comes up and she expressed a few concerning things to me. 1) She doesn't feel like she's in control in the moments that she makes these decisions. 2) She feels as though she has no clue who she is. 3) She doesn't know how to stop herself from being someone she doesn't want to be. 4) Sometimes she finds herself crying without knowing why.\n\nI've been suggesting in passing that she see a therapist or psychologist for awhile now, but after she said those things I told her that she seriously needs to do this. She brushes it off. No matter how much I try to explain to her that this is important and to take her mental health seriously, she belittles the issue. It pissed me off because not too long before that she made a big deal about how I need to see a doctor more often and start taking my physical health more seriously. I agreed to do so even though I really don't want to. Now it just feels like she's being a hypocrite and I told her as much. She said \"It's not the same and I'm not about to admit that I need help. So I'll tell you that I'll consider it and we'll both accept that that means no.\"\n\nThat happened about 2 days ago and I've been thinking about it the whole time. I've spent almost 5 years pursuing this girl, and I am sure I'm in love with her but I'm not sure I'm willing to live with these problems. I want to help, but I know its pointless trying to help someone that doesn't want it. I hate seeing her like this but I'm starting to feel as though there's nothing I can do. Would I be the asshole if I broke up with her and distanced myself over this? ",

      "description": "So basically I am agnostic, not Christian. When I moved here I had no friends and was very lonely. I go to a church to do volunteering and also to make friends. We hang out for dinner and talk in group chats. All of them know I am not Christian and none of them pushed it on me. They are all nice people. \n\n\nNotice they have told me in their beliefs you can drink but you just shouldn’t get like drunk I guess? \n\nFor my birthday I really wanted to go to this bar. It’s a novelty bar so it’s not really somewhere I would go normally. I really wanted to go cause it was so cool and so I invited them. This place also serves food and non alcoholic so you don’t have to drink if you don’t want to. It’s also not a place you would find people like drunk off their faces (or least you wouldn’t expect to) all these girls also know I have wanted to check out this place. \n\nI asked them if they wanted to come and all of them said stuff like “I don’t drink”  which ya know fair enough and I understand that. But some just said “I don’t like that venue” or just straight up “I don’t wanna go there” one of them even said “I don’t wanna go there cause I don’t think God is in those places” \n\nI felt it was a bit rude because like morally I am vegan but yet when my friend wanted to go to a steakhouse I went because it wasn’t my day to decide what to do. \n\nI said “well to be honest I picked that place because I rarely have money to go out anywhere, have been waiting to check it out, usually I would change it to accommodate everyone but I don’t think so this time so I’m just going to go with my boyfriend instead but thanks guys” \n\n\nNow I’m thinking I may of been selfish and rude? Was I? From what they told me I was under the impression they would be fine with a bar as long as they didn’t have to get drunk themselves. \n\n",

      "description": "So, anonymous account makes this a little easier, but here goes. TL;DR at the bottom.\nOne of my close friends, someone I had a brief relationship with 3 years ago (relevant later), is in a relationship with an abuser. He's lazy, workshy, steals money from her to buy weed, is at times emotionally abusive, manipulative, and has apparently hurt her. He also doesn't like her and I being close, as he thinks I'm trying to steal her from him, despite me saying I only want what is best for them both. \nHowever, she says he's trying to get better and trying to be better for her. She thinks he can improve despite consistent displays to the contrary, and that he helps her see sense when she's struggling with her own personal issues.\nSo, in the last few days she's asked me to meet up with them both and try to be civil with him, despite our significant issues. I initially agreed but later reneged due to realising just how much his behaviour aggravates me. This made her angry, as she seems to think that he really can change, and wants me to try and get on with him. I really don't think I can forgive or even tolerate him, all considered.\nTL;DR - ATIA for not wanting to get along with a friends boyfriend because of abusive tendencies, despite apparent attempt to improve?",

      "description": "I (27M) had a very close friend (26F) for a while. We hung out constantly, talked everyday, got along better than with anyone else in my life. Eventually, we both had feelings for each other and became more than friends. But then she moved to a different state and didn't want to me persue her anymore. Basically she wanted us to still be best friends but she also wanted to date other people in her state. I didnt want her to go, and she didnt want me to come. I told her it was too hard for me to deal with and that we should stop talking for a while. Eventually she came back to my state and I asked if she wanted to talk and she rather meanly blew me off. She apologized for that a few months later but I was still salty about it. Shes been dating this guy for a while now too and looks really happy. I've had a few girls since but nothing that made me feel like she did, plus those girls werent that into me so Im kind of really alone. Both in friendships and in relationships. She has been determined to be my friend, she likes and comments on about 75% of things I put on social media. She sent me a really nice message when I acheived a professional goal of mine. She is wonderful, kind, and supportive and Im not at all over her. Im always polite when we interact but I never instigate anything and I hurry off whenever we talk because it just hurts too much. One of the reasons I dont want to talk because I dont want her to know how much I miss her or how lonely I've been since she left, or how much some of her actions and comments hurt me. I texted her on her birthday a few weeks ago and we ended having a longish conversation mostly about nothing and toward the end she said \"I'm sorry, I know you weren't looking to have a conversation. I Just miss talking to you\" it made feel really guilty for not being able to move on and accept where she is in her life.\n\nAITA for not moving on and reciprocating her friendship? ",

I come from a semi large family so at gatherings when I saw her, I didn't hear from her or talk to her all that much. I don't remember having any one on one conversations with her, apart from when she baby sat me as a child. \n\nWhen my dog Riley passed away I couldn't stop crying for days, and I would still tear up about it often for weeks-months after. I felt too sick to eat and I didn't want to talk to anyone for a long time. We had him for 11 years, and passed away when I was 16, which is a bit over a year after my grandmother passed away. \n\nThe whole time I was grieving over Riley, I was also beating myself up over how much more intense my reaction was to this than to my grandmother's passing away. I still think about it a lot and I just feel so so guilty.  It seems callous for a person to grieve more over a pet than a grandparent. Am I a bad person for this?

Tbh he's Indian and he's got dark hair literally all over and he's just super hairy everywhere which to an extent is completely fine with me, it's not like I want a hairless guy or for him to shave completely AT ALL and he does shave his junk a little bit which I appreciate, but he is an extremely hairy guy. and I love his body and am obviously sexually attracted to him but I just think to an extent it makes him look a little unkempt. Maybe tmi, but what bothers me the most is he has a really hairy ass and ass crack and back and it's not like I'm completely disgusted by it but I do wish he would shave it at least a little bit because it does turn me off slightly. He's not unhygienic or anything and definitely takes care of himself, but I feel like that has to affect hygiene a little bit. \n\nAnd also, maybe kind of shallow to bring this up, but some acquaintances mocked him for being hairy and especially his back when we went on a beach trip with some people, which is completely shitty on their part and I confronted them about it and like told them to fuck off obviously, but still. Yeah, it does bother me a little but idk if it would be shitty to tell him to shave a little bit. He's never told me to shave down there or my legs or anything, even though 99% of the time I do out of preference so idk if it would be asshole-ish of me to tell him to.\n\nTLDR; My bf's an extremely hairy guy.

      "description": "*I'm using a throwaway because my main reddit has identifying info on me.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past 2 months I have been working on a team I was assigned to for a college internship. All of us are working with a company and each team was supposed to work together to program a larger application overall (there are about 40 people total broken up into 10 teams.) that we would then present potentially get jobs with said company. (It's treated as a paid internship.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI signed up for this mainly because I was simply using it to fill out credits for my last semester before I go to get my masters. This isn't to say I didn't plan on trying or not taking it serious. I just had no plans to take the job in the end. This is where the problem is, the 3 people who I was assigned with are lazy idiots. 2 of them are \"Rich boys\" (Their words, not mine) who coasted into this program because their dads work in the industry. The other guy I don't know as i've never met him in person or even communicated with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuffice to say, I did all the work. We were given the application specifications at the start and we've (i've) been working nonstop in the 3 month period we had. The other 3 have blown this project off big time. They constantly miss the weekly meetings we schedule and 3/4 times a month i'm alone in the library programming myself. The other 2 have contributed, but the three of them together have programmed 20% of this project while I've done the other 80%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I got sick of it a long time ago. And made the drive I put my code in private 2 weeks ago and none of them noticed. Well, once a month a we're required to have a company rep sit in on our sessions and this last Friday she came to see me alone. She was honestly really cool and nice and I talked to her almost the whole time. In the end, after i explained the situation, she recommended I pull out of the project. The contract we signed gives us a \"get out\" clause that says we can leave at any time, The only condition is we hand over the code we did on our own, we get paid for it, and the team had to recreate any code the person who left did on there own. Seeing as none of them helped me on 80% of the project this would mean their fucked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI filled the pull out papers there and then and left. Last night the rest of the team found out and their pissed. The 2 boys are texting me every 30 minutes begging me to come back or swearing at me for \"fucking them over\" the one who i've never seen sent me an email saying he's sorry that he's been busy and if I come back he'll \"give this project his full attention.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm over all 3 of them but I feel kinda bad. Maybe I should have given them some notice or just stuck through it like I intended and promised I would. So am I the ass here?",

When he turns around and is almost inside I get out of the car, run up to him and pelt him in the back of the head and shove him down until my mom pushes me off of him. I am grounded for 2 weeks, and he didn’t get anything.

      "description": "I'm an only child in my late 20's. My parents live several hours away, but I find the drive unbearable. Its just something personal where I really hate driving, especially alone on long trips. I would have no problems visiting if it didn't take up two stressful travel days to visit.\n\nMy mom tries to guilt me into driving down to visit often. I don't make a fuss when going over on major holidays, but I plan to say no to any more \"just because\" requests from here on out.\n\nThe holidays were recent, and I did give in to a \"just because\" trip late last year, so I had three trips in a short time that helped me realized how un-enjoyable these visits have become. I spend most of the time there on an uncomfortable couch watching TV. Its a small town without much to do. If they aren't at work, my parents frequently go to their rooms, lock the door, and get high, so only a very small fraction of me being out in the living room is spent with either of them. We do occasionally do things together, but it feels like such a small portion of the trip is spent doing anything like that.\n\nNow, my parents aren't abusive, or manipulative, or narcissists. We weren't super wealthy, but I had a great childhood, and they put me through college, and they supported me throughout. They just miss me and want to see me I guess. We get along well, and we have things to talk about (I talk with both on the phone regularly), so the reason doesn't have anything to do with my relationship with them. I also have the free time, job flexibility, and means to make these trips as often as I wanted to. I could even afford to fly and avoid the drive. So I really have no excuse. I just find it un-enjoyable, and I don't want to do it.\n\nWhen other out-of-town family members go down to visit the area (my grandparents live there as well), I know I'll get a guilt-trip-ish text asking to come down, but I don't feel like we have the same family dynamic to compare. Both my parents have several siblings, and they each have multiple children. I get along great with them all, but they grew up together as a very close-knit group. I grew up an only child with no cousins/uncles/anything that were even close to my age, so I never had family that I could be \"friends\". I grew up a bit more independently but I came to like it that way.\n\nMy parents do visit me sometimes. I don't love these visits, since I live in a small apartment with no guest accommodations, but we make it work. At least I can still be comfortable in my home. That said, my mom has some chronic, but sporadic, health issues, and shes currently not in a position to travel, so that's not an option for her in the near future.\n\nLast point, I haven't really discussed any of this with them. I think my parents think my \"no\"s mean \"not right now\". My last visit was on xmas, and my dad visited me when he had a work trip in my city last month, but the guilt-trip texts have recently started so I might tell them this soon if it continues.",

      "description": "I'm the oldest of three. My siblings are 7 and 11 years younger than me respectively. \n\nI went to the college I went to because my parents told me they couldn't pay much, so I tried to apply to places that would give me money. My parents knew absolutely nothing about the college process - I did all the research/ calculations/ etc on my own to figure out what MY stats were, what the stats of the colleges I was applying to were, how much money they were likely to give me given the discrepancy, etc. \n\nI ended up going to a small liberal arts college (with stats well below mine) that had a big scholarship fund and although sticker there was around 65k inc. room/board, my scholarship meant I went for less than 10k a year and came out with no debt. \n\nMy younger sister is not as good of a student as I was and her SAT scores were significantly lower. (Despite my parents paying for private 1x1 SAT tutoring for her, which I did NOT have.) But she applied to a bunch of schools that her scores fell within the average range, and most of them were state schools in the NEIGHBORING state, so my parents can't take advantage of reduced tuition, and they don't have huge endowments to give out merit scholarships.... And for that reason she didn't get ANY scholarship money. From ANY schools. \n\nMy sister has a track record of wearing my parents down until they give her what she wants. So today, she calls me THRILLED telling me that she convinced my parents to pay sticker price to her top choice school. I just couldn't bring myself to be happy for her because she KNOWS my parents have another child they need to put through college and can't afford to pay that much for her without going into debt.\n\nI told her I wasn't thrilled that she put my mom and dad into that position and suggested that she wait until her appeal meeting with the school (next month) about getting more financial aid money before she starts posting all over social media saying she's going there. She got extremely upset and told me that she just wanted me to be happy for her and I was jealous. Then she told my mom I was upsetting her, and now my mom is in my inbox, angry, telling me to \"let her have her day.\"\n\nI guess I am jealous. But I feel like if I had just been inconsiderate and chosen my top choice school regardless of how much money it would sink my parents into a hole, theres no way they'd have paid it, and I'd have been stuck either with loans or at a community college. One thing to note is that because I'm the oldest, at this point they understand how important college is, whereas they did not when I was going through it. They helped my sister through the process due to their familiarity with it secondhand from me, but I did ALL of it on my own.\n\nAnyway... am I the asshole? Should I have just sucked it up and pretended to be happy? Probably but I'm curious and I can't stop thinking about it. ",

      "description": "I have a friend from university and we're part of a group of male friends, all good friends with each other. We often hang out on the weekends and just chill or do shit together, like drink and whatnot. Three months ago, this dude starts a relationship with this girl he knew from high school and all of a sudden, he has no time for his friends. He rarely ever hangs out with us, because his girl needs all of his time. She lives in a different city, and he visits her every weekend. At the start of every new week, when he has to come back to Toronto to go to class, she begs him to stay with her, usually crying about it. \n\nBut what really ticks me off is that the nights we do hang out together, she always has to be there. Either in person or on video call. We're a group of guys. I'm not comfortable having this girl who none of us really know around us when we're drunk and saying stupid shit. I'm not very comfortable opening up around strangers. Never have been. She calls him on video for hours every time we hang out together, and if not, she has to call him on the phone and cry, saying she wants to be with him. It pisses me off because what does she think? That he's gonna cheat on her? At home with his guy friends? We are a group of straight dudes. \n\nHe wants to marry her (after three months, go figure). This seems like an unhealthy relationship, but whatever, that's not my business. The thing is though, I tend to get frustrated every time he calls her when we're together. It's time for guys to hang out. I don't want this random girl there. When she calls, we all have to stop talking and just sit there solemnly because none of us are really comfortable around her, because we don't know her. I have a wife, but she doesn't tag along every time I go out with my guy friends, and I don't tag along when she goes out with her friends. Is it wrong of me to expect my friends to have the same respect? \n\nOne of our other friends (he's single) always tells me to \"respect\" their relationship, that they're in their honeymoon phase and whatnot, and that I shouldn't be an asshole. AITA for wanting this dude to respect our time to hang out as guys? \n\nP.S. Let me just say that I have NOTHING AGAINST HANGING OUT WITH GIRLS. Just, this is time for a bunch of guys to chill. It's not even because she's a girl, it's more because she's dating one of our friends and that we don't know her. ",

And now my friend told me that I am boring to be with if we’re drinking alcohol (like I turn down drinks because I don’t want to be drunk + stomach problems) and a friend told me that I’m basically a vibe killer. \n\nThen after that an acquaintance joins in for no reason (not the one I texted) tweeted something about me that I initially knew because I keep saying that if I’m drinking with them, and later admitted that tweet was for me. Indirectly told him to fuck off because we’re not that close so I had to relay it to a friend. He got mad after receiving that message, called me immature and gay.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR My closest friends went out for a night out without inviting me because according to them I’m boring when it comes to alcohol felt betrayed and confronted them.",

      "description": "Long story, and my first post.\nLiterally made the account so I could get some advice.\n\nI'm 21M studying and doing a \"part time\" job side by side. Why I quote? Because that was my intention an year back when I applied/joined.\n\nI applied to my boss for a part-time/internship an year back to earn some bucks and use my wasted time to learn something new. The offer made was as below:\n\n INR 15,000 a month (around US $215).\n5 days a week\nTiming was flexible as long as the work was being done\nWill work for 2 months, max 3.\n\nAnd this was how my first day went.\n\nWas asked to report at 9am (which i did) and was asked to sit till 6pm so that my boss could come back and review my work.\n\nDay 2, same. 9am to 6pm. But overall, first month went okay.\n\nComes in the second month and I started getting called in at work on Saturdays because \"the client needs the entire project finished by March (it still is going on)\"\n\nI complied.\n\nStarted getting calls after reaching home that xyz needs to be handed over tomorrow so if i could work overnight.\n\nI complied.\n\nSo now, I was working 6 days week, and overnight (till 3-4am) every week for next 2 months.\n\nSo my work-stats have been -\n6 days a week\n9am - 7pm (and 11pm - 3/4am)\nNo increment in compensation.\n\nAll this aside, we had 1 more full timer guy working alongside and he was kicked out in July for being ineffecient (because i was building more at much lower salary). So july onwards, I am the only one working and he has been relient on me for everything.\n\nComing back, comes my college exams and I ask not to work 20 days and told I won't be taking any salary for the 20 days. He agreed.\n\nGuess what happens? I get called after each and every exam if I can give 4-5 hours to the project before I start studying for the next exam. And i wasn't paid for it.\n\nOn my return after exams, i was offered a one-time bonus of INR 30,000 ($430) for the amount of time and effort I have put in (it's 6 months working now)\n\nSince it's my college breaks, i get called on Sundays to office now and been working 7 days a week. At this point, i started getting irritated and giving excuses that I am sick or blah blah so I want a day off.\n\nComes the month of August, I tell my boss that it's my final year of college and that he should get a new person as I'm getting tired and need to focus on studies. I get a mild \"okay, will see\" from him.\n\nThis goes on the entire August, September and October. October end, I've my college mid-sem exams going on and I get 30 calls a day from him and his assistant that something broke needs to be fixed. I had told him I won't work no matter what during exams but this is how I'm being treated. And finally, i submitted my resignation on November 2nd.\n\nI get called and he starts crying (not literally but trying to manipulate me by saying kind words and motivating me to work for him for just a couple of month). I being the nice guy who couldn't say no for an answer just complied and went back.\n\nThe moment I stepped in, i felt the same old feeling. Like I was a slave in the prison. Things went the same entire November.\n\nSince I didn't work for 10 days in October and 10 days due to festivals and exams in November, I get a combined salary of 1 month (15k) for the 2 months (Oct/Nov).\n\nCome December, my sister's marriage was fixed and announced. Plus, I had my end-semester exams so I told him I won't work for 20 days in december. Guess what happens? If you can't, i get called between exams to work again. What's more, listen to his plans. So we have exams with 1 day gap in between. So if one exam is on 1st, other would be on 3rd.\n\nSo his plan? \"Study for your exam after you come back giving one and come to office the next day.\" What this means? If I've given an exam on 1st, i study for the next at night of the 1st and go to office on 2nd and give exam on 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't noticed, i never got a single day's time during the semester to study so i used to study a day before exam. Plus, I'm pursuing engineering so it's not an easy course.\n\nI've omitted so many things in between that I now realize and need you guys to know. He claims to have supported me and allowed me to attend college whenever I said I had to.\n\nWhat this means is, whenever there was some work in college, i had told him a day or two prior and he would always allow me to. But his response has always been like \"oh shit, i had planned for us to achieve this this and this. Can't you skip? Or can you come after college. No? Then work overnight and get this done. We're nearing our deadline and need to deliver ASAP.\"\n\nNow, as mentioned somewhere above. My sister's marriage was announced and we have this ceremony (not engagement) where both the family claims to like each other, exchange gifts and kind-off promise to let their child marry (roka ceremony).\n\nThis ceremony was in between my exams in december. So it was like, I had an exam on 11th, 12th was this ceremony, 13th another exam.\n\nDuring the exams, I don't stay at home so my parents had no clue that I was working/getting called to work during exams as well. But he called me 10 times on the ceremony day and my dad got to know and talked to him. My boss told my dad that it's just 2 days of work left, my dad asked me if it was and we agreed to finishing his last requirement. I worked 10am - 4am non stop for 2 days to pull off a lot of work.\n\nAaand, he got another reason to want me. As soon as my exams ended, I get called again and again to be at office because if I work like this for just 10 more days, we'll be done with the project and he will let me leave.\n\nThis is true, it's only 10 days of work if I work 18 hours a day, but let's do some review.\n\n1) I've been working at 15k inr ($215) a day for 6 days a week. Have worked at least 10 Sundays.\n2) I've been telling him to get a new guy since End July/Early August.\n3) I submitted my resignation 1.5 months back that had immediate resignation.\n4) I haven't met any of my friends or been out anywhere. If i had a plan, \"boss, i want 7 days off, i wish to go out with my friends to xyz place. I've been working hard and need a mental break.\" His response has always been \"it's just a matter of a month at most, just finish this up, and you and me can enjoy out vacations. So delay your plans this time\"\n5) I have worked in between my exams\n6) My last year has been - Work, exams and work, college and work. Basically anything and work.\n\nWhen I submitted my resignation, I started ignoring him and did not deliver an application that  they wanted and he had the first let-down from me (part of the reason why I got 1 month's salary for Oct/Nov)\n\nAt this point, i told him that I'll finish the remaining bits but won't start anything new to which he agreed. And later, (mid Nov) he comes to me and says \"dude, the client needs this app before beginning of Dec, I don't have any other developer so you've to do this.\" I wasn't given an option if I wish to take up this work, I was ordered that I've to do this work when i had clearly told i won't start a new app, because it'll hinder my exams and I don't want any pressure at that time.\n\nI know this is going all over the place, but I'm just typing out as things are coming to my mind.\n\nSo, now my exams ended on 24th Dec, and I get called to office on 24th. I refused so he asked for 25th. I reminded him of Christmas and he was like \"we can work and celebrate together.\" I refused and then it become 26th.\n\nEnd of day, Christmas. Me and my girlfriend broke up. It's a story for another time, but she was the only one (other than my family and 1 friend) who had supported me all this time. Now that she's gone, i told my boss that I'm not in a mentally right state and wouldn't work for sometime.\n\nAnd what I get told? \"This is the final leg, we do this and we both have a break. I respect your fatigue but do respect my image and commitment. Just work like you did on those 2 days (10am to 4am) and we'll be done in 2 weeks. We're just left with a,b,c,d application and I estimate the following timelines\n\nA - 2 days\nB - 4 days\nC - 3.5 days\nD - 4.5 days\n\nDo it last time and we will have a long break.\"\n\nThere is some truth and some lies here. The lies are all his estimations. All his estimations are so pointless. \"It's just doing this and this, make a table and store data and show here. Should be done in an hour.\"\n\nAnyway, now I'm seriously tired and have gone to fuck you mode. I've started disconnecting his calls (i used to let them ring earlier and later tell him that I wasn't near my phone) so that he knows I'm not entertaining his requests. I've told him that I WILL NOT work a single day. I am mentally so frustrated that I just wont.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for completely letting him on his own in this final leg? Should I go back and help him finish the project? I just want to say that I don't want to work. I feel depressed working for him now. I've burnt out.\n\nAdd-on: I usually sleep late, so I wake up late (10am minimum) and he knows. So, to get me to office early, he would ask his assistant to call me until I pickup my phone starting 7.30am. I always message him before I sleep with the update of the work and the time (which is always after 3am).\n\nNo matter how deep my sleep is, i always wake up from my phone vibrating, so I've had so many half-sleeps. And his assistant would call me 20 times. I would wake up, curse everyone, mute the call, try to sleep for 20 times every morning.\n\nI mean, fuck off. Fuck. Off.\nI don't want to work with him, no matter how much money I need.\n\nI wish to post some chat screenshots. I'll see if i get the option to. Have a good day, and let me know how I should proceed. And if you've made it so far, thank you for listening to me. I love you random human.\n\nTl:dr -\n\nI've worked for my boss for almost an year now on the terms\n5 days week, flexible timing an",

      "description": " \n\nThis is a very long story so I will try my best to make this as concise as possible.\n\n1. My wife (21F), her sister (18F), and I (23M) had plans to go see a movie tonight.\n2. My wife and I slept in and got up last minute to get dressed for the movie.\n3. My wife went to use the bathroom to take care of the monthly hygiene (she got her period today) while I made the bed and picked out some clothes.\n4. I went to the bathroom to take care of my hygiene and found my wife on the toilet attempting to clean her newly blood-stained pajama pants; as I walked in she told me to get out while she finished cleaning.\n5. I continued into the bathroom and thought nothing of her being in there taking care of what she had to (my wife insisted in the beginning of our marriage that we should be comfortable with both of us being in there at any time).\n6. As I got ready she continued to tell me to get out so I told her that she should use the guest restroom to clean her clothes; shortly after that she stormed out, soiled pants in-hand.\n7. I undressed and thought nothing of her storming out, hoping she would cool down by the time we had to leave.\n8. My wife finished cleaning up and getting dressed fairly quickly and walked past the wide-open bathroom door (which is right beside the front door of the house) muttering that I should close the door or \"they\" would see me naked. I thought nothing of this and did not close the door as we live near a high-traffic area and figured she meant cars passing by may see me naked as she opened and closed the door to get out.\n9. My wife came back inside, shut the door behind her, and walked past the bathroom.\n10. I hear her walking around but pay no mind as I am focusing on getting ready ASAP.\n11. I hear the door open and figure my wife has walked outside once again, but I am caught completely by surprise when I hear my SIL's voice (I did not know she was getting dropped off instead of us picking her up) then see her through the bathroom mirror which can easily be seen once you walk into the house.\n12. I realize my SIL has a direct view to my butt-naked backside and my front through the large mirror.\n13. I immediately become as embarrassed as I ever have and hear my wife cracking up while my SIL embarrassingly states that she did not see anything.\n\nI became very upset as my wife stated that she intentionally left the door open and was hoping my SIL would see me naked so I could see how it felt (her words). My wife was laughing and found the whole thing hilarious until I cancelled the movie reservations. Soon after I made the cancellation she became very emotional and began to cry and call me a some very cruel things. I've become accustomed to her calling me names when she is angry but I became more upset when she began to recite her latest trend of saying she wishes she had listened to other people, had never met me, fell in love, or married me. \n\nShe said she wanted an apology or would leave to her mom's.\n\nShe left.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA For Dating Two Girls I Work With?",
      "description": "The title sounds awful, but hear me out. I didn’t date these girls at the same time. \n\nSo I dated my ex, Leah, for just under two years. We work together in a very large facility. I fell hard for Leah and we had a great relationship. Leah and I shared many mutual friends and originally met outside of work at a social outing. We were friends for quite some time before she finally agreed to let me take her on a date. She’s cute and easy to get along with.  Truly had a heart of gold. Everyone in the office enjoys Leah’s presence. \n\nAnyways, about 6 months into our relationship a new girl, Megan, started at our company. Megan is supermodel pretty. She’s fun, outgoing, loud, and all around exciting. Megan soon joined our little social group of work friends that Leah was also in. We all got along well. \n\nThings started to take a turn with Leah and I because she started to get jealous of my friendship with Megan. She didn’t like me having Megan as a close friend and would get annoyed when we would Snapchat or text outside of work. It was all harmless, friendly stuff. We never hung out outside of work when Leah wasn’t present unless it was at a work outing. \n\nThe lack of trust and jealousy from Leah drove me up a wall. As much as I loved Leah, I knew things couldn’t work out with us romantically so I ended things with her. She was heartbroken, but kept her distance. A short time later I started hanging out with Megan outside of work and really fell hard. I mean this girl is my dream girl! Everything about her is just so exciting and new, and I love that. Leah ended up finding out about Megan and I over social media and was devastated. But that’s what happens when relationships end, you move on. \n\nNow Leah avoids me at all costs and won’t even consider being friends. On the rare occasion that we cross paths she doesn’t say anything more than a passing ‘hi’.  She also stopped coming to all of our coworker outings and lunches. \n\nSo reddit, AITA for following my heart and dating a coworker after a failed relationship with another coworker? Or is Leah being immature about the situation?",

However, a couple days after I found out she lied about a situation with her and another guy (approx month and a half before breaking up) where she got with another guy. I knew that they had hung out and slept together, head to toe allegedly (which I reluctantly said was fine). Now, I had found out more than happened. Obviously I reacted by asking her to which she still lied. But here’s the kicker, she some how found out that I posted our messages on a private snapchat story which only my close friends are on, and she got extremely mad. Telling me that I just have it out for her and that I’m trying to ruin her social life. Am I the asshole for reacting on impulse and telling a few friends what she did? To this day she refuses to speak to me, until I apologise to her for ‘acting like that’.",

She and I lived in the same dorm for a year, not roommates, and then in the same apartment for two years in separate rooms.\n\nBefore this year, we discussed getting our own dishes but decided to go in communally on things like pots, pans and large utensils such as spatulas and ladles. However, I ended up bringing everything. But I don’t mind her using my pots, pans, etc., because those are agreed upon as shared.\n\nHowever, although she brought her own plates, bowls and utensils, I frequently come home to see her using mine, which are nicer, even though we agreed to bring and use our own. I didn’t say anything, because they’re just dishes and she always washes them.\n\nBut the other day, I came home and saw her eating using my condiments. Now, if she used, say, a little bit of ketchup, I wouldn’t mind, but these are soy sauce and sesame oil I went specifically to the Asian market to get. She never asked if I could use them, and then didn’t put the soy sauce back into the refrigerator after she used it. Also, some of my snacks went missing from the pantry a week ago, and I was puzzled, and then I saw it reappear earlier tonight on her shelf.\n\nI feel like these are such tiny things that aren’t worth mentioning, and I would gladly let her use it if she asked, but since I’ve let her go months without saying anything I feel like it’s rude to bring it up now.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I asked her not to use my stuff? \n\nTLDR; roommate has been using utensils that we didn’t agree to share &amp; has been using my condiments without asking.",

The rule is if you want to request time off for the next month, you have to request it by the 15th of the current month. So for April’s schedule, time off requests needed to be made by March 15th. \n\nSomeone in the department requested time off for May 3rd (which posted with the last week of April) on March 27th - a week and a half after the schedule posted. Once the schedule is up, it’s up to that person to get their shift traded and both parties must notify me to confirm the change. Now I keep getting messages asking me if there’s any way to just put someone else on, or just to take her off completely. I could just take that person off because they are a mid-shift and there to help the staff on our busy shifts... BUT that would leave the night shift person without help and we get SLAMMED on the weekends. She did find someone willing to take her shift but if that happens, she would still have to trade a shift with that person which she is unwilling to do. I also changed the hours of the shift for her to come in and get out earlier, but it still does not work for her... so now I’m not budging. She will just have to work. AITA?",

      "description": "So, my sister lives about three hours away from me. I live in the city and she lives in more of a small town where we grew up. Anyway, she texted me Friday afternoon asking if it was okay if she (and her bf) stayed the night at my place since they were coming to an event in the city. I said sure, I didn’t mind the short notice, but I told her that I was having friends over and we’d probably be staying up late. She said it wouldn’t be a problem since they’d be out late too. \n\nA couple hours later, I head out to dinner with my friends and text her asking when she thinks she’ll be coming by. She responds, “idk lol.” I asked her if she knew if I’d be before or after midnight. She still didn’t know. I asked her if they were going anywhere after the event (a boxing match) and she said probably to dinner and that she’d let me know. \n\nMy friends and I finish dinner and head back to my place to watch a movie. At around 11, she texts me saying they’re eating. I see the message and think “alright cool; she’ll be home soon.” She’s not home soon. My friends leave and, annoyed that she didn’t even give me an estimate of when she’d be home, I decide to just go to bed, figuring either my phone or dog would wake me up if she showed. \n\nI spend the night constantly checking my phone and nothing. The next morning I wake up to a text from my mom asking when she ended up arriving at my place and i tell her she never did. My mom texts in our family group chat asking where she’s at and she responds saying that her and her bf decided to drive back home instead of staying. \n\nThis annoyed me even more. She didn’t have the courtesy to tell me she was driving back home and not to worry or stay up. To make matters worse, my mom texted me after saying that she probably didn’t stop because she didn’t feel welcome because I didn’t text her and ask where she was. \n\nAm I the asshole for not checking up on her during the night and making her feel “unwelcome” ?

      "description": "Two days ago my parents had a routine doctors appointment and they don't speak fluent English so I tag along to help translate between them and the doctor(he speaks the same language but only understand/say a few works). We meet him and shake hands (just something that we do) and asks basic questions such as \"how is everything\" +++. He asked if my mother is on the transplant list and I told him yup and that shes been gaining weight still (she was 100lb about half a year ago and now is around 122lb) he claps and says that great and says getting to 150 would be perfect. My mother replies with \"oh i don't want to be too fat\" (jokingly) he then says well its either get fat or death (referring to surviving the transplant) then i tell him about her knee pains and again he says 3-5 times to translate and say \"It's either knee pains or death\". I also ask if it would be alright to see the dermatologist about a few white heads that were showing on her face that are starting to cause a bit of pain he replies \"I mean sure you can but they're not gonna do anything haha but sure go for it\".\n\n​\n\nAt this point it feels a bit strange but I thought he was joking so I thought nothing really of it then it was my father's turn. Same basic questions then asks my dad about what meds he takes then i tried to say something but he says \"25 years of this and it's funny how patients come and say what medications they're taking and it doesn't match up with my system\" I took a bit of flack of this because I refill and get my parents medication and it can be a confusing process sometimes. As hes looking through my father asks if he can get a refill for a cream he uses and the doc hears the broken english and says \"I already sent one on the 19th(this month)\" then starts to question me about it. I explain that he got it but needed a refill for the creme for the next few months then he says \"there's a specific reason on why i didn't i don't know how much he uses\" but with all of this he says in a condescending tone (he's done this plenty of times before) and add the tone with the comments to my mother I got a bit irritated put my phone down and expressed a bit of an annoyed sigh.\n\n\nThis is where it turns, he says \"okay first off, the reason on why i'm not giving you the refill is because it's a steroid and using it too often can cause a disease and that becomes my problem and my fault and frankly your attitude is disgusting\". I was a caught half way, I was annoyed but also I bit taken aback I didn't insult the guy or say hes doing a poor job just a sigh which then I was wondering \"was my sigh that . He continues to say things in the same tone about the cream especially till the point I just let out another sigh which he goes \"wow okay\" and takes his folders and walks away. Also his face was blood red, and his hands wouldn't stop shaking.",

      "description": "Tl;dr at bottom\n\nSo earlier tonight, my friend and I had a falling out of sorts. Hes pretty down on his luck, 22, living with his shitty dad and senile/abusive grandmother and I would give him rides around, hang out with him, give him money and food and pay for a bunch of stuff and I would consider myself pretty friendly with him. Long story short, he doesn't have a place to stay, spam called/texted me asking for help (I was asleep) then got pissed when I didnt respond and said that I dont care about him. I woke up and of course, I was mad, so I told him to apologize or I would block all contact with him and sever ties with him. He essentially ignored me and didnt respond at all after having responded immediately previously, so I said \"you have x amount of time to apologize\". After that, he tried to call me a couple times, but I was at work so of course I couldn't answer. After I tell him this, he says, verbatim, \"stop messaging me. if you dont youd better believe i will walk my happy ass to the courthouse and file an adjunction against harassment against you.\" I message a couple more times, wanting to give him more of a chance to rationalize and apologize, but he just said \"go f*ck yourself you c*ck baby. see you in court\" (minus censors of course) and stopped replying, so i blocked him. I don't feel good about this situation at all but I also dont feel like I was the asshole.\n\nTl;dr - My friend and i got into an argument, and he is now threatening legal action over text messages.

      "description": "I go to an online high school. For my English course, we had a creative assignment to make the front page of a newspaper based on the time period of the class novel we were reading. We were encouraged to make up our own details and had the option to use made-up events, real events or events that were in the novel. I based mine on a event based on the novel and finished it a couple days before the due date and submitted mine to an online discussion board as instructed by the teacher. A few days later, I looked over my classmates work. One classmate, who had submitted a few days after mine, had a really similar newspaper to mine. \n\nWe had similar newspaper titles, we had the same article headline, we had the same \"publication date\", we had similar journalist's names, we had the same details included in the article (including both sharing a quote that I had made up that was not in the book), and we both included a similar picture to accompany the article. Some things are rather insignificant as they are generic (journalist's names being John Smith vs John Snow), but when combined with the more suspicious evidence (Him using the same made up quote, both dates being same, article details being the same) it leaves me to believe that the classmate stole pieces of my work to avoid having to scour the actual book for details. \n\nI feel upset because I feel as though this student based his article off of mine and used my intellectual property to avoid having to put in the same amount of effort that the rest of us did. His work is also littered with spelling errors except in the areas where I suspect he copied my work. \n\nHowever, it was a pretty small assignment that wasn't very difficult to make. In the grand scheme of things it unlikely to mean anything. I don't know if I should try to interfere with my classmates grades because he might have copied me. I suppose it's possible that it could be chalked up to a series of coincidences. \n\nWIBTA for reporting this to the teacher or should I just leave it alone since it's unlikely to directly affect me?",

      "description": "Since my best friend kinda brought us together, she knew everything happening between me and my boyfriend. When I introduced them, they got along really well what I appreciate since you want your boyfriend to like your best friend and the other way around. \n\nSo, my boyfriend has an entirely different friend group than me and my best friend and he takes me to a lot of parties of his friends. He also invited my best friend to come and I even motivated her to come and stay at my house with my bf and me for that night. \n\nThat evening was a Desaster for me. My bf loves me and couldn’t stop telling me how much he loves and appreciates me that night, but at the same time, it bothered me so much that he repeatedly told me how GREAT my best friend is. “Yeah she’s great, she should stay all of the next day, come sit on my lap, come hold my hand, you can sleep with us in a bed” etc. He’s a pretty touchy person (especially high) and I don’t have a problem with that, but holding hands with my best friend he does barely know Is just so wrong and I told him that, what he understood and promised he won’t do again. She, on the other hand, did nothing about, how it seemed. \n\nI regret that I tried, or more I felt obligated to integrate my best friend into my bf’s life, because, yes, I may be a bit jealous and also feel threatened by how she straight up manipulates people to see only the best in her, because me as her best friend knows that she also has dark sides. \n\nI tried to talk with her about that i don’t like her so excessively trying squeeze into this hole group and between, or more like into our relationship, but every time I try to talk with her about something that bothers me personally about her or just about the way I FEEL about something (which I can’t help), she just takes my arguments, turns them 180 degrees and suddenly it’s all my fault and she manipulates ME into feeling guilty about not trusting her, being mean to her, not appreciating her love for me etc. Since that, I want to confront her but at the same time feel guilty confronting her, especially because she brings up her mental illness (depression) as the reason for so much stuff she does, which I don’t see as an excuse not being able to listen a friend who wants to share a problem. \n\nSince me and my bf haven’t dated long yet and it’s my first real relationship where I actually feel loved and also love back, I may feel threatened by my best friend just hopping into the situation. But are my arguments valid here? Or am I over reacting because it’s just a new situation for me. And I know it may seem like my bf isn’t trustworthy or something, but believe me, he can’t stop talking about me to his friends and family, they always tell me and it’s really cute. I just want to solve this, because it’s not me vs my best friend, but us against the problem, and I still love her as well. I’ve already tried to talk about it with my bf, but he kinda doesn’t understand my point. \n__________________________________________\nBest friends is getting close with my boyfriend and is jealous for him being now my priority, so I started confronting her but she turns it seeming like it’s all my fault and making me feel guilty.

      "description": "So I buy hair / body products from ETSY. I found a product that works for me and over the last 8yrs developed a great buyer/ seller relationship with the owner. Recently my hair responded diff to her products and in an effort to see if it was my hair that was different or the products I asked her personally via email if the formula changed as it felt less moisturizing on my hair and the consistency was different from before. I also asked on a forum catered to green hair care that has a thread dedicated to her hair products if anyone else noticed a difference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was also the issue that I had placed an order that was supposed to be delivered in two weeks but she was delayed due to ingredient availability. As the weeks went by I asked for an update maybe once or twice. Well my sister and I also use her products. The last order I placed was for us both. Also the forum I asked the question is a paid subscription so my sister will use my account to look for reviews / products. My sister made a short comment saying how she was waiting for her order and was saddened it was taking so long and has had no updates.This in part is my fault because I had been in contact  with the seller but had not updated her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe seller read the comment and took that as me bashing her and refunded me the order that we had been waiting almost a month for and said  she doesn’t understand why I would post that I had not received an update and brought up that I posted a question saying that one of her products no longer worked the same for my hair and if anyone else noticed a difference. She said I was bad for her business. She also said my comment about consistency was upsetting as I had priorly I asked her if I could return the two products cause scent gave me headaches and made my nose run and itch like mad. She at the time said it was no problem and she would send a replacement in another scent. She said she was upset that I would mention the slip and moisture not working for my hair even after she sent replacements. I was confused at that comment because I asked for the replacement due to scent not because of my hairs reaction to the product. I never mentioned scent on the forum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI emailed her back and stated I had no idea what she was talking about and if she was looking at the right user comments. I then logged into my account and saw my sis comment and quickly emailed her apologizing profusely and explaining what happened. I then edited the comment and explained this to anyone else who might have seen it and that she in fact had been in contact. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the past 8 years when she has expressed how she’s a single mom working to maintain her expanding business and the struggles that come with it I have encouraged and built her up. I have always been kind and understanding and feel so shocked that she would come at me with such vitriol. AITA?",

      "description": "I've been with my girl for about 4 years. We have a 2yr old son. We live on the east coast. My grandfather (who raised me since I was a few months old because both my parents let's say had other priorities. You can guess what), he lives on the west coast. He moved about 4yrs ago from the east coast when his wife, my grandmother/mom passed away. Currently he's in a wheelchair and can barely do the basic needs of living(making food, getting a bath, etc). He currently gets free health care where he lives and would lose that if he moved back to the east coast, so that options out. He can either sell his house and move into a hospice or I can come love with him and take care of him till it's his time. The house sits on a 1/8 acre 4bd 2baths ranch(no steps) with a 2 car garage. If he doesn't have to sell the house he's gonna to leave the house to me. It's completely paid off. Only thing id have to worry about is taxes every year, and Electric + gas bill. Me and my girlfriend rent and both our credits are shit due to student loans so us being able to get a house on our own would be really ruff. I want to go out there. Take care of him till he passes. I do owe him that. He took me in when he didn't have to. He could have let my parents keep me but him and my gram took me in. They just got done raising 3 of there kids and got them outta the house when my mom had me and they seen what would happen if I stated with my parents. So he and her sacrificed so much to raised me properly. Also by honoring a debt I feel I owe him, I would secure a home for my family for generations to come. I could also rent it out and secure income for my family also, or sell it to buy a house back on the east coast to secure my families future. My girl feels what I'm doing no body else does. No body leaves their family behind to do this. I should let him move into a hospice and not move out there. She won't move out with me(the place is plenty big enough for all of us) because she can't leave her mother and also can't take her mom away from her first grandson. Which I get. So Reddit world. For my first post....am I an asshole or is my girl. Thanks for reading.",

We got our roommate as our waiter, lets call him \"E\". The meal was good and everything seemed fine. We get the bill and tip him $9 on a $56 bill, which is 16%. \"JC\" and I didn't think much of the tip and thought it was perfectly reasonable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n30 minutes later, I get a text from \"\" saying \"Did you really leave me a $9 tip on a $56 bill. Very confused, I asked what is wrong. \"E\" then responds, \"Did you guys really tip your roommate and friend of 10 years 15%.\" J\" and I were shocked and I never responded because I already had some drinks and didn't know what to say without escalating the situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"E\" hasn't talked to us since Friday night, and has just sat in his room. I've tried to ask him if he wants to hang out or if he wants a beer, which he has responded with an angry \"No!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"E\" also knows that I'm currently unemployed and that \"J\" makes barely anything doing research at a hospital, and is trying to save up as much money as possible before going to graduate school next year, which I think makes the whole situation 10X worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo are JC and I the assholes for tipping 16% to our roommate/friend waiter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis took place in Boston, MA.",

      "description": "So, for background: I have always had trouble getting “close” friends. This has come from everyone I got close to growing up moving away due to their parent(s) got a new job, or wanted to be closer to work, and the like. \n\nSo, there is this guy, let’s call him “Greg” that I went to school with. He was the grade behind me and we met in high school (technically we went to Jr high together as well, but simply didn’t cross paths). We met in my jr year, while working on a play but didn’t talk much. We had a class together my sr year. We butted heads a few times, but we ended the year on good terms. Flash forward a few years after Greg graduated he got sick and was hospitalized in a town a good distance away. I did not feel comfortable driving on icy highways to an area I had never been to before, and we weren’t close at the time, so I didn’t try to go see him, but kept in the loop since his mother’s Facebook account allowed ppl who went friends with her to message her. \n\nAfter getting out of the hospital, Greg had to for reasons it’s not my place to disclose move back to our high school is in. We started hanging out a lot, and Greg proved himself time and time again to be a good friend. \n\nThere would be spans of time between our vastly different work schedules and Greg’s introversion that we would not be able to hang.  Admittedly I have annoyed him by worrying about him during some of these periods, by asking mutual parties if they had heard anything from him. \n\nOne night, (around 3yrs ahi later this year) Greg texted me wanting to play a game on PlayStation after I got home from work. I told him I would. When I got home, he was logged into the game in question but didn’t connect with me. \n\nA few months after that I hear from a mutual friend that Greg was an expectant father and based off of how far along the mother was when they announced it, and how much time had passed since the announcement, I concluded that he must have been told around the time he was planning to play a game w/me. Other than a fluke encounter anywhere from the mom being 7 mo pregnant to the baby was maybe a month old. That was the last time I have seen or heard from Greg. If he was to contact me and try to reconnect, WIBTA if I told Greg to fork off?",

      "description": "I met this guy and weve gone on a few dates now. He is really into me which is flattering and I enjoy our conversations, but Ive noticed that he agrees with EVERYTHING I say. Whether its ice cream flavors, hobbies or life views. He'll sometimes express a personal interest and if I have a dissimilar interest he will later change his story. One example is he said he loves pop music and I said i listen to a lot of rap, so all he did later that day on our date was talk about how much he likes rap and if I like rap. \nAnother thing is that it's been two weeks and he tells me how much he loves me and how his life would be over if we didnt work out. He frequently tries to make out with me, to the point where I literally had to push him away because I am not a huge PDA person. Ive expressed my concerns to him and I feel like now hes just holding back how he really feels which in my opinion isnt genuine.\nHe is from another culture, and has explained that its different where he comes from and Im totally okay with that but told him I'm different and want to make sure he can be comfortable moving at my pace which he said yes but any chance he gets he tries to be overly affectionate and change his story if I dont respond the way he thinks I should. I literally had to tell him to stop and breathe because he was panicking when I said a casual, \"thats excessive\" to a story he told me and thought I was going to leave him. I feel like most women would die to have this kind of attention but I am turned off by how obsessed i feel he is with me. \nSorry for the lengthy post, AITA? ",

      "description": "I love my girlfriend and we have been together for 8 months and going strong. Ever since we got together, we’ll call or FaceTime whenever we’re not together and I enjoyed it, for the first few months. After, it gets tiring because whenever I want to play my games and listen to music/want to hear the sounds in game she will want to call and I don’t want to disappoint her by not picking up. We’ve talked about this before and it lead to an argument about me getting bored with the relationship, but I definitely am NOT bored with it and I want us to last. She says she understands and it’s okay if I don’t want to call but whenever I try to imply I don’t want to at the moment, she’ll give an attitude which leads to me calling her. This is probably a really small issue, but there are days or moments where I want to play with my cousins and she calls instead. I want to repeat I do love her.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

We hung out like 2-3 times a week and always were doing something together, and these were some of the best years of my life. I am diagnosed with depression and I find one of the best things for my depression is smoking weed, which I have since stopped because of how dissociative I get when i’m sober. She has ADHD and is often depressed so I suggested one day I bring my wax pen and we smoke a little bit and see if she liked it. At first she was saying yeah that would be great it’ll help a lot but soon she got paranoid thinking her neighbors would get all upset and get her in trouble, to which I said wax has no smell and we could just smoke in her backyard. She just kept saying no and I just said okay, and this apparently was a big mistake. \nWe still hung out that day and had a lot of fun, she seemed unbothered by the conversation and was in a better mood than usual. After this day we didn’t hang out for a while, she stopped texting me and I never could tell why,  but I just kinda shrugged it off thinking she was just busy. \nFlash forward to another couple weeks when I finally thought to myself “she really must be mad at me” and she went on this long rant about how manipulative I am and how I can’t ever stay in my lane. Now mind you this is weeks after we hung out and she seemed fine, and all I wanted to do was try to help how she was feeling, and now she hates me. So am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I'll try to explain this the best I can.. I'm not asking for $$ or for relationship advice. My gf currently lives with me. We pay a equal share of rent. She works part time, I work full time so I'm usually the one who pays for things when we go out. Tonight we where supposed to go to a sporting event. Yesterday she expressed she wanted to buy a 150$ Jersey she has always wanted. I thought it was a poor investment considering last month I had to pay a decent amount towards her part of rent because she made some poor financial choices. Money is sort of tight but we aren't going without. Also to mention I'm about to pay a bit of $$ for her birthday weekend coming up and Im buying the tickets to the sporting event(thankfully I hadn't yet). I thought long and hard about how I was going to approach this or if I should at all.. So I pick her up from work and the conversation goes exactly like this.\n\nHer: hey can you take me to (some makeup store) to buy a few things\nMe: yes, but do you need it or just want it? (She has more make up than my like 5 gfs combined) \nHer: I want it.\nMe: ok that's fine but I want to talk to you about tonight\nHer: ok what's up.\nMe: I dont think it would a good idea to buy the Jersey.\nHer: Why not?\nMe: it's just a poor investment, 150$ could go to alot of other stuff.\nHer: are you telling me what to do?\nMe: Yes I am (I never tell her what to do and I love telling her yes)\nHer: what if I do it anyways?\nMe: we wont go to the game. I will be mad and disappointed \n\nNext 5 mins on the car ride home she is trying to explain to me that she has always wanted it and she rather not go to the game and instead get her the Jersey.. \n\nWe get home\n\nI kept my voice down I tried not let it turn into a argument but she said \"well if I have to move out today then I guess I will\". (I never told her she had to move out). I said do what you want and she then tried to switch it around on me by saying \"now you want me to move out?\" I explained every which way to her that it wasnt a good idea then she told me \"maybe you should have approached me differently she had a bad day at work\". Was I supposed to beg her not to? And before the car ride conversation I asked her how her day was and she said it was fine. I'm trying to think if I missed any points but that's pretty much it.. but as of now we arent going to the sporting event and she is still mad.\n\nTLDR:My gf is mad because I told her \"No\" about buying a 150$ sports Jersey.\n\nP.s I had to Google what TLDR ment I always see it at the bottom of stories and figured it was a summary when a story is long..

      "description": "I (male) proposed to him for prom by hiding a paper in a brand new backpack that I gifted him. (His backpack was old, worn, &amp; falling apart) He straight up said no &amp; kept the backpack. Later he decides he's ok with dating. Because he was poor I never expect him to buy me anything. His affection for me was enough to make me happy. His game controller broke so I gave him mine (ain't cheap, $60 at the time), his 3DS broke so I tried to fix it (I fixed boards) it was broken beyond my repair. His Dreamcast broke so I tried to fix it (damages were too much, it would be cheaper &amp; faster to just buy a new one then try to get all the parts needed to fix it.)\n\nI did all of that &amp; he still treated me like crap, ungrateful for my attempt to help him. I just shrugged off his attitude as though he didn't understand the time &amp; dedication I was willing to give him. We've hardly talk because he would be socially awkward so I would respect that. He would be embarrassed whenever we were together, especially in public.\n\nWould constantly make fun of me to his friends behind my back. On social media, he would criticize my taste in music just to get a reaction out of me. He would ignore my messages for days &amp; when we did talk he would go on about all the people he'd rather be dating if he was given the chance.\n\nI'd invite him to parties, my b-day, &amp; my graduation party, only for him to never show up saying he forgot he had something else to do. (even though I gave him weeks notice in advance)\n\nMutual breakup.\n\nHis b-day was coming &amp; we're still communicating. \n\nFor the time in between, I agreed to continue helping him with his vid game. (I've been helping him with the code for 2 months prior &amp; the game was looking good so far). I lend him my drawing tablet (a $600 device) so he can make the assets easier.\n\nDays before his b-day. Gave him $30 steam stuff for games. Also bought him $40 t-high socks he's wanted. What I didn't give him yet was the last gift, a NEW 3DS XL. I already gave him all the other stuff but the Nintendo console, I wanted to give that to him in person.\n\nB-day. Wants to cut me out of the game. Said I was being too pushy cuz I tell him he doesn't use my tablet. Hadn't even made a single asset. Said I was untrusted with his game, that I'd have no part in it. This tore me apart, I've been programming my ass off for 4 months straight (a time I could have used to work on my own game that I was developing prior). I must seem mature as it was his birthday so I formally told him that I thought the gifts I had already given him days before was enough from a friend, that I would respect his wish of working on the game depended from me, &amp; that I would return the 3DS &amp; get my money back.\n\nWait. Never told him I bought a new 3DS. Crap.\n\nHe's pissed off at me &amp; asked why I'd mention the 3DS. I made a brief apology, he cuts all communications with me.\n\nHis place. Picked up my tablet. Locked eye contact &amp; we both smiled as I walked away.\n\nWe haven't talked since.",

      "description": "She asked what I wanted for my birthday and since my wallet was falling apart, I said I just wanted a small black wallet. She gave me an imitation gucci wallet but it's like, quality imitation, apparently made of real leather and she's said multiple times that it's expensive.\n\nShe's a student and I'm an unemployed fresh grad. I really didn't expect her to spend so much (I'm not sure how much but probably more than $100 at least?) and honestly I'm too broke to give her a present of equal value for her birthday so I kinda feel burdened. Also erm I dont care much for brands so idk it just feels weird carrying an imitation wallet around? Even if no one else knows.\n\nWhen she gave it to me I said thank you and was very polite, didn't let on that I don't really like it. But idk is this something I should tell her so that in the future she doesn't get similar stuff for my birthday? Or should I set a budget beforehand or something so it doesn't come to this? Is there even a polite way of saying hey i know you spent a lot on this but I dont like it? This issue is bothering me quite a bit :/",

That point alone makes it awkward. Secondly, I was in the Navy and did not see any real combat. We took part in operations during Iraqi freedom but I was never in real danger. Third, I think it disrespects the sacrifice many veterans who gave their lives or suffer from PTSD due to their service. Finally, and most cynically, I feel people just say it because they feel forced and it is a political talking point to \"respect and care for veterans\".\n\nSo with that off my chest, please render your verdict.",

      "description": "My sister (18 in college 8 hours drive away, winter break for her so she can meet us up again) and I (16 still in highschool) thought the Netflix movie called \"Bandersnatch\" was really good. My sister loved the movie, and I thought it was pretty amazing myself. We sort of hyped up the movie to the point where we got both of our parents to watch it. Both of my parents were uninterested from the start, but the part where Colin and Stefan used LSD was the last straw for my dad. Tensions have been rising from the start since my dad showed obvious uninterested and was sort of making fun by pretending to go to sleep and such, which struck a nerve for my sister. Now, he's mad at all of the elements of the movie, and sees the LSD, stress, suicide: and starts getting mad.\n\nEver since then, it progressed to the point where my sister got mad and went to her room. My dad ranted about all the elements in the movie and how there's no message. I stopped the movie before the choice where you either kill the dad or back off. He began being more angry and confronting me, where I tried to explain it to him with YouTube videos, and my take. I answered his questions on \"what's the message?\" and \"why are you so interested in this?\" and \"as a dad, I see ____, how am I not supposed to be afraid?\"\n\nNow he's confronting my sister and began to be physical. My mom is trying to calm him down but isn't helping at all: she's just taking his side but trying to push my dad to be more moderate. I'm still downstairs however. This happens every once in a while, and it always ends with him getting what he wants, pushing his logic without listening to the rest of us.\n\nOf course, I would be considered the asshole since I'm not doing anything to help. But, if I tried anything, I would get hurt and nothing would have changed.",

      "description": "Apologies for the title, I don't know the best way to summarize this.\n\nMy son is turning 18, and has been accepted into a university, and I'm very proud of him. He has received a few scholarships and grants, and has applied for loans as well. The issue is the loans, he's upset that he has to apply for them at all. \n\nFor some background, my husband and I have been separated for a few years now, although he still pays child support. I have sole custody of both my daughter (aged 14) and my son. For the past 3 years, my daughter has been attending a private school that costs about $10k a year. My son has never been happy about this - he complains that it is waste of money and that it's not fair, but when he graduated middle school, we did apply to a private high school, which he was accepted to. He refused to go because he said it was a waste of money and that he didn't want to hang out with \"rich kids\", but I think he just didn't want to be separated from his friends, so in my opinion it is fair, as he had the option to do the same as his sister. \n\nFinances have never been a huge problem for us, but I cannot afford to both send my daughter to private school and pay for the bulk of my son's tuition. He worked a job over the summer and has received some scholarships, so I think it's fine to take out student loans, since he can keep getting scholarships. I will provide for money if he really needs it but I think this is also a good time for him to learn some financial independence. \n\nMy son is upset, and although I understand where he is coming from, I do not think it is unfair how I have treated my two children.",

I'm trying to watch and listen to a classical pianist and they were watching some crap on Netflix.

Nothing happened...so I pretty much cursed out these people the 2nd time around... \"If you don't put the f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* phones away I'm going to throw them over the balcony....etc.\" Everytime they brought their phones back out to check a txt or the weather...whatever- I kicked the back of their seat. \n\nI understand that's rude, but I had paid almost $300 for 2 tickets and they were sucky theatre-goers.",

      "title": "AITA for blocking my depressed friend?",
      "description": "I typed this out once and accidentally hit delete so here's the abbreviated version of events. Darn these clumsy fingers. \n\nWe met in high school church camp. She's not my typical kind of friend. I was the goodie two shoes with straight As that didn't smoke or drink or have sex until I got married. She was the daughter of a single dad that didn't care what she did and she barely graduated high school. We would have fun hanging out in person though, so it was all good. \n\nShe got pregnant in her senior year of high school. It happens. I tried not to judge. We continued to hang out the next few years when I was going to college and she lived on her own with her son. We'd go to church together and I'd try and give her advice about relationships and other basic social cues and stuff since she seemed, mentally, a little bit off. For example, she'd repeat stuff a lot. Like, if I said I didn't like chocolate, she'd bring it up over and over. As if she had memory loss. It was weird. But she functioned normally for the most part so whatever.\n\nThen she got pregnant again. I was so confused. I didn't think she was dating anyone. Turns out she was having sex with this 50 year old guy from her work. Like...what? It was totally consensual and she didn't think it was weird at all. They weren't in love or actually pursuing a relationship, just casual sex without protection? I thought I was helping her be a wise adult... Our friendship kind of faded from that point on. I later found on facebook that she gave up that baby for adoption. \n\nFast forward to a few months ago. I've since graduated from college and got married and life is going pretty well. She finds me on Facebook and we start talking again. I'm excited to catch up and be friends again, but then conversation got weird. Here's an example of the stuff she'd text me about. Grammar and all.\n\nHer: im so depressed\nMe: How come?\nHer: because of what my ex did\nMe: What did he do?\nHer: he took something from me\nMe: What did he take? I need some details here if I'm going to help you. \nHer: he took something I loved\nMe: What are you talking about? \nHer: Ill never be happy again\n\nOn and on and on. It was pulling teeth and I started to not care because it was just a game she was playing. I eventually got out of her that he forced her to get an abortion. Which is awful and extremely difficult to cope with and I want to help her, but she seems so stuck in her feelings to hear advice. It's very frustrating. \n\nThere's also several other annoying or strange things she does. She's bound and determined to get pregnant again to replace her lost children, but doesn't care who the guy is. She's even told me it hurts to have sex, which is extremely sad because it's not even just loving the act of sex, its just wanting to get pregnant again. But she is financially unstable and makes quick decisions all the time and she doesn't think about the possible consequences. \n\nI've also talked her out of suicide multiple times. I've sent her phone numbers to help. I tell her her son needs her. I remind her that things do get better. She just continues to deny anything I say. But then she complains to me about all the times people have called the cops on her because she told them suicidal things so often. It now seems to be more of an attention thing than a real cry for help. \n\nShe would also message me all the time. Multiple times a day. Just weird or complaining stuff. My favorite is \"do dreams come true\"....like... what? It was rare for her to ask me about my life. I would even just ignore her for days but it wouldn't stop. It's like she thought it was totally normal for her to keep giving me weird updates all the time without a response. I started to think she didn't want a real friend to respond or help at all, she just wanted a virtual diary. I became sick of seeing these messages all the time and I blocked her.\n\nThen she became very manipulative. She made another Facebook page to message me again. Begging me to unblock her because i'm her only friend and that she'd be better about telling me happy things. (I had actually blocked her and unblocked her once by this point) I told her I needed a break and that she didn't seem to want any real help. So I blocked her new account. This happened 5 more times. She made a total of SEVEN other accounts to continue messaging me. One message she threatened to kill herself if I didn't text her again. So I called the cops. I didn't want to be held liable for her suicide if she really meant it that time. An officer later called me and said she was fine and that he told her not to contact me again. She made one last Facebook page to complain to me that I called the cops on her and that i'm a fake Christian for not being her friend anymore.\n\nI'm torn on if I did the right thing. It was a trivial reason to block her I guess, since it was just annoying, but this 'friendship' was very one-sided. And anytime I would try to give my advice she'd tell me it's just my opinion. And when I told her I thought trying to get pregnant again was unwise, she complained that I wasn't happy for her like a good friend would be. I just couldn't take it anymore. AITA?\n",

      "description": "So I, a high school student, am catching my normal everyday bus which I take for 40 minutes so I always try and find a seat and it's the one hourly bus that goes directly to the school so it is often super busy if not full and this was one of these days. I notice an elderly lady who is about 60 looking for a seat so I move over to allow her to sit down next to me. We sit there for a few stops before a seat with my friend clears up so I just say \"excuse me I'll just move out here\" when (not sure how to express a tone through text but it was really entitled uptight) she says straight to my face \"yeah, you better\" implying as if I was offending her + the seat had belonged to her and I was intruding in her space. I don't like confrontation so I kept on moving and walked away but being a teenager I have low self-esteem and started beating myself up over like thinking to myself \"I should have just stood up\" and making myself feel bad. Was I the asshole for moving over instead of standing up for this woman?\n\nSide note: She was not morbidly obese and she only needed one seat not mine too\n\nTL;DR Moved over for a woman to sit on bus and she acted as if I was being offensive when I went to move",

      "description": "This is actually more like an \"Are we the assholes\". So my fiancee once upon a time had a very close knit group of friends that had accepted me as part of their group several years ago. His friends were like a family to him and he had lived with a few them at one point in his early to mid 20s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 2 years ago there was a fight. My fiancee wanted to avoid conflict and so chose to avoid them for about a month while he cooled down. Then he went to a party and asked that they put everything behind them and move on. Instead of moving on, 2 of them got in his face, told him that they were pissed about being ignored for a month. He explained he just didn't needed time to cool off and he didn't want to fight anymore, but the refused to move on and ever since then have made it clear they don't want him around anymore when their group gets together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiancee and I got engaged a few months ago and are currently sending out Save the Dates. At first I told him that I thought we should invite his friends because it's the mature thing to do and to show that he's not holding grudges. That is, until I realized that they had unfriended me on social media - without me ever even being involved in this whole thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe decided to invite a few of them that we remained in contact with, but leave out the rest. One of our friends says that we shouldn't really do that because it'll make things worst and if I am going to invite one, I should invite all of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Are we the assholes for not inviting once close friends to our wedding because they are holding a 2 year grudge?

      "description": "me and this girl started out as friends through a dating app and  it slowly evolved into more. It really on off friends with benefits and us being supportive of one anothers varying levels of depression and ups and downs. Well earlier this year we had a pregnancy scare and we both agreed that if it were the case we would get rid of it. She was about a week and a half late and then she told me she got her period. Both of us were rather turned off to the friend ship and each other for awhile after this happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell a few months later we started talking again and I had finally gotten my depression under control(counseling and a few other things) and I finally felt like I could fully commit to the relationship and you know minus the scare things were good. So we'd been seeing eachother again all the while I've been pushing her to get help with her depression and etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nshe was over recently and I made an off handed remark about not wanting another scare and it put her into a full blown panic attack. After an hour or so of just sitting there with her and letting her calm down she said that last time she took care of it. Which means that she was pregnant and that she got rid of it. Which was the agreed upon solution and that part doesn't bother me so much. She said that she didn't tell me because she thought I would be mad even though both of us suggested that would be what we did about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that does bother me is that she lied to me about it. First off I know they aren't exactly cheap to get and I told her I would help pay for it, but she just went behind my back told me everything was fine and took care of it herself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess i'm just really frustrated that she lied to me about something so serious. I kinda resent her for the situation and really I just want to disappear and never talk to her again. I feel like I cant trust her on any topic now because of that. does that make me the asshole?",

I head over and meet her at a party and we chill for a bit while I start drinking to catch up to her. Now I'm starting to buzz and she's starting to sober up, we walk back to her dorm and I make her some food, get her water, and other basic needs. All is going well we're having a great time and we move into her bedroom. \n\nThis is where it goes bad.... I crawl into her bed and she goes on the floor plugs her phone into the speaker and starts blasting music. After a song or two I mention to her how she should come up by me so we can cuddle and she totally ignores the question and starts talking about something else. Another 5 or 6 songs go by with us talking about the music and her roommate gets back and my hookup/date invites her into her bedroom. They then began to discuss the two guys her roommate just slept with and the most amount of guys they have slept with in a certain period. At this point I got out of bed put my cloths back on (hookup/date was also stripped down) and the roommate asked if I was leaving I told her my hookup/date has better things to do and then I left.\n\nI messaged me hookup/date from outside and asked her to talk she came out and I explained I started to leave because it seemed like she wasn't interested at all. She said she was interested she just wanted to chill in her own space for a while and it wasn't a big deal her roommate was there. I then left and blocked her. Am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR my hookup/date didn't give me any attention and talked to her roommate about of many guys she's had sex with in front of me.

It is scheduled for early/Mid August this year, and everyone is chipping in for an awesome house to rent for the week.\n\nMy wife has known about this trip since we started dating a few years ago. We have been lucky and are now pregnant, due in late June. \n\nMy wife is telling me that she does not think we should go. The baby will only be a month or two old, and she is worried about how she will feel after giving birth. The flight would be from the Northeast US, probably a changeover in California, and then out to Hawaii.\n\nMy feeling is that people travel with 1-2 month old kids all the time. Also we will have a TON of family around us if we go on the trip who WANT to help watch the kid (so maybe we can relax more than if we stayed home), and I don't feel like she is going to still be hurting a month or two after giving birth. Mostly a guess, but my internet researching backs up the theory, so it's not completely out of the realm of possibility.\n\n**I am supporting her feelings and haven't said anything negative yet (just how I am pretty bummed about missing it)**, but it is really making me frustrated the more I dwell on it. I've been excited about this trip for years. \n\nWIBTA if I told her that I think she is being unreasonable?",

I told her if she was in the same situation I'd understand, and appreciate she still went, and I'd also let her do work she has to do to prepare for one of the biggest presentations of her life this far. She doesn't see it that way. In the end she told me not to go, and she would do the same to me so I would know how it feels (Not sure what that means). We're not on talking terms right now. This event happens this weekend, Sunday to Monday. And Monday is the presentation. ",

      "description": "Hi all,\n\nFirst time posting but I’m confused and think that, I may be the asshole in the situation but am not sure.\n\nTo preface this - My work is wrapped together with FDA compliance and requires strict deadlines and 100% accuracy. The investigation I conducted had a 5 business day timeline to closure and we are expected to have the investigation into quality assurance the day before the due date.\n\nWithin our group there are 4 layers of review, prior to quality assurance.\n\nThe investigation I was given was abnormally long, 12 data points as compared to the normal 1-3.\n\nIt was day 3 and after sorting through the data it went into the first level of review and we managed to push it to the last level of review on day 4.\n\nThis was data review, where essentially we have folks who will double check all the data associated with the investigation.\n\nThe coworker I sent this to in the morning of day 4 told me that she had a doctors appointment at 2pm\nBut another coworker had graciously agreed to take over for her when she had to leave. So I figured, no sweat this will be done by 5. I should note I had been a data reviewer before my promotion to investigator, so I know approximately how long these take.\n\nWell, 3 o’clock comes and I had a meeting, my boss walks over to my cube section as I was getting up and we started a brief conversation when this other coworker comes over and starts composing about getting the investigation late and how she’s missed her appointment and she can’t possibly finish it by the end of the day. This took me completely off guard as we had agreed that she would pass it off so she could make her appointment.\n\nThen she said she would need to complete it tomorrow and asked my manager if that was fine, which he said would be okay, but was clearly pissed.\n\nSo, as having an assignment go to the next group on the final day is a bad look, I coordinated, during my meeting I should have been paying attention in with another data reviewer to finish it tonight. Which he was on board with as it meant overtime and I gave him some extra points in the recognition system we have (they translate to items you can order).\n\nHe just asked for the data that was already reviewed, no sweat I figured, she said she would send it to the other coworker before she left.\n\nShe sent out the word file but not the data file. So, fuck. I texted her asking essentially: “hey if you have a sec and some internet would you be able to pass that excel file over so X could use it for the review.” She responded that she didn’t bring her laptop home (which you are supposed to do) and I don’t need someone else to review it she would do it tomorrow.\n\nBut, as my boss was pissed and wanted it in I gave X the original file and he had to re do the work she had allegedly already done. X was totally fine with it and said it really wasn’t an issue for him at all.\n\nWe end up getting it into the next group by the skin of our teeth that night.\n\n\nFlash forward he next day. I get called into a room by my boss and told that certain people have said that I was condescending toward them and not understanding of their limitations. I was totally and completely shocked and automatically went with the “I’m sorry I’ll try to not be condescending etc,” as I wasn’t sure what he was talking about. Then I realized it must have been the original data reviewer complaint and he confirmed it. He said he doesn’t want to assign blame but just wanted me to work on it.\n\nNow, that left me in the spot of, I didn’t think I did anything wrong but couldn’t really push back in this circumstance without coming off as placing blame on her, which I thought, was on her.\n\nSo either I’m the asshole or she preemptively complained thinking I was going to complain about her, which I was not.\n\nMore recently, this woman, who I might add was previously a school teacher and is a grown woman has been very condescending to me and seems to stick her nose up around me very often. She also never mentioned about being upset with me or anything of the like prior to this event.\n\nSo now my boss has been acting strange toward me and I’m waiting for another shoe to drop, while I’m not sure if I’ve actually done something wrong here.\n\nIt’s very frustrating, so AITA here?\n\n",

      "description": "My biological father and I lost contact about 3 years ago after a string of arguments about how he was never there for me when I needed him.\n\nRewind to my childhood, my mum was basically a single parent to my older brother and I because he was never there for us. One day, mum announces she's pregnant and he forces her to get an abortion because he had gotten my uncle's 16 yr old girlfriend pregnant instead and had chosen to keep that child. So, obviously they got divorced and we moved back to my hometown.\n\nBare in mind he is an extremely manipulative and horrid person, he used to do things like put me on top of cupboards when I was 5 and laugh at me whilst I wailed and screamed.. which is why I'm petrified of heights now. \n\nSo back to the present day, I turned 20 about a month ago, (my mum is now happily married to my step dad who is the best man I know btw) and unfortunately I was born on the same day as him which is the only reason why he actually remembers my birthday.. he texted me and tried to have a conversation which I went along with because I'm not a total wanker... but he failed to mention that he was getting married for the 4th time two weeks later... and even worse that my brother and I were never even thought about when sending the invites out.\n\nEven worse, I go to university with my cousin, his niece, and speak to her all the time and she never mentioned it either.. yet I actually found out about the wedding through her Snapchat story.\n\nSo my question is really, AITA for wanting to message him and let him know he's never going to be a part of my life again, that he will never see the inside of my brother and my own weddings and our own families... or should I take the high road and make him believe that I don't care? \n\nThank you guys!",

She told me that it will only take her five years to graduate with both majors, but there is no way this is possible.

      "description": "Yesterday I was getting off the T (Boston public transit) and saw a very tiny dog, probably 15ish pounds, clearly cat-sized, with its leash hooked up to a parking meter outside of a burrito shop. The poor thing was audibly whimpering and pawing for attention at anyone who walked past and shivering very hard. \n\nI hesitated after passing it, then turned around, set my bag down, and knelt down to warm it up by rubbing my hands around it. I doubted it wasn’t doing much for the little guy but he was receptive toward me and tried to lick me, he seemed happy I was doing it.\n\nThen his owner walks out of the burrito shop, and says verbatim, “You know, you’re probably a nice guy, but people gotta stop being such fucking do-gooders.” I begged his pardon because I was so shocked this guy would say something like that (silly in hindsight because the kind of scumbag who would do that to his dog of course wouldn’t have any shame when something like this happens. He asks me if he looks like he’s being neglected and I say yes, you fucking dipshit, this thing is the size of a cat and he’s whimpering at everyone who walks by, etc. We get into it, start screaming at each other outside of the shop while the patrons look on inside, until I decided I didn’t want this to escalate into a fight so I just left and told him he was a loser/fuck off, etc.\n\nKeep in mind, this is Boston. The temperature last night was well below freezing, probably around 25 F or lower, and this wasn’t a bushy dog. Very small with a minimal, Labrador style coat, not warm or puffy looking. The asshole was probably in there for at least 15-20 mins as there was a decent line in there.\n\nAm I the asshole for picking up this scumbag’s slack and taking care of his dog? This may seem obvious but I was just so taken aback by how shameless this fucking guy was in neglecting his dog.",

      "description": "*Sorry in advance if this doesn't belong here or should go somewhere else*\n\nSome background:\n\nI am 15, almost 16 (so about to have my car), and am a sophomore in HS. My parents are divorced (custody is split 50/50) and have always had a ton of animosity between them, can never agree on arguments, etc. My dad and I have also never been on the best of terms, as he is manipulative and stubborn, and before this incident, I have never strongly fought him for anything, and have never stood my ground against him.\n\nI am a member of FFA at my school, and my upcoming goal for the next school year and show season is to raise a heifer and take it to stock shows, county fairs, etc. My long term goal is to be a large animal vet working with livestock and horses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the actual story:\n\nMy dad, since I have expressed interest in this project, has not been supportive. Until just recently, when I started talking about it seriously, I have always assumed he was just on the fence, didn't really understand, just overall not committed one way or another.\n\nNow, when talking about it, he, and his wife (my step-mom), have been making multiple arguments against it, some being that it isn't worth it, not beneficial to my career, too time consuming, and that I am not serious about it. My mom and I have been working together, along with her boyfriend, to convince my dad to support me and that it is beneficial. We have stated that, because I am literally getting hands-on experience with a large animal, this applies directly to my career and goals.\n\nI also agree that it will be time consuming, but I have solved that by taking early release next year, something my dad also disapproves of. By refusing to let me take early release, he is making it exponentially harder for me to have the 2-3 hours needed to take care of this animal.\n\nI also have been doing tons of research to learn more about raising heifers, how it will benefit me down the road, reading about other people's overall experience, etc. Suffice to say, I think I am pretty serious about this.\n\nYesterday, He told my mom that he and my step-mom would not allow me to go to the barn during his weeks, forcing me to rely on someone else for raising my calf, and prohibiting me from doing so. I would also like to add that I would not be depending on him for rides (I don't get the calf until after I have my own car/license), money (I have my own money already and can work the whole summer), or help with responsibilities.\n\nIf he does restrict me from doing this, I will tell him that ultimately, I would like and value his support, but this is something I am serious about and by not giving me the means to do so, he would result in me deciding that I want to have more custody with my mom, and that our relationship would not be the same.\n\nSo, with that said, WIBTA for giving him this ultimatum and standing my ground against him, even if it means that I would jeopardize our relationship?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Getting ready she will sit on her phone scrolling Facebook and will snap at me when I all her to continue to get ready.\nI'll ask for something and she will have it in her hands and start a conversation and hold the item hostage.\n\nSometimes I do get overly angry because we ride the bus and if you miss it you're basically screwed. The other day, we had plans (her plans) and she was supposed to meet me at my house and we would go about our day. It took 2 1/2 for me to say that she was taking awhile, and even then she wasn't ready. She was waiting for her friend with a car to come get us. I was woken up at 7 30 and we didn't meet up until almost noon. She then said today that she didnt need me there, she only wanted me there so i shouldn't have gotten mad. Not the first time I've had to wait on her when plans are made but this time aggravated the hell out of me.\n\nIdk a little advice would help",

      "description": "So my boyfriend of 3 years has had this friend since he started university (six years ago or so). I’ll call him “Jeff”. \n\nI tried very hard to get along with Jeff from the get go, but it was hard. He has a lot of trouble with social situations and has a tendency to say things that rub people the wrong way. I think he also had issues with me because my bf was one of his only friends, and single with him. So when he started dating me, I think he felt like I was stealing him away. \n\nAnyway, we’ve had issues with him in the past kind of blowing up at me and other folks in the friend group for what feels like no reason. He often takes things said over text way wrong, and starts spiralling into those “everyone hates me” kind of tirades. Recently, he’s been inviting himself over to our apartment A LOT (without asking, just kind of stating that he’ll be coming over so tough shit if you had other things to do!) and I called him out on it none-too-nicely. I said he was frustrating me and he needed to ask first. \n\nI also made sure to say that I wouldn’t be telling him this if I didn’t want to be friends with him. But yeah, it backfired, and he tells me that it made him cry at his desk all day. So I apologize but I also say that I’m not going to sugarcoat my feelings when he’s bothering me, and that he deserves the truth. \n\nThe next morning, he sends me a text threatening suicide or violence if I ever talk to him that way again. Literally says “it will always be a threat” if I make him feel that way again. Problem is, he works himself into those stupors, so I could literally say the most menial thing and he’ll freak out. \n\nI told him he needed professional help, and he starts texting my boyfriend about how he’s never gotten along with me and that I am making mountains out of molehills. I haven’t spoken to him since. \n\nI’ve dealt with this kind of victim shit before and I am not interested in going through it again. He’s obviously sick, but I don’t think I can change his mind and it’s stressing me the hell out. So am I an asshole for just saying screw this and letting him go? ",

      "description": "I have several close friends who come in town about once a month. I never get much notice when they're coming in, they all live  near to each other  but about an hour away from our hometown (where I live). Most days i do nothing after work except gym with my boyfriend and then go home and do errands or stay in with him ( we live together).  We really dont go on dates not sure how relevant this is but im trying to present context. At least the last two times my friends have come in town on friday night I have had loose plans  with my boyfriend  to get dinner  or go to the movies.\n\n For example, two days ago my boyfriend and I talked about going to a restaurant we've  been wanting to try and we  brought up friday as a suggestion. Yesterday I found out my friends were coming into town and wanted to go out and get dinner/drinks. I told my boyfriend they were coming and all he said was \"have fun\". This was right before bed so I just dropped it and went to sleep. He leaves for work before I do so  there wasn't a chance to talk in person the lik morning. After work, I got home and brought up that I wanted to go. I asked him if we wanted to come and he said no which is pretty typical, he gets very surely around my friends. He shut down and started giving me one word answers to any questions. \"Is this a problem?\" \"No im fine\".  When hes clearly lying like that I just act like im taking his word seriously. So if he's \"fine\" there's no reason I can't go. I left  and told him I'd make it up to him. I sent him a text that I love him and we can still go to the restaurant tomorrow  and he said \"stop  bothering  me\". Reddit, am I a major asshole for choosing a monthly visit with longtime friends over a potential rare date with my boyfriend? I want your honest opinions. ",

      "description": "Barely 20 years old, male. As a recent high school graduate who kept making excuses to push off applying to college, I was starting to get lonely and was losing friends to college. However, friend of a friend I haven't seen since high school shoots me a message. We will call her T. T asks me if I'd like to come over sometime and hang out with some of her friends, one of which was the one who was also my friend (who we'll call 'R'. I hadn't seen R in forever either. I was in.\n\nWe all end up having a great time. It was just me, T, R, and a new girl named H. We agree to do this more often, and start to meet up several times a week. Side note, my family is very poor, while T isn't at all. T would take me out to eat all of the time, which always made me feel kind of guilty but she would insist. She would also drive around, and just help me in general.\n\nAfter about a month of the two, I notice that T had been a lot closer to me than usual, and is definitely dropping hints about liking me. However, I'm by no means looking for a relationship, so I choose to show my uninterest by ignoring every hint. After about a month she seemed to have given up and become content with the fact that we would just be friends.\n\nBig detail for the next part is that T had never gotten drunk, despite being older than me. After another month  of us being strictly friends again, she tells me that she wants to try it with me and H. T makes it very clear H won't arrive there until late, but that doesn't really bother me so I agree anyways.\n\nT drinks a little, I drink a lot, and we both become very drunk. Eventually, H shows up and I am plastered, as is T. H says she's tired and goes right to bed, which sucks as she said that pretty much upon walking in. T says she's tired too, and tells me to follow her. She asks if I'm okay laying next to her, I don't really care, but am definitely on edge at this point.\n\nAfter some silence, she started to press her body closely against mine, and I sorta freaked out on her. Didn't yell or anything, but did raise my voice.\n\nSince then I've not hung out with her again and it's been months. I can tell she's been upset about it, but every time she asks me to hang out it's abundantly clear she's trying to fuck. She makes it very obvious. AITA?",

      "description": "(Disclaimer, I am on mobile and I'm not the best when it comes to grammar) This all started about 4 years ago, when me and this person were both in 8th grade (we are both juniors in high school now). I had just moved from another part of town and I'm really shy. Him and his group (which I'm still friends with most of them) were the first to talk to me. I was glad about that because social anxiety makes it really hard to make new friends. Anyways, it was all fine until about halfway through the year, he starts calling me a whale. I thought it was just a mean joke at first but later found out that he meant it and was just being a prick. Fast forward to freshman year of high school and my group of friends got into a big fight that split the group in two and I was the middle man. I had been battling depression for a while and he kept telling me to hurt myself, or worse. The year after, he did the same thing. Then, this year, he is using one of my friends just for free lunches, sexually harassed me by always slapping my but and making grossly sexual comments, and kept telling me to break up with my girlfriend. I finally told him that he was a \"prick with a god complex\" (with a few choice words) and he braught up an MIP I got about 3 months before (that was a dumb mistake I made). Then he went to one of my other friends and his family telling them what I'm guessing is a more one sided part of the story, most likely that I told him off with no reason. Fast forward another few days and him and two of my friends are playing on xbox (this is something I was told and knowing the people involved, they wouldn't lie about this) and one of them brings up that shes worried that she might have a stomach tumor. The person I cut off then makes jokes about it, to the point where she had to leave and my other friend also had to tell him off. ",

      "description": "A couple of months ago my friend, 22F and pregnant, got a house her and her partner cannot afford so they needed a roommate. They asked me and after a day of debating I agreed. \n\nA week before we moved in her partner lost his job and was almost completely broke so I suddenly become the only person with a job, thinking I could handle it so I still agreed to move with them. \n\nFast forward a little bit and they're not great people to live with, they're lazy and pretty irresponsible homeowners who expect me to pay got almost everything. I've been really struggling to cope with the stress of money/frustration of cleaning up after them so last week I made plans to move out this Thursday and leave them with a week of rent in advance but I don't intend to tell them until Wednesday so I don't change my mind. However, the past few days my friend told me she's being dealing with depression for a while (so have I) and she's been constantly in and out if hospital for numerous reason so they've been really relying on me right now to keep everything from falling apart. However, I still plan on moving out on Thursday.\n\nWIBTA for sticking to my plans?",

The girl (who I knew) asked me if I'd date someone with depression, because they were talking about dating with depression and wanted my opinion as someone healthy. \n\nI was really put on the spot and said something like \"well if my bf became depressed I would definitely support him no matter what.\" Then she said \"no not your current boyfriend, I meant like would you BEGIN dating someone already depressed if you were still single?\"  \n\nIt was awkward as fuck and I just stammered a bit and said \"um I guess not... But it's just I don't think I'd be a great partner to someone with severe depression.\" At this point several people rolled their eyes and just said something like oh classic person who doesn't understand that depressed people are just normal people. I kinda kept my mouth shut for the rest of the night. \n\nA few days ago that friend messaged me saying that next time I get that question I need to be way more supportive. She said that several people were really offended by what I said and only reinforced their view that depressed people are unlovable and will never get dates. I got a bit defensive and said that it was unfair for her to put me on the stop, but she just told me to \"get over myself\" and learn some \"empathy.\" W/AITA for what I said?",

Well, fast forward to two weeks ago, a friend asked if I wanted to join him and a coworker on a boys fishing trip.\n\nHere’s where I think I might have messed up. We transferred someone in from another department so we’re a little over staffed in my area at work now. So...I can get the time off. I never told my gf this because the tickets had already been bought and I was just planning on going to work anyway and she didn’t seem to care whether I went with her or not. I told my buddy I could go on the fishing trip.\n\nToday my friend said something to my gf about the trip during casual conversation and I’m not sure I’ve ever seen her so angry in 4 years. She’s threatening to break up with me because she says she can’t trust me and what I did was disrespectful to both her and her family. \n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR was supposed to go to an out of state wedding with my girlfriend but couldn’t get off work.

So yesterday, i was out doing errands and my girlfriend had my key (i let her use it so she can come and go from my room without me being there). I was across the street from my dorm at a store, and she called me while i was paying. I can't multitask all that well so i let it ring and I was gonna call her back as soon as i finished. I finished up, left, checked my phone about 5 mins after she called and got a bunch of texts saying she's leaving and had left my door unlocked with the key inside (i had work about a half hour from there). \n\nI flipped out that she would leave my room with the door unlocked, i called her, and she was still in the building so I told her to get back to my room and i'll be there in 5 mins.\n\nI get back pissed off about it and she's not able to understand why it's such a big deal. But to me, it's as if she left the door to my room wide open with all my electronics and what not up for grabs. On top of that, there have been incidents in the past with people having their laptops stolen out of their rooms because they left their doors unlocked and stepped out. But to her, she says that it's so unlikely to happen that its not a big deal, disregarding the fact that it COULD happen, and then I'd be screwed.\n\nSo am i the asshole for flipping out and blowing this out of proportion, or is she in the wrong here?\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "My eight friends are relatively cool dudes that I spend a lot of time with. I've known them for about 2-3 years and have talked almost every day with them.\n\nThe problem comes in, though, after a friend of ours reported us to our school for cyber-bullying (they actually broke the law). It's been really stressful for them, and about 5 have already been suspended; the school is even possibly pursuing legal action since the girl we \"bullied\" physically hurt herself.\n\nA couple days prior, I was walking down the halls and got into a conversation with the person who reported us, as I didn't have any problems with her even though she caused most of the problems. I figured since we did actually break the law, she was in the right. Plus, I wasn't going to let one mistake ruin our friendship anyways.\n\nMy friend comes up to me after I leave school and starts completely hammering me about it. He asked why I was talking to her and that I was acting really suspicious. I really did not know what to say. From what I see they got mad at me for just talking to someone?\n\nOne of my best friends then texts me why I did it. We got into a big argument about it, mainly because she thought I couldn't talk to her because she \"hurt us and ruined our future.\" (not exact wording) Eventually, I got fucking furious with her and just stopped texting. Then in our after-school club, she could not stop mentioning it. Almost every time I did something she would say something related to what I said in the argument. I barely talked to her during the club after I realized what she was doing and didn't talk to her on our walk home we partially share. I think she's being completely fucking petty and annoying about this.\n\nI'm not even allowed to be in a group chat with them because I'm \"not to be trusted.\"\n\nI'm being called an idiot, retarded, and toxic, and I hate it.\n\nI want to be friends with them still, but they're acting like such dicks towards me, even my best friend. I feel like all I have left now is my one online friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if I left out a lot of information or have bad formatting; I'm not that good with Reddit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I'm a 15 year old teenage boy with no discernable qualities that spends his time playing video games, watching movies/TV and avoiding human contact. I have a good few friends but at times I just feel like I'm the annoying one they keep around out of sympathy. Occasionally even they become tired of my shit and tell me to fuck off and I'm normally the butt of all their jokes. My issue is that I was bullied for several years in school and sort of still am and thus I am naturally distrusting and cynical of others. I drive away people that try to talk to me and sometimes even hurt their feelings in the process. Afterwards I go through periods of self-loathing and promise to get better and yet I never do, in a few days I'm back to my normal asshole self again.\n\nToday two sort of friends were having what I suppose is a fight (not physically or anything as it was in an online group chat) and I somehow made it my business and joined in. I had good intentions but I know afterwards I should have let them figure it out on their own. I started trying to help by getting to the bottom of how it started but was constantly met with \"shut up\" or \"who asked you\". Afterwards I got angry and started telling them to sort it out privately or fuck off. This is when I learned that the whole thing was just a stupid prank to see if I would barge my way in to their issues and make them my own. I ended up feeling embarrassed but then realised that it was ultimately my fault for barging in despite it being a group chat. Then I promised once more that I would get better and be less cynical but I can already tell it's not going to last.\n\nI want to change. I really do. But I don't how I can. And I need your help. ",

      "description": "Backstory:\nI’m currently a senior in college. In one of my classes we had a poster project. The project was fairly simple: find a management method used in farming and make a poster about it. \n\nIn the group were two other girls (let’s call them Elle and Ree) and myself. We had plenty of time to get the project done, and the project was fairly simple so I wasn’t too worried about it. \n\nAlso important: this class only meets once a week, so most communication through the group is online. \n\nActual story:\nA week and a few days before the project is due I make a GoogleDoc so that we can all work on the poster together and get it done. A few days pass by and I notice neither group member has done any work on the project. Frustrating but whatever, people get busy. I continue working on the poster, no biggie. \n\nThe next time class meets I go up to Elle and Ree and ask if they got the invitation to edit the Google Doc. Ree said she got it and will work on it later. Elle said she never got the invite. (This should’ve been a red flag but I thought nothing of it) I tell her no worries, I’ll send another one and add her on Facebook so we could communicate easier (our communication before that was through email). \n\nWhen I get home I add Elle and Ree on Facebook, both accept within a few hours and I make a group chat. I send the link to the Google Doc and all is good. Ree replies and says she’ll get started. \n\nA day passes and Elle still hasn’t opened the message. Weird. Maybe she doesn’t go on Facebook a lot. I send her a private message asking if she’s received the group chats and see if that works. A little while after that I see Elle has posted a status update on her page. Even though she has yet to reply to me. All my messages to her are still unopened, yet it says she was active minutes ago. This is where I start to get frustrated. I cannot get a hold of this girl. \n\nA few days pass, Ree got her shit done and I got my shit done, but there’s still shit to do. Elle is still MIA, I’ve accepted the fact that she will not be contributing to this project. Maybe she got a new group? Maybe she’s dead? Well actually, She can’t be dead bc she’s still updating her fb page. \n\nWe submit our project. It was good but not great, you definitely needed three people for the amount of work it was and we only had two. Elle still has not replied to any message and has done absolutely nothing to contribute to this project. \n\nI let our professor know that we tried to get ahold of her to no avail. He replies that he will take that into consideration while grading. \n\nA few days later I receive a message from her:\n“Hey sorry I've been a piece of garbage human being for the last couple weeks. I have no excuse. I've been really discouraged with school but it's no excuse to not even participate. The poster look awesome! Again, I really apologize for being completely absent. Hope you have a good Thanksgiving!”\n\nShe also lets me know that she got a zero on the project and starts saying it’s “exactly what she deserved.” \n\nInstead of accepting her apology I reply with:\n “We let [professor] know that we couldn’t get ahold of you. Honestly if you would’ve warned us beforehand that you would be MIA it wouldn’t have been a big deal. Everyone goes through rough patches. But not replying was messed up. (Even after I talked to you in class about the project and you let me know you would get working on it). Hope school gets better for you. Good luck” \n\nHer final reply to me was:\n“Well that's unfortunately how I deal with things when I get depressed- I withdraw. Again, I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say but I figured I'd apologize for it because I knew it was garbage of me. Thanks, I hope it does too”\n\nAITA for giving this girl a 0 on the project and not accepting her apology? ",

      "description": "\n3 years ago my college girlfriend and I amicably ended our 8 year relationship. I spent the next 2.5 years improving myself, going to the gym, working on my art, etc. This caused me to receive unwanted attention from sort of aggressive women that had a hard time taking no for an answer. I turned these women down because I was believed there is a woman out there that would be a great match for me and I strongly did not want to become one of the men that used women for sex and hurt peoples feelings (I was raised by a single mom and her string of shitty boyfriends).\n\n6 months ago I met a woman in an uber. She is super outgoing and kind. We agreed to meet up the following day. I completely fell in love with her and we started hanging out nonstop. I had never felt this sort of burning passion for another person, I was completely sure this was meant to be.\n\nWhile drinking one night she said a few sort of crazy things. She talked about rubbing her last \"flings\" semen on her face because it is good for her skin. She told me she enjoyed licking mens buttholes. She described how she cheated on her exboyfriend with her drug dealer earlier in the year and how they would do anal sex without lube.  She described drunkenly trying to drag a man into a restroom to sleep with him and then being locked in the restroom yelling angrily that she wanted to fuck him. She described nearly participating in sex work out of curiosity but backing out after not being selected by the men that came in. This was all a shock to me because she did not seem like this sort of person.\n\nAll this really soured my feelings for her but I thought maybe I was just being a prude and she explained it as her having a problem with alcohol that causes her to act out sexually. I asked her to not share any more of her past sexual exploits and I said she shouldn't feel bad about any past mistakes because the past does not define us, we can choose who we want to be.\n\nA couple weeks later I started noticing issues with my penis. Sex was sometimes painful. Two white growths appeared on head of my penis. A bunch of lighter spots appeared on the shaft. A sort of shiny discolored lump at the base of my penis. Blood during ejaculation at one point. I have gone to many doctors and spent a great deal of money trying to fix these health issues and  they are still persistent.\n\nI have had very strong feelings of love for her but 4 months of health problems have worn me down. Each time I see these strange spots or feel pain on my penis I think of her cheating with her drug-dealer, licking his asshole and how I now carry his diseases. This very much feels like I have massively fucked up my life as now I cannot even consider a relationship with another woman because I would be risking giving the new woman whatever health issues I have.\n\nI feel guilty for no longer having the love I did. I feel guilty for being angry with her and myself. I feel guilty for thinking I have to break up with her. I feel guilty for not breaking up with her.\n\nShe has been amazingly kind, thoughtful and loving to me during the 6 months we have been together. If I were not carrying the diseases/viruses/infections or whatever from her ex-boyfriends/flings/etc. then I would be 100% certain this is the woman I was going to marry. Instead it feels like I have to break up with her and spend the next couple years minimum alone until I can be certain I am not going to pass anything on. \n\nAm I the asshole? Or am I an idiot for thinking a monogamous person can have a relationship with someone into hookup culture.\n\ntl/dr: fell in love with girl, found out she cheats/has meaningless sex, got stds/infections from her, want to break up even though it means I'll be single for years.\n\n",

      "description": "Alright, saw this Reddit in a Youtube video by Cuestar.\n\n \nMy good friend from awhile ago, let's call him Austin, and I were in 8th grade when this happened, so any \"relationship\" probably isn't going last through the summer unless you live in the same town, and even then it is difficult. \n\nAustin was known as a \"No I won't tell anybody, I swear...\" kinda person if you know what I mean. I knew who he'd had a crush on for awhile, and he'd always wondered about who I wanted to be with.\n \nI think Austin realized who it was when I let her go in front of me as we were getting off the bus, at least this is the moment I believe he figured it out. It was also quite blatant that I was allowing her to go in front of me on purpose because I had cut off other people but let her go.\n \nAnyways he kept asking and asking but i kept denying and denying it. But after awhile he would find me between classes just to ask and it started to get annoying. So I finally just told him, thinking it would just get him off my back.\n \nWell...no, it did not. He spread it like a wildfire, and somehow (I am STILL confused to this day how) Emily(not her real name but my crushes \"name\") didn't hear. I think it was that it was so big her friends just assumed she heard it somewhere and had not told her.\n \nI was so angry and upset that I told everyone who he liked, and boy did everyone think I was the biggest \"asshole\" for even doing that. No one believed me though because his crush (let's say Jada, although not important to the story really) and I have hated each other since kindergarten. So everyone thought I was lying just to embarrass her.\n \nAbout 3 weeks pass and Austin comes up to me in my seat on the bus and sits next to me. I try to persuade him otherwise by moving my legs and bags in his way. He asked me if he could sit and I said, \"Sorry not enough room.\" but I looked around the bus and saw the bus had no other open seats, so I caved. He sat down and he mumbled something almost like he wanted me to ask what he'd said. I ignored him.\n \nAs we were stepping off the bus, he'd tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"I forgive you for telling everyone.\" I was like, \"Huh?\" He started it, and he was forgiving me?? I was so angry for the rest of the year that no \"sorries\" were said to one another.\n \nEventually we both moved on but we were never as good friends again. Barely even spoke to each other. \n\nTL;DR My friend told everyone about my crush and I respond by revealing his and everyone hated me. He \"forgave\" me like i started it, and never said sorry for what he did. I never said sorry either.\nSo wise Redditors Am I The Asshole?",

      "description": "To start my story, I work at a theme park, and I can't drive yet, and I also live about 30 minutes away from the theme park. Usually I can get a ride from a coworker, but I wasn't able to yesterday. So, I called my dad to come pick me up.\n\n\nAnyway, Its a fucking theme park which I can go to for free, so of course I play in the park after my shift while I wait for my dad to come. Anyway, my dad doesn't always leave home right away, it usually takes home about 30 minutes to an hour to get to where I work. I have had to get a ride from him about 7 or 8 times in the past.\n\n\nSo all of those 7 or 8 of those times, when he was in the parking lot, he would call or text me to let me know he was there. So in the past, it would only take about 1 or 2 minutes after he called for me to walk over to the car. \n\n\nAnyway, about an hour goes by after I asked him for a ride, and I get a text from him. So I start walking over to the car. But, my manager saw me walking towards the parking lot and asked me a scheduling question, so I was held up a few extra minutes.\n\n\nI finally get to the car, and my dad seemed super pissed, and said \"I thought you were never gonna show up\". I was really confused, so I looked at my phone To see how long ago it was that he texted me, and it was about 7 minutes. \n\n\nSo, I said \"oh sorry about that, my manager wanted to ask me if I could come in on Wednesday\"\nAnd he says \"and it took THAT long!\"\nI was still confused, but I kind of sarcastically said \"oh sorry for making you wait 7 minutes\". He said that it was WAY longer than 7 minutes. I was still really confused, so I said \"oh, did I not get one of your texts?\" He then never actually answered my question and started calling me a crazy spoiled brat, and accused me of talking to girls instead of coming out to the parking lot. He also called me a piece of shit, and that really frustrated me after I had been fucking working all day long and dealing with the thanksgiving weekend rush. So I kinda doubled down and said \"you really can't wait 7 minutes?\"\n\n\nAnyway, I definitely shouldn't have said that, cause that only escelated the situation, but he eventually told me that it isn't his responsibility to text me when he comes and picks me up. \n\n\nhe explained that he had shown up about 30 minutes after I called him, but he was on the phone with somebody, and didnt want to hang up on them, and that is why he didn't text me right after he showed up. So he probably had to wait about 35 minutes. \n\n\nAnyway, after a long silent car ride he took my phone because \"I needed to understand that there are consequences for my actions\". I don't really give a shit about him taking my phone because I have 2 backup phones, but its still hurtful.\n\n\nThis morning he just apologized for swearing at me, and said that he expects me to wait in the parking lot and look for him if I ever ask him for a ride again. Which I think is unfair since literally no other kid that can't drive has to wait in the parking lot. But thats why I'm making this post, I have been thinking about it, and I probably would be pissed if I had to wait that long for someone as well, so AITA?\n\n\nThis story was kind of hard to follow, so I will summarize:\n\nI called my dad for a ride after my shift\nDad shows up in 30 minutes but doesn't text me to let me know he was there, because he was talking on the phone.\nHe gets of the phone after about 30 minutes waiting in the parking lot and texts me to let me know he is there\nI come to the car 7 minutes after he texts me\n\n\n",

      "description": "A month after my sister was married, she called me hysterically crying thinking her husband was cheating on her. She found a message on his Apple Watch (that she bought him for Christmas) that was sexual to some other woman. It was dated after they were married, but he claimed it was an old text message that synced recently. She said she didn't believe him but soon after everything was okay. She said she believed him and was going to make her marriage work. \n\nLast week, my sister and I had planned on going on a Disney vacation and discussed splitting the costs. I assumed it was my sister, myself, and my two nieces (his step daughters) since she didn't mention him and how the cost was being split between my sister and I equally. Fast forward to today and she stated the 5 of us would be getting Disney shirts made for our trip. I asked her why would we need 5 shirts and she stated her husband would be going too. \n\nI later texted her and told that he's her husband and I respect that but I honestly don't want to go on a vacation with him after what he did to her. She got upset at me and told me what does that have to do with me. She brought up a guy I had been seeing and how he hurt me and she would still have come hang with us because she's my sister and she loves me despite this person hurting me. I told her I would always be cordial to her husband and I don't mind going to a dinner or what not but I don't want to spend 5 days with this person and share a hotel room. I just don't want to spend a considerable amount of time around someone acting fake. Am I wrong for telling her this?",

John from day 1 was always very kind to me (they got together when I was really suffering from depression Jane was always dismissive not believing its a real illness but John had been through it heard me out and gave me advice) so needless to say I respect and have come to see John as the big brother I've always wanted.\nMy sister and I are close we shared a room until I was 14.\nTwo weeks ago Jane brings home a guy, I've never seen him before. I spot him in the hall, say Hi (I mean its my house of course I'm gunna say hi to someone if I bump into them in the hall) Jane calls him into her room rather abruptly.\nPops her head out the bedroom door shoots me looks.\nThe guy then proceeds to stay the night and is gone by 9am the next morning.\nI ask Jane the usual (who was that, why did he stay ect) she's very dismissive almost aggressive which is unlike her but she makes it clear this is not something John should know about. \nMe and John regularly text nothing big just chatting. So I shoot him a text telling everything.\nHe says he's not going to out and out confront her but will dig into it.

Lady calls her aggressive ( my friend definitely is NOT aggressive!) . \nMy friend comes back in tears, now comes Manager and asks if we are alright. To which I try to explain the whole situation. His response is that’s their company policy! We have been going to this centre and cafe many times before and this was first time someone said we can’t give children their own food.

      "description": "First time posting here so lets see how this goes. So me and my friend (we have known each other for 5 years and are really close) used to go clubbing a lot together and most of the time i was just there to have a good dance and a couple of drinks. She has been travelling in Europe recently and just wants to get wasted and stay out till early hours of the morning. But i have kind of moved on from doing weekend long benders at this point and would rather just have drinks with good company. I recently have got a boyfriend and we are very much in the \"honeymoon\" period of our relationship, its all very new and exciting. But my friend is single.\n\nShe had just come back from Europe and i hadn't seen her in a month and she was super keen to go out. So i said i would go clubbing and drinking after a football game that i was going to with my boyfriend and a mate. After the game some friends joined us for some drinks in a bar that she was going to meet us at before going out. We were having such fun conversations so i wasn't really in the mood cause we were having such a good time. But after she rocked up and convinced everyone to go out we ended up going to this club. We were only there for about an hour and it was packed and really hot. By this point my bf had left and there was a bunch of us (who aren't really my close friends but...) who just wanted to go back to one of the guys house and sit around the pool and chill. But she really wanted to stay at this club.\n\nI could tell she was pissed off because we all (especially me) bailed on clubbing. She is a very vocal and strong minded person which sometimes i think gets in the way of her ability to accept that other peoples decision. She got an uber home with one our friends that had to work in the morning. By this point it was 1am maybe and i went back with the others and just chilled out for a bit.\n\nEarlier that day i told her i would go hard with her at the club no matter what anyone else wanted to do because we haven't gone out in a while. We have very different music tastes so we enjoy dancing to different songs. Shes single (and ready to mingle) and i have a very new boyfriend. So we aren't really on the same level when it comes to going out. But i all fairness i did really give her the impression that i wanted to go out earlier that day but i just changed my mind and came to the realisation that i probably don't want to go to the same places as her anymore (because of our music tastes, rnb/rap/ club music is not for me)\n\nSo was i being an asshole for just changing my mind last minute? Or should i have gone out with her even though i wasn't having a good time in this club?",

Any leftovers will be charged. Asked for the menu after our 1st serving because she took it. Took a while to bring the menu and didn't even give it to us, just left it on the table next to us. I had to get up to go grab it. \n\nAte a few different kinds of meat and finished our side dishes. Server took forever to replace our side dishes (we had to ask). Took forever to refill my drink. After our 3rd plate of meat, we ordered one last plate. Server decided to bring a WHOLE plate and immediately threw it all on the grill. I was like wtf, we can't finish this and I wasn't about to be charged for not finishing that shit so I took it to the restroom and threw most of it in the trash.\n\nWent to pay in the front cashier. Total came up to 62.79 (two of us), payed with credit card. Service sucked for a place that wasnt even busy at all so I left a 2.21 tip to total it to 65 on the receipt. Cashier told me 'No, that tip is too little. We're not a buffet, we're a restaurant. You need to tip more.\" She pointed to the bottom of the receipt which had 3 gratuity tip amount from 11.00-13.00$. I looked at it and thought about it for a bit and told her \"No, I bought the ALL YOU CAN EAT KOREAN BBQ for 30$ per person. I'm not gonna give a tip based on the amount of the total. I'm gonna give the tip based on the service that was given to me and the service sucked\".

      "title": "AITA For getting upset at my parents and snapping at my mom when they refused me the flight lessons I earned?",
      "description": "Recently I won a $4000 scholarship to take flight lessons. To get the scholarship I had to submit a community service form (80 hours), a five paragraph essay, and an hour long interview. I am one of the three that won. Over three thousand people applied. \n\nHowever, the new semester has started in school and I have been so focused on getting this scholarship that school slipped. My grades dropped severely at the beginning of this quarter and the ending of last. I will admit I put the scholarship before school and sometimes did not have time for homework. I still passed my classes last semester with nothing lower than a high D in one class. On top of that I have been extremely stressed out about the scholarship, family health, and some troubles with my friends. \n\nLast semester my mom and dad both got very angry at me about my grades since they have never been so low. I was upset at myself but, I didn't know how to fix it and the hole just kep't getting deeper until the last two weeks when I was able to pull it all together. I worked my Christmas break away getting most of the remaining service hours and revising the final essay. \n\nI had my interview last week and found out I got the scholarship Tuesday afternoon. I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to tell my parents when they got home. When my mom and dad got home i knew something was wrong and when I asked them what it was they started about my grades. Both of my parents are reasonable people and very nice however my mom is not good at seeing other points of view and she overreacts some of time. A little ways into them scolding me about my grades my mom said something like \"I don't know what else you have been doing!\" And that is when I really got upset because she knew that I had been working on this for months now. I responded \"I've been working my ass off getting a scholarship! Which I was going to tell you about but, apparently that doesn't mean anything to you!\" Both my mom and dad were then temporily off the topic of my grades and we discussed my scholarship.\n\nI don't remember how it started back up again but, my mom started getting really angry and started actually yelling about my grades. She kep't saying that I wasn't doing my part in the family and that she didn't think that I was responsible enough to use my scholarship money and said that there would be no lessons until semester ended because I had to stop acting like i didnt care about anything and told me at this rate I would be stuck working at McDonald's. I couldn't believe it and I was furious because the money is void by the end of the year. If I was not able to fly until summer I would miss out on flying until next school year becasue I had planned to work at a Boy scout camp during the summer to fund my flying lessons. If I didn't start now there is a big chance that I would not be able to use all my money as i would only be able to do one or two lessons per week and I couldn't do much flying in November or December as it is very snowy in those months where I live. I would only be able to take half of the projected lessons. \n\nWithout thinking I just yelled \"What do you want me to end up in a dead end job like you!\" I immediatly regreted saying that and my mom just stopped and went to her room. I coulnt believe that I said that and I basically spent the rest of my night just crying in my room. My mom is very upset still and so am I. \n\nI really feel like a total douchbag but, i just don't know if it was appropriate of my mom to basically tell me I was a burnout and that I wouldn't amount to anything. Am I The Asshole?\n\nTLDR: I earned a scholarship of $4000 for flying lessons but, somewhat neglected school while working on the scholarship. Now my parents are not letting me use my scholarship because of my grades and both my mom and I really hurt each others feelings during an argument about it.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "I love my mom. But for the past three years she has almost completely neglected me. When I've come to her for help and advice on the issues of being a teenage girl or to attempt to open up about how I feel she blows me off. And when she found out I am moving out at eighteen (currently a bit more than a month away) she started guilting me about not having a lot of time to spend with her or the family due to school. And also moving out literally the day I turn eighteen to live with my boyfriend whos a bit older. Knowing this she refuses to let me get a job, and made it so due to missing a crucial deadline I will probably not be able to afford college next year and will be forced to go into massive debt if I want to pull it off. In addition to refusing to take me to the DMV to get my drivers permit al this time. This has made it even harder for me and my boyfriend my only support for the past four years to find a place considering until I can find a job I will be a financial burden and even if I land a job he will have to drive me or I'll have to take the bus. I finally agreed today to go with her for family time and she left without me and dumped me babysitting my little brother. When I texted her telling her I was upset and when she gets home I want some space and to not pick me up. She decides to pick me up anyway. Due to the lack of parking she parks halfway in the street and sends the teen brother she took with her to retrieve me and kid brother. I refuse to go saying I'm upset at her and now just wanted to stay and chill with my younger brother who I was having a fun time babysitting at this point. She gets her rearview mirror tore off by a car who drives away and she marches into the house screaming it's my fault she got her mirror torn off and to get in the car now or she'll cut me off from my boyfriend who is my only support. I get in the car and endure two hours of her yelling at me over her mirror guilting me over her mirror yelling at me for wanting to move out guilting me for moving out yelling at me because I \"told her I didn't want to go and she left without me and then I guilted her into coming back and refused to go resulting in her mirror breaking which would take hundreds for her to fix\" then for not letting it go and ruining her day. I have multiple mental health issues but I haven't had a panic attack or a PTSD flashback since I was fifteen. This triggered both PTSD flashbacks and anxiety attacks multiple times all the while she completely ignored me and kept going even though you could hear me struggling to breathe from the front of the car. Now that it's been a few hours she asked me when I would let it go and has been acting like it wasn't a big deal and I was overreacting. Should I just let it go and spend time with her? What should I do?",

      "description": "We're getting married in July and are finalizing the list of invitations, but we're deciding whether we should invite her extended family on her dad's side. There was a pretty serious fallout with that side of the family:\n\nMy fiancee's father (Dad) was one of 5 kids, and their mother passed away in 2014 with severe Alzheimer's and dementia. She owned a lake house that the whole family would use. One of Dad's siblings (Bro) wrote her will for her and had her sign off on it (presumably not really knowing what she was signing) stating that the lake house would be split 5 ways between each of the siblings, and in the event of the death of one of the siblings, their portion of the estate would be split among their children and not go to their spouse.\n\nDad was diagnosed with terminal cancer a few months before his mother passed away, so that seemed specifically targeted at my fiancee's immediate family. Owning a portion of the estate meant that you would be responsible for annual dues on upkeep/repairs/updates. Dad's portion would have been split three ways between my fiancee and her sisters, meaning they wouldn't have had enough voting power to try and stop expensive, unnecessary upgrades to the house so they would be on the hook for annual dues and renovation costs when none of them were in a good financial standing to pay for it.\n\nBro kept giving the reasons of my FMIL \"not being part of the family\" even though they'd been together for over 40 years, and that Dad's kids getting his part of the estate was \"what Nana would have wanted\". After months of my fiancee certain that she and her sisters would be stuck in this estate with no way out, Dad finally got Bro to agree to buy out his part of the estate. Dad was deep into his battle with cancer at this point and ended up passing away less than three weeks after they made the agreement.\n\nFollowing Dad's death, Bro and the other siblings have all but cut out my fiancee's family short of receiving the occasional holiday card, and her mom is extremely uncomfortable about being near any of them after they told her she wasn't part of the family anymore. We're upset with the way Dad's siblings treated him too (since they sided with Bro and voted not to let my FMIL take over his portion of the estate or buy them out) so we don't really want them there either, but we don't want to look petty by not inviting them.\n\nWe think that not inviting Dad's siblings and their spouses but still inviting my fiancee's cousins would be a bad look, and the cousins might not come if the siblings try to convince them that my fiancee's family is the one that cut them all out. We could not invite any of that side of the family, which ends up being around 30-40 people, but we don't really want to cut out people who weren't the ones that did anything wrong (guilty by association isn't fair?) So WIBTA if we didn't invite any of that side/just invited the cousins?",

      "description": "Asking because in my book, using ultimatums **is** an asshole move. I never thought I'd end up here and it sucks.\n\nBut as the title says, I gave my spouse that ultimatum because they are unwilling to work on their issues and have made me responsible for helping them out with unfucking their life. That's too huge of a burden, I am not a therapist, despite them treating me as their live-in therapist because I do not work due to disability, and according to them \"I also have issues\", which is true! Issues for which I have gone to therapy, read books, and improved in other ways even my friends have noticed. My spouse has also noticed I have become a better person, strangely enough.\n\nMy spouse has tackled the easiest problems so far, with my help. But they refuse to face the fact that I am not a therapist, and I cannot help them overcome the more serious stuff. The more serious stuff has been causing damage between us for years now.\n\nHow would I even begin to know how to help them with this, I have trouble helping myself sometimes.\n\nMy spouse has not been able to help with my issues since they are due to chemical imbalances. I am recovering from depression and complex PTSD due to childhood trauma. It's been either me alone, or therapy helping.\n\nMy spouse also has a history of familial trauma, yet they insist they don't need therapy, they just need me to help them and for me to \"be patient\".\n\nIt's been 6 years and we keep having the same fights over and over, over the same things, because they won't get help. I'm at my wits end. I know I do not have it in me to be patient forever.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

I'm very pessimistic and I have been diagnosed with severe depression, ADD, and OCD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom and I have always had a really rocky relationship. As stated before, I'm an extremely negative person. However, my mom is kind of the opposite of me in that regard; she's always listening to TED talks on how to be a better person and how to succeed in life. I don't know why, but whenever she talks about that stuff it's like she pulls a trigger: I begin to snap and lash out at her. I know she doesn't deserve it and I feel really bad/know it's not her fault, but I do this often and even randomly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom grew up with really strict parents and has been really strict on me \\[in today's standards\\]. No phones or any electronics after 9:00 PM, no homework on the computer unless she's supervising, if you don't complete 100% of the stuff you have to do you will be punished, no playing any video games because you could talk to strangers on the internet (even just texting on fucking Minecraft), no spending money/she takes all my money, stuff like that. I'm not sure if that's strict or not but other people tell me that it is. She physically harms me sometimes, but not often enough for it to be a big problem. I'd say the most she's ever done is drag me out of my bed and across the floor \\[more then once\\] and pull my hair \\[which is really sensitive\\], so it's not really that serious. Just wanted to mention it if that is relevant to the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPOST CONTINUED HERE, WILL MAKE TL;DR LATER: [https://pastebin.com/jdpScKyu](https://pastebin.com/jdpScKyu)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for wanting to flee from my problems with my mom? I feel guilty about it but relieved that I may get a chance to live with my dad without her. I'm sorry for the long post, will add a TL;DR later as it's 1:30 and I have school tomorrow. In fact, I had to sneak my laptop to write this as she usually has it padlocked in a closet with all the other food and electronics.

      "description": "Background: I'm 24, have two older sisters and have always saved my money well and properly. My mom and step father (on disability) were in a no fault accident and recently my mother started to work again after going through surgery. \n\nWell during surgery they needed help with rent in which I helped pay some of it a month ago, my sister then paid some money for my moms final procedure (which I was there for; missed work). Well shortly after returning to work my moms vehicle had a recall so she got a loaner from the dealership. \n\nTheir apartments towing has a strict policy and parking stickers for residents. Well the loaner has temp tags and no parking sticker obviously and they forgot to get a temporary parking sticker and / or park in visitors . . . so they got towed (a few weeks after returning to work) so before work this morning I get a call from my mother crying (literally I had clocked in) stating the vehicle was towed and they needed money. \n\nI've been saving since I was 16 and have a good amount in savings. Problem is up until now I did not know my mom had access and when I said I was busy and would try to contact my older sisters about helping to pay the $300 fee they (mom and step dad) blew up on me stating to \"do not talk to me, we are done\" . . . \"come get the rest of your shit, leave the key under the mat, etc\" all because I said I couldn't help this time because I have finances I need to prepare for. \n\nI don't use my savings unless for emergencies, I budget from checking and recently booked a cruise and trip to Colorado. I am willing to help but not $300 at the moment due to the items above and rent going up. AITA?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend is not the best at replying, and sometimes she'll follow up on missed texts but not always. But mostly she'll ignore when she either forgets or is too busy to respond. It's not like I want to talk every hour of the day, but when I ask a question like when are you free next and the message is read but ignored, to me, I don't see how someone has the time to read a message but not respond. Normally if I don't want to speak or can't talk, I won't read the message until I have time to. I personally just find it rude and dismissive. My girlfriend mainly doesn't do much for a job at the moment and has a lot of time on her hands, she's mainly playing video games or watching TV while job searching. But for me, I don't really know what to think when a message is just read and it bothers me. I asked a question earlier, she read it, I didn't hear anything back for an hour until I just posted a question mark, still read it and then when I messaged later on, she said to chill because she's busy. I mean reply when you can but sometimes she doesn't follow up to the question and just posts something completely off topic, and I find it a bit exhausting. All I'm really asking for is clarification on what's going on. \n\nAITA for getting annoyed when she does that or do I just need to chill? ",

      "description": "My older brother is in his twenties and dating a girl. My family has some negative opinions here, but I'm not sure quite how I feel about her.\n\nMy brother and his girlfirend (let's call them Noah and Emma) got together a few years back. Emma is nice to me, and lets me eat some of the food she buys on the few occasions of the year that she and Noah come down to visit (we live out in the country and they live in the city, three or four hours away). She's into video games and nerdy things and so is my brother, and they get along like two peas in a pod outside of a couple arguments.\n\nHowever, Emma has her fair share of issues. One of them is being lactose-intolerant, which wouldn't be an issue if one time when we were driving her and Noah back to the city when it turned out she didn't take her lactaide and ate cereal with milk and threw up in Mom's new car (About one or two days old) with me sitting besides her in the backseat. Noah and Emma own one or two cats and a dog that they can barely afford, because Noah only recently got a job and Emma doesn't work. They often go out LARPing, which costs money as well. It's even possible that they've had sex in my house a couple times (showering together, heard them mumbling quietly about it at one point).\n\nEmma is also a bit clingy and seeks validation often, so when I do get to see my brother she's with him and he often goes into another room to comfort her because she gets sad for whatever reason, and then I don't really get to see him for the rest of the night when they usually leave the next day. Another thing with this is that when she was down with my brother at my house, when he was with my other brothers she revealed to me that she self-harmed and that she hadn't even told my brother this.\n\nBut Emma is also kind to me and has hung out with me when she's not with Noah, she enjoys my jokes, she listens to me when I ramble and she gives me homemade food sometimes. I find it hard to be mad at her for being so clingy with my brother because she's been pretty much nothing but kind to me, which is why I came here.\n\nTLDR; My brother's girlfriend is extremely clingy and makes it hard for me to see my older brother on the off occasion that he can come down to visit, but is extremely kind to me despite this.\n\nSo, time for my judgement.

      "description": " My best friend is FINALLY kicking out her roommate. I could make a whole post about this woman, but my biggest issues is she took in 4 kittens. It wasn't bad, she had intentions of finding homes for them quickly (or so we thought) . Instead she kept them and they've matured to adolescent cats (meaning it's a lil harder to find homes for them) nonetheless, she claims that they're all \"Her babies\" BUT the kicker is she does absolutely nothing for them. She can't be fucked to fill up their food or water bowls, the worst of it is she doesn't clean out their litter boxes, so they're absolutely disgusting. There is cat crap everywhere in her area, because the cats won't use the boxes because they're so full. I saw it EARLIER TODAY and the cats couldn't even scratch litter how they normally do. There's more shit than litter. Anyways, she's leaving and may be living in her car for a bit, so out of the kindness of my heart (for the cats, not her) I'm trying to find homes for them all, and managed to score taking one home with me. The thing is, she is intending to come get the cat back after she settles. I know I'll be attatched to the little guy, and I don't know if I'm willing to give him back to her knowing she won't take care of them. She wants to come visit him every once in a while and she wants to be there when I bring him home, but I don't want her in my home and I don't understand why she's being like this because she doesn't even take care of him.

      "description": "So, this literally just happened. For some context, my niece and her mom just started staying with us recently.  Yesterday, my mother calls me asking my girlfriend and I to babysit my niece for the night. She tells me that she has plans with other family members, and that my cousin can't go because someone has to look over her daughter, my niece, for the night. We say \"sure\" and tell them we'll be home shortly. Here's where things get annoying.\nMy girlfriend and I finally get home, only to find my cousin and my niece still at home, with no one else to be found. Confused, I ask where my mother is. My cousin tells me that she left. This was annoying as the only reason my girlfriend came over to stay the night was because my mother said she'd pay us to look over my niece. My girlfriend and I also have an event to attend early in the morning (in 3 hours from now, exactly). Annoyed, but deciding it was not too big of a deal, my girlfriend and I decide to go to sleep.\nAt around 3am, my mother and about 4 other family members come home, drunk and obnoxious. Despite being aggravated by this, I figured they would leave soon, so I tried to go back to sleep. They then proceeded to play loud music right outside my door and speak unreasonably loud. They were basically yelling. I ask them to turn down the music as I have to be up early for an event. They simply tell me \"no.\" The music then continues for over an hour. At this point, I'm furious. I head to where everyone is gathered and I very loudly ask them to turn down the music as it's already 4am. My brother, who went out with them, tells me I'm being disrespectful since they're celebrating my aunt's birthday. I tell them they're being disrespectful for blasting music right outside my door as I'm trying to sleep. I must have ruined the mood for their \"party\" because all guests left soon afterwards. My brother and my mom are infuriated with me, and are currently ignoring me. I'm failing to see the reason why. So, AITA? ",

      "description": "I’ve been working at this company for 2 years. I’m at an entry level position, it pays more than minimum wage but you don’t need a college degree to work there. The department I’m in only has like 10 people in it.\n\nA few months ago, we got a new person hired in to our department. I helped train him when he first started. And yesterday we got news that he’s being promoted.\n\nA few of us were kinda baffled by it. He had no prior experience in this kind of work. \n\nManagement has always made it clear to me that they think I’m doing a great job, and that they can always count on me, and I always get really good marks in my employee reviews, etc etc.\n\nYesterday a few of us were talking about why this new person would’ve gotten promoted, instead of someone like me, who’s been there for much longer and who is a great employee. \n\nOne person speculated that it could be because this new employee is the only one (in our entry level department) who has a bachelors degree (albeit for something not related to what our company does) and so they felt he may be somewhat “over qualified” for the position he was hired in for, and that maybe they didn’t want him to get “bored” with what he was doing and look for another job instead. \n\nAfter thinking about it, that possible explanation seemed to make a little bit of sense to me and made me feel a little better.\n\nAlso important to note: this new person has also expressed interest in working more hours and doing more things for the company, so this could go along with the “we don’t want him to get too bored” explanation. But this better not be the only reason though, because I have also expressed interest in working in higher positions in the past.\n\nThen today, I was talking to my other coworker, who was saying she felt kinda pissed for me that this new person got promoted before me. I explained to her that I did feel kinda bummed about it, but that I would kinda understand if it was because he had a college degree, and they felt he was overqualified. But then she said “it shouldn’t matter that he has a college degree, it’s not related to what our company does at all and he has no prior experience; and if being ‘overqualified’ was a problem, he shouldn’t have taken the job in the first place.” Then she said I should ask management why he was promoted and I wasn’t.\n\nBut I don’t know how to ask without sounding entitled.\n\n**TL;DR**: I’ve been working at this company for 2 years and I’m a great employee. New person gets hired in a few months ago with no prior experience and gets promoted. One of my coworkers thinks it’s justified because he has a bachelors degree and I don’t and management might think he’s “overqualified” to work in this position and management might not want him to get bored and find another job. My other coworker feels pissed for me, thinks it’s unjustified that he got promoted over me, and that him having a bachelors degree shouldn’t matter because it’s not related to what our company does, and he has no prior experience doing what we do, and him being “overqualified” is his problem because he took the job in the first place.",

I have two friends in my chemistry class, L and S.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a very big teachers pet, and I'm also really good at science and really appreciate my chem teacher because most of my past science teachers weren't all that great. I have great grades in his class and get 100s on every test he gives out, even the final. Because of that, L and S started making jokes about him wanting to \"see me after class and talk about if I was in dress code or not.\" These jokes were almost always said with heavy sexual meanings, which grossed me out immensely. I'll admit, I had a teeny tiny crush on my chem teacher at the beginning of the year, but it made me feel so guilty and gross, so I worked it out with my therapist and I'm 100% over it now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey constantly made these nasty jokes about him wanting to fuck me and stuff, and I really didn't like it. I had asked them to stop very many times but they didn't. I explained to them in detail why I wanted them to stop, to which L did stop, thank god. S, however, didn't. It got so bad to where when we were hanging out one weekend and she started making the jokes, I yelled at her to \"fucking quit it already, those jokes are disgusting. He is my TEACHER and if he did want to fuck me, I'd fucking report him. Shut the fuck up.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS has a history of BPD and started cutting herself again because of what I said later that night. AITA?",

      "description": "So, my boyfriend (23) and I (20) are both students and have been together for three years. He is in his final year as a informatic engineer and I just started university in toxicology. He currently is doing his last traineeship (or intership? I do not not what it would be called in English) 2 hours from where I live so we only see each other on weekends and during the week we talk on the phone. \nTbh I’m always down to ear him complain about almost anything because I like talking to him and all but there is this one thing I can’t ear anymore: his salary. \nSo when he will be done from school he will make around 70k+ a year which is a lot in my opinion. BUT currently he is making way less, which is normal since he is an intern and only work 4 month a year and the other months he is in school. Way less is still 2x more what I made at my student job when I used to do around the same amount of hours.\n\nA bit a background here: last year I worked almost full time (between 30-35hrs a week has my job would give me) to collect my money so I wouldn’t have to worry about it at school and I still work today with school (less than 15hrs a week). During that year, I agree, I complained A LOT. Like A LOT. At mid point in the year he told me how annoying that was. I got pretty angry and frustrated at first but then I realized, and I worked on it and tried not to complain as much after that. \n\nNow, back with the story: this morning he called me like usual and we talked a bit before he started complaining about having no money. His pay is next week and we just bought a vacation in the south with two friends and he can’t pay his credit right now because the vacation was more than what currently has in bank BUT his next pay will cover way more than that. So we agreed that I would give him money so he could pay for the credit and he would pay me back next week (okay for me). But he kept saying that he is way underpay and that he should be given more (from the company not me haha). \nI was already kinda annoyed from all the previous time so I didn’t say anything. So he told me &lt;&lt;are you tired about me talking about money&gt;&gt; so I told him yes and then it started.\nI told him that I felt he was a bit entitled and that he should stand back a bit. That the condition of his internship were good and that he shouldn’t be that demanding. Then he lashed back and told me about all the time I complained about my job. Then I told him that he’s still very lucky and that not making 95k a year is still really really good for a student…\nThen he told me that he had to go and the conversation ended there.\nAnd now I’m conflicted because I hate (like hate with a fury) people that have the mentality of you can’t complain because some people have it worse. And I kinda feel like that right now.\nBut I also feel like I was right for that specific thing.  \n\n(TLDR: I told my boyfriend that he shouldn’t complain about the money he make as an intern because it is still making way more than minimum wage and now I feel like an asshole)",

Apparently, they got really close in the four months they've known each other because he mentions rather frequently how B is such an important person in his life and how she's so amazing and fun. While we were broken up, he used B as a way to make me jealous (posting photos of her, going out of his way to bring her up in conversation, telling me about all the fun things they do together -- mostly stuff he and I used to do together, etc.) and now he wonders why I don't like B all that much...\n\nCoupled with the fact that B is EXTREMELY similar to my sexually abusive ex (same interests, same cadence, even a similar fashion sense, as well as some very undesirable aspects of their personalities), as well as the fact that I think she is *extremely* fake and condescending, I have a really tough time seeing B around. I've made it very clear to my boyfriend that I don't like her, I don't want to hear about her, and I sure as hell don't want to be around her, but he always finds a way to turn my dislike of B into a problem much bigger than it is. \n\nHe constantly says that she's amazing and funny and wonderful and that I'd really get along with her, even though I have told him how I feel about her. He seems to think that I'm obligated to give her a chance, but I don't really feel the same way.\n\nSo, Reddit.

      "description": "A long time friend of mine has just moved in with me about 2.5 months ago. Every day, she comes home and tells me stories about how a few (different one every day or so) of the cooks at her restaurant are absolutely chasing her. She's very much the trusting/idealistic type and wants to believe that people are worthy of the trust she gives them (she has said that she knows this to be true of herself). I believe that she is too trusting too quickly and gives people the benefit of the doubt despite them treating her like shit.\n\nShe has had MULTIPLE mentally/emotionally abusive boyfriends, and the most recent one is the reason she moved to this current city. She dated him for two years and at the end, berated our friends and myself for \"not telling her that we never had any good feelings about him\". I took this with a grain of salt and resolved to be a better friend to her and tell her when I felt she was being manipulated or too trusting of people she doesn't know.\n\nOne cook openly approached her about an \"arrangement\" that his wife did not have to know about. Another has been completely obsessed with her and is telling everyone at the restaurant that he is going to marry her, etc etc. She has had two of these men's wives contact her and get upset with her for \"trying to steal their men\" when in reality these men aren't worth the spit used to shine my shoes.\n\nThis brings us to the last couple days, where she has told me that two of the other men who work at this place took her out for dinner and drinks after work. She had work the next day, and they did not, and when she wasn't home at her normal hour I texted to see what she was up to. She responded saying she'd been \"trying to leave this place for like 3 hours\" and that they'd ordered food and told her they'd get her an uber home. She finally gets in the uber and 5 minutes into the ride, the guy cancels it. She has to take the train home super late which puts her back another 45 mins.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, where I tell her at some point that the guys she's been working with are utter shit, and that they have been treating her like garbage. She proceeds to defend them by saying \"they're not bad people\" and \"You don't know them, how can you even say that?! Its so rude!\". I extricate myself from the situation, and get really upset, coming back to the conversation a few minutes later and reminding her that she asked me to say something next time I thought that she was dealing with men who were not treating her properly. She gets extremely agitated and begins screaming at me that \"YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING!\" to which I said \"Well, i'm 4 for 4 at knowing when you're engaging with people who treat you like shit.\" and shut my door.\n\nI've been thinking about this non stop and feel kind of bad, but also know that I am saying these things with good intention and with her prior permission. At this point I feel like I'm just not gonna give her the time of day and she can suffer for the umpteenth time.\n\n",

My mom got back into smoking after she and my dad separated, and boy is that an expensive habit. Not long after that, she got into drinking too. By no means is she a bum drunk or anything, but it’s a habit that costs a lot of money we could be using for bills. \n\nSo here’s where aita comes in: Last night we got into an argument about money and how I need to get a job to keep us afloat. It turned into a yelling match pretty fast and I told her that I can keep trying (haven’t had much luck so far) but it would help a lot if she didn’t spend so much money on cigs and beer.

      "title": "AITA for (maybe) getting a retail worker fired at Christmas?",
      "description": "This happened a few years ago near Christmas time at an Old Navy. I think it was the 22nd or 23rd at night around 10pm or so (I think the store was staying open all night for xmas shoppers). I was in there shopping for some new clothes for a Christmas Eve party. The large store was almost empty, just me and maybe like one other shopper and a bunch of workers. I had some clothes to try on and went to the dressing rooms and was the only one there. I'm a guy and one of the female workers (they were all female that night, but this woman seemed more like a supervisor or manager) was nearby and told me to go on in but no one was in the dressing room area. \n\nSo since the store is so empty and I want to try some different sizes and different things I take awhile and at one point go get some other things to try and go back. So anyway, at one point two (female) workers come in and one is telling the other to go try on some clothes. The one telling the other to go try some clothes on was the one who knew I was in there already and had told me to go on in, and I'm pretty sure she was like a supervisor/manager type person, just the way she acted led me to believe this, she seemed to think she had the run of the store and was very dominant in the way she talked to the other girl, and she was a little older like in her 30s while the others working there that night looked like probably teens or 20s; I have no idea what her name was but we'll just call the woman in her 30s Bertha here. Bertha was one of those loud, deep-voiced, almost overbearing in the way they talk kind of people. The other person being told to try on some clothes was younger and I'm pretty sure was just a regular associate or whatever; I never even saw her, at least in the dressing rooms.\n\nSo Bertha is telling this girl to try on some clothes and then this girl realised there was someone else in the dressing rooms (me) though I was in a stall with the door closed so she's like, oh no, I can't there's someone here. I don't know exactly why she said that but I'm guessing workers weren't supposed to be trying on clothes while working but maybe especially if there were customers in the dressing rooms, I dunno. Or maybe she was just really shy, or both.\n\nBut Bertha is just saying something like, \"Oh no, go on in and try them on, he won't mind.\" (talking about me) and the other girl is giggling. Then Bertha says something like, \"Maybe he'd like to see you in your bra and panties anyway.\" or something very close to that effect, which shocked me. I don't know if she thought I couldn't hear her or just thought she'd try to make me laugh too or what but it was wildly inappropriate. I said nothing (I was in the stall where they couldn't see me) and the other girl uncomfortably giggled and went into the stall next to me to change herself.\n\nThen Bertha just keeps talking while the girl is changing about random stuff and I'm just trying to get changed back into my clothes so I can leave. Then at some point Bertha even says something  to the girl like, \"maybe you'd like to see him in his underwear too\" and was cackling about it while the girl giggled uncomfortably while changing. I was sort of dumbfounded but was too shy to say anything and in the moment wasn't quite sure if I was overreacting to thinking it was out of line. So I finished getting my own clothes back on and just left and as I walked out the dressing room I had to walk past Bertha and just ignored her and she just let my like she hadn't just been talking about me.\n\nSo after thinking it over, I realised it was all just crazy inappropriate and decided to call into their corporate line to complain about it the next day. I got ahold of someone who took down everything and offered to mail me a $50 gift card for what happened which I took, and told me they were taking it very seriously and it would all be looked into and took my information in case they wanted to contact me again, which they never did. I went in twice to use the gift card a few weeks later and no sign of Bertha anywhere so I figured maybe she'd got fired.\n\nNow, here's the thing, I told some other people about this incident and they told me was an asshole for possibly getting Bertha fired at Christmastime and said that it wasn't that big a deal, but I completely disagree. She should never have acted like that in front of a customer. I mean, who does that? So, am I the asshole?",

She bought a switch that we share and I've bought many games on it with my own money too. Recently she placed a rule saying that I have to ask her when I want to play with the switch because I took it out one time when she really wanted to play with it. \n\nToday I got home from school and my sister was listening to a pod cast in the living room. She doesn't have school or a job ATM so she basically gets to play on the switch all day. Since she wasn't playing the switch I decided to play with it in my room for a bit. She comes into my room 30 minutes later fuming saying I needed to ask her first even though she wasn't playing with it and wasn't intending too. She took it away cause she wanted to play with it and said if I did it again she wouldn't let me play anymore. Honestly I think it's a really petty rule she made so that she can have all the control over the switch and use it as leverage if I dont give her what she wants.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",

This wasn’t  a one-off, they make these jokes in front of me often, while knowing i’m a flaming lesbian myself. I don’t get offended easily, and i’m all for that drama, but it had gotten to the point where their ‘jokes’ were actually pretty hurtful. I don’t try to stop them,  because i know they’ll tell me to stop being sensitive and that they wErE oNlY jOkInG. \n\nAnyways, somehow it had gotten to the point where one of the girls was talking about how their brother was really good at twerking, so i make a joke about him being a twink. Looking back on the situation, ‘twink’ probably wasn’t the best word to use, as i know even some gay people aren’t comfortable with the phrase, so that was probably a mistake. \n\nEither way, the girl immediately got really offended, and was saying stuff like ‘are you saying my brothers gay?’ i tried to backtrack and explain how it was a joke, but it got really uncomfortable between us real quick. i don’t think anyone else heard, but i still kinda feel like that was a joke i should’ve kept to myself. \n\nSo, am i an asshole?\n\nSidenote, if you are a more feminine gay man, or gay at all, i have no issues with you, keep on doing your thing you beautiful dude.

      "description": "*\\*names changed and location generalized for privacy* \n\nMy bf Jake\\* and I are treating ourselves to a grad trip to Europe in a couple months after graduating from university.  In one of the countries we are visiting, he wants us to stay with his friend Clare\\* for the \\~4 days we are in that country. \n\nBackground: Jake and Clare have supposedly been best friends since high school, they share a large friend group.  I met her for the first time last year at a party she hosted.  From my perspective, Jake and Clare flirted A LOT - throwing her around the pool, chasing her in the water, tickling, etc.  He didn't behave like this with any of his other female friends.  When we got home that night, my drunk ass broke down crying, admitting that it bothered me, I accused him of liking her.  This turned into a big fight.  He said there was nothing between him and Clare and that he just behaved like that because they're such good friends.\n\nClare now lives in Europe for grad school and has a boyfriend (also lives in Europe but different country).  When she was home over Christmas break, we met her boyfriend at a group outing.  He seemed kind of stand-offish with Jake and was very PDA with Clare - otherwise this outing was pretty uneventful and I didn't end up crying at the end of the night lol.  Jake messaged her several times to hangout and catchup before she went back to Europe but she ignored his messages (didn't reply to any at all).  \n\nWhen planning our Europe trip, Jake brought up that we could stay with Clare and save some money.  I agreed the money saving option was nice but I admitted to him that I wasn't comfortable and self confident enough to stay with her for more than 1-2 days. Initially Jake agreed and said that this trip was for us and wanted us to both enjoy it.  However, last night this came up again (thanks to the Boeing737 MAX's being grounded and flight reschedules) and he accused me of being unfair of making a big deal about staying with Clare for more than 1-2 days.  \n\nJake: It's my friend that lives in another country and I otherwise get to see her once or twice a year and you only want to stay with her for 1-2 days? If this was the other way around you and it was one of your friends you would be pissed at me.\n\nMe: You haven't seen the way I see you two together. \n\nJake: There is nothing between me and Clare.  She's a good friend.\n\nWe were both tired and decided to go to bed and continue this discussion once we were rested and got some major school assignments out of the way.\n\nI wanted to say back: Then why doesn't she make an effort to see you when she's here? \n\nPersonally I think staying with her for 2 days is a compromise if we're going to be there for 4 days. He disagrees.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** BF wants us to stay with his female friend that I think have a very flirtatious relationship and makes me uncomfortable.  I said I was comfortable with staying with her for 1-2 days of our 4 day stay. BF thinks I'm being an asshole. ",

He is like an acquaintance to me, and whenever they get together I immediately notice theres a change in her demeanor, she acts much happier with me. He is also out of shape, old, and slightly short. Where as I am younger, and 6'2, and take care of myself. \n\nNeedless to say, there have been several side eyes directed toward me by the husband.\n\nWell, recently shes been coming to work sadder and sadder, or i guess quieter and quieter. She opens up to me that she and her husband are separating, which makes sense because he hasn't been seen around work for awhile. He is now moved out of his house with a relative.\n\nTwo days go by, and we're constantly opening up to eachother. Eventually, she invites me over to her house to eat dinner since shes lonely and her kids are at a friends house. \n\nLong story short, we have sex in their bed. After they've been separated for three days. I told my sister and she thinks im terrible for not giving my coworker space and giving her time to think.

      "description": "So, a little background; my(F23) boyfriend (M30) is a wonderful person. He is kind and caring but honestly, he can be a little bit of a pushover when it comes to his parents(especially when it comes to them). I know this will sound mean of me, but they aren’t exactly the best people either. His dad is a “recovering” gambling addict (I use that term loosely because I don’t think he’s gotten over that issue) and his mom is emotionally and mentally manipulative(not just to him, but to his other brothers too- though she only asks my BF for money). \n\nAnyway, they’ll always ask the BF for money constantly. Sometimes it’s not too much, just to help them get along. He is well off and isn’t struggling that much(yet). Be aware though, they have jobs, they make enough money to pay for their own things, they just have no hold whatsoever on their spending habits. Most recently, however, they had asked him for $2000.  2000 FUCKING DOLLARS! This was AFTER he’d already given them 1/4 of that already. Then they had the audacity to ask him for MORE.\n\nThe thing that irks me the most is that they don’t seem to understand he has his OWN life, his OWN bills, his OWN mortgage, he needs to buy food to feed himself and have money to pay for his OWN insurance and what not. I get the whole “taking care of your parents in their old age thing” but there becomes a point where it crosses the line from “taking care of” to “enabling” and I’m pretty sure that’s exactly whats going on. They KNOW he won’t say no, he’s an amazing son IMO, and tbh they’re really not good parents. He is like a bank to them now, not their son. \n\nIt fucking breaks my heart to see him go through this constantly with them. I know he’s not going to say no to them, especially not to his mother, he cares about her so much (granted he does complain about how much she asks of him). I keep telling him not to do it, to stop giving them so much money. It’s NOT his fault they can’t properly save and spend money. He shouldn’t feel as if he has to practically provide for these assholes while they use their own money for god only knows what. He’s a bank to them, like I said before, that’s all he is.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I'm a amateur guitarist/bassist. I absolutely love music, and I practice intensively, I really want to be one of the best one day. However, I'm relatively new in town and I don't know the music scene at all. I know one guy, and me and him have occasionally played with his brother. His brother is nice enough, but he also has autism and some sort of developmental disability. This makes interacting with him awkward, since he has no concept of social interactions basically, and even more awkward around others. The first time I met him he pointed out (within earshot) that the girl in front of us was transgender, and called her \"he\" and talked about her old name and stuff. I was mortified, but the girl was really nice about it.\n\nThat night, when we were playing a set he came in, blood dripping down his forehead from a cat scratch. He was dressed in everyday clothes, had not memorized the lyrics, and as I found out, was not a very good singer. He ended up messing up the song, and me and his brother basically had to cover for him with solos and stage maneuvers, but after that I'm not interested in playing with him. \n\nAs I said, he's nice, though he makes things really awkward often. He's also a terrible singer, and has bad stage presence. I know gigs are not many for a kid with no connections, but I don't want to play in his band, though I feel obligated because of his brother and I's friendship. He's been messaging me non-stop and has been calling me more than my own family the last week, and I don't want to play with him.\n\nIt's obviously not gonna go anywhere.\n\nAITA here, especially since part of my reasoning is his mental disabilities....",

      "description": "This happened when I was 18. I was part of a very tight knit group of friends. It was me, one guy (K) who I considered my best friend, and a couple (A + J). We did pretty much everything together and usually hung out at A+J's place since they lived together while K and me were still living at home. I saw all of them at least 3-4 times a week. \n\nOne day, I met A for coffee at our college cafeteria because he said he wanted to talk about something. When I got there he was crying. He told me that he and J had gotten into a horrible fight (if I remember correctly she had gotten physically violent towards him) and he was thinking about breaking up with her. He highlighted that he didn't feel safe around her sometimes and that her extreme anger scared him. \n\nNow, I loved J to death. She was the oldest in our group by far and felt like an older sister to me. However, she *could* get scary. She was a very, very strong personality and I often found myself kind of walking on eggshells around her. So when A told me he was scared, crying in front of me, I told him I understood, and that I also sometimes felt scared around J. I calmed him down and a few hours later we both went home. \n\nThe next day I received a long hateful text from J, who told me that A had told her what I had said about her 'anger issues'. She told me that she didn't want anything to do with me ever again. I texted K, panicking, and he confirmed that he also didn't want to see me again. I met once with A, who apologized, but said he didn't dare say anything to J and that I just had to leave them all alone. He also confirmed that him and J were back together. I haven't seen any of them since. \n\nThis incident fucked me up for a good year, since I lost all my best friends. A few months ago I heard from a distant friend that J went into therapy after what happened and still tells people that I traumatized her. \n\nIt's been years and I don't understand. Was I TA? \n",

      "description": "So I have CRPS, I'm ok now. It's calmed down and I can walk properly with minimal pain. And this is important to the story\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened nearly... 9 months ago if my maths is correct. I was best friends with two girls, K and E. And they were a little off.\n\nSo K was a bitch, she didn't care about anyone really only herself. She would hit E hard and hurt her in emotional ways yet E would always run back. Not me however. I was a perfectly good student (still am) and she couldn't touch me as (I believe) she feared me. Not because of some stupid reason, I could defend myself pretty well and knew when to run and tell someone, so I was never harmed. I stopped being friends with K because she would hit E and I have been hit in friendships before and I'm not friends with any of them. I wouldn't stop K because I knew it would be the time I got hit. And also if E wanted to she could of told me and I would of told a teacher or worse my parents. Now my parents aren't scary when you get to know them, they're kind and treat all my friends like they're their children. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this story happened close to the end of the year, K had told E she didn't want to be friends anymore cause she would hurt her. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MANY MONTHS E CAME RUNNING TO ME CRYING. Ofcourse I comforted her because at the time I was happy that she came to me first. A lot of girls tried to reason with E about K but she wouldn't hear anything of it.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks E and K are back to being friends and I've stopped talking to them. GUESS WHO DID THE SAME SHIT AGAIN TO ME! E! Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. HA I didn't fall for it I did comfort her just icy. Then this school year. My CRPS is flaring and I was off school A LOT. K talked to me 'Hey you're off school a lot, CRPS?' 'yes.' I replied icy. According to my parents I can't help but be polite. But oh hell my voice was as icy as hell, I shoved past her into my tutor room (WHICH SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED IN) and sat down and talked to my friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a little stupid but still you can't blame me for being icy. K was a bitch and E was a backstabbing thing. There's more I Could talk about but this is fine",

One of the things that brought us together was being sassy but she takes it way to far. like we were out to dinner with a mutual friend last night and this friend said she can really handle spicy food. Which I get, abby then made a fb post about how she hates people who hate spicy food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nim sorry but how is that a thing? but she is always judging someone for something and i just (as lame as this is about to sound) do not want all that negative bullshit in my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmore over she does this thing where if im talking about my day whether good or bad she clearly doesnt care. She is always looking to talk about herself. If i text her about how a student was getting on my nerves or how i slipped in the parking lot she will give me a laughing face emoji then tell me about her day. and if I dont respond with a paragraph or something she then judges me for not being supportive. Then if i am getting on about something bad that happened to me she will have to one up it. Every time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlately she is just driving me up a wall and I am over it.

      "description": "So the fight started when I asked if he could spot me a beer. It was the Bone thugs N Harmony concert I've been dying to go see with my man, and I forgot my credit card at home. I told him I promised to pay him back tomorrow (the beer was $12- yikes at the concert prices, but still, we live together...I'd def pay him back). It cost me about $100 for our tickets, no problem tho, I was glad to get them for us. He rolls his eyes, mumbles something about waiting in the beer line and then agrees to go with. Beer line is dope, we can see the show, I'm dancing, having fun grinding on him when I turn around and hes just standing there, frowning. I knew It was me, I fucked up by asking for a beer and for him to spot me, move from his concert spot he picked to the line, etc. So I said to him \"baby are you ok?\" I get the usual \"Yeah it's just the beer is expensive and I hate this line and I don't know how to dance at hip hop shows and....(he continues on and on)\" Poor guy is not having a good time now, and, lets be real, its all about this beer and the beer line. He's pissed he's in it, and I feel guilty now that I got us stuck in it.  It was only like 4 people long, but he really did not like that beet line...anyways we are in and out of line and back and his lil spot he picked for the concert within like 15 min, so I'm drinking, I'm dancing on him, I turn around and hes just flat faced...not having a good time. I see couples in front of us dancing, slapping each others ass, kissing, hoot n hollering and having a good time and here I am trying so hard to get some energy going and hes just not feeling it....I don't get it. He loves hip hop. We both have been dying to see this show for ages..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe says it's because \"Why do you need beer? Why couldn't you just chill. It's so expensive here for beer, it's ridiculous. I'm pissed about it.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow before y'all think I'm just a gold digger let me just say 1.) I'm a nurse, he is a sandwich artist (but that doesn't matter about his character. He's actually a starving artist with painting murals...\n\n2.) I just bought him a brand spankin new Apple Watch 4 last month\n\n3.) Just bought him a spankin new MacBook Pro for his art career this week\n\n4.) I'm about to surprise him with a $3000 Disney 3 day get away Florida vacation for Christmas that I saved up for- He loves disney. \n\n5.) I paid for the concert tickets\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBUT he helps like he paid for the uber, buys us groceries when he can, etc. He is usually super sweet and loving. I just don't understand why this concert experience failed so hard.... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for asking for a beer? Was I being a princess or was he being a buzzkill? Why was he pissed BEFORE I asked for a beer? He said he was having social anxiety. Someone help me understand. If I was being high maintenance by asking for a beer then I feel bad about it. (I did pay him back today anyways, the $12, from our kitchen piggybank)",

I start to unpack the groceries and see there is only one small to medium-ish head of broccoli. I say “oh, I don’t have enough broccoli.” \nI didn’t say it annoyed or sassy, I said it matter of factly that I had made a discovery. \nHe says, “That was the biggest head.” \nI replied, “ok, but I said a lot, this isn’t a lot.” \nHe then goes off on me, raising his voice and saying things like “you do realize that no human on this earth hears a lot of broccoli and buys more than one head right?” \nHe says telling him I don’t have enough broccoli makes me the asshole because it’s a useless statement only “meant to be shitty” \nI disagree because I was trying to problem solve. \nI said it because 1) it’s seriously not enough broccoli for dinner so I either need help adjusting the recipe or I need more broccoli. \n2) because there was a miscommunication of how much broccoli to get, so I’m clarifying what I mean and what he needs to hear in order to fix that for the future. \n\nI have explained all of this to him and he maintains that ITA.

      "description": "  First off, I know what most commenters will say if I don't address this. Yes, I know how to take a joke, but this time I think he crossed the line.\n\nBackground info: We're both in highschool and we've been best-freinds for about five years now. If you were to compare our outside characteristics with cartoon characters, we would match Mordecai and Rigby (him being Mordecai and me being rigby) and this means he gets more attention from people for being Superior to me. I don't mind this much, but this detail is an important part of the story.\n  During lunch, we sit with three girls and another friend of ours. One of the girls we sit with has a thing for my best friend and vice-versa. I knew of this beforehand. (I was the only one who knew)\n\nFriend I called a dickhead: C\nGirl that has a thing for C: G\nMe: me\n\n  On with the story. We were at lunch, having a good time as usual. G and C start flirting, then C cracks a joke. I laugh like any person would. G laughs too, but when she's done, she starts laughing again. I asked her why, and she says \"you make the funniest laughing face ever\". C brutally elaborates by saying \"Yeah you look fucking retarded when you laugh\", but I brushed it off by saying \"Damn it really be like that sometimes\". This caught me off guard and not gonna lie, it kind of made me mad.\n\n  This is the embarrassing part. I have an underbite and a pretty large tongue, so I'm bound to spit sometimes when I talk. I don't spit that much when I talk, but C likes to point this out Everytime it happens. Me, G and C were having a conversation, and when I spoke to C, I accidentally spit on his thigh. It wasn't even that much either. I'd say a drop smaller than an ant landed on him. C raises his voice at me and tells me that I accidentally spit on him. I tell him I can't control it, but he proceeds to tell the whole group I spat on him. This is when I call him a dickhead.\n\n  When I call him a dickhead, he gets very offended and says \"bro what I didn't even do anything to you\" and I proceeded to tell him everything he's done to me the past week. (Yes, he's done a lot more to me than raising his voice at me.) After I gave him a list of times he was an ass to me, he tells me that I need to learn to take a joke. G tells me than I need to take a joke too, but I'm guessing they failed to realize that all they did to me for the last week was gang up on me and insult me every chance they get. I stay silent for the rest of lunch.\n\n  I love C, but he can get out of control with his \"jokes\". I consulted with our other friends about C's antics, and they all agree with me, but I still feel bad for calling C a dickhead. I may be too emotional, but I'm not sure. What I'm sure of is that I know people see me as inferior to him, which just made it hurt even more. I know that C was just trying to impress G, but he could've done it differently. \n\n  So AITA? ",

      "description": "A few days ago I had a second date with a guy, I went to his place and he cooked dinner. I have been vegetarian for 12 years (since I was 13 and because I like animals) and I guess it didn't come up on the first date. When I got to his place he told me he was making lasagne and I didn't say anything about me being vegetarian because he went to the effort of cooking for me and it seemed disrespectful and rude to refuse to eat it. So the date is going well and he tells me the lasagne is ready and we go sit down to eat it. I don't really feel comfortable eating it, but I would rather just do that instead of refusing. I had a few mouthfuls before I had to run to the bathroom to throw up. I don't know if it was because it had been so long since I had eaten meat or if it was because I felt so bad about eating it. I explained to the guy that I was vegetarian and just tried eating it to be polite but he got annoyed at me and told me to leave. I texted him to say I'm sorry and he said he overreacted but I still kind of ruined the date.\n\nAITA for trying to eat the meat?",

My friend, we'll call her Lara, is Canadian and came to our country to visit.\n\nShe could only visit one night and we decided to hang out, we split two bottles of tequila between 5 people. \n\nWe drank one bottle first and we all felt fine, then we asked Lara's mom if she could sleep over, the mom said no and Lara was extremely angry. Lara in anger decided to take a lot of shots consecutively.\n\nShe instantly got extremely drunk, started puking and couldn't stand up. Her dad came, picked her up and took her home.\n\nAn hour later her mom called us, she was fuming. You see, Lara has a cortisol deficiency and she takes some medicine to fix it. Apparently, this causes her alcohol intake to be three times as intense (please tell me if this sentence doesn't make sense). We didn't know this, but her mom called us assholes for letting her drink and for not assuming alcohol would affect her differently.\n\nTbh, things did get out of control, but I also feel that since Lara is over age she should be responsible enough to know her limitd or at least warn us about her condition.\n\nAITA?",

This is more annoying however. \n\nSo I told her today to stop doing it. Stop tagging me in her posts that have nothing to do with me. I’m not her husband. I’m not even that close of a friend. She got mad at me and said “I thought as a friend you would be happy for me. I thought you would see that I appreciate you as my best friend and support my relationship”.

      "description": "I come from a very conservative family. My parents are great people and I love them very much, but we definitely have different takes on certain topics. They hate tattoos and can be very discriminatory against people who have them. Unfortunately for them, I happen to really love tattoos. \n\nI am not heavily tattooed at all, but I do have a floral piece on my back/ shoulder that’s about 17cm long and a small wrist tattoo. Of course, my parents made a gigantic deal out of them when they first saw them and my dad told me how stupid I was for getting them because I looked trashy and dirty. He also told me that I was never gonna get a job, that ladies are not supposed to get tattoos and things along those lines. Quite hurtful, to be honest. \n\nI moved out of my parents’ house about 8 months ago to a different city where I have a great job and make much more money than I was making back home. My parents didn’t want me to leave, ever. They wanted me to pretty much stay home for the rest of my life unless I got married (which is definitely not on my plans).\nI recently came across a picture of a girl with a full sleeve. You can’t really see her face but her hairline and head look exactly like me. I thought it was a cool coincidence and really liked her tattoos so I set it as my whatsapp profile picture. No big deal. \nNot even an hour goes by and my mom is already bombarding my messages demanding I remove the picture. I told her it wasn’t me but she was still not having it. I said no and thought it was over with but apparently not. \n\nThe next day she sent me a message saying how much it hurts her and my dad to see that picture (even though they know it’s not me) because they can’t understand how I would like those kind of things. She also said my dad has been crying nonstop thinking about it. Thinking about an irrelevant profile picture. Of a girl with a tattoo. \nI understand they were raised in a different time where tattoos were not as accepted as they are now and I totally respect the fact that they don’t like them. But i like them and i am a grown woman. \n\nAITA for not removing the picture even though I know my parents get mad about it?",

      "description": "I suffer from bipolar disorder, and lost my meds when I moved in with my grandmother, mother, and two brothers. When I moved in, I lost my mood stabilizers when I moved out of state and no longer had Medicaid. My mother and brothers have been very understanding, all of them also having bipolar disorder. My grandmother, however, doesnt. Have been plagued by a near complete lack of appetite (eat every other day, some times just a bowl of cereal). I'd forget to eat until I'm too weak to stand and cook myself something one the stove. I had just turned 19 when I moved in with them (high school sweetheart didn't work out), and was immediately pressured to find a job. My room fell into a state of disrepair. \n\n\nCue grandma berating me for being lazy. She's just retired, entirely sane. She'd come out, call me a slob, useless, and a free loader, until I cried. I'd sit in the dark living room, sobbing to myself. My mother would comfort me, but made no attempts to stand up for me. some nights, I would text my friends across the country, crying and telling them now had it hurt. I eventually found a job. Things were better for a bit. The job was hard. Minimal pay, understaffed, abusive coworkers. My depression was still there. My room remained in shambles, I spent much of my free time trying to lift my own spirits. My grandmother took another jab, this time prompting me to go over the edge. Seriously considering suicide, I asked my mother to take me to the hospital. When my mom came in to ask if I needed to go, cue GM yelling at me to answer her. I went. I begged to be admitted, to give me a few days away from her. No such luck. They prescribed me $300 meds I couldn't afford. \n\nSeveral months later, the constant anxiety attacks were too much, I quit my job after six months of sobbing whenever a co-worker bullied me at work. The moment she found out, I was called a free loader. My mother told her why I had quit, and she just continued to yell. \n\nEnter stage left my father, divorcee parents meant I never knew him much. After hearing situation, he's offered to have me move to Texas and go to college. I hold off in finding another stress hole of a job and wait until texas. Just after Christmas became January 10th, which became February 1st, and now she's begun berating me for a job again, she told me today I needed to pay the $400 for my mudroom \"bedroom\" or I'll be on the streets. I was 150lbs when I moved in, I'm 120 now.\n\nI know I need to grow up. I was molested at 5 and 14, my mother believes the latter stunted my mental growth. It's hard for me to be responsible. I understand that she's trying to help me in her own twisted way, but making me want to die is only hampering my ability to do what she wants. \n\nTldr; my grandmother has been berating me for my laziness, caused by my depression/bipolar disorder.

Before doing this, we agreed that She would come to my house and live with me for the next summer.\n\nSince we’re a few months out we started planning, and she basically tells me that she hates it where I live and doesn’t want to come for an extended period of time and that the only option basically is for me to leave again and go to her.\n\nIt makes me upset and angry frankly that I left behind my family/friends/hobbies last summer to see her and now I’m not getting that same effort back.\n\nAm I the asshole for being angry about the situation?",

      "description": "Please read before judging. My girlfriend (18) and I (17) dated for a year and a half, before I broke up with her a little over a week ago. Now, I realize I am the asshole for how things ended. I broke up with her over text, as we were in the middle of a bad fight and I realized I couldn’t do it anymore. I just didn’t want to arrange a date just to break up, and I realize that was terrible. \nSo today, I took her to get dinner so that we could talk, and when I asked her what she had been up to she said “partying, hoeing, working, school, hoeing, partying.” And I said I was surprised that she had been physical with other guys so quickly. She said “I don’t know why that surprises you, but we don’t have to talk about it.”, then proceeded to mention him several times (“he drives a $50,000 truck, he’s LOADED” etc.), which I tried to ignore, until she said “I need to look for a prom date now, maybe I’ll see if daddy wants to go with me, except were not really a public type, if you know what I mean.” I immediately became distant, and went to the restroom, when I walked out, she was walking towards the door and said “oh we don’t have to leave”, to which I responded “you were the one walking out the door”. \nOn the way back to her house, she became very angry at me, telling me I had no right to be upset, etc. I explained that I was not upset about her being with other guys, but I would like her to keep it private. She became more angry, before we got to her house. \nI very angrily said “well I hope you have fun.”, and she said “Oh I will, I’ll have a ton of fun fucking ___”. I sped off and haven’t really talked to her since. AIRA for being upset? I feel like I am in my right to be upset with her for throwing it in my face, but would like more opinions. ",

      "description": "  \n\nThe character limit is killing me :D\n\nMy girlfriend (19f) and I (21m) have been in a really good relationship for over 1 and a half years. Currently I am on an exchange semester, I will stay here from the beginning of february to the end of June. We will not see each other apart from video calls during this time.\n\nOne month in, we were texting. In the transcript I’ll label her as GF and myself as I:\n\nGF: By the way, if you are feeling anything like me, you can make out with any girl, as long as you come back to me\n\nI: What? Are you completely out of your mind?\n\nGF: I am fully on withdrawal from you. No, I’m serious, it does not matter to me, as long as you come back to me in the end\n\nI: Do you need to confess something to me?...\n\nGF: No\n\nI: Then stop with this bullshit\n\nGF: Trust me, I’m being faithful, I even have my own Cockblocker (good friend)\n\nI: I hope so\n\nGF: I am happy with you, I do not need anyone else but I miss being close to you, the only person I’ve kissed since you are gone was (female friend of us)\n\nI: What kind of logic is that then?\n\nGF: My logic, I want you to feel good and that your missing nothing\n\nAnd then you aren’t all alone anymore\n\nI: If you think I’ll give you a free pass just because you offered me one, you are in the wrong, If I wanted to make out with anyone else, I’d be single and would not be mentioning you in any conversation I have\n\nGF: just so you know, I talk about you all the time too and even if you gave me a free pass like that, I would not do it because I’m feeling really happy in our relationship but I don’t want to force you to do anything that makes you feel bad when I’m not around \n\nI: Do you really think, just because we are separated for 4 or 5 months that I jump on everything that moves? Do you really think our relationship means that little to me?\n\nGF: no, but everyone has their needs, atleast I have our friends here, I’m not that alone here, I know that our relationship means a lot to you, that’s why I tell you you can do whatever you want, because I know that you will come back to me\n\nI: Yes I’m “alone” here, without my friends, family and you, but does that make you think I do that kinda shit?\n\nGF: I just wanted to give you the chance, I know that you love me and I love you, I never wanted to say anything that hurts you, I know you wouldn’t do something like that, but if it would help you get through those months, I just wanted to say that its OK for me\n\nI: So wrong in place\n\nGF: OK, I take it back, I’m sorry I just had it in my head and just wanted to say it, I’m really sorry and I love you\n\nI: Can’t take something like that back, said is said and now I’m in doubt\n\nGF: I don’t doubt you\n\nI: But I doubt you now\n\nGF: Are you serious? I do not do stuff like that\n\nI: Yes, I am fucking serious\n\nThat was yesterday and since then we haven’t talked to each other. I kind of lost some trust in her now and I’ve been thinking a lot about what the future will bring\n\nSo AITA for being mad at her?",

      "description": "I (28m) made my best friend (27m) end his friendship with me because I went to a holiday resort with my girlfriend for a day but haven't invited him to that resort before. He said its because in 15 years I have never invited him there. It is a resort that my dad has had a timeshare at since I was a child. \n\nI am not sure if I am allowed to post images on this sub, so I have copypasted the conversation from Whatsapp, verbatim, some edits to protect identity. This is to add context so you can judge if ITA fairly:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHim: How was your long weekend at &lt;resort&gt;? (In 15 years of friendship you have never invited me to &lt;resort&gt;)  \n\n\nMe: We were only there for one day. (You are rude).  \n\n\nHim: And you are a shitty friend. In 15 years you have never thought to invite me to &lt;resort&gt;  or organise a holiday and include me. But here we are still together in a dysfunctional and harmful and not really meaningful friendship. It shows how messed up we are.  \n\n\nMe: I haven't been to &lt;resort&gt; in 10 years, so yes, I didn't invite you in school. But school is a long time ago.  The only holidays I've been on since school are Zanzibar and Italy. And I invited you to Zanzibar. This is why I don't text you. You start fights when all I did was roadtrip for the day with my girlfriend just like you did this weekend with yours.  \n\n\nHim: Then don't message.  Carry on with your life. I can do better than having a crap friend like you. You are the most selfish and stingy person I have ever met.  Go get other friends because I don't need the one-sided friendship I have with you.  \n\n\nMe: I'm selfish because I don't invite you on holiday? You are petty.  \nMe: There was also &lt;other-resort&gt; which  I organised.  So I did &lt;other-resort&gt; and invited you to Zanzibar.  \nMe: So I haven't \"never thought to organise a holiday or invite you\". You are full of shit.  \nMe: Of the 3 holidays I've been on since school, you've been included in 66% of them  \n",

It gets on my nerves !\n\nSo I tell them I died. \n\nWhen I pick up the phone and they ask \"Mr. [my name] ?\", I make up a story about how I died, and I'm my own son here to deal with the funeral or something.\n\nSometimes they apologize and hang up, but sometimes, they keep trying to sell me shit ! Yet thanks for this technique, I've been getting a lot less calls.\n\nMy girlfriend says she's not so sure about doing this, because it might come back to bite me in the ass one day, and also because sometimes, telemarketers are just young minimum wage workers who're trying to make a living. I guess she has a point, but I also don't think I'm doing something unjustified. The polite way just doesn't work !\n\nWhat's your opinion, reddit ?",

      "description": "There is some back story to it. Im an expo and I work with all males in a kitchen. I come in early and set up the line and get whatever we need for the day besides on my 2 days off. My coworker comes in at 12 and just had 3 days off because he \"needs\" it. Well hes always trying to tell me HOW to cut the things we need and how to wrap the stuff we need always with a heavy attitude like I have been doing it wrong, even though im the only one who does prep for our work station. Anything I say too , he sees it and tries to 1 up me. I told someone else I speak a little bit on spanish and he comes up and starts telling us about how he had a massive road trip with his friends to Mexico. He is also currently \"hanging out\" with a front of house manager that dosent like me and has treated me differently than him in the past.\n\nOn to the part where I walked out. Im doing my job at first alone as always. It gets busier at the hour he comes in and we are now in a rush. I accidently sent out a plate that had sweet potato fries instead of regular fries and he just starts telling the server its my fault like he always does. I didnt care becuase it was that time but I overhear him blame other stuff on me when im right around the corner all the time. He just starts counteracting almost everything I say because I guess he came in on a bad mood ? I started plating another tray and he starts getting mad at me because he said to start on the ticket thats first... but I was on the next ticket and while i was trying to explain what simple shit I was doing, I just got so frustrated and went to the back to prep since he thinks he can do it all himself. Well. 5 minutes go by and he starts shouting at the top of his lungs my name because he needs me out there. While im back there crying/prepping, i had to go back out there and help him JUST FOR THE SAKE of the whole dining room. I only did it to not mess up service anymore. I know what I did was wrong to innocent customers, getting their food out later and what not but I just cant take this guy treating me like this anymore. I try my best at my job and i tried my best working with him but i cant go everyday with him belittling me and we have already had a talk with the boss about his behavior towards not just me but also other coworkers since he always mumbles under his breath how slow they are. Tbh i dont think my other coworkers are slow, he is just impatient and dosent want to look bad to the servers since most of them are girls i guess. Idk. AITA ? \n\nP.s. I did get a talk from my boss that it did mess up the line when I did that. I knew that when it happened, i just didnt care at the time, he put me in tears at that point. \n\nTLDR . My coworker is a douche to me because I think he wants to be seen as the main expo or the \"good\" one or something ?? Idk hes really rude to me and my coworkers so i walked out during service during a busy time and he got screwed.",

I used company software to look up information on my girlfriend and her family (It's not illegal to do this the software is available to civilians for a price). and I found out this man she is hanging out with is actually her brother and he goes by a different name presumably for protection. I recall hearing her talk about a book where \"male heirs\" are hidden from the public and she mentioned that Kim Jong Un was a hidden heir that no one knew about until he ascended to power. All of these conversations came back to me and I was slightly relieved she wasn't cheating but now i'm just more paranoid about why this family needs to hide a \"male heir\" to begin with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for finding out this information? should I tell her I know?",

      "description": "Kind of long story ahead\n\nSo, I’m not super close with this person (who we’re going to call S (20M)) but my super close best friend is and I used to be close with this person.\n\nSo S is not a actively bad person. He believes that cheating is bad. However, heres a little bit of background.\n\nHe was in a two year relationship with this girl and she was just the worst. They did not click physically/sexually and she basically belittled him and abused him emotionally. S wasnt used to attention though, so when they first started dating he got roped into the idea that she would be the only one that ever likes him. Really toxic stuff.\n\nSo S graduates and gets to college and meets this girl (we’ll call her M (19F)) and they hit it off really well. She openly says she has a boyfriend (one shes dated for like 3-4 years) but I guess M and S hit it off to well. They start a friends with benefits situation without M’s boyfriend knowing. \n\nAt this point, my best friend and I obviously object but S has never felt this kind of “real love” before so he keeps going with her. However, hes starting to feel guilty, He keeps telling her its either me or him, we cant keep this going forever. M tells him some sob story every time though about how “her boyfriend is mean” and “she loves S” but she just cant leave her bf. S and our lil friend group are starting to see her sob stories for what they are and S comes to the conclusion that she probably wont leave because she just wanted something new and fun while keeping the comfortable aspect of having a really long relationship with said boyfriend.\n\nS finally gives the ultimatum and she of course picks her boyfriend. Although S is heartbroken, he sticks to his word this time and cuts it off.\n\nHeres the thing: Should someone in our group, maybe even S, tell her boyfriend he literally got cucked for half a year? I cant imagine thats safe for their sexual health if shes sleeping around with other dudes, plus theyve been together so long doesnt he have the right to know? A lot of people have said that my best friend and I shouldnt butt in, but I think our friend S would do it with some encouragement. And I would hate to know that the person Ive dated for so long literally cheated and no one told me cause “they didnt want to be in someone else business”. Cheaters should be shamed imo, and since S is willing to fess up then shouldnt M get exposed?",

      "description": "Throwaway since they also have reddit accounts and im not sure if they follow this subreddit. Im also on mobile so i apologize for the outline and any errors.\n\nSome background:\nIm 18, living in a boarding school in germany surrounded by only a few, very small, cities. I found a two friends and we get along great. Im from berlin and I’ve been at international schools my whole life. This is my first time being at a ‘german only’ school though, theres a lot of Chinese international students (they have grown thick skin towards racism, sadly).  The other students make jokes in class as well, the teachers don’t say anything either and when i spoke up, the international students told me i shouldn’t bother.\n\nSince my friends are from smaller towns where theres only (white) germans, they have not been exposed to other cultures unlike me. But they have been incredibly rude about it. They make a lot of asian jokes though im not sure why they target them specially. They make jokes about the int. kids in class, the language, saying stuff like ‘uhh they all look the same etc.’ When I call them out, they only do it more, saying i have no sense of humor.\n\nI have a Korean boyfriend (we’re LDR) and when he came to visit, I had to make them promise that they won’t make any racist jokes (he’s been bullied for being asian and would’ve left straight away.)\n\nTheir insensitivity is starting to get on my nerves. They eat at asian restaurants all the time but when it comes to the culture they drag it through the mud.  I enjoy being with them and since my school is small, if id stop hanging out with them id be alone and it’d be very hard to avoid them. The other students would also see me as some little bitch who can’t take a joke.\n\nI’ve tried to make them open up a bit by showing them some things like J/Kpop and tried to convince them to watch (thai, korean etc. )movies with me but they say that they don’t care for it. I know i can’t force them to like it but Im not sure how i should continue. My boyfriend doesn’t even want to visit me anymore after i told them about how insensitive they are (may have been a mistake on my part). Ive actually called them out before, saying that their behavior is extremely xenophobic and racist but they laugh it off. \n\nThey’re both very pessimistic and arrogant at times which is annoying but I cant change that. It bothers me though that they know that im uncomfortable with this and that they would willingly make my bf uncomfortable as well. \n\nNow, WIBTA if I cut them off or just flat out yell at them for how awful they’re being, which is making me want to stop being friends with them?

      "description": "(Trigger Warning: Self harm, abuse, suicide, that kind of thing)\n\nFor context, me and my friends are fairly young, all around 15. We all have bad or incredibly strict parents, so we’re all dealing with our own issues in some way, and we have no real way to get help.\n\nOne friend, who we’ll say is called Luke, is the worst. They have massive self-worth issues, self-harms, drinks beer all the time, falls in and out of toxic relationships, and is, quite honestly, selfish. They never listen, and they never want to.\n\nI’ve yelled at Luke over text multiple times about what they do. When they wanted to get back with their ex, I basically said “Fine, go be destructive, I don’t care anymore, but don’t come crying to us when it doesn’t work out.” I’ve constantly told them that I don’t care because I’m just so emotionally exhausted from dealing with them. I mean, why should I bother or care?\n\nThe scary thing is that Luke’s been constantly saying that they’re going to commit suicide this year. And I mean CONSTANTLY. Every few days it’s been brought up, and in a kind of way that’s like “ha ha I only have a few months to live anyway lol”\n\nWe’re all worried about them, but it just feels...manipulative, at this point. Like it’s just another way for them to get attention. (They glorify their alcoholism and show when they sniff GLUE, for God’s sake.) \n\nThere’s about eight of us altogether, and we see each other at school everyday, so cutting Luke off is probably not going to be as easy as I want it to be. But I’m just so fucking tired of dealing with them. I’m already working through my own stuff. I have awful self-esteem, I’m dealing with getting over my toxic dad, and I likely have ADHD. If they’re not even going to THINK about getting help, I don’t see why I should bother.\n\nI don’t want to deal with Luke anymore but there’s also my other friends, and I keep feeling like that would just be abandoning them because of my own emotional issues.\n\nSo, do you think WIBTA if I cut Luke off?",

      "description": "Have to keep things vague because some of the people in this story use reddit and browse this sub quite frequently.\n\n\n\n\nAs background info: there is a life long friend of mine and she has been dating this guy for a year and a half. She is a very insecure person and she often demeans what she does to try and make it seem less impressive. She has recently come to me and told me some problems in their relationship. Though I have never met the guy, she gives me a lot of details about their relationship. So based on her info, I gave her some advice on what she needs to do.\n\n\n\n\nWell recently I have developed feelings I have been repressing for a while now and it's hitting with full force. I haven't been in many 'strong amd serious' relationships in the short time I have been dating. While, she has been in multiple relationships and she always confides in me.\n\n\n\nNow, recently she has expressed some concerns of her bf possibly cheating and hadn't expressly told me her fears yet. She has told me about him having attractive girls on insta and snapchat who she didn't know. When she asked about them he closed up.\n\n\n\nNow her boyfriend is about 2 years ahead of both of us in terms of age and grade. So, I don't really have a lot of experience being a college student. BUT, I do have a coworker who is about 3 years ahead of me and so I ask him on his thoughts on the relationship and what he believes is happening. He tells me that he believes that with how young the guy is and the college that he is attending he is probably cheating.\n\n\n\n\nEarlier today, when talking to my life long friend she brought up her concerns directly and asked for my opinion on the situation. I try to be an honest guy and give my limited knowledge on the situation and then tell her that a friend who is more experienced in that kind of situation believes that he might be cheating.\n\n\n\n\nShe has flipped out on me and has told me that I shouldn't tell anyone about her relationship or what she confides in me to anyone. Though I didn't give any revealing information about her or her bf just very general information. Then my coworker made his best judgement based on the limited info.\n\n\n\nAm I an asshole for asking for relationship advice?",

And here’s where things took an ugly turn, I called the seller and she told me she can’t file the delivery and that I should check for someone who could do that for me, also the prices are high, my parents started to nag me and say how I was irresponsible and that I should’ve cancelled the order, I replied that I was just doing what they told me and that I informed at every step the status of the transaction and that I didn’t feel comfortable taking choices about their money without consulting them first, they keep telling me how I was the one to blame about all this.\n\nWas I the asshole for not doing a major choice on money that wasn’t mine?",

      "description": "This is probably going to be a long one.\n\nI'm a commercial cleaner, I absolutely love my job, it was perfect up until last Thursday. I work on a team with my best friend (Jay), and my boyfriend (Dee), how could it get any better right? Jay has been a close friend for about 6 years and I have been seriously dating Dee for 9 months now.\n\nWe drive to 6 accounts on Thursdays, since my car has been down a little over a month now, Dee has been picking us (Jay and I) up from our house. Obviously Jay and I live together and Dee lives about 20mins away from us. \n\nHere is where it gets interesting, my boyfriend has a decent car, the outside could use some TLC but the interior is immaculate. Dee is a genius when it comes to wiring, so as well as having an awesome sound system he also has the video display up front and we can watch movies on the way to our accounts. \n\nJay has been struggling a bit with his alcoholism, he doesn't always drink on the job but occasionally he does, I dont judge as long as you get your work done, keep the liquor out of the accounts, and of course dont break anything. He has worked the better part of the last 6 months with no issues so I had no issue. \n\nThis day though I could see signs that he had a little too much, and I told him, you're cut off from this point. He wasn't happy but obliged, or so I thought. \n\nJay asked my boyfriend for his car keys so he could fetch a cleaner we forgot to grab from the car, goes outside and is unseen for 10 minutes, I go out and he is still in the car looking for the cleaner... it was on the floor where we told him it was. In the same back seat he was just sitting in, but for some reason he is sitting in the front driver seat. \n\nFast forward to us finishing up the account and leaving, I am the last out because I have alarms to set. I get in the car and see my boyfriend pick up a cigarette that had been set on the dashboard after probably 2 hits and burned down to the filter... We both look at the dash to see a nasty melted gouge. Dee asked Jay if he was smoking in the front seat of the car... No was the response he got. We both look at the cigarette and sure enough Marlboro on the filter, (Dee smokes Newports and I dont smoke at all) Jay smokes marlboros. He asked again, this isn't your MARLBORO cigarette that burned up on my dash? Again no. \nAt this point Dee is so angry he asks Jay to get out the car and ride with another team member to our last account. Jay exits and we sit for a second to take in the situation. \n\nDee is furious, I get it, he is trying to sell his car, the interior had no damage up until this point. I try talking him down and eventually he does, although he does not want my friend back in his vehicle without an apology or the cash to replace the dash. Not so unreasonable, well Jay decides he is going to avoid Dee, I get it, Dee is pissed. \n\nFast forward again, time to go, I was under the impression my other team member would take Jay home, he had messaged me on fb and said he would either ask or uber home. Come to find out he walked an hour and a half home despite the options he had. To add to this he posted on snapchat about how he has to walk home because people are \"childish\" and \"petty\". I am pissed when I find this out, because I find out later from my boss and another coworker. \n\nWhen Dee and I leave I saw Jay had left his food in the car...or rather in my boyfriend's daughter's car seat directly, and the plate on the floor, I try to hastily clean it up but no, Dee saw it and he came to the back seat to look for more, and starts pulling empty marlboro packs, Naked juice bottles, wadded up paper towel used to clean up some kind of red spill and more garbage from under the seat. These are obvi from my best friend because as I have said before neither of us smoke Marlboros and I know my boyfriend doesn't drink Naked. At this point there is nothing I can do to make Dee reconsider Jay riding with him.\n\nNow I have Jay telling me over Facebook messages that he will make his own way to work. \n\nOk then.\n\nOn Friday we started a brand new account, so both of my bosses as well as the regional leader is with us. I get to work with Dee and my boss asks where Jay is, I told her what he told me, he was making his own way, then I hear about the snapchat posts, personally I dont use snap but when I was shown the snaps I wanted to snap. My boss calls him and he states we just left him. Now I'm really pissed. My boss leaves to go get him and I tuck my anger down for a later conversation with my best friend. \n\nUnfortunately we had no time to hash things out right away so I figured at the next account we would sit down and talk. No dice, he asks my boss to take him BACK home, completely behind my back, to the point that I didnt know he was leaving until I got to the next account. I message him asking why he would do this, he tells me he's not getting in between me and my boyfriend, I told him this is not the case, there is nothing I can do for him concerning Dee and his car and how he should've come to him as a man and apologize. Jay goes on about how important Dee is to me and how this isn't my problem and he will do what he has to do from this point. I said yeah Dee is important to me, but so are you so man tf up and talk to this man before he decides he doesn't want an apology anymore.\n\nThe whole weekend goes by and Jay says nothing to me, we live in the same house yet had no interaction, so when today rolls around I do what I always do, get my things together and wait for Dee to call me and say he is here. When I leave I see Jay's room has no light and did not see him elsewhere in the house so I assumed he was already gone and leave. Minutes after leaving, I get a text saying how he wanted to apologize and how could we just leave him behind...\n\nThis is where I snapped, I told him straight up that I didnt even know he was in the house and if he really wanted to apologize to Dee he would've either asked me for his contact info over the weekend or been on point watching for him to pull into the driveway. Personally if it were me and my job on the line I wouldn't have bothered with shoes I would've gotten out there to speak my peace. He gets sassy with me about his walk home, and I told him he walked home because he wanted to, he could've just as easily apologized or asked the other team member (she was actually pissed he didn't ask her). I told him straight up that his priorities were screwed up and he needs to grow up and take responsibility for his choices, and that people aren't going to wait around to hold his hand through things. \n\nThen I started in on his snapchat posts I was getting hounded about by our office gossips who were trying to get all the juicy details of the story...\n\nI asked him if Dee was petty for bringing him to work everyday without asking for gas money or even getting a thank you in return, yes he comes for me because I'm his girlfriend but in all reality he doesn't have to bring my friend too. Was my boyfriend petty every time he made pit stops so you could get your cigarettes or liquor, or take you to the store? I got no answers to this question, so I told him I wasn't going to be a member of his pity party. He states he didn't want a pity party, and I told him obvi you want pity cause you asked for it all over snapchat where our co workers can see and continue to message me about. \n\nI'm not sorry for telling him to grow up and be a man (hes 32) but I do wonder if I am an asshole in this.\n",

      "description": "When me and GF met being a book nerd was a big part of her identity. She read regularly and even volunteered at her local library. As an avid reader my self, it is one of the things that attracted me to her. Fast forward a year and a half or so later and I can't even remember the last time I saw her reading a book. \n\nA username of hers came up in conversation, and the username references her being a book nerd. I pointed out that she doesn't read anymore and therefore is not a book nerd, and shoud make a different username. She defended herself saying that she is still a book nerd because she regularly listens to audiobooks. I tried to explain to her that this is not the same, because listening to something doesn't take as much brain power as reading it does. Audiobooks are like the cheap easy version of a real book. I don't thinks someone who *listens* to bools can classify themselves as a *reader*. I even told her I felt she was some what dishonest when we first started dating since she made it seems like books were so important to her, but now she doesn't read at all. She got mad at me and said I'm pretentious and a \"paper snob\". ",

      "description": "First post so go easy on me.\nI am an adolescent boy who currently struggles with many mental difficulties.(Depression, autism, ADHD. Just to name a few.) This causes me to severely unmotivated and become very abrasive to people. Other times this can cause me to not want to go outside and socialize with people. My mother on the other hand is a very extroverted, motivated and tenacious person and so is my sister. Needless to say this can cause multiple problems and arguments in the home. For example, my mother often likes to out for a meal and enjoy time with friends. I detest this and this caused conflict, a few weeks ago, which ended up with her and my sister crying and calling me an asshole, and today, we finally hit boiling point. I have a lock on my door for personal reasons, essentially my privacy was constantly being invaded and I hated that. So today, I was having one of my moments and didn't want to work or talk to anyone really. This caused my mother to get incredulously angry and she attempted to kick down my door, after I opened it, I tried to explain what was going on and that I would appreciate a break from work today. She wasn't having it and she started screaming and getting very angry and claiming that I was guilt-tripping her into being lazy. I reminded her that the last time she acted like this, I was in hospital for two months. She then proceeded to storm off in a crying mess. This has me wondering if I was in the wrong.\n\nThank you for reading.   ",

      "description": "So recently I’ve taken on a second (side) job. It’s essentially a consulting job that could lead to a full time permanent position if it goes well. What it does mean though is that my free time\nIs now limited. After putting all work aside Thursday to spend quality time with the husband for Valentines. Ignoring my work Friday to hang out with my husband and friends. And putting it off Saturday to attended a family funeral, and again spend time with my husband, I had a few hours window today to buckle down and get stuff done. \n\nAfter a few interruptions, I was finally making progress when the mother in law rang. She asked that myself and my husband be at her house in 30 minutes to go and pick up something for our new kitchen. I was quickly trying to finish up my work with my husband moaning about why I wasn’t ready.  When I did manage to finish it, I ran upstairs to get changed, so we could rush out the door. While I was getting ready, husband came upstairs and tried to hug me. I pushed him away and explained that I didn’t really have time, and that I was already in a rush and abandoning my work to go help out with something that he could be doing by himself. \n\nHe lost it. Said that it was ridiculous that I didn’t have time to hug him. And said that I have a habit of rejecting him. \n\nI explained that he often does not respect my need for time or space to myself and that his constant need for affection and attention is putting a strain on both my work and my mood. I have given him nothing but my solid attention for 3 days, and when i need just a few hours to do some work, he gets upset that I’m “rejecting him”.  \n\nI know he just wanted a hug, but for me it’s not the point. He could see I was rushing around to fit everything in, did nothing to help this, and acted like a petulant child when he couldn’t get 10 seconds of my attention. \n\nAITA here?",

      "description": "I recently got into a fight with my friends because of my texts that ask them if they want to do something during the weekend. According to them I do this way to often and “need to stop living between 4 walls”\n\nI will admit that I ask this question a lot (once every 1 or 2 weeks). However, asking them is literally the only way I can get company to come with me since nobody else ever takes the initiative.\n\n**Case in point:** A couple of years ago I came across two friends on public transport, one of them tells me; “I’m free to do something the last weekend of the month.” I say ok, and we exit our stops. I decide that I won’t ask them anymore since I now know that at least someone The week arrives; Friday comes, Saturday passes and Sunday is about to end without a word. So I give a call asking what’s the deal. The response: “We already went out, but you didn’t let us know anything.” And then a discussion unfolded into a he said she said situation where they claimed they told me in the public transport that they were going out that Sunday.\n\nI have a difficulty starting conversations and connecting with people in my free time, making it so that every time I go out alone I basically stay alone. Despite this I still try to go out alone every month because I prefer to be around people as opposed to sitting alone in my apartment.\n\nThere is also a big divide for me between my school life and private life. Basically, when I’m in school I’m 100% business and find it difficult to talk with my fellow students about things other than the assignments we’re currently working on together.\n\nAll my friends have fulltime jobs at the moment, while I’m the only one who is in higher education. So I can understand that they are busy. But every time I get to hear stories how they went with another group to that bar or did this and that.\n\nI also understand that people have their own lives and that the world doesn’t revolve around me. So when my friends tell me they’re spending time with their girlfriends, have to work or are going to travel then, I ask them if they’d be free after that. Generally answered with; I don’t know.\n\nAm I really the unreasonable one here for wanting to spend time with the people I do know in the only way I know that works? ",

      "description": "I am mid 30s and my sister is a handful of years younger. To make a long story short, my sister has been a drug addict and liar for many years. My parents never believed me but I kept telling them. Last year she got pregnant from a guy that already has a few kids he doesn't care about. I was mad but my parents wanted to be supportive so they threw her a baby shower. She showed up, 8 months pregnant,  looking like a heroine addict. It was obvious she was high. \n\nSo that caused huge blowup because my  parents couldn't understand why I didn't want to see her and be supportive. \n\nShe and the guy decided to hide in a secret location during most of the pregnancy. Never once went to the doctor. When the baby was born the baby tested positive for Meth and some other things. Obviously they took it from her.\n\nMy parents wanted me and my significant other to take the baby and care for it (long term)but we weren't in the right place and I said no. Also knowing that my sister would always be in the picture played into it. \n\nMy parents ended up with the baby.  State was fine with my sister being around she just couldn't be alone with the baby. The state put a plan into place, including drug tests and therapy. My sister and the guy intead left, for 5 months. \n\nShe came back 5 months later, pregnant again. \n\nI don't want anything to do with her and my parents are holding it against me. I wasn't invited to Thanksgiving, and hardly ever get calls or texts. It's obvious they are mad that I wouldn't adopt the baby then are mad that I won't accept my sister back into my life.\n\nAm I the asshole guys?",

Frequency wise, I like to hug him occasionally when we're having a conversation that I think a hug is appropriate (e.g. when I'm congratulating him, expressing thanks, consoling him). He likes to hug me ALL the time. I will be in the middle of doing something and he will try to grab me. It's worse in the mornings when I'm tired, late and I just want to get from a to b, he just stands in my path trying to grab me for a hug. \n\nI again brought this up with him last night, this time with more forceful vocabulary. \n\n\"You touch me so much and so often it makes me want to touch you less. I feel like I'm developing a phobia of being touched.\"\n\nUsually whenever I try to stop him from touching me so much I say \"stop touching me!\", he asks what's wrong, I tell him nothing's wrong just sometimes I don't like being touched. He then pouts and I have to go give him a hug anyway.\n\nAnyway, it turned into a huge thing, he went straight to bed not wanting to talk to me and this morning when I got up to make him breakfast before work he was still in a bad mood. \n\nAm I the Asshole here who needs to learn how to act a bit more...human?\n\n",

We decided about a week ago, that i would come over the next day after my work, spend the night with her and then leave tomorrow in the late morning. This is where our fight started.\n\nA well friend of mine, who recently moved to another city, decided to celebrate her upcoming birthday back home. She told me about her birthday plans about two weeks prior, which i totally forgot up until maybe three hours ago, when she reminded me and told me about where and when the party would take place. \n\nSo heres my issue: I really want to attend that party, since there are also a lot of old friends coming back for the weekend who i‘ll be seeing for the first time in a couple of months. My gf however, does not get along with them all that well and also wasnt invited. She insisted i spend the evening, as originally planned, with her and not attend that party. I said No. Just like that, she got pretty mad and basically kicked me out.\n\nSo, AMITA for preferring a birthday over a night with my gf?\n\nAlso, apologies for any grammar/spelling mistakes, not a native speaker.",

      "description": "I had a fight with my friends and I honestly am not sure if I'm in the wrong. So for context I'm a guy who is in a friend group of all females. We met in freshmen year of college in NoCal (North California) in 2013 and have been pretty close for the most part. I got into a toxic relationship that pulled me away from this group but we were able to slowly rekindle a few years later: I'll explain later why that's important to the story. So one of the girls in the friend group, who I'll refer to now on by M, graduated early and was living in SoCal. I have driven down to LA on several occasions to visit M and I had brought another friend in this group, A, down with me before once. I never charge A for the ride, just to split the gas and the driving time. A is a very strong-willed kind of girl. She's normally a nice and caring person who doesn't put up with bs or drama. Really down-to-earth. A and I have been pretty close but in my eyes things were never romantic. My gf and I were very on and off and I kind of liked A, but A always mentioned that her taste in guys is different than me and has told me on multiple occasions I'm not her type even though I've never hit on her. M as well as other friends always would push me to ask her out but it never felt appropriate. No one in the group like my previous relationship and would try to ship me and A even tho both of us made it clear we're not into each other that way. The reason I'm saying this because I think it has to do with A's behavior towards me. A used to be very nice to me and  always a little condescending but I invited that with my crass and immature behavior. However in the last few years of our relationship her attitude towards me became extremely hostile. While others in the group would groan/chuckle at my jokes, A would scoff very curtly and coldly. I would always try to brush off this behavior as a joke but it got to the point that A would never smile or laugh at anything I say and would go out of her way to let me know she disproves of my behavior. When others exhibited the same behavior as me A wouldn't mind it at all, it only seemed directed towards me. It was so bad that I would sheepishly confront A asking \" A, did I do something to upset you\", \"if I did something wrong, I'm sorry\" but these comments were usually ignored with A rolling her eyes at me. I didn't want to make much of it so I always quickly dropped the subject. A was planning to move far away so M suggested that we visit her before A leaves and we all agreed. I drove 3 hours through traffic to get to A's home and pick her up and the drive down to LA was mostly uneventful. Its usually around other people that A's attitude towards me greatly degenerates. She constantly shot down every comment, joke, or suggestion I make while talking as a group. M would see this as a joke and join her but M would always smile and laugh just to let me know that this is all in good fun. Which is fine, I joke like that as well. Its just that with A it seemed like it wasn't a joke and that she just hated me. I confronted A again on this behavior in a sheepish manner since I don't like making drama and again she blew me off. Eventually it got to the point where I decided it wasn't a joke and decided to ignore A as much as I can for the remainder of the trip. THE JUICY BIT: The last day of the trip, A, M, and I were at a restaurant. M acted childish and was throwing chips at me. I joked back by pretending to mention to the people sitting behind me that chips were landing there. A as usual reprimanded me for my behavior. I asked A \"why not say anything to M\" and A said \"You should be consider yourself lucky that I so tolerant of you.\" Flabbergasted I told her \"why even bother tolerating me\". She then warned me \" I may not go back to NoCal with you if you keep up this behavior.\" I'm thinking to myself that I drove us down in my car and I went out of my way to take her to her house and everything with little thanks. So I responded saying \"why make it a warning, lets make it a reality; I don't want you(A) coming back with me.\" I rarely ever get angry but when I do I don't hide it but I didn't raise my voice. I was very stern though and the group realized I was very upset.\" The table went quiet and M tried to alleviate the situation with some joke but A and I both stopped talking. I drove A and M back to M's house and announced to M's family I'll be leaving. A started packing and I reiterated \"you're not welcome to come back with me.\" A acted shocked and asked \"are you serious,\" which I confirmed. I drove off still fuming in anger. After about an hour of discussing this matter to my gf (same from toxic relationship but we worked out a lot of our problems) convinced me to drive back and give A a ride as i shouldn't leave her like that. A and my gf hate each other and my gf saw this as an opportunity to take the moral high ground for both of us. I didn't agree, but regardless I called M letting her know I was driving back if A still wanted a ride. M let me know that A is taking a bus back and doesn't need to the ride. I never communicated my problems with A to the rest of the group since I didn't know how serious it was until too late so they probably just see me as a monstrous asshole. What do you guys think? UPDATE: A has yet to tell the rest of the friend group and we're planning a group skype so idk what to do.",

      "title": "AITA for leaving after waiting to pick up my girlfriend for 30 minutes?",
      "description": "My girlfriend had dance practice at a place about a 10-15 minute walk, 3 minute drive from her apartment. I drove her there and dropped her off. She told me to come pick her up at 5 at her second dance practice about a 10 minute walk from the first one. \n\nAt 2 i get a message on my computer (my phone is dead and fucked up, it takes hours to come alive again) to come pick her up. I'm confused since her second practice isn't done til 5 but i tell her my phone is dead and I'm coming now and I'll be at the same place I dropped her off. Important note: my girlfriend is never late to things. If she says she will be somewhere at a certain time she is always there. When she says to pick her up, she's either already waiting or in the process of leaving.\n\nI get there and she is not there. I wait for around 30 minutes, still not there. I borrow someones phone and call her. No answer. I text her and tell her I'm waiting then give the person their phone back. As I'm sitting in the car I'm thinking of all the scenarios that could explain why she isn't there. \n\nI arrive at two: Her second practice was cancelled and for some reason she walked/got a ride back to her apartment. In this case she would be locked out of her apartment since I have her keys and I need to go let her in. Or, she got a ride with a friend or walked to the second practice. If she was still at the first practice and was being held up I assume she would come outside real quick and tell me to wait. \n\nSo I leave probably around 6-7 minutes after I texted her from some random persons phone. I get back to her apartment and message her from my computer and shes asking where I am. Apparently she came out very soon after I left. \n\nShe got the call but didn't pick up since she didn't know who it was. She responded to the text but I wasn't going to hold onto someone's phone waiting for her to answer so I didn't see it.\n\nShe had to stay after practice for some reason and is mad that I didn't wait longer and she's going to be late to her second practice which she wanted me to drive her to. Usually she would get a ride from a friend but she had to stay after. She says my reasons for leaving don't make any sense and that she always keeps her word and would never leave without telling me. I would agree with that which is why I was so confused that I was waiting for 30 minutes.\n\nAm I in the wrong here? I was fully expecting her to be waiting outside her door when I got back, I didn't want her to be waiting there in case she left and was already there.",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting anything to do with my girlfriend's new friends that she made during the time my mum died?",
      "description": "I know that the title may seem obvious, but I think it needs some explanation. My girlfriend was on a 7 week work trip. It is essentially a training camp where new recruits get up to speed on their company's products. 7 intense weeks of training and exams while living out of a hotel with 12 other people. Prior to this my mum was having health problems, but nothing that seemed majorly concerning. 3 weeks into my girlfriend's trip I went to visit her but had to come home after 2 days as I was told my mum's health had deteriorated and she only had a few days to live.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week after I got home my mum passed away the day after her 60th birthday, this was all in mid-October 2018. Two days later my girlfriend was on a scheduled trip with the friends she'd made prior to me even coming out there. During this I was obviously at a real low point, she was sending me pictures and I was finding myself very angry and resentful. It didn't seem fair that she was having a great time while I suffered, but I struggled to communicate that I needed a lot more words of support. I think, as we were long distance, she thought the contact was enough. She sent me some lovely, heartfelt things but a lot of the time while she was out there I'd just get an update of her day and how great their night was, when what I probably needed was a text just saying, 'We're all out, but thinking of you at this horrible time.' I don't want to paint her in too negative a light, I think anyone would find it difficult in any situation but the distance made it so much harder for her to be there for me and while I found it tough, I didn't communicate how I was feeling at all well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat this did mean is that before she made it back from the trip, I was getting a lot of pictures of all these really tight friends she's made. She's constantly texting them and I could tell she was really sad to leave, I'd imagine they've really helped her as it must have been tough to be away while I was going through something horrible. I'm in the UK and they're all from different part of Europe so they're not local.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the first weekend of January they're all coming to stay and my girlfriend has offered to host them and to be honest, I want nothing to do with them. She'll have 3 of these friends in our flat for a whole weekend and I don't want to spend a minute with them. I'm found I'm a bit consumed with irrational jealousy and just a dislike of these people, even though I've never met them. My girlfriend is actually understanding of this and even cancelled an opportunity to meet with one of them one on one after I explained how I'm feeling.  I just associate them with such a horrendous and lonely time in my life that I just want to escape the weekend they're here and not be around but I'm not sure if that's sensible for myself or fair on my girlfriend. Seems I may be being an asshole by making this even harder on my girlfriend.",

      "title": "AITA for not paying $40 for my boyfriends party",
      "description": "A little context. I live with my boyfriends parents and my boyfriends party was yesterday on the 18th. I have planned early and decided to buy him his gifts almost two months in advance because I have been out of work since November due to an injury. I have had to find ways to come up with rent to be on time. However this set me back on my own bills. I was previously being paid for my medical leave from work but stopped receiving payments forcing me to come up with ways to make money after my savings has run dry. Before his birthday as far as I know it was supposed to be something small and the mom wasn't going to be participating financial wise due to money problems. However on his birthday I get blindsided and told to give $40 to help pay for subs and party food because his mom ordered a few caterings. I would be happy to help if I had the money because it is my boyfriend and would like him to have a great day but that isn't the case. Throughout the party I felt ashamed because I felt like I didn't even belong because I didn't pitch in type of vibe. When I was buying my boyfriend his gifts we also went out and bought some hotdogs to cook on his birthday but they were gone the day before his birthday. My boyfriend and I got a bit upset but we both understand we didn't let anyone know it was for the party and accepted it as that. I ended up being up most of the night cooking up some food for the party which ended up being thrown away anyway when I woke up. Midnight on his birthday he tells me his parents tried buying him a car to surprise him but didn't go through with it because one of their checks did not deposit into their bank account. I told him that is a terrible idea and position they put me in because they always complain about having money problems.  Second, he doesn't even have a license. They told him we can both use the new car so I wont have to borrow cars from my dad. I think this is a terrible idea because I never agreed and don't know how they would be able to buy a car outright or payments, let alone the insurance. I told my boyfriend I would not be driving the car because I don't want to hear about it about having to help pay for the insurance or wear and tear on the car. I would rather they put that money towards their bills. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my boyfriend when she brings up the $40. I will tell her \"I was blindsided and there was no discussion about me paying beforehand and as much as I would love to help. With the current situation with my work and paychecks I don't have any money but not to worry about the rent because that is my primary concern.\" My boyfriend thinks thats a rude thing to say and offered to pay it with his own money. I told him no that is his money and should keep it for himself. He insists so there wont be any drama. I again told him no.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "title": "AITA for being angry at my boyfriend who learned a language behind my back and humiliated me in front of my family?",
      "description": "Hey Reddit, long time lurker first time poster.\n\nSo some relevant background info; my parents moved to the country I live in (UK) from Malaysia (They are Chinese-Malay) before I was born. All of my extended family still live in Malaysia or Hong Kong. All of my immediate family, cousins and most of my aunts and uncles speak from fluent to OK English. However none of my grandparents or great-aunts or great-uncles do, they mostly only speak Cantonese and some Malay. I only speak English, meaning I've never had a conversation with my grandparents that hasn't been translated for me. Sad I know, I have tried but I just have no affinity for learning languages beyond my first.\n\nSo on to my boyfriend... I have been dating my boyfriend for about 2 years now, he is my first boyfriend for all intents and purposes and so far everything has been going great. He is very respectful, hardworking and kind and has even managed to talk my parents round to liking him. Early last year I floated the idea of him coming to Malaysia with me for Chinese New Year in 2019 to meet my extended family, he was thrilled with the idea. We booked the trip around March or so.\n\nNow here's the problem. My boyfriend has, without consulting me first, in the past 10 months gone behind my back and SECRETLY LEARNED HOW TO SPEAK CANTONESE(!!!!) to a conversational level. He then decided to spring this on me and my parents/siblings on New Years Eve as a \"surprise\". My family were very pleased, my Father spent almost the rest of the evening talking to him in Cantonese while my Mother gave me disparaging looks. I knew what was coming. I just felt sick, when we go to Malaysia he will be able to have full conversations with my own grandparents that I've never been able to enjoy while I'm sat alone again as the only single-language speaker in the room and my whole family is looking down on me and talking about me questioning me because if a white boy can do it why can't I?\n\nI excused myself before midnight and went to bed, it isn't proper for him to be in my room alone because my family are very traditional so he didn't follow me but he did text me a few times to ask why I went to bed and if everything was okay which I ignored and quickly fell asleep.\n\nAnyway, the next day my Mother asked if I had learned to speak Cantonese too, which I told her I hadn't, that he had gone and done this by himself and I still suck. Which started a huge shit storm basically how I have no respect and don't care about my family, how she's going to tell my grandparents to disinherit me, how I'm an embarrassment, how she's not going to let me go on the trip and so on.\n\nBy the afternoon my boyfriend had texted me quite a few times and was getting worried. I just replied asking if he knew what he did wrong and he was just even more confused. I explained it to him and he said that he just wouldn't speak it but it's too late! He will be the talk of the town before he even arrives and all of it will be held over me. I asked him why he didn't help me to learn with him, and he said that he knows I hate Cantonese and that it stresses me out because I'm bad at it and he just wanted to impress my family. I told him I needed space and he said OK, hasn't contacted me since (Which is a little suspicious...)\n\nI also found of from him that he going to evening classes once a week on the day he told me he was out with his friends. Which also means he has been lying to me constantly (And more concerning, believably) for almost a year too.\n\nSo yeah. Is he the asshole to not only learn Cantonese, but then surprise me and my family with it without consulting me? Am I the asshole for feeling disgusted, angry and ashamed because of him?\n\nThanks\n\nTl;dr My boyfriend has learned my native language that I cannot speak behind my back and it's going to tear me apart from my family. AITA for having a problem with this?",

      "title": "AITA for serving vegetarian food at my son's 1st birthday party?",
      "description": "A little backstory, my wife has become vegetarian a few months ago and I have changed my diet to support her. Both our families are meat eaters, and as my sister has young children I sent her the menu weeks in advance to see if it was OK, to which she replied \"I don't think they'd eat any of that, but don't worry I'll get the kids something\". A few days before I'd also made a general remark to my mother that we (as a human race) don't need to eat meat, as she'd asked what kind of food was going to be there.\n\nFast forward to the day before, my wife and I spent a lot of time and money preparing a wide variety of vegetarian dishes such as pizza rolls and quiche, with other finger foods and snacks. We'd also been planning the party for a long time, getting a cake made, hiring a hall and arranging a soft play for all the kids.\n\nIt gets to the day and the whole time my mum is making strange comments to me about the meat industry, asking if we've made our cats vegetarian too, and even goes up to my wife with some chicken they brought, and goes \"mmm tasty chicken!\". All of this was quite rude I thought, but ignored it as we were there to celebrate our son turning 1.\n\nMy mum, step dad and sister all come back to ours afterwards to present a gift to my son, where all hell breaks loose. The three of them begin shouting at us about how we are \"imposing our values\" on them and how we didn't give them a choice for food. This all apparently stemmed from my flippant comment about not needing to eat meat, which seemed to have been marinating in their minds ever since. \n\nMy sister's point was that they always accommodate us whenever we see them by preparing vegetarian dishes. My point to them was that the food wasn't the main focus, it was just an extra. The  party was supposed to be about my boy. The whole argument got so bad that my wife was crying and now we don't speak to any of them.\n\nPlease let us know... AITA? We're really trying to work out if we were in fact assholes for not preparing any meat dishes. My wife is very much against the meat industry so wouldn't have bought any meat anyway, but they wouldn't accept that either. We didn't realise a 1st birthday party would come down to what food we provided. My wife's family didn't even care about the food.",

I really don't know what to think and  who to ask, so I'm asking here.\n\n About 3.5-4 months ago we went to a ski resort as a school. Long atory short, I got together with a girl and I guess the chemistry was good between us. We said It would be too fast to call it something so we tried ro get to know each other. After 3 weeks, in new years eve, she said she didn't want to be in a relationship rather than just veing friends.\n\n After she said so I said it would be painful to me to keep talking to her as a friend wile I had feelings for her. So I stopped talking to her. Though it's weird because we are in the same school and use the same bus after school. After some days my friends got mad at her because they thought it wasn't neccesary to aproach me as a flirt and just saying we should be friends and causing pain to me. They swore to her and she got mad as well. I don't know what to do when I see her and what to think of her.\n\nSorry if I did mistakes in vicabulary ",

      "description": "I don’t know where to start honestly I’m so torn with this whole thing, I don’t want to be a dick but this relationship is driving me crazy.  I mean one day it’s all good the next day she makes me feel guilty for not hanging out with her.  A little backstory I’ve been dating this girl for about a year and a half, we’ve had our off and ons, we’ve even had breaks in between.  And while I love her I’m worried I’m getting love blind or whatever it’s called.  Frankly she does shitty things, for the longest time if we fought she’d insult me and accuse me of so many things culminating in her insulting me in public but when we talked she cried and apologized and it felt so heart felt.  She said her mental health isn’t good and she’s feeling weird etc.  and I believed her but then a week later she did the same thing when we got in a disagreement and idk it just broke all trust when she promised she’d never do it again.  \n\nFast forward to last week, we’re out drinking and we had a really good night out we go back to my place and I go to get up to get something from the fridge and she gets super upset with me.  She starts yelling as loud as she could screaming at me, then at one point she just dropped to the ground failed everywhere screaming and crying and I just went and hide in the bathroom.  I hated being such a wimp and not facing up but my roommates were home and it was 2 am I was drunk and just wanted it to end.  I still haven’t asked them if they were woken up by the screaming.  We talk about it the next day while cuddling and she cries saying everything’s been so hard her depression is flaring up and I sit and talk with her about everything she’s feeling reassure her it’s alright.  We did this a bit through out the week and I thought everything was improving.  \n\nThen this weekend happened, it started normal.  She worked Friday night and I had a busy day and just wanted to be home so she was stuck at her place and she wanted to drink, so I went drove her to Walgreens she got some stuff even surprised me with some stuff then I went home.  But Sunday happened and it ruined the weekend.  I have a research paper due today which I had to finish up citations for Sunday night as well as work which since is retail we’re super busy then I had to go to see family afterwards which I haven’t seen.  She messages me at work and I get a chance to respond and she wants to make plans to eat I tell her I can’t but she could come to my house and get food although she’d have to meet my family.  She doesn’t want to so I just think alright then that’s fine.  But she keeps guilting me over and over about how I can’t hang out with her, and after I finally finish my paper I go to see her for a bit but it was horrible.  No attention was enough I felt like I couldn’t do anything right if I checked my phone which I do a lot when we normally hang out she just guilts me and says “Oh I’ll shut up and let you use your phone”. And it feels like I’ve been gone for like war or some shit when it’s been two days.   She just keeps getting worse and worse kinda throwing low key insults then we just sit there not really talking awkward as hell and I just say I’m gonna leave then.  Of course she cries but I just didn’t want to stay I finished my paper and felt really good but that killed it and I just wanted to salvage the feeling a bit.  So I went and got Ben and Jerry’s, like truffle something and that was good shit let me tell you. \n\nAnyways I know this is a shitty rant and obviously this is biased from my point of view but I just don’t know if I can take it anymore.  Plus I’m planning on doing a job that will require me to be really far from home a lot during summer so if we can’t make it two days without seeing each other what am I supposed to do then?  And while I still love her I just don’t know, I feel so shitty sometimes and it tears me apart.  But we made so many plans lately like to go to the renaissance fair and all those cute things and I want to almost stay for those but I don’t know.  Any input helps, sorry for the long ass rant. ",

      "description": "I'll keep this to the point, although I feel like I could write a books worth of stories similar to this one.  It seems to be a recurring theme between my wife and me, and I think this is a really good illustration of it.\n\nWe are renting an apartment now for about 1500.  Its spacious, it's a lower rent than we had originally planned on paying, and it's in a good location for us.  We like it, but both agree we would be willing to pay a bit more and get a few more of the bells and whistles we really want - nicer kitchen and general interior finish being top of her list.  We're currently searching in the range of about 1800-2000 a month, around the same area.\n\nWe've seen 5 places in person that were reasonable, 2 of which I was prepared to apply for which costed exactly 2000 a month.  I thought both of those two checked all of the boxes we had discussed, granite counter tops and new appliances, hardwood throughout.  \n\nYesterday, while leaving the showing of one of those 2 that I thought was great, i was suprised to learn that she was not impressed.  I asked what she didnt like, and listened while she explained. \n\nIt honestly comes down to styling, and craftsmanship, and like aesthetic design choices.  For example, one place had a back splash with small, clear tiles, and she commented that she would prefer subway tiles because that's \"in\".  The granite counter tops had a slight shading to them, and if one piece had been flipped it would have blended much nicer at the seem.  \n\nMy frustration is, we can tell from the photos that these 2000 places are not chic.  They're nice, but they dont feel like they've been designed with an eye for trends or \"fashion\" for lack of a better term.\n\nMy wife likes to think that nobody understands her style, but I've been with her for more than 10 years and I have some idea of what she wants.  It's going to cost us 2200-2400 a month, which I'm fine with and she is not.  Fine.\n\nToday, she sends me a handful of posts for other rentals around 2000 a month, with much shittier kitchen than the one we saw in person yesterday. \n\nI'm not going to get upset at my wife over this, but am I an asshole if i dont search out places? One of the posts she sent today I had already seen, and not sent to her because I know she will veto the kitchen.  \n\nI'll go see whatever she schedules, but she will get upset if I dont continue making and effort to schedule some too.  But I dont want to schedule apartments I know she wont take, and she wont go see a 2400 apartment. \n\nWhat do yall think? ",

      "description": "AITA??\n\nSo I know a girl who got pregnant beginning of our senior year. Whole school flocks to her to support her and she’s given special privileges. She can go to the bathroom whenever, go to the nurse, go to another teachers class (this was her calm space or whatever), and admin would let her leave the lunch room because she was ‘scared a fight would happen in the lunchroom’ some BS like that. \n\nAnyway coming close to graduates day it’s found out that she has the highest grades in our class. My first thought was how tf she did this when she’s pregnant?! So I look at her work (all our work was shared upon completion and after grading) and all her papers are super good and professional which seems off so I do a plagiarism check. 0% plagiarism. I accept it and move on. \n\nShit happens in my life and I’m depressed. Applying for scholarships because I can’t get aid. I notice her posting about all these college acceptances and scholarships awarded to her and get pissed off. HOW CAN SHE DO THIS?! She wrote about feeding a crack head realizing she doesn’t wanna be like him and got scholarships?!\n\nShe has baby. Enrolls in private catholic university. For free. 100% paid for by aid and scholarships. She posts baby updates every so often. Baby is sleeping so well through the night! And never ever cries for no reason! I call BS and am attacked by all her family and college friends backing up her story. SHE TOOK HER BABY TO SCHOOL BECAUSE HER DAYCARE WAS ON HOLIDAY!!! \n\nI am furious. She gets knocked up at 17 has baby a week before graduation day. Got to leave HS early May for “bed rest” and made a huge deal about not missing finals or missing AP exams while 34 weeks pregnant. Anyway. She ended HS straight A’s!!! How tf??? She was Magnum cum laude!!??? How?! The principal boasted about her English papers and anatomy papers and all her work was just sooooo great.  She gave speeches to the community 8 months pregnant.\n\nNow she’s on Fb posting pics of her baby and talking about how great college is and I’m sitting here fuming mad because I worked my ass off and couldn’t even go to a university had to settle for a community college. \n\nI was vice president of student council! She was just the treasurer. ",

I know they still love me, and i just cant handle being the support they need right now. Im recently into a new relationship, and already had my trepidation about talking to them. And with this i feel all the more that i just cant extend the energy necvesary to talk to them. I also know if i dont talk to them i will get a flurry of texts and calls and it just feels overwhelming. So i blocked them. AITA?",

      "description": "So, Me (45M) and my wife (43F) have two kids. One son (17M) and one daughter (16F), both still in high school. \n\nThe situation here is that my son cheated on his last girlfriend. They broke up several months ago, but he really hurt her feelings by cheating on her and then dumping her. He's done this with the two previous girlfriends he had as well.\n\nMe and my wife don't condone this at all. However, we don't like to punish him for it either. We don't really want to get involved with his sex/romantic life. \n\nBut really, my wife agrees with me that punishing him would be a bad idea. Even though he has issues with those types of things, he's a great kid. He's got outstanding grades (among the best in the school), he's competed in debating tournaments and he's an amazing athlete. As crude as it sounds, he's ''all around'' amazing. He's made us so proud as parents, he does our family proud. As it stands, he even has a shot at getting acceptance into an Ivy League school (or a school of equivalent caliber, if he goes for MIT/Stanford types). \n\nIf he wasn't doing much with this life, we would have more incentive to punish him I guess, but really the way things are, we don't want to give him too much negative treatment. In fact for most of his life, we have disciplined him when he seriously misbehaved but for the most part, we took a more positive approach and told him he can achieve whatever he wants in life. My wife smothers him a lot more than I do, but really we're proud of where he is going.\n\nNow my daughter is also great, but she seems to be taking serious issue with our non-punishment of his cheating. This caused a big argument recently as she shouted at us that ''He can't keep getting away with treating people like crap!''. \n\nShe was very emotional during this argument, but I think this was because our son's ex girlfriend was also my daughter's friend. Why else would she get so emotional over him cheating? \n\nSo we just told her ''Look, you're emotional right now. If you want to keep acting like a baby, then do so, but you're not going to achieve anything. You shouldn't be talking about your brother like that''. We offered to take her out for a family meal and she refused and moped around in her room. We're *not* going to punish our son, but she seems to be really mopey about this, AITA?",

      "description": "Currently on a plane flying from NY to LA, It's about a five hour flight. Roughly one hour into my flight I reclined my seat, and immediately noticed the man behind me dig his knees into my back. I say nothing. About 20 min go by and this man very politely asks me to un-recline my seat. He said he doesn't feel it's fair of me to intrude on his space. I said No, I apologized, and put my headphones back in my ears. He clearly did not like that answer, and dug his knees even harder into my seat. Soon after this I fall asleep only to be woken up by this man pretty aggressively tapping on my shoulder between the gap of my seat. He started going off about how rude I am and that I don't deserve more space then him (I'm in economy plus which gives me more leg room, I'm also 6'6.) At this point I'm pretty upset that he woke me up so I tell him \"to go eat a bag of dicks\" and to suck it up. He has already complained to a flight attendant who basically told him there is nothing she can do to help the situation. I've got about two hours to go on this flight and I don't think either of us will stand down. \n\nAITA for refusing to move my seat up? ",

      "description": "Sorry if this post is weird, I’m on mobile. \n\nSo there’s this guy that I’ve slowly become best friends with, let’s call him L. L and I have slowly become best friends. I’ve becoming really close with him to a point of telling him everything about me, including my deepest and darkest secrets. I genuinely consider him my best friend. A while back we both shared that we had deep feelings for each other and felt really close. We became really intimate and even closer and the feelings just kept growing and growing. I told him how much I care about him and all the feelings I had for him and he said the same back. A few days ago I learned that him and his ex were still friends. This made me a little nervous but all in all it wasn’t a big deal. It’s something I could accept. After all a breakup doesn’t have to end the friendship. He told me that they had dated for over a year but they were 100% just friends now. A little later when I asked about it, he told me that they text every single day. Literally every day. And he also went on to say that he sends her good morning messages every day. This made me extremely anxious. I deal with anxiety normally and this just made it fly through the roof. It just really hurt me and made me feel weird to know they text daily and he sends her good morning messages. “Only” friends don’t do that right? Well this hurt me and made made me extremely uncomfortable to a point that I asked him to at least stop talking to her daily and stop sending her good morning messages. When he refused to do that I just asked him to choose between her and me. I said that if she was so important to him that he was okay with making me feel this uncomfortable that maybe we shouldn’t be getting this intimate. He said that he refused to make that decision and I told him that if he’s not making a decision, that’s it’s equivalent to him choosing her because he knows how much this hurts me. In the end he still didn’t make the decision and I basically called all of this off even though it hurts so much to not have him with me. \n\nAm I the asshole for giving him that ultimatum? Or are my feelings worth respecting and is the ultimatum justified? I just need a little clarity and I don’t know if this is all just my fault from my anxiety and insecurities. ",

      "description": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI (27/m) was raised in a highly religious family. I went to a Christian school, went to church every week, and eventually I went to a Bible College and Seminary to be a pastor and theologian. A few years ago I started developing some severe cognitive dissonance about my beliefs. I formerly believed in a 6,000 year old Earth, homosexuality was wrong, pro-life only, etc. Whatever you think your typical Christian Conservative/Republican is, I used to be.\n\nThese beliefs started changing once I started thinking long and hard about them. Then one day 4-5 years ago I just stopped believing it. I realized I could no longer believe or adhere to what I had so ardently defended my whole life. This flipped my world upside down in massive ways. I was caught in an existential crisis that lasted me weeks and months.\n\nThere came a point where I told my parents I no longer believed. I should never have told them, but I for some reason one day it was a burning in my chest and I just had to let it out. They were devastated by the news. They told their friends and church friends, they told other members of my family. It did not take long for me to be known as the apostate child.\n\nThis brings me to my problems of today, now. I just don't like my family. They are dangerous fundamentalists. They live in an alternate reality of beliefs surrounding the world. It's not as though I'm anti-religion, because I'm not, but I am *highly* anti-fundamentalism, which is what they are.\n\nMy parents check up on me every few weeks, asking me if I'm praying to God about problems in my life. It's like they refuse to admit I just **don't believe that anymore.** They are always talking to me about God, praising God, and ascribing every minute detail in my life to God. It's seriously been 4-5 years now and I'm over it.\n\nMy parents want the family together for holidays like Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, but the truth is that I want to avoid them at all costs. \n\nI will be honest with you, r/AITA. I do not like my parents. I am angry at them. Most days, I wish they were dead. I see them as a menace and plague to society, living in an alternate reality of delusion. They continue to force their opinions and beliefs onto me, even though I'm an adult, way beyond the point of their care, and I am capable of making decisions for myself. I do not want to see them or talk to them any longer. I do not want to attend family gatherings. If I was not so secure in my current job, I would leave my state just to be away from them. \n\nSo be real with me: Am I the Asshole?\n\n\n**tl;dr**: My family raised me to be a religious fundamentalist nut, I deconstructed my beliefs, and my parents continue to proselytize me. I'm very sick and tired of it. I'm a grown-ass man and I want to never talk or think about God with them ever again. It has gotten to the point where I don't want to see them, or talk to them, so I generally don't attend any family gatherings anymore, so long as I can help it.",

I've made it clear to her about I appreciate her worrying for me but i'm depressed, I just actually enjoy being home more than going out doing something. I'm 19 and she is 21 her argument is that \"People your age are going and doing (insert whatever it may be here.\" I remember telling her its frustrating that she feels as though telling me what other people are doing is going to make me automatically decide to change my interests or go out more. Elise responded  to a long paragraph I sent her explaining how I feel about her worrying about me, making sure to show that I appreciate the gesture while also addressing my frustrations with how she going about approaching me, by saying she won't probe my emotions anymore and getting very defensive while also accusing me of deflecting the \"situation\". I did not respond to the message because I had nothing more to say about the conversation I wanted to drop the conversation and not worry about it anymore because she made it clear by explicitly telling me that she wasn't going to to change her opinion about her thinking i'm depressed.\n\nFast forward to Wednesday of spring break she calls me upset about how she was in a car wreck Sunday and how I didn't call and check on her while also telling me about how she has been having a tough break which I was fully prepared to be there and comfort her she went on to lash out at me saying i'm a horrible friend because I didn't know about all of these things going on because I didn't respond to her message. I had no idea about the car wreck, I didn't know she was not living at home with her mom anymore and was staying with a friend but she expressed that I abandoned her and i'm a terrible Friend for doing so.  Am I the asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My friend feels like I abandoned her by not responding to her message, during the time we had no contact she ended up having a horrible couple of days.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

So this happened years ago but I want to get this lingering question answered once and for all.\n\nSo my ex(we were exs at the time of thr event) and I were hooking up after some time being apart. Nothing too serious just a fun time, and definitely not exclusive. Also we were wearing condoms. This was around Christmas. On new years I went to a party in seattle and had a crazy night that ended in me having sex with someone I met that night. I knew that telling my ex about it would cause a lot of emotional turmoil, and i was hopping on a plane to guatamala a week later. So i didnt tell her, and we continue to have sex for a week. \n\nNot that this changes things but the next year around christmas we hook up again. AFTER we have sex she tells me she is dating a man 40 years older than her and is using him for money. I will say that i felt super weird about that because i felt like even though we wefe broken up and nom exclusive, her dating someone else was information i should have before deciding to hook up. \n\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "  I'm a guy, in a relationship with my gf and I get hit on a lot. I know I know, that sounds like a brag but it isn't. Most of the time people back off when I tell them I'm taken but sometimes they don't:\n\n\n  I was at a bar drinking with my friends when some girl started flirting heavily with me. I told her I was taken and she backed off for some time but then came back even more drunk and more flirty. I told her to stop and emphasized the fact that I'm in a relationship to which she replied \"It's not like you're married\" and became really touchy.\n\n  I left after that but her comment got me thinking. My father let me take his wedding ring (he's divorced) and I decided to wear it when I'm going out. This way I can just show it off and people would take the hint, and so far it's working. I don't wear it near family/friends/everyone that isn't a stranger. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy pretending to be married though, it's exciting to live a lie lol. \n\n I talked to my girlfriend about it and she found it offensive that I would lie about my martial status. However no one knows about it and if they found out I'd explain its purpose. What she said did get me thinking about if it's morally wrong to do so feel free to be the judge. ",

I commented on the post saying that the winning candidate won by a clear majority, it would be unfair for people's votes to count differently based on how dense the area they lived in is, and that I would support the popular vote no matter which candidate won. She proceeded to go into a rant about how I, unprovoked, shared my opinions even though she hadn't shared hers, and that I was being self righteous and a sore winner about it.  She said all this sarcastic stuff about \"what would we do without the educated city folk educating us.\" She implied that I called her an \"idiot Republican,\" when I did no such thing - I was perfectly respectful, no personal attacks, no political attacks, just sharing my opinion on the matter.\n\nShe then unfriended me, which I'm not upset about, she's barely in my life as it is and I see no reason for her to be in it moving forward.

      "description": "Okay, so a little bit of backstory.\nI've been a model for 4 years  (this year will make my 5th) and I've always wanted to do artistic nudes. My husband however is against it and out of respect, I haven't done them even though I know nude models get paid more. It wasn't a big deal at first until I was offered a gig with my favorite photographer (guy has been published MULTIPLE times and his work is timeless). Husband's ex was also a nude model and he supported her well into our relationship (long story, have to get into that later). So I have to tell this big photographer that I can't work with him because of my husband, which is a big douche move in the art community. My work has suffered since.\nFastfoward to this year: I've decided that I'm going to do what I want with my modeling. It's something that I may want to do as a career and I don't necessarily have a say-so in my husband's day to day work, so why should he with me?\nHe gets upset, we argue, I cry, whatever. He never shows support for my work, never has, and now a model friend of mine that he bought a shirt from once is selling her smut to make ends meet and he literally says that he would buy it. I get pissed right the fuck off and mention that I view this woman almost as a mother (she's an older, amazing model). He says he doesn't, mentions that he finds her hot, and continues to joke about it. Tries to make me feel like the asshole for getting mad at a simple joke. AITA for flying off the handle at him?",

Last year my father died at the age of 63, I'm still not that good, and he 'left' us a couple of things, but the problem here is the car that he left to me, an old BMW 328i. And it was a special car for him and me, I remember 'helping' him with maintenance when I was a kid, he even thaught me how to drive on that car. I know it's not an unicorn car, you can find them cheap on ebay and craiglist, but it's special to me, it is one of the only things he left here, and the problem starts there. My sister is going to study abroad, and we were raising money, when father died we stopped for a while and restarted and now my family is trying to convince me to sell it, because it is in registered in my name, to help my sister. So, people, Am I being an asshole? Am I being an egoistical prick only because I want to maintain his memory here ? Don't get me wrong, I love my sister and I want her to be a sucessful person, but I don't think it's right doing that. I don't know, am I wrong ?\n",

She hasn’t really been able to take leave because she was flagged for her weight. Finally, she tells me in early December that she got approved to go on leave at the end of January, so I immediately went and put in for my vacation time at work. I haven’t stopped talking about it and made everyone aware that I was taking this time to see my sister.\n\nMy job has a super strict first come, first served policy about taking vacations. My department only has 8 people and it’s considered a trade so you can’t just pull anyone off the street to cover for one of us, so only one person is allowed to take vacation at a time.\n\nThis past week, one of my coworkers asks off for the *exact same* week as me, saying he already spent $2,000 to go out of the country and our bosses “better approve the time off because of how expensive it was.” Our boss sees the request and pulls him aside telling him that he can’t have it because I asked for it. Coworker cries to the big boss and big boss gives it to him, telling my boss to tell me to take my vacation “some other time.” I went to the big boss explaining the situation, he didn’t do anything, so I went over his head. The DM was appalled and basically took away my coworker’s vacation, wrote my store manager for breaking policy and told my coworker if he calls in more than once that week to go on said vacation, he’ll get fired. \n\nI didn’t mean to get everyone in trouble, but I asked for it over a month ago and I want to see my sister.

This was no exception...it is known in the school that her dad died last year, and that she is also known for being quite promiscuous. \n\nAfter I said that, everyone went quiet...she burst into tears and the teacher comes in and freaks out, he asks what happened and I get sent to head office. I was given detention and ordered to apologize. I said ''I'm sorry for expressing my opinion'' and I was given detention AGAIN for not giving a real apology.\n\nAfterwards, quite a lot of people came up to me and gave me high fives...they were all happy that I ''tore her down a peg'' and some even invited me to parties (I'm not even interested in going to them, but feels weird...). However some of her friends (mostly all guys) came up to me and said I am a horrible misogynist douche for saying what I said and that I owe her a real apology, I just told them to fuck off as well. \n\nThis has caused some tension with some of her female friends too, who said I am being evil. \n\nWas I wrong here? I thought what I did was justified given the circumstances for what I did but it has caused some issues with people.\n\n**TLDR - Called a girl bully a slut and that her dad would be ashamed of her after SHE sexually shamed me for being a virgin loser who plays video games...given detention because I didn't apologize, tensions with school mates.**",

      "title": "AITA for not wanting my Dad to get a tattoo of the date we lost our baby?",
      "description": "My wife and I were scheduled to have a baby late last year. It would have been our first child and we were on top of the world. The pregnancy, however, was a traumatic experience. It was a high risk pregnancy and my wife dealt with health issues throughout. As the pregnancy went on, my wife's health continued to deteriorate badly. Things did not improve over time, and the doctor had concerns about my wife's health and the condition of the baby. We made the devastating decision to terminate the pregnancy, and it absolutely crushed us.\n\nThis whole situation just destroyed us completely. The procedure had complications and my wife made it through some very tense moments, but she ultimately recovered. It's weird because people mourn in different ways. I've had friends who've lost babies and have memorialized them very publicly. I love it and have never had a problem with that. The thing is, with the way this pregnancy went, it's not really something we wanted to revisit with others. We privately made a decision that we will always love honor, and respect what we had, but we would keep it in our hearts and not display anything (like a memorial wall or a picture) Again, others may do this, but this was our private decision based on how we felt.\n\nMy dad has a tattoos of the names of all his kids and grandchildren. After the pregnancy, my dad asked me if we had picked a name out for our baby and we told him we had not decided on one. He then told me he had planned of getting a tattoo of the baby's name, but since we did not have a name picked out, he would like to tattoo the date that the pregnancy was terminated, as a tribute. Now I understand my dad's motive here. He is doing this from a place of love and feels he is doing the right thing to honor our baby. However, my first thought was \"oh God please no Dad\" and my wife's face told me the same story. I didn't say anything back to my dad, but simply nodded when he told me his plan. My wife later told me that she really does not want him to get the tattoo and doesn't think it is appropriate. This is not something she wants to re-live on a daily basis or every time she sees it on my dad's arm. I love my dad and I love him for wanting to do something, but is that the most appropriate way to do it? If we are at a social gathering and someone asked my dad about the tattoo, the last thing my wife is going to want is for him to flag her down and have her re-live that day. We just want to mourn privately. We do not want to re-tell the story and re-live the trauma. Don't we have that right? It's no one else's business. I've talked to my mom and she says it's a wonderful tribute and that I should be grateful. I haven't said anything to my dad yet because I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. It's his body and he can do whatever he wants, but AITA if I tell my dad we would really prefer that he did not get the tattoo?",

      "description": "Super short background: So I am 6 months pregnant with me and my husbands first child. I work but he is definitely the primary bread winner and we are reliant on his income not mine.\n\nMe and my husband were sitting in traffic on a 2 lane highway. The lane going our direction was all the way backed up and at a standstill. The lane in the other directions was empty flowing freely. The driver 2 cars ahead of us tries to flip around and go the other way to get out of the traffic. But as she is doing that a car comes around the corner and she t-bones him off the road. He goes slightly down the embankment and crashes into a tree and gets knocked unconscious. The car almost immediately catches fire under the hood and my husband jumps out and runs to the car. The passenger door is blocked by the tree and the drivers door handle is broken from being hit. My husband breaks the window with his elbow and peels the glass back with his hands (the glass is that beaded safety glass stuff) so he can pry the door open. \n\nHe did this got the guy out and shortly after the whole vehicle goes up in flames. So he definitely saved the guys life and is definitely a hero. Because of that his elbow and hands are all cut up and can't work for a few weeks but that is the absolutely best news. He could have got himself killed.\n\nI haven't said anything to him because I probably shouldn't feel that way but he has a wife and child that depend on him and I feel like he should think about that and not put his life on the line. Making sure he is there for his child should be his first priority. Am I as much of an asshole as I think I am for thinking this?",

      "description": "After my sister got married last year, she and I planned our first out of country trip that we took 3 months ago. She also invited 4 of her friends (who Im not close with, but r familare with) to join us, and we all started to save money. I had no trust in my sister/BIL to save money because they are terrible with money, so I offered to hold their share and store it so they wouldn't spend it. I even \"scheduled\" bi-weekly payments so the stay on track. Knowing their finances they would have no problem saving. At the final months leading to our date, she had excuse after excuse for giveing me less to save. I offered to loan them $3500 (because I didn't want to go to a foreign country with only her friends) and continued to save. \n\nBy the time it came to pay for the flight and tour ect., I later found out that they both quit their jobs (at the same company) 3 months earlier and both took a month to find a new one. I was furious but we were at the home stretch and I didn't want it ruining the other people's vacation so I bit the bullet and paid for their flight, one person's tour, and their share of the apartment we stayed in for 4 days. I live alone in an apartment and handle money much better and even did OT before the trip so I wouldn't come back broke (that was the idea). So I was financially able to help which came to over 5k. We made a schedule together of how and when they'd pay me back after the trip which was supposed to start a month after the trip but is now pushed back to Feb.\n\nMy sister announce she was pregnant just 3 weeks ago and all I could think about was the money that she owe me. Now I dont care how she wants to live her life but she knows they are not financially stable (plus other conserns the rest of the family has). And it turns out she got pregnant during the trip no less! Which makes it worst because they were fighting during the trip on multiple days to the point she was thinking about divorce already! And it left me not wanting to associate with my BIL for how he acted for those 2 weeks. \n\nAITA for allowing money to get in the way of family for me. If it were like $1000, I don't think I'd care as much. This baby will be the first grandchild for my parents and will make me an aunt. And I do feel bad. But I also have to take care of myself. I worked hard to earn that savings and I think I'll never see it again. I do, however, acknowledge that I was stupid to lend them that much knowing how they are but I was so starry-eyed with my first real travel I let it distort my logic.\n \nTL;DR: I loan 5k for my BIL/sister's share to go out of the country for 2 weeks so I wouldn't go alone with her friends. They got pregnant during the trip and all I thought about was the money they owe. ",

My thumb is what you would call a hitchhikers thumb (bends back far, nobody knew), so I decided to make some magic trick up that he couldnt push my thumb back with all his strength. He tried and as he pushed it i let it give out bent it as far back as I could, I yelled in agony pretending he broke my finger and I held it up and said you broke my finger arghhhh. \n\nNext thing he did was burst out crying, and I kinda sat there like what the fuuuuuck. I didnt know what happened, he kept crying and kept saying he broke my thumb and I was like no man I was kidding its not broken look. And he kept going on freaking out and apologizing and crying and the teacher talked to me after class and was really fucking angry at me. I had no idea, we were like 13 and he probably knew he was special, I knew something was up with him but didnt know he was like that.\n\nHe's a great friend, was part of my friend group from year 9 to year 13 and we still play halo together all the time, we are adults now but hes still alot like a kid.",

      "description": "To preface this, I have known this girl for about 4 years up till my confession, and liked her for about 2 of those years. So my best friend and I had been getting really close over the past 2 months or so, and getting far more touchy as a result of this. I had chosen to keep my feelings at bay in the past, but as things escalated my feelings became too strong to hold back. I began to feel like I was betraying her trust by being as touchy as I was with her, although most of the time I was not the one who initiated this. Eventually, I decided enough was enough and decided to confess to her how I feel.\n\nSadly, she did not feel the same way for me, which I was fine with and began the process of moving on. The next time I saw her though, she began immediately talking about other guys she was either talking with or trying to have sex with, and this felt very cruel to me. I had just poured my heart out to this girl and it felt like she was intentionally trying to hurt me. After this, I asked if she could refrain from talking about guys for the time being, as I needed a lil bit of time to recover before I could only see her as a friend again.\n\nThis is where the potential assholery comes in. My statement resulted in a small argument where she essentially stated she didn’t want to talk about the fact that I had confessed to her. She said it made her extremely uncomfortable and honestly angry. For some reason, this really upset me and confused me, considering in the moment she was relatively understanding. I tried to get her to talk about it more, so I could understand where she was coming from and potentially work this out, but she continued wanting to avoid that topic in its entirety.\n\nLater, I texted her essentially saying that until we can talk about what happened as adults, I would like to take a break from speaking. She never responded to this text and I’m kinda feeling like I may be the bad guy here. \n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": " \n\nTL;DR at bottom\n\nHey all.  This has been going on for the past few weeks and I’m feeling really shaken and guilty.  Sorry for the bad grammar and stuff.  \n\nSo my previous good friend of many years is Tina (not her actual name).  We were reasonably different, but complimented each other.  She’s had some serious family troubles that I’ve helped her with.  We’ve never been in the same social circles, but still made time for each other.\n\nFast forward to the last two years and in comes John.  From the first time I meet him, I sensed some kinda bad vibes, but I ignored it (stupid me) and was happy that she was in a relationship with someone she loved.  I tried to joke around with John, but he just kinda stared at me so I stopped. We still occasionally hung out and chatted online, but I understood that she needed to cut a bit of our time to develop her relationship.\n\nI don’t know when it started, but Tina started to become a bit more distant.  She’d sometimes leave me on read, or say that she can’t make meetups and always make some vague excuse.  At first I let it slide, but when it started getting worse, I asked her what’s up and why are you becoming more distant.  She just said “sorry, work’s getting real busy” or something along the lines of that, which I thought “that’s fair”. \n\nOne thing I still remember today is when I meet her boyfriend by chance at a supermarket.  I was shopping in an aisle which he happened to also be in.  I smiled and said “hey”.  He just scowled at me, with this look of disgust then walked away.  Even now I wish that I had gone up to him and asked, “what was that for, bitch?” But at the time, I just stood there.\n\nI guess I figured out what the scowl was for when one of Tina’s friends asked me “hey, do you know that Tina has been talking shit about you?”  This shocked me.  She said “yeah, her and her boyfriend have been calling you slut and stuff. I’m all for gossip and stuff, but it was just really toxic.” I was extremely  upset.  I used to use have sex and  do drugs throughout middle school and high school because I was dealing with some really bad shit and Tina knew that.  People have called me slut behind my back, but to know that Tina was the one that said it hurt me so much. \n\nI consulted with another one of my friends and she agreed to come with me and confront Tina about it.  I asked her if we could meet up and surprisingly she agreed.   So we meet up, sat down and did a bit of small talk.  Then I asked “is it true that you’ve been calling me a slut behind my back?”  I’ve always been direct. She seemed shocked and quickly denied it.  I said that her friend told me that and she immediately  asked “which one?” It didn’t matter and I told her that.  She seemed really uncomfortable so my friend stepped in and asked the questions again, but a bit softer.  Tina’s always been a bad liar so her face said it all. \n\nI wasn’t really too angry, just mostly sad.  Actually scratch that, deep down I was pissed.  I asked her why did you do that.  She didn’t really say anything.  When I asked if her boyfriend made her say it she said no. I remember her shoulders were super hunched over and she was shaking a bit.  I admit that this should have been a warning sign to stop but I was to upset to consider that. I asked her what’s going on and she said nothing.  I replied something along the lines of “you, knowing my history, called me  a slut.  That’s not nothing.”  \n\nShe then told me “well you kinda were.” My friend told me that, when Tina said that, my face looked so angry, especially after she continued “I told John about it and he agreed.” \n\nI exploded.  I’ve been known to have somewhat of a nasty temper (I’ve been going to therapy to help reduce that), so the next five minutes were us screaming at each other, with most of what I said summarising into “what the fuck is wrong with you.”  At one point, Tina accused me of being a Lesbian that was obsessed with her. My friend tried to calm us down, but that didn’t work so she half dragged me out of the building and into her car.  I don’t remember most of this, most of it is my friend telling me what happened.  I do remember breaking down in the car though.\n\nA year and a bit past since then.  Tina blocked me on all social media.  Her friend told me that John and Tina still talked shit about me until that friend stopped hanging out with her.  Due to our social groups not overlapping there wasn’t any friend drama, but I still felt empty.  When I thought of Tina, I choked up on fury and sadness.\n\nI got a text from Tina a couple of weeks ago asking if we could meet up.  When I asked her “why?, she said “to apologise” \n\nSo I meet up with her and she explained that her boyfriend was verbally and emotionally abusive, bordering on Narcissism.  She said that he was so nice at first and then turned toxic.  That he talked shit about most of her friends (especially me for some reason) and eventually she kinda believed that.  It took a lot of self-reflection and help from others to realise what was going on.  Even then he tried to keep them together.  \n\nShe told me this and apologised and I just remember sitting there, saying nothing.  I couldn’t bring myself to forgive her.  I’ve always been one to hold a grudge, so many be that’s why.  I understand that maybe I should have tried to reach her, but part of my was furious that she told someone I didn’t know that well personal stuff like that.  I might be overreacting.  It’s just I feel so guilty because she went through hell and I’m basically telling her to piss off. It’s just I don’t trust her enough now for this not to happen again.   I feel so bad and don’t really know if I’m being dick.\n\nTL;DR:  Good friend of mine dated a narcissist, became really toxic and called me slut behind me back.  When I confronted her we had a screaming match and didn’t talk for a year and a half. She apologised but I can’t forgive her.",

      "description": "I am 20M, and I live with my parents. I commute to community college, Monday-Thursday, and I will be graduating after this semester. I have wanted a motorcycle since I was a kid, when my mom had one. I always thought it was super cool, and I wanted to get one when I was older\n\nStarting my freshman year of high school, I started working summers, and saving up money. By the time senior year ended, and I was ready to go to college, I had about $11.000 saved up, between working and birthday/christmas money. (I rarely spend money) Going into college, I knew I had enough money to buy all my courses, and books for the 2 years I was attending college. (This college is one of the cheapest in NE) My parents had to worry about nothing.\n\nMy car was paid for by my family, and they pay for my insurance, but other than that, all expenses are me. I pay for gas, fixes and oil changes, and anything else. Now I am on my last semester of college, and after the 4 semesters, I have about $8,500 saved up. I have a tax return coming in of about $2,000, and leftover christmas/birthday money of about $500. This puts me at a total of about $11,000. I plan on going to work right after school, and I want to get a motorcycle because, 1) I have the money, and 2) I have always wanted one.\n\nMy buddy has a motorcycle, and is willing to sell it to me for about $3,300. After this purchase, my savings would be at about $7,700. My mother’s arguement, is that I should establish myself, before I spend money on a luxury item. My arguement is, she wouldn’t have to worry about anything. I would pay for it, pay for insurance, and pay for any maintenence. My mom says that I still live under her roof, and I would be keeping it in her garage. She even threatened to kick me out. (I couldn’t tell if she was joking or not...)\n\nAITA for wanting to buy a motorcycle, with my saved up money that I earned, and not having my parents worry about anything changing expense wise. Or is my mom right and I should get more ahead in life, before I buy something like this?\n\nThanks for any responses. First time posting here, and I’m also on mobile.",

      "description": "I'm an English tutor working in Russia. A couple of months back, I was contacted by a businessman looking for \"four two-hour classes a week,\" who wanted to get his level up high enough to live abroad in the foreseeable future. We had some meetings and they went pretty well, but he had a pretty hectic schedule; always having to take calls during classes, etc.\n\n\nAfter a brief pause in studies because of some traveling, he started having to cancel the odd class, then only had time for 1-2 a week. Then he started forgetting and my wife and I decided to label him as \"somewhat unreliable.\"\n\n\nTwo weeks ago he had a class but then didn't come... I texted him to ask if something is wrong and he replied \"I'm in St. Petersburg.\" I fought back the urge to write a sarcastic \"thanks for telling me.\"\n\n\nThe issue is that my time is a bit of a premium; if I've a free evening I will usually hire myself out to an English school with which I confirm a timetable every week. So last minute cancellations both rob me of the money I'd have made had the lesson taken place, but also potential earnings I might've made had I instead worked at a school that evening.\n\n\nThen last week he did it again. Once again in SPB while I'm waiting for him. Luckily this time I texted him the evening before.\n\n\nSo my wife and I decide to discount him altogether; we don't chase him up about any future classes and he ceases contacting us from that point on.\n\nNow to today. I'm sitting at home, enjoying my half day off, when he writes me on WhatsApp to ask how to translate a Russian slogan for his canteen business into English. Figuring it'd be petty of me to outright ignore him, I translate it for him and deliver said translation as a sole message, he asks if it's good for food, so I change one word. He then says it's too long. He asks if \"Always hot feelings\" works as a slogan... at this point I'm somewhat miffed that this is evolving into a free consultation of my expertise and that he's dragging me into a creative process; especially if it means I have to explain why some things works when pertaining to food while other things don't. So I simply write \"nope.\"\n\nHe starts sending me pictures of MacDonalds and says \"I want a slogan like MacDonald's and their 'I'm lovin' it.'\" So I simply reply with \"We can discuss it in our next lesson)\"\n\n\nThis is the first time in dealing with a client that I've \"gone catty.\" I almost always try to walk the higher road and avoid being petty, but it felt somewhat warranted here. Was that unprofessional of me?",

      "title": "AITA for lashing out at my duet partner because she didn’t learn her part and got us pulled?",
      "description": "I’m in highschool rn but not gonna release more than that but I am 18, and this girl is a sophomore. We are in choir together and we were really close, I would get her things she needed that she was too shy to buy, we would talk about our significant others, stuff like that. She says she’s great at piano and that she’s a Coloratora Soprano. She also says she’s very great and proficient at learning music.\nSoon enough enrolling for Solo &amp; Ensemble in our districts MPA (music performance assessment) comes up, and I throw out the idea of us being the first duet for my director in like, almost a decade. She obviously is excited and I tell her it’s gonna be difficult but I have faith in her, oh boy was that the most terrible mistake I’ve made in my musicianship. I go to my director who has full faith and trust in my ability to work my ass off to get what I want. I tell him I’d like to do a duet with her, me being the Alto, and her being the Soprano.\nNote: I can sing in either range but I prefer alto because it’s more comfortable AND I’m really good at doing harmonies, humble brag over\nHe says yes, which I was NOT expecting. I was so excited I immediately run out and tell her. Of course I give her a great song for starters and she gives me a musical song in return, big red flag I missed. I showed her Domine Deus by JS Bach, a beautiful piece that I’ve done in a duet before and it’s relatively easy once you figure out the patterns. I try to practice with her but she always says she’s busy... but then comes to me later saying:\n“By the way.... can you get me a pregnancy test? I ran out of the condoms you gave me and he accidentally came inside” \nI was furious and disappointed in her. My paycheck hadn’t come in so I wasn’t able to buy it for her but a week later she got her period so she was fine. Then it sorta hit me that when I asked her if we could practice she said no so she could go “hang out” with her boyfriend. I was fine with this as we had months to learn.\nFast forward a bit to when we finally get the sheet music for her song of choice, a french song (my director hates them because he says the proper diction isn’t good for your vocal chords and he doesn’t have time to teach us how to sing it properly/safely either). Keep in mind this is a musical theater song and this is a classical music “competition”. I tell her I’m fine with the song but she has to get it approved by the Mullet (our choir director has a mullet so we call him the mullet). She says she’s too afraid to talk to him so I have to do this for her too. Are you noticing a pattern?\nI show him the music and he says no, I predicted it but she had NO OTHER MUSIC CHOICES, she straight up told me she only thought of that song because she really liked it and didn’t know any other duets. As a classical music student that’s as “proficient” as she claims to be I find this very... suspicious. I brush it off and let our Mullet man pick our piece. He gets it to us three weeks before the duet is supposed to happen and I’m fine with that since it’s an easy song and all, but I’m also a little frustrated because he wants it memorized the next day. I get my shit together and deal with it and memorize my part overnight. She doesn’t. He doesn’t ask us to practice it until a week and a half later and I come to find out, SHE STILL HASNT LEARNED IT. Now at this point I’m like, okay we have a good week to learn this before we get cut. Spoiler alert: We get cut two days before the performance. I create an audio file for her to listen to in her free time hoping she’s learned the other piece. She says she has, but when our accompanist plays it she doesn’t know ANYTHING. I have my parts down but because she’s messing up so much I get a little thrown off and mess up too, not great etiquette for music but I couldn’t help it, I was shocked.\nI decided to make an audio file of that piece too. Now here is where I explain how I make the audio files so you know how painstakingly long this took. I use a program called muse score because I’m cheap and music is a hobby of mine. I transpose music from paper onto the program for audio files all the time, but my program can’t just read the PDFs I upload to them because they have overlapping rhythms. I also can’t just grab recordings because it’s either in a different key or I can’t separate the voice parts. Tough luck. But on average transposing ONE part in any music takes me about an hour and a half for a 3 minute piece. So if we go by roughly 30 minutes a part per piece, and one of our pieces has three instruments plus two voices, and is 4 minutes long. That’s about 10 hours put into one piece. The other piece only has a piano plus our voices and is about a minute and a half, with no overlapping piano rhythms so I got it done in free time during classes (yes I can bring in my laptop to school, yes I can work on my personal things in class, yes my school is weird but shhhhh moving on).\nThen the beast comes in. I’m nervous to start touching this piece because it’s massive and even though it’s repetitive it’s always modulated (key change) or slightly different to the point where I can’t just copy and paste. For singers it’s easy to change, for transposing.... it’s hell.\nSo I get all these done and send them to her over the weekend. I literally spent my entire weekend working on these and declined to hang out with my friends and family just for this. This duet meant the world to me. She comes to me and tells me she’s super busy because she’s doing solo for S&amp;E (solo and ensemble) and that she’s in the women’s ensemble, both of which I am doing too. I tell her it’s fine then she cuts me off and says:\n“I’m also in musical theater so I don’t have time to practice”\nAt this moment I realize I might be fucked. I try to brush off my nervousness as my anxiety coming through the depths of medication and trying to murder me again. Boy was I wrong. Earlier today is the reason I’m typing this. After some ensemble practice I talk to the mullet about the duet and he straight up says:\n“It’s cancelled. You’re not doing it. You guys haven’t practiced.”\nMe: “but I know my part!”\nMullet: “yeah but she doesn’t and it’s a...” he waits for me to finish his sentence.\nMe: “duet...”\nHe then tells me to go practice my solo because I’m shaky on the diction and pronunciation of the Italian song, I speak French so it’s weird to change some of my habits. My friend is sitting there and he jokingly laughs at me, “you’re doing a solo, a duet, and an ensemble? Girl you can’t even sing!” I nervously laugh and walk out the door to tell her our duet was cancelled. She says: Good.\nFUCKING GOOD. I learned later that she thought us practicing was cancelled. I’ll attach my dms with her if asked, but I’m fuckin pissed dude. Am I the asshole for lashing out at her and being pissed she didn’t learn her part?",

      "description": "pretty sure I am, but just want to make sure\n\nSo, I knew this girl for about 2 years, and we started dating last year, in september. They were mine and her's best months of our lifes, but she suffers from anxiety, and she Always thought that it was just too perfect, and something would go wrong anytime, so she broke up. It was weird, because we still loved each other, saying I love you more, angel, cute nicknames, and we hugged a lot in front of people. friends even started thinking we were together again, it was weird. Anyway, carnival came up, and im brazilian, so its pretty chaotic. It made 1 month from when we broke up, and we were good friends. Then i noticed something was odd, she was making a lot of questions about if I would be sad if I saw her kissing another guy, and I told yeah, I still got feelings for her anyway, i would be lying if I said no, but I just want the best for her, even though it would hurt inside. 1 week later, I found out she kissed a guy in the pool for about 10 minutes, and she didnt tell me that. Man, that made me so sad. Knowing that she couldnt trust me, or that she thought that talking about love things with me would make me sad, and was better to hide. kissing for 10 minutes, it wasnt even a big deal, why hiding? We broke up, I wouldnt be sad with her for going on with her life, I was sad by the fact she kept it to herself. We argued a lot about that, and we are really distant at this moment. She told WAY more serious things about what she did, so I think that she doesnt want to tell me only because im her ex. AITA for being so mad at she not telling me about her life, even though im her best friend and she used to do that a lot? sorry for bad english too, im brazilian as I said before.\n\n(I know that she doesnt have the obligation to tell me everything about her life, but she told that to a bunch of friends she doesnt even talk a lot, and that made me feel like shit)\n\nI am 100% sure she didnt broke up because she was cheating, trust me on that one. 100%.

      "description": "I'll try to keep this short.\n\nI'm on Tinder and I see a cute chick so I swipe right. In two of her pics it's clear she has a twin. Cool. Not identical, but close enough. They were both above the shoulder shots. We start talking and she's ramping up to be perfect, you know how crushes are yadda yadda.\n\nThis last weekend we had our first date. I get there early and wait for her outside and she shows up much larger than in her pics, but she's still cute and I'm not a picky man (plus tmi... dat ass). I figured that the pictures she'd used were from last year and that's fine. Not all my pics are recent either, I just threw up my best. \n\nThe date was actually awesome. The crush is still strong even as I'm typing it but... fuck I was suspicious, alright? That whole twin thing was a weird red? yellow? flag, especially how she talked about her sis. Nothing bad, just... dismissive? Idk how to describe it. Anyways, so I check Facebook and the pictures she had used were from her sister's profile (not fully public but one was her profile pic and another one was visible on there so I'm guessing the rest are hers too). And I'm not sure how to feel now. On one hand, I like her. On the other, she's using her sisters pics to get dates and that's... weird?? But they're twins so she legit would look just like her sis if she lost a bit of weight so it's not really lying??? And I get why she did it, we all got flaws we wanna pretend aren't there, but????\n\nI asked my coworker's their opinion and it's divided as fuck (one lad said I was fat-shaming/lacking empathy), so since I found this sub recently I figured I'd ask here.

There is parallel parking  on the streets that is constantly filled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for the situation. Earlier this year, I was looking for street parking. I found a singular open spot that I could park in. I come to a four-way stop as another car pulls up to the opposite stop sign (we are facing each other). The spot that I want is on my side of the street so all I have to do is pull through the intersection and pull into the spot. The person that I am at the intersection decides to pull a U-turn in the intersection and take the spot that I wanted. [Here's a diagram to help understand.](https://imgur.com/gallery/w4oTLbX) Being furious at the situation, I gave him the middle finger as I drove past. \n\nThis was the last block before the residential district started, so I had to loop around the block to get back to downtown. as I am getting back to the same intersection, He is waiting for me and starts taking pictures of me and my car. I had my windows down, so he came over to yell at me. As I drove away, He put a dent in my truck.

      "description": "People keep telling me I’m NTA, but I really feel like I am.\n\nI am a college student who works as a writing tutor. It’s a pretty chill job, and we have a lot of free time. We aren’t required to clock in or out; we just have to write our hours on a timesheet that gets processed each pay period.\n\nI have one coworker (who I’ll call C) who is supposed to work with me on Fridays, but rarely shows up for her shifts. The other week she admitted she had been struggling a bit, and I felt sorry for her, but I still felt frustrated because I would be the only tutor in the room when she didn’t show up. One Friday, there were two people in the writing center at once; I’m just lucky one didn’t need help immediately because, if they did, I would have been screwed. \n\nC has always been super kind to me, and we honestly have had some pretty good conversations. I like her as a person but not so much as a coworker. I really don’t think she’s a bad girl or anything.\n\n\nThis past week one of my other coworkers informed me that C had been lying about the amount of hours she had been working on her timesheet. The timesheets are left in a binder in the room, so everyone can see everyone’s. I looked at hers (shouldn’t have snooped probably), and she had put more hours on her timesheet that she had actually worked. I know this for a fact because I work 5/6 hours the writing center is open on Fridays, and C lied about her hours on a Friday.\n\nWhen I learned about this, I got irrationally angry. I’ll admit that I took it way too personally, even though it wasn’t about me. But I felt like I was being taken advantage of. I tried to think of any reason someone might do it beyond entitlement, desperation, or thinking they could get away with it and genuinely couldn’t come up with anything. I also tried to ask others if they could come up with a reason, too, because I’m autistic and admit that I’m not good at understanding why people do the things they do.\n\nMy other coworkers have been having problems with her, so they were complaining about C to me. This made me even more angry and totally ready to call her out. We have another coworker who has problems similar to C’s, but the reason she’s never been fired was because she didn’t put her CONSTANTLY missed shifts on her timesheet.\n\nMy other coworkers (who were also having problems with her) encouraged me to inform our boss, and because I was as frustrated as they were, I did. My boss’s reaction was just “Ok, I’ll look into it.” And I really don’t anticipate anything substantial coming from it aside from: “Hey. Don’t do that again.”\n\nThis Friday, she was super nice to me yet again. She gave me fries and said various other nice things to me that kind of touched me, to be honest.\n\nNow.... I just feel like a dick for snitching. People are telling me I’m justified, but I just feel like an ass and that I did something I shouldn’t have. I’d love some input, so I can figure this out for myself.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I dated a man for a month and had the unlucky draw of getting pregnant(we used protection). Before I knew I was pregnant, I ended things with him because I found out that he cheated towards the end. I'm not going to lie, while me and him were together, I talked to my ex but never did anything or said anything beyond the point of \"I miss being around you\". Me and my other ex were together for nearly two years. Granted it was shitty of me to say something like that while with someone else and I regret it, he actually cheated. Like went out with another woman and fucked her. Then after we split he sent me screenshots of explicit messages between them, followed by him saying \"I just wanted to get back at you.\" A few weeks later the doctor tells me I'm pregnant. I tell the father and he insists on trying to be together again. I told him I didnt want to be with him because he made me feel really shitty in general. I cant stand being around him anymore. Everything he does gets on my nerves. \nAnyways, after telling him I didnt want to be with him, he responded with \"well the kid probably isnt even mine and I hope it isnt because then I dont have to deal with your lying ass.\" There was a point I wanted to try making it work with him but after realizing how much i despise him, I didnt want to anymore. So I suppose thats why he called me a liar. One of the red flags that he showed was when I didnt want to have sex with him and told him he was being creepy when he wouldnt stop, so he said \"well its not my fault I want to have sex with you! I mean look at you.\" I know he meant it as a compliment but as a victim on rape and sexual assault before, it made me feel unsafe and depressed. \nAfter all these awful things were said from him, I told him I dont want him around and I dont want to contact him during this time. I also told him any efforts to make contact with me wont be considered until after the baby arrives.\nI found out I was pregnant at 6 weeks. I am now 15 and have yet to say anything to the father. I dont want him around during the pregnancy because of the blatant disrespect he has shown for me and my body. I dont want him around daily telling me how I'm a bitch and bad person because of how I refused to be with him and called him predatory. He still tried to message me on new accounts but the messages are never about the baby. Theyre always about how I did him dirty and how I am being a bad mother by not letting him around. He hasnt asked about the baby or its state yet. Only messages slandering me.\nMy brother tells me that it isnt about the relationship between me and the father but between him and his child. Which has made me feel guilty and post this. I feel that I'm doing him wrong by preventing him around me while pregnant with his child. I told him I'd consider letting him around after labor so he can meet his kid but only if he has a job and offers help with the baby(diapers, wipes, clothes, the basics). I also told him he can care for the baby when he gets his own place. He currently lives with his mom and shes a hoarder with 17 cats. Yes you read that right, 17. I know I'm going to hear the classic, \"why did you let yourself get pregnant by someone so scummy?/ why did you date him in the first place?\" And honestly, I saw something in him and he wasnt always rude to me. In the begining he was sweet and respected my space. He told me how he would do anything for me and take care of me no matter what happened. He told me a woman has never stuck around for him when he struggled, which made me want to be that woman.\n\nThis whole thing stresses me out. Especially when people ask about the father. I cant just tell them the truth because most would think I'm keeping a man away from his kid. I cant tell them I dont know because theyll think Im a whore. And i cant tell them he doesnt want to be involved because thats not the complete truth either.",

      "description": "I've lived with my roommate before in college, and now we are living together as young professionals. We've been living in an okay, but very small apartment; she got the bigger room, but we share rent equally (that was D U M B). She works from home for most of the week, which I thought was going to be great living with her again because she was pretty anal about keeping our college apartment clean. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile, this year, even though she's at home all day, she's been bad about cleaning up after herself. She rarely wipes down our kitchen counters or the stove after cooking and has vacuumed our apartment once, and just the main area. She hasn't cleaned the bathroom floor that I know of, and it gets pretty dirty-looking due to white tiles. I used to keep white rugs in the bathroom, but they got super dirty from admittedly both of us walking on them with our shoes on. However, I am the only one who cleaned them. She claims to have cleaned them but she has a weird fear of bleach, so even if she has cleaned them, they never came out \"white.\" (I also am convinced her BF has bad aim, so really don't want them out when he's around) So the last time I washed the rugs, I folded them up and put them under my bed in a garment bag with the rest of my bedding. I also put most of my dish towels in there too, due to the same reason for me being the only person to ever clean them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe texted me today asking about the rugs, and I told her that I didn't want them to get ruined and that I was the only person taking care of them, and she asked me to put them back in the bathroom, and \"why would you have things you don't use?\" Followed by: you know I don't use bleach, and they are just white rugs. This is coming from a girl who hoards all of her nice things in her room and only uses her nice purses/shoes/whatnot when her bf is around. She also frequently leaves wet rags on my wooden cutting board, left boot marks on my nice runner for the hallway, and almost broke my Dyson vacuum cleaner by trying to pry it apart to release the debris in the container. \n\nAITA wanting to keep things, even simple white rugs, nice and away from her?",

      "description": "This is really weighing on my shoulders and was hoping Reddit could help. Throwaway to maintain privacy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: I'm in my mid/late 20's, haven't lived at home in 10 years, financially independent, great relationships with both parents who are friends but no longer together. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have recently learned that I have to get a small surgery *on my face* to remove a growth. I have never had surgery before, never had local anesthesia and I'm terrified. I have told my parents that I am not scared. Tried the route of if I pretend I'm fine, I will be fine. \n\nMy mother has been depressed lately, unsure of what she wants to do with her life, wants to move but does not know where. She up and left for a three week trip to Florida right after I got the news of my upcoming surgery and I took her car and our shared dog to babysit. \n\nIt is now four days into her trip and she's booked a last minute flight back for my surgery against my wishes. I told her that I don't want her to come. If she does come, I requested she does not stay with me and does not come with me to surgery.\n\nMy reasons: \n\n\\-She will make (and already has made) this into a bigger deal than it is, I'm already scared and it will make (and has made) me feel even more stressed out and scared than I have to be.   \n\\-Even just talking on the phone about it, she cries and makes me panic. Can't even imagine what it will be like in person.  \n\\-She will baby me and try to stop me from going to work, doing work, feeling like an adult or feeling brave at all.  \n\\-I have a small apartment, we share a bed when she visits, she sleeps in the middle with the dog, they push me off the bed and wake me up with her night terrors. I want to have a good night sleep before and after surgery.   \n\\-I want to be alone the nights before and after, stick to my morning routines, get work done, meditate and get myself in a good head space as best I can.   \n\\-I don't want her to cut her much needed vacation short for my sake. This is extra stress on me, making me feel guilty when I want to be focused on my health.   \n\\-My dad lives and works close to where my doctor is and will be able to pick me up so she is not logistically needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the flip side is, she is depressed. This is her moment to feel needed, like a mother, and I am denying her of that for my own reasons. I am letting her needs take the back seat to my mental state.   \n\n\nSo, AITA for not letting my mother be a mother? I feel like I am. But maybe I'm not?",

I've never been level enough to do raids and things but with BFA I got that boost and have been running current content until recently. He introduced me to Mount Grinding and I'm having a good time.\nOne that I'm running a lot right now, mostly to spite another friend who's been trying to get Invincible's reins since the expansion was first released is Icecrown Citadel. This is where it all started.\n\nI'm a completionist. I've been working on the Loremaster achievements for a while just to feel complete. Like I've achieved something and that everything is complete.\nHe introduced me to the \"Glory to the Raider\" achievements and when I was first raiding brought up the \"Glory to the Icecrown Raider\" mount and said it's another I can go after.\n\nFast forward to last night, he was getting upset and saying I can do anything BUT \"Glory for the Icecrown Raider\" he said he's 'unique' in his group and the undead dragon is aestheticly perfect for his deathknight and if I get it then he's going to be pissed and have to find a new mount.\n\nNow\nAm I the asshole if I still do the raids and get Glory of the Icecrown Raider?\nI'm not doing it primarily for the mount but for the achievement and having done it. The mount is secondary to me.\nWe also play different factions(I play alliance, he plays horde) so we never play with each other and I don't know if I'm even considered a part of his friend group that he wants to be special in.\n\nPersonally I think his argument is a bit childish and stupid to get mad at me for doing it too. If I do do it I don't plan on using the mount just so he can still be 'special' and feel 'unique' and because like I said. As cool as the mount is, it's secondary to me just wanting to complete things.\n\n Am I the asshole if I still do it even after he practically begged to me last night not to do it so he's still 'special'?\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend wants to stay 'special' in his group with his raid mount. Said he'll get pissed if I run the raids to get the achievement since I'll get the mount out of it. AITA if I still run the raids for the achievement but never use the mount so he can still be 'special'?\n",

Well I found what I believe to be the perfect litter to choose a puppy from so I show my husband all the information I’ve gathered. He didn’t seem crazy about the conclusion I’ve come to so I thought ok, he’s looking for something different than I in regards to this puppy. So I go back to doing research and looking for available puppies. I found another that fits almost all of our parameters so I show my husband again. He’s a little more enthusiastic about this one and says if I want it I should go get it. Which is great but I can still sense apprehension from him. I decided to ask him about this apprehension that he has surrounding a new puppy. He comes back saying he doesn’t want a 10 year commitment only to end in heartbreak when the dog dies (his parents had to put down one of the dogs he grew up with about a year ago) and that he would have most of the responsibility. Now, I disagree because I’m a SAHM and I’m home all the time so really I’d be the one to take care of it most.

      "description": "So here's the thing, where I live rent is 450, Internet is 50, and all the utilities together at most is 350. So roughly 850. Between two people it should be about 425. Well, we had to kick him out because he told everyone he had to pay too much and we were lying to him about rent/utilities. He's lived with us for over a year and we only ever actually had him pay 300 instead of 425 because he had a shit job. He never paid on time and spent his money on stupid things before paying bills. He blocked everyone in the house even though he owes partial rent (125) because he moved out on the 15th. We even let his girlfriend live there too. Our friends are mad at us for kicking him out and keeping his furniture, but he owes us money so am I the asshole here? And how am I supposed to give him his crap back if he's blocked us all? Not to mention he didn't even clean his room and the room was so disgusting there was mold and nats everywhere that I had to clean. 🤷",

      "description": "When we got together (dating) she was a little chubby and I was up front that I wanted her to slim down and she said yeah Ive always wanted to get real fit so it was cool. The plan was to work out together, get ripped. \n\nDidnt go that way. We both gained weight together sitting around binge eating/watching netflix then I lost about 60 lbs over a year with a diet and she didnt eat any different. \n\nShe kept gaining and now her body shape is totally different and Im not into it, shes heavy enough that I get a gust of wind when she sits on the couch and shes always out of breath when she eats. \n\nEvery time I bring it up she says oh yeah Im going to, just waiting for this or that but lately I feel like thats just something she says, and 3 years seems like a long enough time to find some kind of way.\n\nIve told her up front \"if you want this to work I need to be attracted to you\" but her habits never change. \n\nEvery other part of our relationship is going well and I think were great friends but the attraction is really going away. She makes most of the money and works really hard to make us comfortable, which I thought might be too much pressure so I said Id take over all my expenses but she fought me, saying she wanted to stay a team.\n \nAt this point its not about how things are right now as much as me not knowing if shes ever going to do what she says or just keep getting bigger.\n\nAm I the asshole for being so focused on her body?",

      "title": "AITA because I completely lost it with a lady who tried to cut in front of me TWICE at a large grocery store?",
      "description": "I was at a large grocery store yesterday and I walked up to the butcher area to ask for assistance but there was one person ahead of me. When the person finished, I was just about to ask the butcher my question when a woman cut in front of me and asked him, \"Hi, can you please help me in the freezer aisle?\" The butcher said \"yes\" and was about to follow her when I interjected, \"Sir, I was here first.\" I swear I saw an eye roll on his part but whatever.\n\nMoving on. I had a cart full of groceries and I stood in line to check out. There was a woman who was unloading her packed cart so I waited a few feet behind her because had I moved my cart forward, I would have been blocking the traffic for other customers to walk through. Then, I see the same woman, who cut me off in the butcher station, nonchalantly walk in front of me and then she proceeded to unload her items onto the conveyor belt. I told her, \"Excuse me, ma'am, I've been waiting here. I'm next in line.\" She gave me a smug look and said, \"Ha, if you're next, then why are you standing back there and not here??\" So I told her, \"Because I don't want to block the flow of traffic walking by but I AM NEXT.\"\n\nGuys, she continued to argue with me saying, \"Well....you should've moved forward\" and then she proceeded to start unloading her groceries. Keep in mind that I am not a confrontational person. In my 44 years on this planet, I have never been in a fist fight, In fact, I used to be a major pushover. If I was 18, I may have told her, \"You're right, go ahead.\" Well, that's not what happened.\n\nI. SAW. RED. I YELLED at her, \"Listen lady, I'm a civilized person who takes others into consideration UNLIKE YOU who would have most likely not give two $hits and would've blocked this entire area. Now put your $hit back into your cart NOW or I'm going to go over there and do it for you!\" Then, the kind lady that was about to pay told her, \"Seriously? You need to move because she has been waiting.\" You'd think that she would have backed off? Nope. She continued to unload her groceries muttering that I should've been closer and not standing so far in the back.\n\nI'm ashamed to say that I made a scene. Again, I yelled, \"I'm NOT going to tell you again. Get your $hit and put it back into your effing basket or I'll go and do it myself. NOW.\" She then took a good look at me and started putting her things back in her cart and walked away. I would imagine that by this point, my eyes were crossing and my head was two seconds from spinning like the kid from the Exorcist. I can't remember the last time I've felt so angry.\n\nShe finally moved but she kept staring me down and I'm ashamed to tell you guys that I screamed \"WHAT THE F\\*\\*K ARE YOU LOOKING AT????????\" She finally looked away and as quick as this started, it ended. The nice lady that was in front of me patted me on my back and told me that she was impressed how I defended myself but to please calm down because I looked like I was about to pass out.\n\nTo be honest, at this point in my life, I've let people walk all over me. If this had happened ten years ago, I would've let her go on ahead of me. Not now. I'm a jaded, middle aged woman who is not the one. Don't get me wrong, what came out of me yesterday felt like an out of body experience. I'm not a mean person. She just sparked something in me that threw me over the edge.\n\nEdit: This may or may not be relevant, but I'm a Mexican American and all of this occurred in Spanish. I am a fluent bilingual speaker but I usually speak English. I didn't even know that I could fight the way I did in Spanish. Believe me, if you guys knew how to speak Spanish, I would've written the exact exchange I had with this entitled twit. I don't know why but when arguments happen in Spanish, it looks like a much bigger deal!! ha!\n\nSo be honest, I'm a big girl. Was ITA?\n\nTL;DR: A lady cut line in front of me twice and I lost my marbles.",

      "description": "Backstory: we were froemds for a year. During the end we often saw eachother when she needed a free baby sitter. \nOne day back in May '16 I was supposed to have her 1 year old sleep over for the whole weekend. She dropped him off Friday night and I watched him till Sunday morning. She picked him up and was going to drop him off Sunday evening so she could go get lit with some friends. All day Sunday I was doing landscaping work and gardening with my son and husband. I started to feel sick so I took a pregnancy test and suprise suprise! I was pregnant! I told my dad and husband, and my dad offered to take me out to dinner and my husband was to stay home with our son; something that had NEVER happened. \nAnyway, I called my friend and apologized to her that I couldn't watch her 1 year old for 72 hours, and I told her that I hoped the 36 hour break she had was enough time to recharge. \nIt wasn't. She blocked everything from me and told me I was an awful person for wanting to celebrate my pregnancy with a nice dinner and early night. \n\nFast forward to recently, she called me out of the blue asking to talk. She needed a sitter for her 2 kids. I obliged and met her for coffee. \nI bought my coffee and sat down with her. Assured her that I wasnt mad for the past etc, and i wanted to hear her conditions. \nShe wanted me to babysit both her kids from 730am-930 pm Mon-Fri she would bring snacks with them and I could watch them at my place or hers, and she wanted to \"help me\" by paying me $600 a month for that. \nAfter we discussed all the details around homeschooling (we both homeschool so she wanted me to be a teacher as well) \nI calmly got up and told her. \n\"How fucking stupid do you think I am? I just came here to see you aplologize for throwing me to the curb when I found put I was pregnant.\" \nAnd I left the coffee shop. ",

No big deal, I’ve met him and up until then wasn’t worried about him. Flash forward a few hours and she’s been drinking. I get a FaceTime from her where she’s frantically looking for her contact in his bed. She tells me flat out that she made him leave the room so we could talk. I hang up to process what I just heard. I text her asking why the fuck she’s in his bed and she said that they aren’t doing anything and she’s just trying to sleep. That’s a huge red flag for me. I tell her to get out of his room and to sleep on a couch, which she does, and I tell her goodnight. Flash forward to last night. She texts me to tell me that she’s going to play beer pong at his house with her friends again. I tell her I’m not comfortable with that because we still haven’t gotten through what happened the week before. She tells me that he’s her friend and she wants to see her friends tonight. I tell her that if she wants to go there she can be single because I can’t trust her with him at this point. She tells me she’s going anyways and then we break up. I told her this is a direct result of her actions from the following week and my inability to trust her drinking in his house. So Reddit, am I the asshole here??",

      "description": "So my gf (22f) and I (23m) have been together for about a year and a half, and have been long distance for almost a year. She's in her last year of school so when she graduates in a month we won't be doing long distance anymore. We live about two hours apart so we still see each other about once a week. \n\nBack in the fall she became friends with this guy from one of her classes. One night back in November she went out with a group of her friends and him and a couple of his friends. She ended up going back to his house to postgame (her friends went home). She ended up staying there until about 4am and would periodically post snapchat stories of him and his friends singing and playing guitar (the guy and his friends are in a band) and the whole time she was ignoring my texts. This lead to us getting into several fights over the next two weeks and we came very close to breaking up. \n\nSince then things between us have been great. We worked out a lot of issues that had arose from being long distance. She is still friends with this guy but they don't hang out as often. What does kind of bug me is that they're best friends with each other on snapchat, and the two of us don't snapchat very often (I know that sounds kind of immature but whatever it bugs me I can't help it). \n\nEvery once in a while she will say something like \"oh this guy might come out with us tonight, he's so nice I really want you to meet him\"or \"I really think you Guys would be good friends you're very similar\". Stuff like that. \n\nI trust my girlfriend and since nothing like that night in November has happened again I'm not gonna try to interfere with their friendship because she's her own person and I can't control who she's friends with. However, the other night she said that he really wants to meet me and I told her I'm sorry but I have no desire to meet this guy, which she said was mean. \n\nI felt like this was fair given the fact that they graduate in a month so I likely won't really build a friendship with him at this point, and because of the stuff that I pointed out already this just isn't someone I'm particularly fond of. \n\nAm I an asshole for telling her I have no desire to meet this guy?",

We have so much in common, we're studying the same thing, we both are going to intern at the same company this summer, we like the same TV shows, etc. She's like my soulmate and my god she is soo attractive.\n\nAnyway I've been spending a lot more time with B recently and A has started to notice and is getting upset because she says that I'm 'dating' B (which is technically true), but I think she's just being jealous and getting angry because I have female friends which isn't fair.\n\nThis weekend I spoke to B about our feelings for each other and she told me that she likes me aswell and that I should break up with A before getting with her which I agree with. I also slept with B the next day which confirmed that I 100% want to end it with A and start something with B but my problem is that I don't know how to do it without breaking A's heart and having her friends/family think the worst of me. Especially becuase I'll be with B. I don't want to look like a scumbag or anything, I just want to do me and be chill but it's hard because A is definitely the type to tell everyone that I'm a bad person. \n\n\nBut I don't think I'm the asshole here? It's not fair to A to stay in a relationship where I don't love her - so I'm a good guy by breaking up with her. I'm also getting in a relationship with B and making her happy - so I'm also a good guy by dating B. Why am I an asshole?? Because it's her best friend, is that the only reason? I just don't see it because at the end of the day it's a net positive for everyone involved, and if A wants she can still be friends with B there's no problem with that.\n\n",

      "description": "Hi all, throwaway account here.\n\nMy friend (19) recently talked to me (18) and asked me to stop talking to them about money. They said it makes them uncomfortable since I grew up with a lot more than them. This is regarding conversations about houses, cars, apartments, loans, etc. (However, they began a couple conversations since- me: \"My bike is old\" them: \"oh, mine's nice! It was a gift awhile ago.\" me: \"Mine too, my aunt bought it \\[a mountain bike\\] for a couple hundred in 1996 and handed it down when she stopped using it. It's worth like 50 now, lol\" them: \"ha, our house was like a couple hundred! Well, a couple thousand\"- that I just have to listen to since I was asked not to contribute).\n\nThey don't leave the dorm after class much so when I go to the markets on campus I offer to pick something up for them. My other friends (19 and 20) do this as well/with vending machines, and never ask to be paid back. They both grew up with less than me; one has worked on campus last semester-now, one just started, and the main friend does not work while at school.\n\nSo here's the thing: My family's upper middle class, but I don't get an allowance, didn't get a new car when I turned 16 (reasonably nice hand-me-down at 17), and all college loans are in my name (parents do contribute to my tuition though). I pay about $25-30,000/year for this school (out of state, no financial aid, loans), main friend only pays $2-4,000 (in state, plus financial aid and maybe? a loan). I work off-campus several hours/week plus my courseload for all my spending/saving money. I hate my job but it pays 9.35/hour (which I worked for 2 years to get, up from under 8). (Main friend works for minimum wage only at home.) I've earned myself over $2,000 (plus all my saved birthday/xmas checks since childhood). Main friend talks often about moving money from their savings to checkings to afford basic stuff like a bus ticket home, food, etc and makes jokes about having only a couple hundred dollars.\n\nAMITA for wanting to be paid back if I get something for my friend (more than a few dollars)? I want to be a good friend so I offered to pick up some meds for them while I'm out tomorrow but I wouldn't spend over $5 on medicine for myself and they want name-brand stuff, $10+. I know they likely won't have it in cash and I don't want to ask for their card. It's really bugging me because they're a good friend and I don't want this to come between us, but I feel it's unfair to continually buy them stuff.",

I wanted to tell her about my feelings but decided not to, still wanted to continue that friendship. \n\nMonths later, in September, she tells me that she was friends with benefits with that guy for all summer, but now she wanted to end it and he didn't agree. \nI couldn't care less. \nMy feelings were still there, less intense but still hurting.\n\nAlso, I felt betrayed by her, because she never told me about that guy, while I shared with her every aspect of my life, but maybe that was the younger me overreacting. \n\nIt's December, my friendship with Susie is wracked. \nI can't talk to her without feeling sad, so I skip several days before answering her texts, which are more small talks rather than the heartful conversations we had before. \n\nIn the end, she got together with that guy and posts pics everywhere, and I can't stand it. \n\nI decide to wrap up my courage and write a text explaining to her why I acted certain ways, how I felt about the kiss, about everything. \n\nI write to her that I can't stand it anymore and that I wanted everything to go back to normal, to us just being regular friends again. \n\nBut now everything is awkward, I don't know how to talk to her, she doesn't either, we text less and less often, until I decide to block her, because this situation is hurting me and I have to let go. \n\nAITA?

A few weeks ago Mary was asked out by Joe. Joe  later said it was stupid of him to ask her out because he doesn't have any feelings towards her and he just jumped the gun because they had so much in common. She rejected him, of course. But now she says it's super awkward and she hates him. By the way she acts it feels like Joe is Romeo pondering over his lost love and crying at night over Mary's rejection, but he truly doesn't seem to care and still considers her a good mate and has nothing but nice things to say about her, though she tells me she goes out of her way to avoid him. He actually asked me out as well. I rejected him too (although I might actually see what dating him is like since I do fancy him and only rejected him because my cousin told me I had to) I guess he's just desperate for a girlfriend. Anyway me and my mates are going to a local concert next Thursday and my best mate and I asked him to come as well which he said yeah. But Mary, who also planned to go is super pissed at me. She says it'll be so awkward because he asked her out and he's practically her \"ex\" that we're choosing him over her. I told her she can uninvite him if she truly wants but she said no, I should be the one to do it. I told her to grow up, but now I feel guilty because I feel like I am choosing him over her. Should I uninvite him? AITA for hanging out with him? ",

      "description": "I have been with the same cohort of graduate students for 3 years. This is our last semester and we should in my opinion be cruising to the finish line. This semester we are taking a course together that runs from 9am to 3:30pm because of our professors wishes not to meet on separate days.\n\nStarting last semester my colleagues and I have noticed aggression from one of our colleagues. They aren't physically harming us but their comments are combative and are accompanied by a noticeable frustration and hostility. Several times now the class environment has degraded from an amicable exchange of ideas to an outright argument.\n\nDuring our last meeting this individual directed his venom at me. I tried different tactics to avoid escalation but I ended go having to walk out of the classroom. I tried diffusing with jokes, with silence, with agreeableness but the professot insisted on continuing an uncomfortable exchange. After I left 2 out of the students in class sent me texts acknowledging the situation asking if I was ok and noting how intense the exchange had become.\n\nI have 3 emails which I have sent to my professor and she is aware of the students rude /foul behavior. She has promised me she will intervene next time but never actually does.\n\nIt has gotten so bad that 4 of us have requested we change the format of the class from a seminar style to individual meetings with our professor.\n\nOur professor has denied our requests and has emailed us telling us she will absolutely not intervene in any discussions/arguments and that she refuses to change the format. We are all uncomfortable and the class has become tedious and dreadful. She has told us this is a character building process.\n\nI have considered filing a formal complaint but am worried about the academic repercussions.\n\nI refuse to argue with the hostile person for several reasons. I dont think it's healthy. I suffer from anxiety and do not fare well in combative situations. I am comfortable discussing and defending my position but this person raises their voice, has told me to be quiet and wait my turn to speak, gets visibly angry, and will not be reasoned with. I am not sure what is expected from me.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL:DR - there is an asshole getting hostile in our class and our professor is validating their behavior by taking a hands off approach. I am thinking of filing formal complaints.\n\n\nUPDATE: My colleagues met outside of class and thought up some strategies to controlling the dialog going forwards. We will not tolerate yelling, screaming, or disrespectful behavior by basically shutting the class down. \n\nI confronted the rude student in person and that seemed to work well, they were no where near as aggressive when alone. This makes me believe the behavior is some sort of insecurity and not actual aggression. \n\nThe professor should be prepared for some rather harsh end of term reviews. ",

      "description": "So I work at a jewelry store and while I enjoy the product and the people, I've had a few issues there that have all lead to this moment. This will be quite long as there's a lot of backstory so TLDR at the end.\n\nI'm a university student, and have been in school full time up until this point, and working at this store for the past year and a little bit. I am now going to be taking a couple of semesters off because I have some health issues that need to be dealt with and my body really needs a break... I've definitely been pushing too hard for a while. And a lot of my health issues (the main one being chronic severe ulcers) stem from stress and anxiety, which this job doesn't exactly help with. \n\nAt this job, they heavily stress numbers. ADS (average dollar sale), UPT (units per transaction), AUR (average unit retail), conversion (how many people who come in buy) are all looked at for each individual several times a day. It's very high pressure and they set some very unrealistic goals for us every week. At the end of every week your stats are posted and ranked with other employees. Beyond that there are a LOT of other jobs that need to be done and basically if you aren't constantly moving, you aren't doing enough. One of these jobs is visuals and there are a LOT of displays which are constantly being changed. Our store sells charm bracelets (I'm sure you can guess from that where I work) and so a lot of time and effort goes into styling a display. It was noticed fairly early into my time here that I'm very fast and efficient at creating displays and can get one up in about half the time of any other employee without sacrificing the quality of the designs. And so while this job used to be given out equally to all employees, and a lot of it was done by a girl who's a team lead but also the visuals manager... for a long time now, these jobs have been given almost exclusively to me, to the point where I have often been responsible for almost every unit in the store and the girl who's actually getting paid for this job does almost none of it. I am also the one who entirely maps out the entire store for inventory and basically have to make what I call the scrapbook from hell... a book with a picture of and barcode for every item in display, in order, so that they don't have to take anything off display to count for inventory. This is a mind numbing job that takes days and always leaves me as basically a zombie.\n\nBecause of this, and the constant pressure they are always putting on us, this job has always caused me a lot of stress and caused some issues with my health... but despite all of that, I've always loved working here. It should also be noted that I make minimum wage, and there is no commission. Just a really poorly thought out incentives program that nobody really benefits from. So I'm getting paid a pittance to do a lot more work than I would be doing at any retail job and its wrecking my health to boot.\n\nNow this summer I got married, and this has been amazing but also difficult at times because just after getting married, my husband started working graveyards... this severely cuts into the time we spend together, even if it's just sleeping together... we've been doing our best but me taking time off school definitely had the added benefit of allowing us more time together... or so we thought. You see up until now, my availability has always been respected because I'm in school. Now however, they've basically told me that my availability is merely a suggestion and they'll schedule me when they want and I have to be there. I had told them for the holidays that I would work Thu-Mon anytime, just not Tue/Wed because those are my husbands days off and we want to make the most of them. I actually feel this is quite generous of me because this means that when my manager shifts me to close on any days DH is working, then I dont see him for 48 hours or sometimes more. I've been dealing with this because it's the holiday season and we get obscenely busy and I want to be of as much help as possible, even though this really does take a toll on our relationship. The plan was to make myself only available until about 6:30 after the holidays so we always got at least an hour or two together every day. Now I feel as though I can't do that because they won't even respect the two days I said I can't work so why would they respect my preferred hours? They know my situation and that for the sake of this stupid store I have actually gone nearly 4 days straight without seeing him, but the dont seem to give a shit. \n\nNow the difficulty comes from the fact that boxing day is a Wednesday. I literally have no problem with the fact that I'm working Christmas Eve, I only care about boxing day because it's one of his only days off and I am genuinely not open to work those days. I told my manager this and she took the shift down and then a couple of hours later put it back up and told me higher ups said she had to because it's a holiday so availability means shit right now. \n\nI told her that I will likely have to look for work elsewhere where my availability will be respected, and that I'm tired of just being a number in this company that cares so little about its employees. What I didnt say is that I think with how hard I work and how little I work for I deserve at least the courtesy of observing the days I'm unable to work. I do way more than the average sales associate in this store and worlds more work than the average retail worker because this crazy company thinks they're some sort of high end store and that we should be grateful to be doing twice the work for minimum freaking wage. Also our previous manager actually hired enough seasonal workers last year that I didn't even have to work Christmas Eve so I'm pretty annoyed that my manager being so picky has put me in this position. \n\nI told her I would stick around until Christmas Eve because the last thing I want to do is leave her in a tight spot, and that we can talk about it when I see her next but at the end of the day, my marriage comes first. She saw the message (through our work app) but hasn't responded. \n\nAm I The Asshole? Am I at least justified in wanting to find other work? They're definitely making me feel like the bad guy here...\n\nTLDR My store refuses to respect my availability (which is quite reasonable, and I'm already making many sacrifices for them) despite the fact that my husband works night shifts and I sometimes go days without seeing him due to them not caring about the availability I've given. Boxing day is one of his days off and I've basically been told they don't care what the situation is, they can do whatever they want because it's a holiday. I've said I'll stay until Christmas Eve for their sake and then I'll be finding other employment. ",

Because I feel bad for her being stuck at home, whenever she tells me she wants to go clothes shopping or furniture shopping I occasionally babysit all of them, even though they're so little. I'm well enough compensated for it, and I enjoy children so I don't really mind it.\n\nHowever I found out recently that even when she tells me she's going to a certain place, she's actually been going to her husband's work to make out/have sex with him there. When I ask her where all she went, because I'm curious about her shopping as a friend, she would outright lie to me like \"Ohhh there was a lot of traffic that's why it took so long\" or \"I actually spent a long time walking around in that store and looking at everything haha\".\n\nI don't mind that she feels a need to spend time with her husband, and I've even babysat when they've gone out on dates late into the night. \n\nHowever, I feel extremely insulted and grossly taken advantage of because she's been so dishonest especially ABOUT sexual stuff, so I told her I won't babysit again without telling her the reason. I feel like if she's using my time and energy of babysitting to be out and about, the least humanly decent thing would be to be honest if I ask how she spent that time. Or at least say \"I'd rather not let you know\" instead of full blown-out lies.\n\n Should I not care so much? Would I be an asshole if I called her out on her actions directly?",

      "description": "So this is a short AITA . Oh and the formatting and stuff is for mobile so just and FYI.\n\n Simple put me and a girl I see every week went on a couple dates and it didn't really click due to conflict in interests. I like video games and western culture and she like art and Korean culture to the point it conflicts. But recently I've seen that she has actually noticed everything I do and what I wear complimenting how I dress and overall just being that nice person she is. Also I should point out she doesn't do this to any other guy just me even going out of her way to walk across the room to say hello. My problem is that I've tried to take her on dates and we just don't stick. \n \n So here's the AITA I've actively avoided her advances but in a passive way, like with dry answers and such because she is still my friend but I don't know should I try it out I mean worse comes to worse I break her heart if it doesn't work out or I could just live with it. Now keep in mind it is hard for my 300 pound ass to find a girl so there's the desperation talking as well. So AITA what do you guys think I can do to not be the Ass if so?",

      "description": "Ive been called an asshole and a hypocrite over this so lets see what you guys think.\n\nMy mother is an alcoholic, and a bad one. Shes done terrible things to me and my sister, and we've each experienced emotional, rarely physical abuse from her. My father is a weak man who allowed his drunk wife to abuse his kids because hes afraid of conflict. So with that recipe for success we've had 20+ years of bullshit.\n\nMy mom has gone in and out of programs and supposedly went to a rehab at some point, but she fell off the wagon. Hey cycle is a week of no issues, then one day a week where shes a drunken blabbering fool. She knows that when she drinks she hurts other people, but she does it anyway so I resent her for this. Now she dissapears for days on end then reappears randomly again like nothing happened. This also annoys me because I feel like if she dies on one of these trips ill blame myself, so im more angry at her.\n\nBut im also an adult now and im through trying to fix people. I can only control myself and my mom is her own person, and i cant help her. Its a tough thing to admit but its the truth. I just try to enjoy the good times we have left.\n\nSo anyway thats the backstory. My sister is a drama queen. Idk if my moms alcoholism really affected her since my mom favored her for years as shes a girl and im a guy. I guess she related better with my sister so i got the brunt of it, but my sister also saw some bad shit no question.\n\nMy sister likes causing fights. She will routinely degrade my brother in law verbally in ways not even our drunken mother did to us, but shes sober.\n\nMy brother in law is my best friend so i have to see my sister still. She has recently been publicly drinking in front of my mother when we're all out to dinner. She knows that its tempting to my mom. I know that if my mom sees booze shes going to want to go on a bender and it bothers the fuck out of me that my sister does this. \n\nThe moments when mom is with us and happy are so rare, why ruin that? So i told her in private to cut it out. She then brings up my own drinking, which i do with my brother in law at restaurants some times.\n\nI enjoy whiskey and ive been drunk once before. Idk maybe its not good for me given my family history but i dont let anyone know, especially my mom. I dont feel like an alcoholic since I only drink casually with friends or on special occasions. \n\nThe main difference imo is not doing it in front of mom. I would never drink with family. But she thinks im being a hypocrite. Am i?",

      "description": "I've had a friend for about 13 years. The entire time he has basically been a bum, working off and on, and has quit jobs because child support caught up with him, because he didn't feel like driving, cause it was too hot, cause it was too windy, because he just didn't want to work their anymore. \n\nAt one point he was going good, was able to finance a car and was working and being a better father. Then his job made him mad, he quit, car got repossessed. \n\nAt one point he was supposed to be going back to school and after a wk a past school debt stopped him from continuing. He had to pay 600.00. I told him to get a job and pay it so he can go back. He decided that he was gonna wait for his GF to get her taxes/school check so she can pay for it. Its been over a year and this still hasn't happened. \n\nRecently, their landlord ended their lease (probably due to constant late payment and complaints from the neighbors about weed smoke coming into their kids room) and he asked if him, his GF and her kid and her GF can stay with me. The good in me said yes, the real in me wanted to say HELL NO!!\n\nLong story shorter...the lease ended at the end of oct. That means they had 30 days to find a place and have the money together. If you were planning on paying rent the next month, then that means you just need to save a security deposit. November came and they decided they weren't moving because the landlord didn't give them enough time. So that is now Two months where you did not pay any rent. They came to my house the beginning of December and I told them do not pay me rent, save so you can get out you have 30 days with a 7 days grace period due to the holidays. \n\nA few days before he is supposed to be out he say, well we gonna start applying for places next week. um excuse me?? you should already be out by the time you can start applying and you are just now saying something. I told them they could stay a few more days but they have to leave.\n\nPut my foot down and now they found a place.\n\nAITA asshole for not wanting to be his friend anymore? He is older than me and has a GF. Im a single mom of 3. They have 4 adults who are all working age in their home and only 2 work.\n\nHis  irresponsibility landed his family in my home. I know I didn't have to say yes, but I feel like I just don't wanna be his friend anymore.\n\nHe is worthless and there is really no point in our friendship. I cant take him seriously when he cant even take care of himself or his family or the kids he created. \n\nWhen he leaves im planning on telling him until he becomes a productive member of society we cant be friends and if he doesn't want to be my friend even after than, Im willing to take that loss.

      "description": "A little background, I'm a college freshman in the Midwest US and I met this girl at the start of last semester. We hit it off and after being friends for a while we started dating. I thought we both loved eachother but in January she asked for a break because she didn't know if she wanted a relationship at that time, she still wanted to spend time together like when we were friends and get back together after a week or 2, I was okay with that so we went on a break. We kept talking but one day when we were laying together in my bed, cuddling (we didn't have sex while we were on our break), I noticed she was talking a lot about a new coworker, I jokingly said 'man, he's gonna be dissapointed when he finds out you don't want a relationship right now' and she got this really guilty look on her face and said 'I actually have some strong feelings for him'. I was silent for a second and said 'I think we had different ideas of what was going on between us' and asked her to leave and give me a few days to clear my head so I could think of what I'm gonna do next. \n\nShe left me alone for a few weeks but lately she's been kinda playfully bugging me in our mutual classes, taking my hat, smiling and waving at me when we're sat apart, shit like that. I know things didn't work out with her coworker, and I feel like she may have been trying to win me back by acting like she did before we were together. I was fucking pissed, I asked her verbatim 'Please leave me alone, with the way things ended I'm not comfortable around you anymore and I'm trying to move on with my life'. And so she stopped. Earlier today I was at the dining hall with my roommate and I saw her from across the room, we made eye contact and she immediately started crying and left.\n\nI feel awful that she's upset, I may not love her anymore but I still care about her well being and want to see her happy. Did I handle things wrong? How can I make sure she knows that I don't resent her?",

      "description": "A few of my friends and my brother and our mutual friends went out to a club one night. My brother and his friends begged me to DD them so I did. Everything was going really well and the club was closing at 2:00am. At 1:30am all my friends were ready to leave and I was ready to go home. I let my brother know I would be outside making sure my other friends got into cabs and that I was ready to leave right after. \n\nIt takes a while to round up drunk people so at 1:45am they finally come out and me, my brother, and my brothers two friends are all walking to the car. My brother and one of our friends, let’s call him Alex, were having some sort of argument. I didn’t really think anything of it because they’re drunk. We get to my car and my brother is visibly more upset so I finally ask him what’s wrong. He says Alex’s girlfriend was talking crap about me the whole night about a plethora of things as well as me wanting to leave early. \n\nAlex and I have been friends since childhood so I was pretty shocked by this. Alex’s girlfriend has never really been nice to any of the friends and the whole night didn’t talk to me but I didn’t think she hated me. The general consensus among all the friends is she’s pretty rude and unfriendly. \n\nI asked if this was true and the other friend, let’s call him John, confirmed it. I asked Alex and he’s said yes and I asked him if he told her off or stuck up for me considering we are friends and he said no. So I asked him why would I do him a favour if he can’t even stick up for me and that he could cab, walk home or get a ride with his gf if we weren’t actually friends. He got upset and said “fine I will” and walked away and I took everyone else home. \n\nOf course my brother and I received nasty text messages from Alex’s girlfriend who claimed she was “sober” and I was being a “dumb bitch” to which I replied “if you’re sober drive him home then” and then I blocked her. Alex cabbed home just fine but I can’t help feeling bad about leaving him stranded and basically punishing him for the actions of his gf. \n\nAlex and my brother are no longer friends and obviously neither am I. We are both just letting him ride this relationship out without being involved anymore. \n\nAnyways, TLDR: AITA for not dd-ing my friend home after I said I would because their SO talked shit about me and they didn’t stick up for me?

      "description": "So my friend (F16) has been dating this emotionally abusive guy (M22) since she was 14. The age gap is already weird and creepy but i could look past that if it wasn't for the fact that he's really obsessive, mean, jealous, toxic and treats her like shit most of the time, not to mention he doesn't have a job and dropped out of highschool. \n\nThis relationship has caused me and my friend to drift apart, because any time we would hang out she was on her phone texting hil constantly, because if she didn't reply to him within 5 mins then he would blow up her phone and harass her. i've tried talking her out of it several times but she just won't listen.\n\nHer birthday came around, and we didn't see each other like we usually do, as she was spending the day with, you guessed it, her boyfriend. instead of posting a public \"happy birthday\" snap on my snapchat story (like i usually do with close friends) i simply texted her \"happy birthday ❤️\" . She proceeded to act really weird and when i asked her what's wrong, she first ignored me, then she said it felt weird that i congratulated her the way i did. i then explained to her that we aren't as close anymore because of her toxic relationship and that i still think it's dissapointing that she's with him after everything he's done to her and all the countless hours i spent comforting her when she was upset about something he did. She then says that i just don't support her life choices and that she doesn't wanna hear any of this on her birthday. Am i the asshole?\n\ntl;dr : friend who's in toxic relationship didn't think me texting her happy birthday was enough. i proceed to explain that we're not as close anymore because of her toxic relationship and that i don't support it on her birthday.",

      "description": "You'll most likely think i am so here's the back story:\n\nPartner and his ex have child together almost 15 years ago. Only child is spoilt rotten, never told no, given everything she wants and waited on hand and foot. Child is a brat from a very young age, never disciplined, never punished for bad/rude behaviour, never called out for her lies or for setting things up so they fight so she benefits.\n\nFast forward from birth to sd age 11. Partner and ex have split (found out ex cheated and sd isn't even his) and sd is playing the daddy ran away from me card and constantly baiting him into arguments so that he feels bad and buys her what she want. Months after their breakup we meet, hit it off and start dating. Sd is pissed - how dare her dad be with anyone else (mum had someone else before they even broke up but thats ok), how dare her spend time with anyone but her.....really normal shit for a kid after parents split. \n\nAfter a few months we move in together and everything is great between us. Sd stays with us and we try to week on/week off with her mum.....sd doesn't like this and wants to be with us full time until we ask her to do something and then she runs off to mum.\n\nAnyway, i am a child of, to a degree, tough love/responsible parents - you make a mess, you clean it up. You fuck up, you face the consequences. Now my sd won't do anything for herself and after 3 years i am over it. She wants slaves and servants not parents. I'm sick of it. I refuse to pick up after her or be dictated to by her. When we ask her to clean her room she is straight on the phone to her mum saying i am mean (it stinks in there and she leaves dirty pads laying around). She gets pissy when her clothes aren't clean but she hasn't actually put them with the dirty washing - again i'm mean. I don't make what she wants for dinner every night- she only wants junk food and because there is no junk i  the cupboard she tells people i don't feed her at all. \n\nShe constantly creates friction within the household. If she doesn't like what we tell her to do, shhe instantly starts with the \"i'm going back to mum\" crap (there is an avo between tne two so she cant actually go there and her mums family wont have her)\n\nIts at a point now where i hate being in her vicinity because shes just causing trouble or creating a mess she expects me to clean up. Shes lazy and filthy and i hate it. I hate her for all the trouble she's caused. \n\nI know alot of her behaviour is learnt/conditioned from her childhood, but after 3 years she should be able to do something for herself. I am sick of constantly putting her first and she throws it back in my face.\n\nWe also put off having our own child so as not to upset her but how is that fair to us.\n\nAm i an arsehole for hating her? Am i an arsehole for wanting her to be an independent person who can actually care for herself? Am i an arsehole for not wanting to be a slave to a 15 year old?\n\nThere is so much more to this story but just can't fit it all in",

      "description": " \n\nSo will try to keep it brief. This is my wife's dilemma. She's not on here but wanted me to ask reddit for advice and if she WBTA if she does what shes thinking. wife age 30 for reference.\n\nSo she grew up without ever knowing who her dad was. Mom claims she was (the R word) and never knew who he was. Now, we and other family are very skeptical of this claim. The mother is a really terrible person all around, terrible parent, chronic liar, lifelong alcoholic, abuse, all around very very not great. Would regularly bring guys home etc. type of Guys that would abuse the mothers other daughters etc. This is corroborated by her much older siblings. She had many kids with a few different men, last child being my wife with this unknown guy. \n\ni just want to get the point across that its something she would easily lie about and that there is no discussion on whether she is a terrible person and would easily lie, that's fact.\n\nThe mom was 40 when she had her last child. Putting this perspective dad at about 70 now or thereabouts.\n\nShe took a DNA test through ancestry website. It matched her with a first cousin (high chance) on the would be dad side of the family. So this cousins father is her uncle. He Only has 1 brother. We conclude this must be her father. Can't find much on the potential father like pictures, but have his contact info and think we have his home address. But found some pics of other relatives and grandfather and they look so much like my wife its crazy.\n\nNow, she would like to contact him for a couple reasons. She would like to know if she has any other half siblings, do any live in our area etc. also would like to ask about any health issues that run in the family, that kind of thing.\n\nSome potential issues. We don't think so, but what if the mom was indeed (the R word)? What if the guy just cheated way back then but is still with his wife now? you can see these issues and there are potentially more scenarios you could think of.\n\nIf she contacts him, and he has been married 40 years and she's still around, that may create problems for him. Which isn't what she wants to do. Those kind of issues is what we are worried about.\n\nSo Reddit, my wife wants some advice.\n\nWIBTA for contacting my dad, knowing it has potential to cause him a great deal of stress?",

      "title": "WIBTA for breaking up with boyfriend post major operation (and not seeing him if he wants me to see him)?",
      "description": "(Obligatory apology for the long post, ended up being a cathartic release to type it all out)\n\nOpen relationship of 2 months, been relationship like and had sex most of the year. Met all his family etc, basically live with him. I help with house chores and our laundry, etc. He is 25. I'm 21. Incoming third person (Lana) is 23. I get along with my bfs family so well, his mum considers me as her own daughter and I go to extended family dinners and events. Lana and my bf work together.\n\nWe are in an open relationship because he has commitment issues after ending a 7 year relationship with the girl he thought was the one. Basically he wanted to buy a house, join bank accounts, have kids, and she wasn't ready. They also didn't make each other happy and were really codependent. Bf moved back home after the breakup at the end of last year. He said he isnt fucking anyone else and doesnt want to, and I believe him. It's okay with me if he does, just as long as it's not Lana (you'll see why below haha).\n\nHe was happy to be more affectionate, emotional, and boyfriend like, but to him a commitment is serious like you're either casual and not in a relationship or seriously thinking about a future together and working towards that. So this is what we ended up with.\n\nHe had an ACL and meniscus tear. Had surgery for it 2 days ago. Essentially, bed rest and crutches for at least the first two weeks. Intense rehab. No sport for 12 months, no gym for 2, etc. Very rough.\n\nWhen he got out of surgery and woke up from the meds, he was like \"hey, Lana is coming to visit in her study break. But I'm so keen to see you. You're so beautiful\" etc etc.\n\nLana is his best friend, they used to be fwb. They are two peas in a pod and understand each other in an uncanny, mind connected way. Lana is in love with him and has issues with me, eg, she wasnt comfortable with me being there at the same time. She was the first one to see him after surgery, and the last one to see him before visiting hours closed. I visited in between with his mum and dad. \n\nI took him home the next day. Lana and my bf made plans to hang out then, so I disappeared but in an emotional huff. Basically I asked bf where I should put his stuff before leaving, he said bedroom, I put it in the bedroom, and he got annoyed because it wasnt upstairs. He dramatically expressed this. Tried to cut him slack because of painkillers and he just went through a major operation, but basically left in an emotional huff. Didnt stay to resolve it because if Lana saw my car there, she would irrationally lose her shit. It's happened before. He said he was disappointed and I responded with, I stay and I'm in the wrong, I go and I'm in the wrong.\n\nHe also said (when I pressed him) he prefers her company because I'm serious and argumentative.  (I am, except he was bringing up Lana for no reason and knew it would push my buttons, and I said so and asked him to stop, he didnt, and then he got mad that I was annoyed and sad. He also ended up fighting, separately, with his ex, Lana, and myself on the day of his surgery. I feel like that's more indicative of him just being an emotional mess and arguing.) He was talking about how we should break up because he cant cope with Lana and I not being ok with each other, and because if we will work it will be after a break from this because it's too much right now. I agree. I'm in love, he doesn't know that, and it's hard as fuck, but I agree.\n\nHe texted me yestersay saying he felt terrible about it all and that he would call when Lana left. He never called. He said he fell asleep. This morning I asked if Lana stayed over and he said yes. This cut me so deep because, again, he chose her over me. He swaps between saying how I feel (really fucking upset) is valid and this is all fucked up, and then saying it's not a competition with Lana. I agree it's not a competition, but I shouldnt always be second to her. It makes me feel shit as his gf, it makes my confidence take a big hit, I feel insecure and not good enough, and sad/depressed. This has only emerged over the last few days with his surgery stuff. I am not ok with feeling like this. Also feel preemptively embarrassed because she was there, not me, and his family might think I just dont give a shit when I've done everything I can for him including moving my flight dates so I can be here. (Surgery was planned for a different date but there was a last minute change.)\n\nThis is exacerbated, I think, because we broke up around 3 weeks ago because Lana was way too irrationally upset and was saying stuff like \"I will quit, I cant handle seeing you\" and \"we cant be friends\" etc and being verbally abusive to him. He isnt willing to quit, and isnt willing to give up his friendship. That's fine, I've never asked him to. It's not my place to do that. He ended up saying fuck it, no, this isnt right, she cant keep controlling this. I think this history just makes it harder for me emotionally.\n\nThis morning he said he doesnt want to talk, and that if I genuinely care, I would first want to make sure he's okay. He wants me to come over for company while Lana is there. He said Lana is ok with this. I would have been, but for her staying over last night instead of me. I cry or feel really sad when I hear her name or think about her. I'm not angry anymore, just really sad. Like I've spent a fair bit of my alone time crying. Cried on his surgery day when I wasnt the first to see him, after I left when Lana was coming to see him, yesterday arvo and then went out with friends to a bar, came back at 2am and cried myself to sleep. Cried when I woke up after hearing she slept at his. I'm exhausted and drained.\n\nI've gone through a lot of family issues (parents on off divorcing my whole life, and mum abusing me emotionally and verbally). Been through therapy for a while, but my therapist just moved countries. If I was healthy, i probably would have left a while ago. But things were improving, and i used it as a healthy way to learn about emotions and relationships through discussing things with my therapist. I never thought I could fall in love in my entire life, and yet I have. Even through the worst of it all, I've grown and have learned how to deal with my emotions better (still obviously needs work haha). Just putting this here because I'm hoping it'll make the story make more sense and give context. \n\nTldr; WIBTA if I breakup with a guy I'm in love with 3 days post his ACL and meniscus surgery if I feel really sad because he doesnt prioritise me? Not looking for advice, just very morally conflicted.",

      "description": "Throwaway since I don't want to be connected to this if I do report her.\n\nI'm having a small dilemma about reporting a close friend for her use of weed on the job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend Ally has a private Snapchat story that's only available to close friends, people she sells weed to, etc. On this story, she often posts videos of her smoking, which is whatever to me (I smoke sometimes myself). However, there was a snap on her story the other day that clearly showed that she was at work; and on her break she was shown smoking a blunt, and then returned to work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this wouldn't be as big of a deal to me if she had a run of the mill job. But she works at a small private daycare, so she's around children from the ages of &gt;1-4 years of age. It immensely bothered me and a few other of my friends who also have the ability to see her private snapchat story. From this inquiry, she's probably frequently high around other people's children, who have entrusted in her for the wellbeing of their kids. Also, Ally isn't the most functional when she's high (she also smokes everyday). I've been around her when she's only has two hits of a blunt, and she becomes lucid and can't carry on a full conversation. \n\nShe's a frequent seller and smoker, and the fact that she's bringing this around other people's kids when she has no right to do so is disrespectful and dangerous in my eye.\n\nMy potential plan is to email the daycare anonymously and make them aware of her behavior and make it clear that this is purely for the wellbeing of the kids, and not a malicious intent towards her or weedsmokers in general. She is a very close friend that I see semi-often, and she isn't in the best place financially, so losing her job would be a large issue. I don't want to see her financially struggle again. So, I'm asking, Am I The Asshole? ",

      "description": "So my roommate and I live in a small, single room dorm. I purchased a microwave and fridge in the beginning of the school year and allowed my roommate to use them. However, my roommate eats a lot of foods with \\*very\\* strong smells. Stuff like fishy smelling ramen, frozen Indian food, tamales, etc.. She is also just... sort of dumb??? and burns stuff in the microwave. Like one time she put chocolate chip cookies in the microwave  for three minutes and our room smelt like burnt chocolate for DAYS (along with our hall). \n\nAnyway, when she makes these foods, our room smells like her food all day. Also, the microwave is right next to my closet so my clothes end up smelling like her food for a while. There \\*is\\* a microwave that she can use in the dining hall so I wouldn't be completely depriving her of her frozen smelly foods, she just wouldn't be making it in the room.\n\nSo would I be the asshole if I asked her not to make her food in our room anymore (just food that leaves  a strong smell)?",

      "description": "Allow me to elaborate. So I’ve been talking to this girl for about 2 months now, and all I can say is I just feel lost with it. She’s absolutely beautiful, like she’s stunning. And on top of that, she has a great personality. We started as FWB, but I don’t know what I’m feeling right now and feel lost. I’ve told her I have feelings and she feels the same, but I don’t feel like it’s the same feelings I’ve had for other girls. The recent girls I talked to felt too perfect for me so I was obsessed, while with this one, it actually feels realistic, but the feelings feel more grounded in a way. Like, I don’t want to talk to her 24/7, but I just don’t know. I want to love her, but I don’t know if I can so far. I actually really like talking to her and she likes talking to me. We worry about each other, but I don’t think we’re on the same level of feelings about each other. I wanna be with her, but part of me just doesn’t. I never been on a date with her because we haven’t seen each other awhile, but knew each other forever. This girls is nuts for me and I wanna be nuts for her,  but I don’t know. I don’t wanna lead her on, and hurt her, but fuck, I don’t wanna lose her. She’s so amazing, but I just don’t know if I can see myself with her. Is this what it feels like to have an actual girlfriend? Every other previous girl lead me on and broke my heart. A date doesn’t really excite me to be honest, but having her by my side sounds so nice right about now. I really don’t wanna hurt her.  She’s so precious. I think one part of me feels like I should cut ties, while the other part of me would hate myself for letting her go. WIBTA if I just ended everything here? What should I do? I really hope I can love her she’s so fucking awesome, I don’t know where to start, we just click. Ughhhhh, please help me... ",

      "description": "My previous girlfriend and I met in college.  We were together for a little over a year and a half.\n\nI ended up landing a career job that I really enjoyed; I worked in the city, she lived in the suburbs (my actual home was about an hour drive away).  We agreed that I'd stay at her apartment a night during the week and spend a day together on the weekends.  Even with this, she felt we weren't spending enough time together and seemed to still be used to how it was in college: we saw each other 3-4 times a week.  I started hanging around more on the weekends for us to do things but after a while I started to feel like I had no time for myself to unwind or hang out with my other friends.  Every night was a request to facetime/talk on the phone, which I was fine with most of the time but certain nights I just wanted to unwind and focus on Netflix, a game, or something else.  \n\nThen my dad got extremely sick.  He's been battling cancer for 11 years, but around the beginning of August he was the sickest he has ever been - to the point that my mother and I needed to have conversations that I hoped we never would've had to.  He could no longer work and honestly could barely move without a walker, so I started doing a lot more around the house to help my mom as well as just wanting to spend more time with my family because I didn't know how much time he had left.  I told my ex-girlfriend I'd only be able to see her on weekends because of the above.  \n\nI was incredibly drained.  So one night she comes over and tells me that she thinks it best for us to split up because I \"could not satisfy her emotional needs as well as take care of my own\" and I \"clearly needed to be with my family more\".  I was really caught off guard and agreed that we go our separate ways and maybe re-assess when my father's health improves.\n\nI spent the next couple weeks really thinking about this and ultimately decided that I didn't want to be with someone that couldn't sacrifice the slightest to be with me in honestly the most difficult stretch of my young life so far (even told her at one point that I didn't know when I could see her next because there's a chance in a week my dad was no longer going to be alive)\n\nFast forward 4 months.  My dad was in and out of the hospital for most of September-November, I posted updates regularly on Facebook for our family and close friends to stay in the loop - not one text message, nothing.\n\nAnyway,  I started seeing someone new and we really hit it off and I feel like we will likely end up entering into a relationship very soon, and I have no intention of sharing this information with my ex-girlfriend.  We effectively did split up, but some mutual friends seemed to think that I \"could've done more\" during the stretch where I was caught between my family and her.",

      "title": "AITA for not involving my fiancee's family in the proposal",
      "description": "Months before I proposed, I told my fiancee's family that I was ready to propose to her and the day I was planning to do it. On that day my fiancee's mom asked me to include her younger daughter, my fiancee's sister (in her 20s), in the proposal. I said something like \"Okay, I'll get in touch with her.\"\n\nMonths pass and for various reasons I decided not to include either family in the proposal, but instead just include friends. I propose on the day I had planned to do it. My fiancee was super happy and said yes and frankly it was perfect. Then, on our way to our post-proposal lunch, she called her family to share the exciting news, and they were extremely cold and negative. They tend to be melodramatic, so she just tried to ignore it and enjoy our lunch and time with friends and she called other family in other countries etc, who were all warm and positive. \n\nWe decided to try to meet up with both sets of parents for dinner (they live only an hour away). My family agrees instantly. Her family absolutely refuses to meet for dinner or after dinner saying that we took this experience away from them, they feel completely blindsided and angry, they feel like they are being cut out of their daughters life, and basically that I have intentionally offended and excluded them. My fiancee basically begged them saying, okay can we just come see you for 10 minutes because I just got engaged today and I'd like to share this big day with you, and they said no. Not only that, but they then send pictures on a group chat showing them eating dinner &lt;15 minutes away from where we live, and just by themselves, so it was not like they had other commitments or plans.\n\nSame behavior continued the next morning. We then decided to just go over whether they like it or not because at the least she wanted to see her grandparents who were visiting from another country. When we were there, they said I violated their wishes, that the younger daughter had kept the day free and was waiting for a call about it for months, that we were starting our marriage in a way that offended everyone, and basically that we were terrible people for not thinking about them. I apologized for not communicating back to the sister that she didn't need to keep the whole day free, but frankly other than that I didn't think I did anything wrong and so I didn't apologize more. \n\nNow several months later, the family is still not over it. They don't want us to use the proposal photos for anything because it hurts their feelings, they keep saying that the proposal day was their dream and we ruined it, and they're mad at my fiancee for taking my side.\n\nI'm just so confused. I felt like I put my fiancee first and planned the proposal that way. And immediately post-proposal we tried to plan dinner with them to celebrate. Clearly they don't think so and are driving us crazy. AITA here?",

Long story short bride has expensive taste due to wealthy fiancé, and I am in the poor income range. So far I have had to pay for half of a bridal shower plus take home gifts for the people that came, and prizes etc and then I had to pay for my portion of her Bachelorette (300$) as well as pay for half the brides portion. The wedding is about a 10 hr drive from home and the room is around 600$ a night so x2 because I have to be there for rehearsal dinner. Plus bridesmaids dress (400$), alterations, hair and makeup which I'm being forced to have done (250$). In total the wedding is going to cost me around $2000 if not more. \n\nWhen I tried telling her that I was having trouble affording all this she told me that I've had 7 months to save so it's not an excuse. Living paycheck to paycheck its not easy to save 300$ a month... \n\nWas it wrong of me to mention this to her? At this point i regret saying yes, but I feel it is to late to back out now. ",

      "description": " I consider myself a religious person who believes there is a spiritual side to our world beyond nature. But **I don't believe in ghosts**. Once a person dies, they go onward, they do not remain earthbound. Yet this is why I am still left searching for an explanation to a series of strange encounters my family experienced 44 years ago. When I was about 9, **my family and I moved** into a three-bedroom bungalow in Central California. Besides it being small, and my brothers and sisters and me having to share bedrooms, the only really unusual feature of that house was that standing at the front door, you could see all the way through the living room, kitchen, back hall, and out the back door. Not long after moving in, **we began to see glimpses of an elderly man**. I still remember him vividly: He had white hair and was always was wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans. Sometimes we'd be in the living room and see a glimpse of him at the back door. Or one of us would be walking down the back hallway and spot him in the living room. It was always just a momentary glimpse. If you looked again, nothing would be there. One night, it was just Mom and me at home. My brother, John, with whom I shared a bedroom, was away with my grandparents. When it was time for bed, I hugged my mom goodnight and went to my room without bothering to turn on the light. I could hear Duchess, our little black mutt, thumping her tail. When I hopped into bed, I patted the foot of my bed and called to Duchess to come join me. **I could hear her nails click on the floor** as she walked across the room and felt her weight as she jumped onto the foot of the bed. Immediately, though, the weight became unbearably heavy. It was so heavy that my feet were bent backward and downward. It was also extremely hot. **I was suddenly very afraid.** I shouted at the dog to get off and I sat up to push her with my hands.  Nothing was there. The weight and heat were immediately gone. I ran out to my mom to discover Duchess had been outside the entire time with our two other dogs. Mom said I must have had a bad dream, but even she admitted that I hadn't been in my room long enough to fall asleep. The whole episode lasted for less than a minute. Even though the dog never visited me again, the fear from that night stayed with me. I grew to hate that house. I started having a lot of nightmares. We all continued to see the old man quite often, but it was weird -- those visions weren't scary. Still, I did not want to be alone in that house, or my room, again. Years later, long after we'd all moved out and had kids of our own, we went on a big family camping trip with our parents. It was my mom, my sisters, me, and the kids back at camp -- the guys were out. Somehow we got to talking about that house. I shared how I always hated it and told the story of the dog. **That's when my sister, Birdie, started freaking out.** When our sister Deb had moved out, Birdie moved into my room with me and John moved into hers. Birdie explained that once, when I was spending the night at a friend's, the same exact thing happened to her. Something she thought was a dog in the room, walking across the floor, jumping on the bed, and then an immediate sense of heavy weight, extreme heat, and fear. As we talked, the men returned and we filled them in on our creepy tale. Sure enough, John had the same ghostly encounter when he'd been alone in the room. Suddenly, we noticed mom and dad giving each other a look. We demanded to know what it was about. Our parents had rented the house from a man who'd inherited it from his father. **His father had been murdered in the house.** His dog was killed trying to protect him. They had never said anything to us because they didn't want to frighten us. I have come to believe that the old man is what is known as a \"residual haunting,\" sort of a loop in time. A common event that happened so often in life that, even after death, it still takes place. The dog, though, continues to baffle me. Although I believe that animals have souls, I don’t believe they have spirits that travel onward after their bodies die. **So the dog must have been something entirely different, not a dog at all.** Maybe an evil spirit that became attached to the dog’s body during the murderous act against him and his master. I still don’t really know, but I do know that I have no desire to go back to that house to find out. So, to make sure this never happened to me or anybody again, I struck a match in the house and left to go sleep at a motel with my family for the night. They never discovered it was me, but i'm feeling guilty. \n\nAITA for burning down a house with an evil spirit attached?",

      "description": "God I have a couple of AITA's so here's one of them.\n\nA little context. My mom (44) recently exited a very toxic relationship with my dad that lasted for a little over 22 years, and when I was around 16 I told her that as soon as I was of age I'd work and get her out of there since she never worked because of her being a house wife.\nWhen I turned 18 I got a serious job and started making some money, so I got my mom out of there and started technically, becoming her provider. I understand that it's a little harder for her to get a job because of her age, and I did tell her that as soon as she got a job I'd go on my way, since I was only there to help her get OUT of that shitty situation. \n\nIt's been two years now and while she has gotten a couple of short lived jobs she hasn't gotten a serious job, I think it's because I've been enabling her, giving her the same life than my dad gave her but even better without the toxicity,\nbut it's been taking a toll on me emotionally and financially, I'm living paycheck to paycheck paying rent and utilities for me and my sisters, and while my older one is helping I make more money therefore I put more money towards the house and it doesn't help that my mom is a little bit... mean? She doesn't\nthink what she says and ends up insulting me without noticing, telling me things that hurt me, (specially coming from my mom)and making decisions for me and keeping tolls on me. So I technically haven't had a proper teenage life and now I'm 20, work 9 hours a day to support my family and I've been diagnosed with dysthymia (Which is technically, high functioning depression).\nI've tried to tell my mom about how much this is affecting me and telling her that I want to leave and she always becomes overly defensive, telling me that \"I'd be abandoning her\" and my sisters to go live with my dad since I always \"liked him better\" and ends up crying and calling me, well, an asshole.

Once I have my degree and TEFL certificate, etc, I plan on finding a teaching job in a foreign country, moving there, and staying for at least a while, if not the rest of my life. \n\nI have been to this country multiple times, and while the stays varied in lengths, I am ABSOLUTELY sure this is what I want. \nAlthough they were opposed to begin with, my parents are finally beginning to accept that this is what I want, and this is what I am going to do.\n\nHowever, my mother recently told me that should they ever “need” me to, I “will come back to England to care for us from then on.” (I.e if they developed dementia, etc) She said it like I had no choice in the matter. Of course I disagreed with this - by that time, I plan to have a career and possibly a family in this foreign country, and she can’t expect me to just drop everything and become some stay at home nanny for her. At least, that’s what I think. \nShe was appalled, accused me of not caring about her or my father, and stormed off. \n\nOf course, I would definitely come back to England to visit them whenever I could if they were ill - hell, I want to visit them and vice versa as much as I can every year regardless of their health. \n\nI just think that if they were to get ill, it is both unfair and irresponsible to expect me to drop my life in order to become their full time caregiver. I am not and will not be trained for that, and I wholeheartedly believe they would be better off in an old person’s home should they need to be in one. \n\nI love them both and care for them greatly so it sucks that my mother thinks I don’t. \n\nWIBTA if I stuck to this viewpoint?

My coworker texted me a few times to see how my boyfriend was doing and to also vent about the annoying things that have been happening at work. That being said, a couple of days ago she asked if I could work, which I said no. Fast forward to today she asks me if I can work some days, and I said no again. From looking at the schedule, I’m assuming it’s so she can have a break in between? I told her I really don’t want to come across as bitchy and unhelpful, but it hasn’t even been a week since my boyfriend has been in the hospital. On top of that, our job has been really stressful lately and I just can’t have that added to everything else that’s going on. \n\nThoughts?

      "description": "I have been with my current employer for 9 years 3 months. I started out with them as an apprentice which took 4 years to complete, on conclusion I was appointed a tradesman’s position. \n\nShortly after I applied for a scholarship that the company used to offer which provided a wage of $50k per year  to study at university full time with all fees paid which amounted to about $40k. I was successful in the application process which always had a huge amount of interest from all employees.  The degree I chose took 4 years to complete, and during university holidays I was to work at the company. I moved 5 hours away from the town I completed my apprenticeship in to attend university, and there was a depot for the company also in this town. \n\nOn completion of my degree, I entered the company’s graduate program. I completed my first graduate rotation within the company at the same town which I attended university at, and I have also just started my next rotation at the same depot in a different business section. \n\nAbout halfway through my degree, the company I worked for ownership changed along with the goals and how business was conducted. There is now a massive focus to run the majority of the business out of one depot which is in a major city, 3 hours away from where I currently live. The past 5 graduates have been forced to this location to further their careers and get off the graduate program which is only supposed to be 2 years long, however there have been graduated stuck on the program for up to 6 years.  Also, the opportunities that have arisen are in project management, which is not a career path I wish to go down. I wish to remain in a more technical role as I am now.  Concluding this current graduate rotation I have the impression that I will be made to move to the city depot 3 hours away. \n\nIn the last 5 years, I have met a girl who I will marry who’s work and family is in the town we currently live in. With the uncertainty of the location of my career, it’s starting to put a lot of stress on our relationship. We both want to buy a house in our current town, we couldn’t afford to buy a house in the major city the depot is in, and we want to settle down and have kids shortly (I’m 28 btw).\n\nI applied for an external job and was successful which will keep me in my current town and is also a lot more money than what I’m currently on. I’ve yet to give my notice to my current employer. I know that I was an investment for their company however our interests aren’t aligned anymore. \n\nAm I the asshole for putting myself first?",

      "description": "I am a minor incase that matter in the story.\n\nSo a couple months ago I had completed my work for a job over the summer in late August. I had earned a little under $1000 over the course of the 3 months I had worked there, and it being a labor intensive job I felt like that money was very hard earned. Over the course of up until about 3 months ago, I had spent about 400 of it on various things over the course of that time, and that leads to the point where my mother had come in.\n\nMe and my mom had been struggling with finances over a very long time. My parents split a while back over finances, and we had been living in various places over the last couple of years. We were in a hotel up until renting the place we currently have, which is pretty much a duplex in a set of 3. I was very proud of what my mom had done for me and what she was able to accomplish especially with her low credit score and financial instability. That was until the incident that occurred relating back to my saved money.\n\nTurns out my mother had not been able to pay the rent for the house for the month of December, and she ended up asking me for the money. Now considering how rough of a spot asking me this put me in, as I didn't want to upset her or lose the house, I ended up giving it to her. Now what irks me isn't the fact that I gave her the money, I would have done that in a heartbeat, what irks me is 3 things. 1) I was left in the dark of our financial situation up until this point, where I was kinda asked out of the blue for the money. I knew we were struggling but I didn't know it was THAT bad. If she had told me I would've looked for another job to help contribute to the house, utilities, etc. 2) I haven't seen any of the money or my possessions back. I loaned her that money, with a promise of seeing it back, over 2 months ago and I haven't seen any of it back. Nor have I seen the stuff that has been put away in storage, or the things that are stowed away in my grandmothers house (which is currently unavailable to us due to a falling out but that's a different story.) 3) I am still performing my duties as a person who lives in this house, i.e. cleaning, organizing, taking trash out, rubbing her back daily due to her back problems, etc.\n\nIts at a certain point that I begin to feel used and not properly loved or compensated for what I'm doing to ease mine and my mother's stress. There's a lot of tension in the house and I am not sure If I am to blame myself, my mother, if its both of our faults or neither. It's been so difficult getting to here and I still love her for what she's done, but I don't want to ruin another relationship with a family member because I don't feel appreciated.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I was a friend with benefits with a guy, we were sex partners but things weren't serious between us.  One day, this stranger messages me and tells me that she's his girlfriend and he's been cheating on her with me.  I guess she found his texts.  I was furious with him, can't believe he did that shit.  I wanted some revenge for her, I felt like it was my duty. I knew he had feelings for me,  so I \"confessed\" my feelings to him.  Over the next few days,  he fell for the bait and I really sold him the idea that I loved him.  After almost a week, after telling him how much I adored him and how amazing he was,  I just told him his a scumbug and  just straight ghosted him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently, from what I hear he was pretty hung up about that.  Even a month later, he just messaged asking for an explaination as why I ghosted him,  saying I owe it to him and he still thinks I actually loved him.   I wonder if that was too cruel.  Does he deserve any sympathy, am I the asshole?",

      "title": "WIBTA if I cut off my friend of 7 years?",
      "description": "I’ve been friends with someone I’ll call H for nearly 7 years now, since we were little kids. We’ve always seen each other as inseparable, until at least 3 years ago. She moved away to a state nearly 700 miles away, and comes to visit every year. However, since then, she’s become increasingly unstable and depressed, to the point of serious self harm. She’ll constantly show me and our friend (I’ll call him B) self harm photos, and gets pissed at us if we “don’t get concerned enough” or if we tell her to get serious psychiatric help. I’ve had multiple breakdowns over seeing each photo, and it hurts to have her tell me that I “don’t care” or that “we were never meant to be friends”. B and I both see her as our best friend, and we would take bullets for her. \n\nShe’s grown more emotionally and even physically abusive as time goes on. A little over a year ago, when she came to visit, I stayed over at her house for the night. We were playing some game, I believe it was a form of tag, and she decided to pick me up and throw me on the ground. I’m barely 5 feet tall and weigh 70-ish pounds, I’ve always been rather stunted, so being literally thrown down by someone more than half a foot taller and 20 pounds heavier rattled the fuck out of me. My ankle ended up getting sprained and she got upset at me for “taking it too seriously.” Earlier the same day, she threatened to cut herself if I didn’t let her use her makeup on me. I despise using makeup and she knows it, it takes ages to clean off and I always end up with horrible acne afterwards. I got the same exact result. \n\nSince B came out as gay back in late 2017, she’s mocked him and went as far as writing smut about him without his permission. He’s 13 years old. This has occurred far more than once. She’s even threatened to write smut of me if I didn’t go with her wishes, and nearly drew porn of me while trying to pass it off as someone else. When I came out as homoromantic/asexual, she mocked me as well, telling me that I’m just confused and that I can’t be asexual. After trying to tell her that not wanting to fuck people =/= confused, she gave a condescending reply and unfriended me.\n\nRecently, H had a meltdown over me joking around with B about getting a girlfriend, and left all of our group chats. When we tried to contact her, she said things like “leave me alone” and “I don’t want to talk with you”. We decided to back off for the time being and shakily went back to what we were previously doing. When we invited her back to the chat, she had another meltdown about how we didn’t try contacting her enough and that we didn’t care, etc. I explained that since she explicitly said to not talk to her, we took that as, you know, not wanting to be talked to. \n\nI’m at the end of my rope. Trying to help her is so emotionally draining, and that’s on top of finals and the stress of transitioning to another school. I can’t bend over backwards for her anymore, not when it means putting my physical and mental safety, as well as B’s, at risk. I’m so tired of being constantly stressed and anxious and having this feeling of impending doom loom over me 24/7. I can’t remember the last time my stomach wasn’t churning over these issues. She truly can be fun when she wants to be, and the 3 of us have had genuinely great times together. However I’m really feeling that the cons outweigh the pros, and that I’d be happier if I cut her off entirely. Would I be an asshole for doing so?",

I’m in college and have very little use for one. Even after trying it, I decided it isn’t for me. I’m thinking of giving it to one of my friends who has expressed interest in having an Echo Dot (in general).\n\nThe other part of the background is my thoughts and emotions. I feel really guilty because I’m pretty close to my aunt and she always gives wonderful gifts. I would never tell her unless she asked outright and would hint instead that “Oh, I don’t use it much but my friends and I like using it.” Maybe it is for validation, but I’ve always felt guilty at showing even the slightest discontent with any gift, let alone regifting one. I also feel guilty because my dog chewed on it a little bit and while it still works, I get this sinking feeling every time I think about my aunt’s nice gift in comparison to how I feel about it. \n\nI’ve talked briefly to my mom, but it’s her sister that I’m asking about so I don’t want to get her involved too much.

It literally was the blink of an eye before Ford was completely on top of Milo biting his neck pinning him against the floor. Milo is crying and Will went to grab Ford but he didnt have any collar on so he was grabbing at whatever he could. We both kept trying to get in between but Ford was very likely going to bite us. I just looked at Will and said I dont know we just have to do something. So I just pushed my body in between them and I felt Ford jumping on my back and thankfully right then Will was able to get a good grab around Fords chest and pull him back. I got Milo and realized Ford had bit off his collar so I had to pick up this 55lb dog while shaking from adrenaline. I didnt know where to go so I just ran into the girls room on the first floor.\n\n\nI stayed in that room for a while. Will came in right after and I was waiting for one of them to text me to tell me it was all good to bring Milo upstairs. Nothing at all so I figure that they must have just taken him out the front door and just away as fast as possible. Will went to check and said they were all locked in her room. \n\n\n I hadnt even looked up during it so I had immediately texted my roommate \"omg i feel bad i thought you were going to bed\" but then Will had told me that the whole time they were petting Ford while Will was trying to wrangle him off me and Milo and saying \"its okay, you're okay\" to the dog. I mean there was no way to misinterpret that as Ford being attacked. Hes 95lbs and couldnt even be stopped by a 6ft guy.\n\n\nI checked my phone and my friend texted back saying \"thats not what i said i said im bringing him over wtf you should have texted me that you were bringing Milo here\" Here? you mean to my house? when you told me Ford would only be here to sleep and thats it? Also she specified to me that he was bad with dogs, so she should have at the very least had a collar on him while he was in a house that has a dog living in it.\n\n\ni dont know what to do because i dont feel like i did anything wrong really just an overall miscommunication, but there reaction to it is making me upset and thinking that this is my fault.

I sent him my resume to look over, which he did. He referred me to the hiring managers, and I got a phone interview. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe phone interview went well, but I only got accepted to the next part of the process because of his referral, an in person interview, meaning there are probably applicants with prior experience in the field.  I'm very, reasonably, nervous for this and he has been giving me tips and information on everything that happened when he interviewed there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this guy is my best friend and I know he would never intentionally screw me over. We've been friends for years, and he knows how badly I need this job. However, I know him to be a compulsive liar, a trait that has gotten better over the many years I've known him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other day he said his friend just got done interviewing there and he would send me the info from that interview. The next exchange went like this. I'll call him Rob. \n\nMe: Interviewed for my position?\n\nRob: Yes, yes. \n\nMe: Damn. \n\nMe: What friend?\n\nRob: Someone from (prior workplace, meaning prior experience in field). She's the only (PW) person I've pushed through this round because she got back to me before you did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis can't be true, He told me about the job on a Friday night, and I gave him my resume Sunday. This means he told this other person about the job either before me, which sucks, as we've been friends for like 7 years and this person ayear at best, and only through work, or AFTER he told me which REALLY sucks cause then I feel like he really doesn't give a shit at all.  \n\nIDK.

      "description": "I'm still in high school, and in the beginning of september I started developing a friendship with a girl in my class. We listened to the same music, we had the same style of humor, liked same movies, etc. We were texting a lot, talking about our feelings and our hardships in life. Turns out, she had a really rough life, and was fighting with depression, but things were looking good for her, because she started visiting a psychiatrist. Because I was her only real friend, she would tell me about her problems. I listened to all of them, sometimes in text, sometimes in person, and tried to offer the help I could.\nThe problem was, that she told me that she would listen to my difficulties too, but everytime I tried to talk about mine, she would always bring up hers and we ended up talking about them, ignoring me completely.\nThings were going like this for some time, and then one night when she was talking about how no one loves her and it would be better if she didn't exist, I told her that's not true, because during all the time we spent together I started developing feelings towards her. This shocked her, but she rejected me, and honestly, I was fine with it, because I didn't expect her to love me, I was okay with being her friend. Then, she told me that she needs some time alone, because she needs to process this, and for the next few days she kept her distance at school, and didn't talk to me. \nAfter some time passed, she texted me and said that she was sorry about her behavior and if I wanted, we could still be friends. I accepted her offer, and for some time, everything was going fine, until for some reason she became really distant again and started ignoring me. \nOne thing that's really bugging me, is that  during the first month of our friendship she told me that she needed me, because I was her only friend, and most of her family didn't care about her at all, and because of this I feel really bad because I know that I could help her if I really wanted,I just don't want to anymore. \nThe other thing is that I also had some problems of my own but every time I tried to talk about them, she would belittle them by comparing them to her problems. \nSo AITA in this scenario? I really can't tell anymore. And guys, please forgive my shitty grammar and bad writing skills! \n",

      "description": "Last night on the couch we are both sitting and watching a show and she goes to grab my hand. I'm thinking she wants to hold hands so I go to grab her hand and hold it but she pulls it away. She does this about 3 more times kind of quickly and I'm getting annoyed so I tell her not to touch me if shes going to do that. Suddenly she recoils back, looks at me like I shot her dog and scoots to the other couch cushion. She gets all quiet and we both just keep watching the show. Eventually she says that I really hurt her feelings with what I said and that I haven't even acknowledged how shes feeling. I said that I shouldn't have to apologize or walk on eggshells for telling her not to do something that's annoying me. I didn't raise my voice or push her away, all I said was don't touch me if you're going to do that. She gave me the cold shoulder the whole rest of the evening into the morning and on the drive in the morning shes STILL upset with me for not acknowledging her feelings. I said she was being emotionally abusive/controlling trying to get me to condemn my own actions when I feel justified just telling her I don't like something so don't keep doing it? So I want to know if I'm being an asshole for not entertaining her \"feelings\" about me telling her to stop doing something most would find annoying. I understand she may have thought she was being playful but it wasn't very fun for me so i told her to stop and she completely switched gears and thinks I don't care about her feelings at all now and it's blown way out of proportion.",

      "description": "Background: I'm a stay at home mom. My darling husband works full time plus some in tech. He gets home every night around 5:30 or 6. Right when he gets home we all have dinner and then the babies go right in the bath and we start bedtime routines which usually last until about 7:30. \n\nMy complaint to my husband is that after dinner, I'd like to have a break. 10 min alone out in the garden to decompress from the day. My toddler doesn't nap anymore so this will literally be the first time since 6:30am that I get any time alone for the day. My husband drives home from work everyday and gets the 20 min drive alone and I think I should get a bit of time too. His argument is that the drive is not relaxing, it's his commute. I understand that he'd rather not be driving but it doesn't change the fact that he gets that 20 min alone before he faces bedtime with a toddler and a baby. He believes I shoud take my \"break\" when the kids are down like he feels he does. \n\nTell me Reddit, am I the asshole here? ",

      "description": "Okay, so both us are into smoking weed but since we live with our parents it is not possible to do that at home. So we always look for some quiet/chill places in our city where we can smoke weed and get stoned, listen to music and sometimes enjoy a beer. We usually hang out in the evening since during daytime we have to work or go to school. Since a month or so it is freezing cold every day. During daytime it is max. 5 °C (41F) and in the evening and night it is -1°C (30F), but often colder (-5°C/23F). I explained multiple times to my friend that I think it's too cold outside to hang out, but he keeps asking this everyday. He always says that once we are outside it will be better than expected, but out of experience I know better. Also important: I am only one of his two friends, so he is quite lonely. That might also be the reason that he stubbornly asks to hang out everyday. I even said to him that we could go somewhere inside like a bar or so, but he always wants to hang out outside since he is quite shy and does not like it when there are other people around, because of the noise and possible interaction with strangers.\n\nSo my question is: **AITA** for not wanting to hang out with my quite lonely friend because I find it too cold outside?",

      "description": "So slight context: this guy and I have already broken up. But I feel a little bad still... I’m white and I celebrate Christmas. He’s Asian and doesn’t (but used to when he was a kid). \n\nOver Christmas I asked if he wanted to come down and spend it with me and my family. He agreed. My parents and I even bought him several gifts, but asked he come midday as we didn’t have the same number of gifts for him as we did for each other and our exchange students that live with us. He was asked to arrive at the GO station (a half hour drive from my house - but he can’t drive) by 2pm for me to go pick him up so I could get home in lots of time to relax before helping start Xmas dinner. \n\nHe told me no. Said it wasn’t realistic for him to get there for that time as it was too early and that’s when he usually wakes up (he’s unemployed and doesn’t like using alarms as they’re too “jarring” when they wake him up). So I said fine maybe come Boxing Day that way as long as your there before dinner at 6 you’re fine. \n\nBoxing Day comes. He texts me at 3:30 he JUST woke up. It’s at least 3h of public transportation from his house to mine plus the half hour drive once I pick him up on the other side of the city. He then got mad at me for being upset with him. Said it’s not his fault he has a ‘sleep disorder’ (he does have sleeping problems but nothing diagnosed and he’s not doing anything to help himself either) and that it’s perfectly ok for him to show up after dinner and just have leftover without my family? \n\nHe then turned this issue into an entire relationship thing and kept demanding I break up with him so I got tired of fighting and just dumped him.  I couldn’t take the guilting and catering to him anymore. \n\nAm I an asshole?\n",

      "description": "So I'm starting esthetician school in a few months, and my grandparents are paying for it on the terms that I go to college after. Last week, my mom got her eyebrows done, and then after she made a casual remark about how soon I'll be waxing and tinting her eyebrows for her. I let this pass, figuring that the materials are inexpensive for tinting and waxing, and it won't take up too much of my time to do this for her every few weeks or so. \n\nA few days later, my mom said she's excited for me to start school, and she expects me to do her eyebrows and give her monthly facials. I asked if she expected the facials to be free, and she gave me a dirty look and said of course. Now I'm thinking that not only with this be costly for me, but I'm not going to have a lot of free time as I'm planning to be in school full time, as well as working as many hours as I can without taking away from my school. I won't have a lot of time for myself, let alone be doing hour long facials on top of waxing/tinting. I was annoyed by her just assuming that I would be doing this for her without asking, but I didn't really say anything.\n\nYesterday was when I really got pissed off. At the school I'm attending, you learn most things, but there are short classes for different things that can further your education, and you can really earn extra money. I picked a class Im planning to take once I graduate and have the money to pay for the class, and Ive discussed it openly to my family. My mom is displeased with the class I want to take, and has been persuading me to take an eyelash extension class and a microblading class(where they basically tattoo you're eyebrows on if you have thin eyebrows). Ive told her I don't want to take the eyelash extension class, because there are already plenty of people in my area who do it, and I don't feel comfortable doing a permanent thing such as tattooing eyebrows on someones face. Yesterday she straight up said to me that she wants me to take those classes so I can do her eyelashes and microblade her eyebrows. The class for microblading is over $2000, and I feel like she is being selfish in expecting me to not only do very costly services on her, but take classes Im not interested in doing or paying for, just so I can be her personal esthetician. \n\nLike I said before, I have no problem with waxing and tinting her brows, and every once in a while do a skin care treatment, like as a present or for a special occasion. I just really don't want to feel obligated to be her personal esthetician when I'm going to have little free time to myself as is. I don't even feel excited to start school, as I already can tell she's going to demand me to provide her with all the skin care treatments she desires. Am I an asshole for feeling like my mom is crossing a line?",

      "description": "Their dogs are outside on chains all day long. They have no shelter and it’s cold and might rain tonight. It’s typically not rainy here but it is cold. Dips in the low 30’s at night. \nI told them if they don’t get the dogs shelter I’m calling animal control. They bought one dog house. They have pit mix, chow/ German Shepard and a chihuahua. \nThe chihuahua is in heat which is causing the other dogs to go crazy and pit was very aggressive to chow grabbing him by the neck. This was not play fighting. The neighbor had to come out and stop the fight which resulted in them getting shorter chains. \nHe put up a “wall”between the two larger dogs which the chow is now jumping over and was actually stuck upside down for a few tense moments due to his short chain. It’s very dangerous. The neighbor came out and sprayed him with water to get him up stop making so much noise and then went back inside without fixing the wall issue. \nThis is cause of me a great deal of anxiety. Every time I hear yelping I have to run to the window to make sure chow is not hung on his own chain or mauled by the pit. \nThe chihuahua and chow were not originally chained. Only the pit. C and C killed s litter of kittens which is why they got chained too. At first I was think okay make it’s good. Pit has company now and they were all able to touch and play together cause their chains were long enough. But since chihuahua is in heat it is causing problems. \nIt also looked like their daughter was hitting one of the dogs with a stick but I’m not 100% sure. She did throw them (C and C ) off the porch before though when chow was a puppy. She is maybe 6 or 7. \nSo WIBTA if I call animal control or should I wait until she is out if heat and see if it gets better? \nThere is also the weather factor. \n",

My ex and I broke up about three months ago because I felt there were a lot of problems with our relationship - mainly that I was putting in way more effort than he was. \n\nEver since, he's been extremely clingy, trying to stay friends and constantly wanting to talk over what happened. I'm extremely stressed out right now due to a lot of life events happening at once, and when I was pissed off the other night he sent me a message essentially blaming me for the death of our relationship.\n\nI lost my shit and called him that night, and told him I didn't have time for this bullshit and he needed to stop. However, I still haven't replied to the original message even though he asked me to.\n\nWIBTA if I outline everything I felt went wrong in the relationship before I finally block him?

      "description": "Hi. I am a highschool student working on a science fair project. The databook journal was due a few days but I was sick so I wasn't going to be at school that day. At about 7:05, I told my partner (Friend B) that I wasn't going to be at school and I wasn't going to be about to bring the binder. Someone had an extra binder, thankfully, so at about 7:14am, she texted me saying that sometime had an extra binder to use. The binder is worth five points, by the way. Looking back, maybe I should have asked my mom to send the binder to school or gone to school anyway but my mind wasn't right and I was just really tired, not that that's an excuse.  \n\nAnyway, I kind of went about the rest of the day feeling awful, taking medicine, and napping. When school got out, I asked everyone, over text, what I had missed. Friend A (not my science partner) said to me \"You left Friend B hanging. You should feel bad about yourself. It's your fault that you almost failed science fair. You're so immature and irresponsible. For being in highschool, you sure don't act like it.\" She seemed to immediately regret, I have to say. When I saw the messages, I was floored. I had no idea it was such a big deal. Apparently, they had been theorizing that I faked being sick because I had an essay due today (which isn't true. I had turned in the essay the night before, online. I I had apologized to Friend B this morning but I decided to do it again. Friend B said she wasn't that mad and that although she was slightly annoyed, it was only five points, anyway. She said that it was easy to jump to conclusions because I was lax about my grades compared to my friend group. (I have A's and B's but most of them cry when they get anything under a 95. Meanwhile, I'm usually okay with an 84.) After that, Friend A texted back\n\n\"Hey zarrou, I wasn't trying to be mean to you btw. \n\nI was just trying to make you understand what I and others thought about the situation.\n\nWhat happened today just wasn't very responsible of you and was very uncalled for. \n\nBut it's fine we all make mistakes and it's good to have someone who can call you out on what mistakes you make or you'll never learn from them haha. \n\nAnd the fact that you're probably shocked I said that is a good thing. \n\nIt means you don't make a lot of mistakes. I mean if you think about it ... I bet next year your going to remember this and your gonna be like 'I cannot let Friend A think that I'm still not responsible' and this small little talk can help people change for the better in the smallest ways...\" \n\nAt that point, I probably should have accepted her apology but I didn't. I said that I honestly don't know what you wanted me to didn't know what she wanted me to do in that situation and that what she said hurt my feelings. I also said that I didn't understand what she gained by commenting on the situation and why she had to insult my like that which I regret. In return, Friend A said that she was actually playfully teasing me which I guess went over my head. And also,\"Whatever I guess we were never close anyway.\" \n\nI feel really bad about the binder. I get that I was the asshole in that situation because I left my member hanging but was I being an asshole for what I said to Friend A? I tried to apologize to her but she won't pick up or answer my texts. Whenever I try to approach her in person, she ignores me. I don't know what to do. I get that I should have tried to come to school and that I had an obligation to bring the binder but I didn't expect her to end the friendship over it. \n\nThis is probably some petty highschool drama that will end soon but I'm still worrying about it a lot. Thanks for listening. \n",

This cousin ended up helping that night after work. I went picked him up, he helped move the items from door to car while we all did a part. I was grateful for helping me last minute. \n\nThis weekend Ive been waiting for the gas to turn on in my apartment. Ive been waiting for the company to come and the window was all day long. Its been 5 degrees in the apartment and also don’t have hot water. \n\nHe asked me while I was waiting if I could go grab cash and buy something for him a 8-10 minute drive away. \n\nI said sure and went and bought it for him and brought it home. \n\nFast forward to tonight, i was going to go to his place to hang out but apparently I misses the gas person coming ( never got a phone call or knock) so I said Im not coming. \n\nHe got upset cause he still wanted the item and told me to drive it over to his house and drop it off. (45min to 1 hr + tolls each way)\n\nI said no I’m not doing that right after work at 6 pm because Im busy during the week and I already went out my way maybe causing me to miss my gas appointment by buying the item for him. \n\nHe went on to tell me \n“ You weren’t doing anything but waiting. I understand if you were doing something important but you didn’t go out your way you were doing nothing. You should feel honored I gave you something to do. “\n\nHe then proceeded to tell me after he did the favor for me if he asked for something I should just respect it and do it. \n\n\nIve been waiting all day for the gas people to come today and I’m extremely busy after work with college classes. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying No to doing an favor?

      "description": "So my boyfriend and I (F) were out at one of our favourite casual food places and we planned to see a movie after. While we were eating, he kept going on his phone to check basketball stats. Although I know it’s not a big deal at all, it does bother me when people use their phone at the table. In the past I’ve ignored this for the most part - only pointed it out jokingly before in hopes that he would get the hint. But tonight he did it 3-4 times during our meal and I just wanted to address it. \n\nSo in the least aggressive voice I just asked him, “why do you keep checking your phone whenever we eat?”\n\nHe said “what do you mean? am i not allowed to just check something quick? you do it too!”\n\n(i dont use my phone during meals it’s always in my bag)\n\nI tried to explain that it’s just common etiquette to put your phone away during a meal. It should be a time where you talk and give the other person your full attention and answer texts/calls/basketball stats later. \nHe disagreed and saw no issue with it or how it could be perceived as rude or disrespectful. \n\nHe got offended and basically gave me the silent treatment until i was done eating. We went back to the car, and again i got the silent treatment. Then he proceeded to tell me that we should save the movie for another night and that he should just take me home. \n\nHe also said that asking this question and believing that it’s rude to consistently go on your phone at the dinner table makes me controlling. \n\nOpinions?\nAdvice?\nAITA? \n\n",

      "description": "So my girlfriend moved out of her parents house last year, and her parents had bed bugs, so when moving out she unfortunately brought them with her. Since then we have got exterminators to get rid of them and we have been bed bug free for around 5 months now, but we had to get rid of our couches and our bed, and we werent allowed to wallpaper or put carpet down until the exterminators were finished, so as you can imagine the living situation has been super stressful for us both. We do not have a lot of money, my girlfriend is a full time mum so i support us both, but i dont have a great job. Since then we have got flooring, wallpaper, and a new couch, and its all been very expensive. \n\nHer parents have not hired exterminators and are trying to deal with the problem themselves, but they aren't getting very far. They still have bed bugs, and aren't doing much to get rid of them. \n\nToday, my girlfriends dad wanted to come grab her son (she has a kid from a previous relationship) and spend some time with him, taking his pram with him, and I asked him to wait outside because I know that bedbugs travel from place to place on people and their possessions. \n\nWhen he came back we asked him to leave the pram outside the door so we could spray it with bedbug spray and leave it outside for a while as it had been sat in his house for 3 or 4 hours, and we were concerned about the bugs hitching a ride on it.\n\nHes been moody ever since, telling my girlfriend we were rude to make him wait outside, that we make him feel dirty and stuff like that, but the way I see it, I DO NOT want bed bugs in my home again, it has been absolute hell trying to get rid of them, and the thought of having to furnish the house and hire exterminators AGAIN is just not what I want, its all way to expensive and emotionally draining to do for a second time. \n\nAm I the asshole here or is his mood justified? Should we be expected to put all of our possesions on the line for his feelings? ",

At the end, when were alone, I told her that I was confused and not in a place to be in a relationship (I'm still a little stuck on my ex I left 9 months ago but making good progress). I told her I wanted to makeout with her but I did not want a relationship. I also told her I didn't want to hurt her or use her in any way. She said that was fine and she just wanted to makeout as well. We made out for like a minute and just kind of chilled afterwards.\n\nShe seemed fine and not bothered at all and thanked me for everything but I feel like a dirtbag.

Since the beginning to were taking this pretty serious and I always considered us a long lasting couple. All of our friends know we are dating and we met each others parents.\n\nNow comes the tricky part. \n\nAfter 8ish months of our relationship we had an \"engagement\" in his house, after I came back from my 2 month trip. He proposed with gummy bears and I said yes hugged kissed had sex etc.. It was huge highlight of our relationship and one of the cutest moments we had. After that sometimes we would call each other fiance/e and make statements that we are engaged. But nobody knows about that because its between us. \n\nNow, a few hours ago we were having a casual conversation and word fiancee came up and I told him something along the lines \"but you know we are not actually engaged\". He got upset and I quickly explained that I still mean to marry him and Im still promised to him but that it wasnt real engagement since nobody knows about it. Then he said he cant actually propose me because we are too young. I agreed with him and stated that I in fact dont want him to propose now but I just made sure he knew that wasnt real engagement. \n\nSo since that talk he is deeply hurt by my words and says something must have happened for me to say it and doesnt understand how its not real. \nAm I the asshole and is it my fault?

      "description": "For background I live in a suite style college dorm with a kitchen and common area. The suite has 5 people and 3 bedrooms. I live in one of the doubles (the rooms are randomly assigned and I wasn’t lucky enough for the single).\n\nMy roommate is a party person, and I am more of a stay at home introverted type. On weekends, she invites her friends, and they pregame/hang out in our suite.  I don’t get why they MUST come in our room when there’s an entire living room and table. They always come to our bedroom too, and drink/smoke weed but I don’t drink or smoke. My roommate is always trying to convince me to try it and that it’s “not bad” but I really don’t want to. I don’t care if they do it outside of here, but I don’t want it in my room, especially weed smoke. Our room is right next to the RA, and if they even smell smoke they have to investigate. Plus, I choose not to smoke for a reason, so I don’t want to smell it.\n\nShe doesn’t tell me when they’re coming so often I’m completely in my pajamas with strangers. Once she had a bunch of people in our room partying and drinking while I was at home for the weekend, and I only knew because of her snapchat story. Obviously you can imagine I don’t appreciate drunk people around my things while I’m not there.\n\nTo me the bedroom is the most private/intimate space I have, and it’s bad enough sharing it with one stranger, but having a whole bunch in and out does not sit well with me. Her guests are respectful and don’t touch my things, but I still don’t like it. If I had my way I would totally ban guests in here. I can’t trust them not to do drugs/drink in here. I don’t want to get punished for having it in my room when it’s not even mine. We are  “chill” roommates and never complain to each other, so I don’t want to ruin it. She’ll think this is ridiculous because it’s her room too and she should be allowed to have friends, which I understand, but I have limits. \n\nShe’s also known to have a short temper, get “petty revenge” and even physically fight people when they piss her off, so the last person I want to piss off is the one around all my stuff. But my school is strict on alcohol and drugs and I don’t want to risk it. However, who am I to impose my lifestyle on her? WIBTA for telling her not to bring any guests even though it’s equally her room as it is mine?",

I’ve bought him a truck and I pay for his health insurance and mobile phone.  \n\nAt 18 I was out of the house and on my own 100% and in college.  My son works at a vape shop and states I’m not being supportive if I pressure him to make big life choices because he’s trying to figure out “what he wants to do with his life” 😳.\n\nI make a good salary BUT I want him to think before he takes a 25 minute hot shower about how much water costs and it costs money for heating the water - you know basic things like this.\n\nI really was hoping he’d figure out what he wants to do and move so I can free myself up financially.  His younger brother is autistic and living with his father 30 min away so he can finish high school.  I’ve got 18 months and I’m sure I’ll have my soon to be grown son back with me and that’s fine!

      "description": "Hey everyone. First time posting and I’m on mobile so if the format is weird I’m sorry. \nTLDR AT END!! \n\nI’m (23f) a college student living in a pretty shitty apartment with my roommate (23f). Her and I were random roommates and we get along really well, she’s super cool and chill but she never locks the door. \n\nI’m a really cautious person because you never know what could happen at any given moment. (yeah I can see how I’m a little paranoid but ssdgm) so it’s been about 8 months now of us living together and we live on the first floor, so many people are constantly walking by or driving by our place. I ALWAYS lock the door. It’s second nature to me. And I’m pretty much a home body and like to be in my own space so I’m pretty much always here. My roommate though comes and goes at any time of the day/night. She never freaking locks the door. She will come home at 2 am, unlock the door but never lock it back. It really frustrates me because my friend who also lives here got broken into last week. \n\nI told her I would really appreciate it and I would feel safer if she locked the door behind her. She was totally okay with it and actually apologized that she hadn’t been doing it the entire time. \n\nFast forward to a few days later~ I wake up at 10 (my one day to sleep in between work and school) to find the fucking front door OPEN. She wasn’t here so I texted her about it and she told me she must of not shut it all the way when she left for work at 5 AM.  My front door was open for 5 hours. And to add on to that, I have a dog that I usually let out of my room in the morning so if he would’ve ran out the door I would’ve been even more furious. \n\nI told her she really needs to pay attention to the door and please to lock it. Ever since that conversation she’s been really stand-off ish. Am I the asshole? \n\nTldr: my roommate doesn’t lock the front door and she left it wide open after she left for work in the morning. Confronted her about it and now she doesn’t talk to me. ",

So about 5 months back she came over and we had sex and afterwards I went in to cuddle with her and she told me to stop. She got up and left without saying good bye to me. I could tell she was upset and I spent the next few hours calling her and texting her to try and figure out what was wrong. The next day she called me and told me we should just be friends with benefits. I'm not that kind of person and broke up with her on the spot. A few weeks later she told me she was bluffing and she was expecting me to come crawling back, apologizing and begging to take her back.

Most recently he had taken up the entire kitchen table with bags, clothes and other junk. It is known in the house since we have other roommates that the common areas (kitchen, kitchen table and couch) cannot be taken over for more than 24 hours with anyone's stuff. Since the stuff had been there for almost a week i took it all and dumped it on his office chair. Hes told me not to do this before and has told me to put it in a specific place by his desk but that feels to me like i'm now putting in more effort to clean his stuff than he is. I grant you its somewhat petty and i can accept that but the next day he refused to kiss me before leaving for work. For some that may not be a big deal but for us that's huge. Even during larger fights we don't do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe seems to believe i owe it to him to put the stuff where hes asked but how does that make sense if he literally put zero effort into putting it where it should have been?

      "description": "First post ever so please forgive me if I'm not doing this right. My (21f) friend Sara (21f) tells me that she picked up Guy (fake name) and he then proceeded to jump out of her car on the freeway. He lived but was badly injured and she took him to the hospital. He was on a variety of drugs as the reason for doing what he did.  She was freaked out from the whole situation and cleaning all the blood from her car. She also really loves Guy. \n\nNow about Guy is that he is a user and a dealer, been in and out of jail and he takes advantage of everyone around him.  Sara has loved him and dealt with his shit for 7 years. For a short while he agrees to be her boyfriend but cheats on her and dumps her shortly afterward. That doesn't stop her from always answering when he needs something and letting him drag her into his bullshit. He blocks her when he is annoyed by her and unblocks her when he needs her. I can't stand this guy. \n\nSara is heartbroken everytime he does this to her and I try to comfort her and make her realize how shitty Guy is. She says she knows but she can't stop loving him but she promises that she's done with him and will not talk to him.  Which she doesn't have a choice when he blocks her but when he unblocks her she doesn't hesitate to take him back. Over and over.  \n\nThen this happens and I just stop her and tell her I really don't care anymore.  She is angry because I'm not there for her. But I'm just tired of hearing the same story and saying the same thing.  I tell her that Guy is going to kill her someday with the situations he puts her in.  She says she HAD to go get him because then he could have hurt himself or someone else.  I tell her I understand that, but he is not her responsibility and it's not her fault if he makes decisions that could hurt himself or others.  But she doesn't understand or maybe she doesnt want to. Or maybe she's right?\n\nSara had always been there for me and we are very close so I feel bad. AITA?",

      "description": "This happened a couple years ago but it's something that keeps coming up &amp; causing me anxiety/discomfort.\n\nWhen my husband &amp; I got engaged (it was like April), we had been dating for about 8 years &amp; it was not a surprise to anyone that we were going to get married. We do the whole tell the parents thing &amp; they are all excited, later that day I realize that we hadn't told my older brother so we call him up &amp; share the good news. At first he's excited &amp; then asks when we are thinking about getting married. Since we had only been engaged for about a week we hadn't really set a date &amp; I mentioned a date that was about two years in the future but clearly stated that we didn't really know since we hadn't been engaged long &amp; had to plan.\n\nMy brother then says \"oh well it looks like I may beat you guys down the aisle.\" I laughed but when he didn't laugh as well I stopped &amp; said \"wait, you're seeing someone?\" He apparently was, they had their first date on Valentine's day (February) I kinda brushed off his comment about getting married before me &amp; told him that I'd love to meet &amp; get to know her. Especially since she was the first girl he ever dated &amp; \"brought home.\"\n\nCouple months (~July) Husband/I set a wedding date that's ~9 months in the future. We also meet the GF, I think a good fit for OB. In August, we get a call from OB saying that he &amp; GF are engaged. Wow, congrats! Ask about the story &amp; all that, but I never really thought to ask about a date (I was admittedly too wrapped up in planning to be considerate).\n\n2 weeks later OB calls me &amp; asks if I'd be ok with him getting married before me. I was (stupidly) shocked &amp; said I'd have to talk to Husband about it since I was unable to process it at the time. That day I went over to visit my husband &amp; asked him what he thought &amp; shared how I thought it was crazy that OB&amp;GF wanted to get married so quickly after beginning to date. Husband wasn't ok with them getting married before us &amp; agreed w/me that it seemed fast. I also spoke to our mom/older sister they both agreed that I was within my rights to say no if I was uncomfortable about it since he asked.\n\n2 days later I called OB up &amp; told him that it did make me uncomfortable but if they really wanted to get married before us then I couldn't stop them.\n\nThey ended up setting a date for 2 weeks after my wedding.\n\nEver since OB/his wife have made comments often about how they \"really wanted to get married in February\" (I didn't realize that they wanted to get married on their 1 year anniversary, which I do feel bad about) &amp; have heard them bemoan the fact that they couldn't have the flowers they wanted for something like that.\n\nAm I an asshole for letting my feelings known or should I have swallowed them? If YTA, what (if anything) can I do to make it up to them? Thanks for your thoughts &amp; harsh judgments.",

      "description": "I have two girlfriends I care about very deeply. This is completely in the open and they know about each other - I’m not cheating or hiding it or anything like that. I’ve been dating Kayla for 10 months and Lauren for a year and a half. I’m 24, Kayla is 22, and Lauren is 23.\n\nAlthough I came from a lower-class family, I have done very well for myself. I still do a 9-5, but I have a lot of spending money. Both Kayla and Lauren are in grad school with a modest stipend, so I virtually pay for everything when we go out.\n\nI’m madly in love with Kayla, and I love treating her to nice things. The sparkle in her eyes makes me giddy. She had a rough life growing up, and I really want to show her the world. I’ve taken her on several international vacations, many Michelin starred restaurants, etc.\n\nI care very deeply about Lauren and have taken her to nice restaurants, concerts, etc, but I haven’t spent nearly as much on her as I have on Kayla. If I had infinite money and time, I would love to take her travelin with me, but I have limited resources. \n\nRecently I told her that Kayla and I were going to Fiji for two weeks and she blew up on me complaining that I never take her anywhere. I point out that last month I probably spent $1500 on her between play tickets, dinners, and bar tabs.\n\nShe is making me feel like an asshole for not spending more money on her. Am I? I think I’m being generous as is.",

      "description": "So I’m going to try and keep this short, TLDR at bottom, but I’m an LGBT person and Wiccan. I left the Christian faith after being kicked out of a church (and eventually getting my family kicked out) for being transgender. I am not open about this detail in my public life, but I am open that I do have a boyfriend, but my next most private thing is my religious belief.\n\nRecently at my convenience store work in a conservative Christian part of town, I’ve had a lot of people come up to me and try to ask me if I’ve heard the word of God. I tell them yes in some cases, but I left it for a personal reason, and then I get barraged with “Once you’re saved, you are always saved!” until I mention to them in the Bible that it actually says the one Unforgiveable sin is denying the Christian god and Jesus, and suddenly they tell me their life story and how much God has done for them, derailing the topic.\n\nThere are some instances where I just have to say “yeah I’m a Christian” so I don’t get lectured at work, or wherever I go in town. It’s pretty frequent I get asked this as the hours I work coincide with the services of 3 churches within a half mile of where I work. I’ve finally been able to tell certain people that on the clock, I have no religious or political opinion, but now when I come to my work casually, or in the area, it’s a lot harder to escape the question with regulars from my work who know that I am not a Christian.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I start telling people I’m not interested in their beliefs and told them kindly to mind their own business? I know a part of me is hugely afraid of rejection and what other people think of me, especially since I’ve already faced a mass community rejection once. I don’t want people in my life to know my business but I feel like an asshole for lying. I just wish I could have my belief without people trying to just change me. I don’t try to convert people and I love everyone for who they are and their walks, I just wish the same hand would be given to me.\n\nTLDR; I want people to stop trying to convert me to being a Christian after I faced mass rejection, but I feel like I would be an asshole if I told them to stop and that I’m not interested in their religion. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "Sorry, this is going to be long. This happened earlier this year and we recently broke up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we were together, I was 24F and she was 19F. We'll call my partner 'Sarah'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm confused as to how I should feel about this. We had a rocky relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt got to the point where we said we were going to take a break from each other. I asked her is she going to see someone else and she said she's going to live her life. To me, that basically means yes, she's going to see someone else if someone else comes along. I told her that I feel uncomfortable with that. I told her that's not a break; to me, a break is just some space apart to cool off but we're still together, and what she's describing was a breakup. So in the end, we broke up. I moved out and went back home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets confusing to me. We broke up but we were still in each other's lives all the time. At some point, I started staying over again and during this time, we started being intimate again; we would do things like hold hands, hug each other, snuggle and even kiss each other. One night, one thing led to another, we slept together. The next day, we went to a nice restaurant for lunch and I apologised for the stuff I did in the past (mostly me being emotionally detached and not understanding emotions, this is a classic avoidant person dating an anxious person situation). I started crying at this point, then Sarah came over to me to comfort me and kissed me on the cheek.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all that, it feels like we got back together. Then Sarah tells me she met someone on Tinder and she has a crush on them, but she's deleted the app because she wants to think about it before she does anything. But she said she's added them on facebook and has their number. I remember feeling horrible by this news. I told her that I dont feel comfortable with her seeing someone else romantically. She said she just wants to be friends with this person now. I just remember feeling horribly upset by this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSarah saw how upset I was, she comforted me and told me it's going to be okay. She said things will get better and she believes in me that I can get better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe very next day, I went back to work. During the day, I noticed that Sarah accidentally left her medicine in my bag so I texted her to tell her medicine is with me. I asked if she would like me to bring it back tonight and have dinner together. I got no response from her so I thought she's probably busy doing something (she usually doesn't reply to our messages) and I'll just bring it back to her place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hopped on the train and called again later and she picked up. I told her i'm on the way to her place because she left her medicine with me. Sarah tells me that she's actually in the city and is on the way back home. Wanting to make conversation and genuinely interested in her life, I asked her what did she do in the city. She said she was hanging out with a friend and because they were watching a movie, her phone was on silent. They went to the arcade too. She was on her way back so I waited for her at the train station for over an hour. Stupid me thought it was a good idea to not wear warm clothes and I froze my ass off. I killed time by knitting her a scarf.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Sarah arrived she looked really sick! So I took care of her that night. While we were walking to get some takeaway, I asked how her day was and she said it was good. When I asked with which friend, she dodged the question which made me feel uneasy because before she told me she found someone on tinder which she has some feelings for. This makes me uneasy because i’m not stupid, I get a feeling she was with that tinder girl since she didn’t tell me who she was with… I've put it out of my mind for the rest of the night because she was sick and took care of her. Later that night, she told me I was special to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up still feeling uneasy and scared. I was freaking out that she went on a date with that tinder girl last night. My gut tells me she did go on a date with that tinder girl. I needed to get the hell outta there. She woke up while I was getting ready. She had a look on her face and tilted her head toward me and smiled, so I kissed her on the lips goodbye and she smiled back at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left that morning and went back to work and went home. The next few days I was just feeling completely crushed and awful. I tried calling her but she ignored it. She finally messages me back after a few days and asks why I was “hassling her”. I told her I’ve been feeling very low. She then says she needs to work on herself and appreciated it that I was supportive and was there for her as a friend. She know’s we’re complicated but it’s a lot of stress on her. That completely threw me off! As a friend! I just felt so crushed and I broke down and cried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few hours later, she texts “how are we sorting out the dentist payment?”. Backstory here is that she needs wisdom teeth surgery. When we were dating, I said I’ll pay for it. She’s unemployed and I’m working full time. I didn’t answer right away because I was still feeling awful and spiralling. Sarah later calls me and asks me “what’s wrong” in a very impatient tone. I told her how I was feeling and she says “well you've put me through stuff too, the bad outweigh the good”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked her did she go out with that tinder girl, she said yes. I asked was it a date, she said she didn’t know. After a lot of back and forth, we concluded that we were just friends after all that time and that I’ll be paying for the surgery (SO DUMB OF ME!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think after a few days I went back her place. Eventually we started arguing. I got so fed up I told her we can’t keep doing this. I said I’ll get out of her life and maybe one day we can be friends again. Sarah was sad after I said that and I was sad too, we both ended up crying. I wiped away her tears and hugged her and comforted her. Eventually she kinda tackled me to the floor and hugged me and cried on me. I held her in my arms and rubbed her back to comfort her. She eventually kissed me on the lips. I was surprised but I kissed her back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said she missed me. I asked about that tinder girl and she says she doesn’t feelings for her anymore. Sarah said while she was with tinder girl, she wished she was with me instead. She said she wasn’t going to talk to her anymore. Eventually, Sarah did delete her number and facebook. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch later, probably a few weeks after, I brought up how upset I was when I knew for sure that she went on a date with that tinder girl even though I told her I was uncomfortable with Sarah seeing someone else while we were on “break”. Sarah then says it’s my fault that she turned to tinder because I was such a jerk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, she confessed to me that she also kissed a guy on the lips the night before just to see what it was like. I was so shocked that I dropped my phone while I was holding it. I thought to myself, so I WASN’T GOING CRAZY AND UNREASONABLY JEALOUS of her guy friend (I kept my jealous feelings to myself because I didn’t want to push her away). After she told me and saw that I wasn’t taking it well, she asked am I still going to pay for the wisdom teeth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAND GUESS WHAT MY STUPID ASS SAID? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went off on a tangent on that last bit, but back to the main point. Am I the asshole for feeling so shitty about that whole situation?! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Also I need help in getting over her)",

      "description": "So it’s literally only been 5 days since I was talking to this guy. In my opinion that isn’t even enough days to catch ‘hard feelings’. Keep in mind we have NEVER met either. He wanted our first date to be before he leaves for the navy. He’s in there for 5 years and already served one year.\n\nToday I REALLY thought about it, and I wouldn’t be able to date someone in the navy because of distance. We hardly even know each other and he’s leaving in 2 weeks. And again, only 5 days talking. At first when I started chatting with him I thought I’d be able to do it, but now I realize no, I wouldn’t.\n\nWould I be the asshole to tell him I changed my mind on going on a date with him before he leaves? What I’m worried about to , I’m actually still a virgin at 20 years old and I don’t know if he’d be ‘expecting sex’ on that date because he’s gonna be gone for so long after and I’m not that kind of girl.\n\n\nI also want to point out he’s a PLAYER, I literally found out he’s been talking to other girls besides me, which I don’t appreciate and at this point I don’t care about his feelings. He can go on a date with one of the others. Am I the asshole?",

I explained that i had been feeling depressed, and that i had lost my mind for a few days and thought about doing something stupid  and i then laughed it off and said everything was now fine. \n\nFirstly - no i don’t think depression or any related issues are a joke, however making jokes about my own situation is something of a coping mechanism to me, which i have explained. \n\nHowever, my friend now thinks that i am a complete asshole, i am not sure whether it’s because i actually told them about it, or whether it was because i didn’t appear to take it too seriously \n\nI myself am a little annoyed because i have helped my friend through all of their problems, my friend hadn’t messaged me once in two weeks to check on me bearing in mind i usually message a lot to check in (they’re preoccupied with a new partner) and has offered no support, other than calling me an asshole, unfair, and questioning how are they meant to just laugh it off. \n\nObviously i regret saying it but AITA and i just can’t see it? \n\n",

      "title": "AITA for turning the heating on despite my flatmate complaining?",
      "description": "This is probably fairly mundane, but I'm really stumped as to whether I'm in the wrong here. A bit of background, first: I'm a second year university student living in a five bedroom house with four other flatmates, and we all get along reasonably well with each other. I have the ground floor bedroom, which is the largest, but also the coldest, due to it being at the front of the house with large bay windows. The past few months have usually been colder than usual, so I'll take it upon myself to turn the boiler on for some heating in my room if it ever gets too chilly. \n\nHowever, a few weeks ago, one of my flatmates (let's call him Elvis) confronted me after I made a passing comment about what I usually set the boiler dial at. He said that I was being selfish for turning the boiler on, and that I was the sole cause of this heating issue. I suggested that he just turned his radiator off in his room if he was too hot (every room has its own radiator that can be turned on or off independently), but he told me that he already does, and that heat was rising from the bottom floor to the top floor. We eventually came to the compromise that we would keep all of the radiators off, except mine, to minimise the temperature elsewhere in the house.\n\n(Another flatmate told me that it's annoying to turn off the radiators individually, because then they take even longer to warm up when he wants the heating on. I said that it was selfish that he'd rather have his heating come on faster when he wants than let me have my radiator turned on independently, but that's another matter.)\n\nHowever, even since we compromised, he'll still turn the boiler off whenever he's nearby. We've not spoken to each other about this, but we'll often end up in anonymous boiler proxy wars. I don't turn the heating on all of the time, but I will whenever my room does get particularly cold, and he'll consistently come to turn it off. Last night it was two degrees Celsius outside, and he came downstairs to turn it off each time that I turned it on (this happened about several times).\n\nI've never seen Elvis wearing something other than shorts, even throughout all of winter, so he's definitely a naturally warm person - I understand that if he's getting too hot in his room, it must be as frustrating to him as it is when I'm too cold. However, I really struggle to understand how turning the boiler off will make any difference when his radiator (and most others in the house) is turned off; the flatmate in the room directly above mine has said that he has no issues with being too hot, so I don't think it's an issue with heat rising from my room specifically. And it's not like I'm trying to keep the house at insane temperatures - the boiler has a dial with ten notches on it, and I never turn it past the third mark. Even when it's ten or eleven degrees outside, I feel as though it's warranted to keep some heating on.\n\nSo, I want to know, am I the asshole here? What should I do?",

      "description": "!!! Before this begins I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes, english is not my first language !!!\n\nMy dad's mom was my favorite grandma when I was a kid. I used to go to her house every single weekend because it was always fun and games and I loved it there. I loved her and saw her as an amazing grandma.\nThat's until I grew up. \nI didn't change with her at all, still acted the same and loved her, but I started noticing how harsh and rudely she would treat her dad and my uncle that live with her, and how she was always complaining about something and making everyone seem like the villain. Still, I would go to her house and stay there for a while, watching tv with her and talking and this kind of stuff.\nOne day, my father told me that she told him that I was rude on my time there and never talked with anyone and instead just stayed on my phone the entire time and a bunch of other rude things about me, including things about my appearance (and she told him not to say anything to me). I do have A LOT trouble being sociable and those experiences are really uncomfortable to me but never once that sort of thing affected my relationship with her as I didn't see her as a outsider, she was my grandma and I always treated her very lovingly and kindly.\nWhat surprises me the most about that is that she never changed the way she acts with me. She was and still is the same, and I've been to her house after I knew what she was saying about me, she just acted like nothing ever happened. \nSo now I can't bring myself to act with her the way I did before, it just feels very fake and I've been avoiding going to her house or to interact whit her because everytime I see her her words repeat in my head and I just can't be genuinely happy and loving as I was before, and end up just being fake and giving out fake smiles and vain simple responses.\nAITA to be doing this and feeling this way when she still treats me the same even though she said all that about me? Am I just being childish and holding on to something that happened in the past? Should I try harder to forget?",

      "description": "Sorry it's so long. I've have a close, but often contentious relationship with my daughter. When she became a mom, I became a full time babysitter for my grandson. She has to be at work by 7am and lives 30 minutes from me so I have to get up by 445am. Thankfully it's  usually only 3 days a week, and btw, I ABSOLUTELY ADORE MY GRANDCHILD! \n\nThe first year I babysat it was maybe 8-9 hours each day i was there because my son in law was able to be home by 3-4pm, and I was just grandma being grandma and helping. Then my and my husband's financial situation changed due to a healthcare crisis and bills. I HAD to get a job again. \n\nIt was humiliating to ask my child for money to care for my grandson, but that's what I did. I explained our situation and I told her I couldn't keep babysitting for free on a full time basis because it left me no time to get a real job that pays. We came to an agreement that she would pay me $100/week or like $35/day and I agreed to claim it on my taxes so she could have it as child care credit on her taxes. This was the 2nd year babysitting. \n\nDuring the 3rd year babysitting my son in law got a new job that often takes him out of town. Now instead of leaving by 3-4pm, I'm there till 5 or 6pm when another grandma takes over until about 8 or 9pm when my daughter gets home from work.  One night a week I do stay until she gets home,  giving me like a 15 hour day. I'm spending at least  10 more hours per week babysitting than I used to.\n\nNow daughter is pregnant and when I half joking half serious told her that after the baby is born I was considering raising the rates from $35/day to $50/day she completely lost it. As in threatening to just put them both in daycare and never letting me see them again. I tried telling her that since son in law out of town so much that my days are longer now, 10 extra hours a week was basically another day. She wasn't having it and just threw in my face how much my mom helped me when she was little. For free. Because that's what grandmas do.\n\nAm I the asshole for charging my daughter to babysitt? Should I have just quit babysitting,  made them put him in daycare and gotten a real job 2 years ago? At the time I felt like it was a good compromise. They pay me less than a daycare would cost so it's good for them and while I don't make anywhere near what a real job would pay it helps my budget just enough that I can keep my head above water.  Unfortunately, I'm just financially not able to do this for free like other grandma's do. \n\nAm I the asshole because she pays me at all?\nAm I the asshole because I brought up more money for more hours/more kids, that are my grandkids?",

When I was driving past a cyclist ignored me and drove right in front of me, which had me braking pretty hard (no emergency brake) so I didn't hit her.

      "description": "I live in dorm style, on campus housing at a University with 3 other girls for 6 months now. It’s tight quarters, but things have generally been very chill and we’ve all become good friends. \n\nOne roommate “M” has an emotional support dog who is two years old. The first week we moved in, the dog shit all over my rug and shoes and peed on my other roommate “H”’s bed. H and I tried to talk to M about it, but as soon as we brought it up she started crying. So, since we didn’t know her very well, we kinda just let it go to keep the peace. \n\nSince then, the dog has peed or pooped in the apartment about twice a week. I often clean it up. It sheds constantly and she never vacuums. M works long hours and keeps the dog locked in a small kennel for about 8 hours a day. When she comes home from work at 11pm or so, she doesn’t take the dog out, she just goes to bed and takes her out in the morning. She takes her out maybe twice a day, but never on a walk, just to go pee in the courtyard of the apartment building. She even had a tinder guy come to spend the night and the dog peed on her bed during the hookup! \n\nH and I used to take the dog out because we felt bad for it, but M would get on our case about not locking her cage right and other small stuff. We didn’t want it to become our issue so we stopped. \n\nThe dog is very poorly behaved. It has bitten M on the face, growled and tried to bite guests, and it barks constantly. M lets it eat off our plates and generally do whatever she wants. She does not know any basic commands like sit or down or whatever. \n\nIt’s really been getting on my nerves. About a month ago I talked to her in a very non confrontational way and very “let’s work this out together” attitude. I thought it went well, but the next day the dog shat on the floor again! I talked to her again the next week. Nothing changed. \n\nSo todayyyyyy, she texted in the roommate group chat “I have said this before but you guys need to make sure the sponge isn’t damp after doing your dishes” and that was my last straw boy o boy. \nShe is upset about such a minute detail when there’s the giant issue of her awful dog at hand. \n\nSo I went down to the front desk and told them my concerns. The receptionist gave me the email of the apartment manager &amp; said that if her service dog was acting this way she could be removed. I emailed the manager and she’s going to talk to M this week. I don’t think the dog will be taken away, I think I’ll just be moved apartments, but I guess we’ll see. \n\nI really feel so awful for doing this. I know it’s not the dogs fault &amp; I want her to have a nice life and this isn’t it. I don’t want her dog to be taken from her, but I was just so tired of dealing w this every day. Her mom has a nice big yard and other dogs. The dog would be so much happier there. I do feel like such an asshole though because it’s her emotional support animal. I’m having inner turmoil &amp; I can’t sleep. What do y’all think?? ",

      "title": "WIBTA for moving out if my husband doesn't stop smoking?",
      "description": "Married for four years but together for 12 and we have a young child together. A couple months ago my husband suddenly started smoking cigarettes again. I say again because he was a smoker when I met him 12 years ago but managed to hide it from me for almost the first entire year of dating -- I know, great way to start a relationship with a lie -- but somehow we got through it. I told him if he wanted to move in together he needed to quit smoking, which he did, and other than that and a few minor things he's always been honest about everything else and has not smoked the entire time we've been together (that I know of). \n\nThe last two years have been rough, admittedly. Our baby was a very difficult newborn and cried and screamed all the time for no reason, and still today is a very poor sleeper and high needs, but he's a good kid and my husband was/is excited to be a dad. So it was strange when a few months ago out of the blue he told me he had started smoking again at work. Of course I asked why, and he said he'd been feeling stressed out from lack of sleep, work, etc. and he just had the urge to smoke again and it's been helping him cope with the stress. I've tried numerous times to talk to him to get to the root of what exactly is stressing him out and why he took up smoking again - because we've both been under the same stress for the last two years and he managed to not smoke that whole time; in fact, for awhile he was working out daily and that seemed to be working as his outlet. \n\nThings were complicated when his mother passed away in October, although they were not close and he hadn't seen her in over a decade. He'd already been smoking for awhile but was promising to quit until then. Now, he refuses to try to quit because he says he is still grieving, which is understandable, but I am not ok with him smoking indefinitely and I am at the point where I feel his smoking is negatively affecting me and our son. Although he only smokes outside and claims he doesn't smoke in front of our son, he still reeks of smoke when he comes in and we are not sleeping in the same bed anymore because he would smoke right before bed and I couldn't tolerate the smell of him coming to bed smelling of smoke (I don't have a medical issue but I'm very sensitive to the smell and always have been). On top of that, he coughs and hacks loudly now in the mornings and at night which is both depressing (for his health's sake) and annoying, and wakes me and sometimes our son up. He also will try to go long stretches when he's home without smoking so that he doesn't smell, but of course this results in him being moody all the time from the nicotine withdrawals and he'll snap at me and for no reason. I guess what saddens me the most is even if he is not willing to try quitting for me, he should want to for his son's sake. Yes he's still too little to really understand what smoking is but he won't be forever.\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\*: Husband started smoking a few months ago and is not willing to quit anytime soon. \n\nI know it's only been a few months and he's still grieving his mother, but would I be the asshole if I gave him the ultimatum of either quitting within a certain timeframe or me and our son moving out (or he moves out, but obviously I can't force that as it's his home too)?",

For the first few days, they weren't actually living there (they were moving things in, but staying somewhere else) so things were quiet like usual, but since they've moved in the amount of noise has been abysmal. Every single day I can hear their baby crying and screaming, and my bedroom is right next to their bathroom (all the houses have the same layout) so I hear every shit and piss they take. This has been affecting the little amount of sleep I do get (usually it takes me until 2AM to get to sleep if I can sleep at all) and making it even more common for me to have sleepless nights. The worst part is that the house is owned and rented by the local authority, so it would be impossible to get soundproofing put in without a tremendous amount of money out of MY pocket (money that I don't have right now).

      "description": "This happened last night and it's still bothering me a little this morning, so y'all tell me if I was the asshole.\n\nLast night I went out to dinner. It was after dark by the time I was done and the parking lot for this restaurant is poorly lit and the lanes are only one car width wide. Basically, it's one way through the lot entrance to exit, with a small side lot behind the restaurant that you can circle.\n\nI was leaving the parking lot and drove towards the exit. A car was stopped in the lane, blocking the way out. The reverse lights then came on and the car started backing up. I honked and it stopped, but was still in reverse. There was a parking space that it looks like he wanted to get into, but he'd gone too far forward. He didn't have to backup to get to it, he just had to drive about 10 more feet and turn left to get to the spot from the other side, since you could park from front or back in this single row of spots. \n\nSo, we sat like this for a few minutes. Him in reverse, not moving, and me in drive, not moving. It was pretty obvious he wanted me to back up to let him in the space, but in order to do that I would have had to back up in a dark lot in a narrow lane -- not straight back, but around a curve. I didn't want to do this and risk hitting anything or anyone. The lot was pretty crowded and there were people  going to their cars.\n\nI got out of the car and pointed to where he needed to turn to come at the space from the other side. He said I should just back up so he could get the spot. I said that I didn't want to back up, that I wanted to continue driving forward. I don't know why I used such odd phrasing, that's just what came out of my mouth. We were both visibly annoyed, but civil. \n\nI got back in my car and waited. A couple of minutes later, he moved out of the way and I left the lot.\n\nFWIW, there were no cars behind me. I could have backed up, and might have done so if it were daylight or the parking lot was better lit, but it was too dark.  ",

That guy stood directly behind me and said he likes my shoes. I got kinda scared. I didn't say anything, but i grabbed my friend and almost runned away to the first shop we saw. The guy probably understood it and disappeared. So AITA? Was he just shy and trying to make a conversation? In my opinion, i wasn't.

      "description": "Hi all, long time lurker without an account until now. \n\nAbout a month and a half ago, my mom (62F) and I (28F) had a \\~2 hr long fight over the phone. It started with her accusing me of making up stories to try to make her look and feel bad---I showed her written and picture proof of the event I was talking about (I was an avid journaler during the time that we were fighting about), and told her I was really not okay with being called a liar when I obviously wasn't. The fight then meandered through a bunch of other issues, and ended with her demanding examples of her being overly critical, which I provided, easily, as she is a textbook tiger mother. She reacted by straight up calling me a liar (\"you know what, you are such a liar\") and I told her \"f you\" and hung up on her.  \n\nWe are neither a fighting family nor a swearing family (my sister and I used to get in trouble for saying \"that sucks\") so this was a REALLY BIG DEAL. My sister (32F) told me I was way out of line and need to apologize. My dad also said that I should apologize because she's the only mother I'll ever have.  I'm was/am still stuck on how my own mother called me a liar (twice) because she didn't want to admit that she did some irrational/imperfect things. I told my sister that I wasn't okay with just lying down and taking whatever verbal and emotional abuse our mom dishes out to us anymore, but my sister said that by telling her to go f herself I was abusing her.  \n\nMy sister also brought up the point that our mom definitely has some mental health issues and she can't help herself so we should be understanding. She is undiagnosed because she's resistant to going to see anyone, but depression is definitely on the table. And she had just been really upset by something my dad did (long story) so she was probably feeling particularly fragile at the moment. So maybe I was too harsh and should've apologized. My mom and I are both extremely stubborn (apple, tree) so we haven't talked at all since except that I texted her happy birthday last month (not talking isn't atypical though, I never call because of the whole overly critical thing). AITA for not apologizing?  \n\ntl;dr: my mom was upset about something, we had a fight where called me a liar twice when I wasn't. I told her f you and hung up, still haven't apologized despite sister and dad insisting, AITA",

Our clientele is 25+,but since we are located in the suburbs, we get a lot of young guests on Friday and Saturday nights (in Denmark, it's legal if you're 18).\n\nWe were out drinking on my day of, and my friend D was getting super drunk. He was really embarrassing the whole evening, shouting at my co-workers that they were too slow (which is the most stressful and annoying part of my job) and being a douche. Later that night, I went home with my boo, but D and the others stayed. When the bar closed, he wanted to come inside to turn on his phone (its was too cold to turn it on). He was told no, and the situation got heated. He ended up actually making one of the guards trip and fall (he had recently had surgery). The next day, I felt the need to give them his name and FB-account, which I did, and he got quarantine for life. This sucks, since we hang out there a lot, but Im not sure weather it was the right thing for me to do. Am I (also) The Asshole? ",

      "description": "So this is a little complicated. I have a friend who I'm very close to, and we have dated on and off so it's still kinda Inbetween friends and more than friends. I'm 17, in college, and I'm generally fairly busy. I've known him since I was 13, so he knows me generally fairly well.\n\nNow I like double texts such as people sending me multiple wholesome photos, texts, stuff I reminded them of, stories they wanted to tell me, etc etc.\n\nWhat I hate?\n\"hey\"\n\"hello????\"\n\"?????\"\n\":((((\"\n\"hello....???\"\n\nThat kinda stuff, and they do this all the time. I've Been generally busy today and more so lately in general, so I haven't really been texting anyone but my best friend (we haven't gotten a lot of time to talk due to their poor mental health, but they're getting better and we talk more!!)\n\nNow, for example, today I spent my day at college and then at home playing pokemon let's go, cause I hadn't had the time to play it or any other game pretty much since it came out and I wanted to relax.\n\nNow I have about 10 text messages over the span of the past 5 hours, all along the lines of \"hello???? :(\" kinda stuff. Him getting annoyed and grumpy I'm not responding. I'm. Busy.\n\nI didn't wanna respond when I saw this because I knew I was gonna be really annoyed and he would probably still not get why. Yes, I've told him I hate this behaviour. No, he hasn't stopped.\n\nNow I did respond kinda annoyed just saying \"for the love of God could you please stop\" and he's kinda pissed at me.\n\nAm I the asshole? I know, I could've told him I was busy, but I've generally told him before and it doesn't really seem to matter. And when I tell him it feels kinda guilt trippy like \"OK... I'll leave for now\". Not too bad, but not great either.\n\nI wanna add onto that, one of his texts was him being annoyed and going \"I know you're at school but I want attention.\"\n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nPs: sorry for the messy post",

But every time I try to plan something for him to meet him, something comes up. \n\nHe’s never taken me out on any dates because he just doesn’t have the money and lately he hasn’t been texting me like he normally would. He doesn’t say good morning or goodnight or I love you. I always start the conversation first. And when I bring it up, he makes me feel bad that I’m concerned about it. \n\nHe told me today that his coworker met my father and told my father that he took one of his female friends out for coffee last Friday. He barely had any time for me that day. Wouldn’t even call me to say goodnight. \n\nI bring up that as soon as I asked him to meet my dad, as soon as I wanted a real relationship, he stoped coming over. He stoped being affectionate. He says that I’m paranoid and that I obviously don’t know him. \n\nI tell him that I feel like he used me for sex. He flips out. Says that he’s so mad at me for even suggesting that. \n\nAITA?

      "description": "I grew up being very close with my cousin. We spent every holiday together and made snow creatures every winter; one year he just stopped coming. We were young (hes a year older) but it still made me sad\n\nAs we got older it got more awkward. Id try to talk to him but in middle school he was the cool kid, I was the emo kid. When people would talk about me he wouldnt defend me and wouldnt say hi when he saw me. At family gatherings he ignored me until everyone else left (and I mean literally anyone ages 10-20) for him to talk to and only then would he give me attention\n\nMy freshman year (his sophomore year) he was quarterback on our football team and I’d dropped my emo status and joined the cheer team. I told him how it made me sad that he’d ignore me and how he was basically my brother 1 year and the next a stranger. He told me he was sorry and that we would fix it. for a bit we did. He became my best friend, offered to bring me food on days I didnt have lunch, high five me in hallways, hug me after football games, talk to me when I was sad\n\nThen one day he decided to add to the stigma of football players in HS. he let his grades drop and started doing drugs and drinking all the time. When people would make fun of me he’d start laughing with them and stopped saying hi when he saw me. He even let someone on the FB team take a picture of our text conversation and post it making fun of me. He himself didn’t say anything mean but he didnt defend me or tell them to take it down either\n\nSoon he stopped altogether. He wouldnt text me often anymore. We went to our school ball and he didnt say a word to me the entire time even when I approached him. when he started doing drugs and partying he let go of me again. I dont care about that stuff but he’d been against it his whole life\n\nWhen my birthday came it was my sweet 16, I invited him. I called him just before it to make sure he was coming. He said he was but he’d be late. He never came and my sister who lived with my nana at the time came at the end of the party and told me that my cousin had came to see my nana who had cancer like he said he was (he told me that’s why he’d be late), said he napped the whole time, left hours before said he was, went to get drunk with his pals + told my family not to tell me\n\nThere was proof online. later I get a text from him that says “Hey cuz, left nanas pretty late and I assumed you’d be cleaning up by the time I showed up so I just didnt. Sorry to disappoint&lt;3” I never replied, I haven’t spoken to him since. It was the 4th birthday he said he’d be at and didnt come to. He hasn’t made an effort to reach out to me but I feel bad for cutting him off. in every situation where its me or someone else he chooses them. When we see each other at the gym he looks at me like hes expecting a convo and I dont approach him. I didnt speak to him at nanas funeral even though he expected me to\n\nAITA for cutting my cousin out of my life?",

      "description": "So this happened about an hour ago so I’m still a little shocked, but ill try to explain in as much detail as I can. Tonight, I decided to drop in on some friends and they were watching some football. We ended up deciding to go to the bowling alley and we were out there for about an hour, had two beers and left. Ended up going and getting a daiquiri that I wanted to drink later on in the night. We get back to my friend’s place and he puts on a game. At the end of the third quarter, I ask if there are any basketball games on. My friend says he doesn’t know, there should be. I say, “alright, I’m gunna check what’s on real quick” and start scrolling through the guide with the game still on behind the lower panel showing the other channels. He says, “I don’t give a shit what’s on, I’m not changing the game”. I’m thinking at this point he’s messing with me, cause surely no one would be upset by me checking the channels real quick. I jokingly reply, “I don’t give a shit either man. I ain’t gunna change it, I’m just seeing what’s on real quick. I won’t change the channel”. He suddenly gets up and rips the remote out of my hand and yells at me to get out. I sit there stunned for a second and then I say “I wasn’t going to change the channel man, I was just seeing what’s on”. My other friends are just staring now. He then says, “I don’t give a shit, get the fuck out”. I said, “are you serious?” He just responds, “yes, get out”. At this point, I get really pissed off because this is such a stupid thing and I have the urge to actually swing because I’m a bit tired of some of the shit he’s pulled in the past, but I think better of it and just tell the rest of the group, “have a good night guys”. And get in my car and leave this house he shares with two of our mutual friends that weren’t home. I waited about 15 minutes to cool down and then text him to apologize and say I’m sorry if what I did came off across the wrong way, I just wanted to see what games were on to check the scores of the games later on. He responds and tells me “if it’s not your house, you’re not the boss of shit. That’s fucking stupid. If you wanted to check the games, you could’ve just looked at your phone just like you could with scores”. That just pissed me off even more, but I tried being civil and said, “you’re right, I could’ve just checked my phone, I’m sorry if it came off that I was bossing anyone around, that’s not how I meant to come off.” And he just hasn’t responded, probably won’t. Then he’ll just try to pretend it won’t happen like he does with other stuff, but I’m about fed up and thinking about just breaking off the friendship altogether which is unfortunate because he’s part of our friend group and I feel that means I may not be hanging with that friend group as much anymore. \n\nTL;DR: My friend kicked me out of his house because I was checking what other games were on tv while still watching the game that he wanted to see.

      "description": "Long story short, I got engaged. I told my S/O I wanted a particular style stone from a particular small jeweler I found on Etsy. Their reviews were great and I had good contact with the owner while trying to decide what I wanted. \n\n\nMy S/O and I went to the jewelry store and got my ring size. Voila magic I’m done. \n\n\nHe orders a ring in the style I like, from the company I sent his way, in the size we checked for. \n\n\nHe proposes. The ring doesn’t fit. I’m like ok clearly the size was wrong. It’s not extremely loose, but just loose enough to make you worry. I message the jewelry shop saying I want to see if I can resize, they say no problem $100 and to ship their way. I’m out of town for 10 days so I say I’m gonna check with a jeweler to resize it when I get back where I don’t have to pay shipping. \n\n\nI come back home, take it to a large national jewelry chain and ask them to give me my finger size so I can get the ring resized.  They tell me the size is the same as before we purchased the ring. Then I ask them to measure the ring, they tell me it’s 1/4 size larger than my size. I’m like um... confused. So I’m like ok, let me take it somewhere else and check. \n\n\nI take it to another large national jeweler and they tell me the same thing. I take photos at both places with the ring being measured the incorrect size. I send them to my S/O. \n\n\nWe escalate a case through the purchasing site to ask for a resize since it was 1/4 size too large and not what was ordered. We provide the photos showing it’s too large. We make them send a shipping label to send it back (we give an alternative that we could drop it off - the shop is literally 20 min from my home but they didn’t bite) and they do. \n\n\nThey get the ring back in the mail and say that it is the correct size. They send picture of it on another ring sizer showing the correct size. They say they will resize it 1/4 smaller and ship it back, costing them around $100 for shipping and they didn’t charge the $100 resize fee - saying they lost $200 on the deal. \n\n\nThe business says we are not being fair - and saying we are making inaccurate accusations that they made an error. My S/O spent thousands of dollars on this ring and just wanted it to be perfect.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Ordered a ring that cost several thousand dollars in a particular size. Ring didn’t fit. Two different jewelers say it’s a larger size than ordered. Escalated to get it fixed. Shop says it’s the right size, and unfair they lose $200 on resizing and shipping charges. \n\n\n\n\nAITA for making them resize it without paying their fee?",

      "description": "This is not a fundamental one, just something that I could use a level-headed perspective on. My bf and I listen to political podcasts frequently. Eventhough we agree on most big topics, there are some things we see differently and we have discussed them fiercely but lovingly in the past. He is a little more on the right, while i am a little more on the left. Now there was a podcast that really hit a nerve with me and upset me, because I found it callous and racist. I texted my bf quotes from the interview and told him why they upset me so much. He then proceeded to take the counterposition and to explain to me why he actually agreed with some of the speaker’s points. I told him that i was not in the mood for a discussion and that he should let one go every once in a while and just be my supporting and understanding boyfriend. He then ended the conversation by stating that if I didnt want his opinion, I shouldnt have texted him the quotes. AITA for expecting him to feel the room and leave aside the political quarreling? Not everything needs to be a debate. One of the reasons why I love him is precisely that he is opinionated and well-spoken. I wouldnt want him to ever have to compromise or betray his political beliefs, which are part of his identity. AITA to ask him to write/say something nice and not to take a position/counterposition? Dont get me wrong, I dont want him agreeing with me. It would just be nice if he acknowledged that I was upset and not treat the conversation like a debate. Am I being too sensitive here?",

      "description": "So a little background info; I was dating this girl about a year back and we had a mutual friend whom she had introduced me to. This friend, let's call her Stephanie, was down with clinical depression and dropped out of school so she didn't have any friends except for the girl I was dating back then. However the girl and my relationship was very toxic, and both Stephanie and I realised that too late. I finally broke off with the girl and Stephanie cut her out as well. \n\nAfter that, I was basically lost and alone as well. We were both at our lowest since she lost her only other friend and we both only had each other to fall back on. We tried our best to support each other and all, but after some time I got busy and wasn't able to keep in contact with her as much. During this time, she's made a huge improvement with herself, finding many new friends and even having a close circle of friends (according to what I see on social media), all while I was busy with school. \n\nIt's been half a year since I have had a real conversation with Stephanie. It was her birthday recently and I was disheartened to find out that she held a party without sending me an invite. I felt angry because I was there for her at the times she was at her lowest. She was also always there for me, when I got busy I did try my best to keep the friendship going but I didn't feel the effort from her anymore and we'd go for weeks or months without contact. She's basically forgotten me, and because of this I cut her off from my life without telling her. I'm happy for her and all, that she's found friends, but I feel very underappreciated in this situation and i'm not the kind of guy who deals very well with my emotions, especially in situations like these.\n\nAm I the asshole for cutting her off?",

      "description": "I know this isn’t a relationship sub, but I really need to know who is in the wrong here. \n\n\nTitle sounds bad, but here’s some backstory. My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship since freshman year of high school, and we are now both living together as adults in college. \n\n\nThroughout high school, he cheated on me several times. Once with my best friend, once with a close family friend’s daughter, and several more times... that I know of. Each time, I found out months after the cheating had occurred so I obviously developed serious trust issues from being lied to so much. I stayed with him because I was young and dumb, the same way he cheated because he was young and dumb. We have both matured immensely since we’ve graduated and are not the same people we were as teenagers—like most people. \n\n\nHe’s grown into a great guy. He works really hard, is completely open and transparent with me, and I really have no doubts about him being loyal. Despite this, being effed over by him so many times in high school has left me a lot of trauma to deal with. Yes, I see a therapist. \n\n\nHere’s an example of my trust issues in action: a few months ago, he wanted to spend the night at a friend’s house. Several male friends would be there, along with two girls that my boyfriend and I have previously hung out with /together/. I explained to him that I wasn’t comfortable with him spending the night (and drinking/getting high) at a house where two attractive women would also be spending the night at. He told me that I was being ridiculous and that my trust issues were baseless since all of his unfaithfulness happened back in high school and there would be other people there.\n\n\nObviously I couldn’t stop him, and I couldn’t tell him he couldn’t go, so he went anyways and everything turned out fine and he didn’t try anything at the party (not that I really expected him to). I was still really upset that he went and completely brushed off my concerns.\n\n\nStuff like this happens from time to time and while I never actually think he’s going to cheat on me, I also feel like he isn’t being empathetic enough. Every time I bring up being uncomfortable about a situation, he gets mad at me for “bringing up sh*t from the past” rather than taking responsibility for the trust issues he created for the first 4 years of our relationship. \n\n\nSo AITA for being unable (unwilling, maybe? Not entirely sure) to simply get over what he put me through while we were in high school? Is there any way you guys think we can compromise?",

      "title": "AITA for ghosting an old friend?",
      "description": "10 years ago I was a freshman in college. I lived in a small dorm with about 40ish other freshman. We were all kinda friends and knew each other, and for most of the year all of us would host or show up at the same parties. After freshman year we all moved into other dorms, a lot of us transferred to other schools, and by our junior/senior years, most of us weren’t speaking much. \n\nFast forward 6 years from that, I’m engaged to a girl I met at that freshman dorm. We reconnected after a few years of not speaking, started dating, one thing led to another. Only two other people from our old freshmen dorm got invited to the wedding, but I heard from a lot of them in the year leading up to it, mostly just a quick “hey congrats, how have you been all these years?” But there was one who went far, far beyond that. \n\nFor the sake of anonymity, I’m gonna call him Dave. Dave texted me about a month before the wedding and said “Hey I saw on Facebook you and (wife) were getting married, congrats”. I didn’t have his number saved, as I haven’t talked to him in 8 or 9 years and we live in different states now, so I didn’t know who it was at first. For whatever reason, I decided not to ask who I was texting, I just texted back “Thanks a lot!” and left it at that. He did not text me back. \n\nThe next day I was on my lunch break at work and I looked at my phone. I had FOUR missed calls from that number I was texting yesterday. He never left a message, never sent another text, just called me four times. I was a little creeped out so I never called back. This continued every day that week. Sometimes he’d call me twice, other days three times, but by the end of that week I had 20+ missed calls from him, but no voicemails and no more texts. I want to point out that I’m not allowed to have my phone out at my job, and ALL of these calls came between 8:30am and 12:30pm or 1:30pm and 5:30pm. I was on the clock every single time he called. \n\nThat next weekend I decided to figure out who it was. I had a different friend who I didn’t go to college with call this number from his phone. Dave answers on the first ring and, with no hesitation, provides his first and last name to a complete stranger. Then my friend hung up using the excuse that it was the wrong number. \n\nAt this point I was halfway considering answering the next call, because this WAS someone that my wife and my then-fiancé used to hang out with semi-frequently. He lived in our building and dated one of our other friends for a little while. It wasn’t COMPLETELY unreasonable that he’d want to catch up. But for some reason the aggression with which he called me after not talking or seeing him for 8-9 years just made me feel uneasy about it. I explained this situation to another friend from the same college who knew us both and his response was “What the fuck? Is Dave ok in the head?”\n\nAlthough I did at first intend to answer one of Dave’s many calls after I found out who it was, he continued to only call me during business hours and to do so multiple times per day, without ever texting or leaving a voicemail. I allowed this to go on for two weeks, and then finally I decided I had to block his number. I had no idea where the conversation would go after 60+ missed calls, but I decided I didn’t want to have it anymore. I finally blocked his number. \n\nSo my question to you is, am I the asshole here? I do feel bad about blocking the number and never responding to him after that one text, but the fact that he kept calling multiple times a day after I didn’t answer the first time just made me extremely uncomfortable to the point where I feel like I made the right choice. Is it the asshole choice though?\n ",

      "description": "So there’s always more to the story than the title implies. Here’s the gist: my friend and I are uni students who live on campus. I went to school far from home, so I’ll be flying back to campus. To get to campus from the airport, I’ll take an airport shuttle, which you book a ticket for by giving your flight information (origin, flight departure/landing times, etc). My friend is local to the city, it’s not hard for her family to drop her off at campus (that was her plan until she learned about how I was getting there). A few days ago, she texted me asking for my flight number and arrival time and the name of the shuttle service, specifically so that she can book a ticket on the bus and be on the same one as I am. The shuttle route is three hours, twice the time it would have taken for her to drive with her family. When I asked why she needed my flight information, she replied “I booked a shuttle ticket so I could get to campus with you.” I’m a very independent person, and love traveling alone. I’m angry at having company imposed on me, especially after fourteen hours of flying and driving and being up since 2am. Also, the shuttle service is for people who actually need a way home from the airport, hence the reason why you need flight information to book a ticket. I haven’t told my sort of friend how I feel about this because I also feel bad about being irritated. Reddit, am I the asshole for feeling that this is exceptionally clingy, inconsiderate to me and people who actually depend on that shuttle and seriously considering distancing myself from this person over this conflict?",

      "description": " So I have a situation, and I'm unsure if I'm the asshole here.\n\nTl;dr: a friend of mine and her family live in my apartment-basement rent and utility-free, and are upset that I'm not paying for their vacation to Disney; expect me to pay for everything; am I the asshole for telling them it's time for them to go even though they have awful credit/no money saved?\n\nA friend of mine lives in my basement free of charge, which sounds bad, except that my basement is a full on apartment (in fact, it's the size of my old apartment before I bought my house). She and her husband have two kids, who also live here, and she helps me take care of my kids (I'm a single mom). They have never paid rent or utilities (in fact I pay for their Netflix), and I frequently buy things for them and their kids (I paid for her daughter to do gymnastics, her son to play soccer, I buy them Christmas presents, etc). They do buy food, and she does watch my son/pick up my daughter from school. Her husband works. They have no bills outside of a car note and insurance, and even though her husband makes about $2,200 after taxes each month, she frequently is worried they won't make the car payment, and her car registration expired in February 2018.\n\nI don't agree with her parenting style, as she frequently becomes too emotionally involved in kids' arguments, and takes kids behavior personally. She frequently claims that she would \"spend her last dime on the kids\" like it's a badge of honor, and is frequently worried that her kids don't have \"the best\" or \"enough\". She once pitched a fit because her husband purchased a Nike duffel bag for her son, which she didn't think was \"good enough\".   She says I just don't understand what it's like not to have any money, and that I'm emotionless.\n\nThat being said, just over 3 years ago I left an abusive spouse who left me literally penniless, and for a long time I was afraid he would kill us. I worked hard to get where I am now.\n\nWhile I really appreciate what she has done for me and my kids -- without her I wouldn't have been able to work some of my crazier work schedules -- I am fully aware that I can do this alone, and I am becoming increasingly frustrated that she expects me to essentially be her cash cow. I'm taking my kids to DisneyWorld next month, and she expects me to take her family as well. She is now upset that I told them I wouldn't be able to afford paying for their share of the vacation, and that I'm still taking my kids. She frequently spends money on fast food, alcohol, and random \"gifts\", and cried when I told her I didn't want a plant she gave me, I want her to save money for bills.\n\nShe is becoming increasingly erratic and emotional, and has been snapping at my kids on a regular basis, to the point that my oldest has had meltdowns three days in a row. I think it's time for them to move on, but since they have awful credit and no money saved, am I the asshole for telling them to get out?",

I'm not entirely sure where this came from and now I feel extremely guilty. I didn't even think anything of it until now. I thought I was being nice and now I feel like shit.

      "description": "TLDR: I’m letting the behavior of a close friend who has unrequited feelings for me cause negativity in my life and potential future relationship. I want to burn the bridge. AITA?\n\nBackstory: “R” and I have been friends since 2015. We get along great and have similar personalities/moral compasses/interests and just generally vibe well. In 2017, he confessed that he had romantic feelings for me and asked if I’d be willing to take our friendship to that level. For lots of reasons, I said I’d rather just continue on as friends. He’s always been very supportive, trustworthy, fun to be around, and a solid person to have in my corner so I certainly didn’t want to end the friendship because of this.\n\nSince that time there have been several occurrences between him and I that left me feeling uncomfortable/disrespected/disregarded. For example, the time he refused to get out of my car until I told him “the real reason” for not wanting to be with him. He refused to accept that I don’t believe we are romantically compatible and accused  me of being shallow and not giving him a chance because I am out of his league. His words but tbh I don’t disagree. I’ve worked hard through my 20s on my emotional health, financial independence, self confidence, and overall just learning to be content with the person that I am. I feel as though he has a lot to become aware of/work on in order to become someone I could be truly happy with and proud to call my partner. Anyway, I felt very trapped in that moment and like he was being selfish and unfair. There have been a handful of other moments similar to that. Some of which happened when he was drunk and borderline aggressive. At times he made me feel unsafe.\n\nAdditionally, the few times I’ve brought a potential romantic interest around the friend group, he pouts. He’ll get belligerent drunk or stay outside and chain smoke cigarettes alone. Other friends have noticed this as well, so I know it’s not just me and my tendency to be hyper-aware of (and maybe sometimes even fabricate) the moods of the people I care about. As a result of this, I feel guilty. I don’t want to be the reason for his unhappiness. I also resent the absolute shit out of him.\n\nAround Thanksgiving, I started seeing a new guy. Right now he lives several hours away so when he comes into town I spend a lot of my free time with him. I also pay A LOT of attention to him if he comes out with the group because, well, I’m super into him! R can’t stand it and he’s not being subtle at all. He hasn’t said anything to me but he acts like a child whose just been scolded every time I bring this guy around. I’m sick of it. I realize I could just not care about R and be happy and smitten and enjoy getting to know this new fella more but I’m just so bothered by the whole situation. In March, new guy moves back to my town and I don’t want anything to cause turbulence between him and I as we’re trying to develop a potential relationship.\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA if I completely ended my friendship with R in order to move forward with my romantic life guilt-free?",

      "description": "Context: I own a 2 bedroom flat and rent out a room to another guy (found him online), he's been living here for a year now. Overall he's a chilled person and I have no real issues with him. \n\nRecently his girlfriend has been over a lot. There was a point last month where she was round 9 days in a row. I said something to him at this point and that he needs to cut it down to 2/3 days a week max (the same amount of time my gf comes round). Unfortunately she lives with her parents and I think is why she spends so much time here.\n\nThe conversation went well and he was really cool and understanding. However now I've noticed she's always round on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays - effectively the whole weekend. Technically this is okay as I said I don't mind her being round 3 days, but now I don't think I'm cool with her round the whole weekend.\n\nI don't have my girlfriend round all weekend because I'm someone who needs my own space sometimes to relax. Therefore each weekend now it's sometimes just me and them two in my small flat. I don't want to feel like a third wheel in my own flat. If them two want to watch TV in the living room, I feel awkward being there. Obviously I would be fine with it sometimes but it makes me feel like a stranger in my own place for the whole weekend. \n\nAm I an arsehole to bring this up again and say it's not okay? I don't want the solution to be her chipping in for bills because it's not about the money: I'm just not cool with living with just a couple for the whole weekend every week. If it was a 5 bedroom house I think it would be different, but in a small 2 bed it's a weird dynamic. ",

      "description": "My university friend and I have been living in a very nice apartment for the past 2 years, especially for 2 people who have recently graduated. This is because my grandparents own the apartment. However, I do not currently pay rent. \n\nThe average flat costs in my city around $180-250 usually not including expenses or wifi. We have a good location right in the centre of the city and our place is pretty new (less than 10 years old). She currently pays $300 per week including expenses.\n\nIn the past, my flatmate has gone back home for the summer break (Dec-Feb) and my grandparents have allowed her to pay $100 per week while she was away, so that she doesn’t have to pay as much but can still keep her room and all of her belongings there. She also went on vacation with her boyfriend last year for 4 weeks, asked if she could do the same deal and my grandparents approved. \n\nThis time her and her boyfriend are going to Europe/Asia for 8 weeks, she asked me if she could do this same deal again but my family declined. Their reasoning being that it is too long of a break and that she is no longer a student. \n\nI have talked to my grandparents and they won’t budge on this. My flatmate won’t budge on this either and says that it is unfair that she has to pay $2400 in total while away. I have mentioned that this is normally the case in flatting situations, they either pay rent while away or sublet their room but because of our arrangements in the past I understand where she is coming from. \n\nShe texted me tonight saying that she will move out next month because she can’t afford to pay the $2400. I am now on the hunt for a new flatmate. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n",

It was nice, but being her first photos and her being our forst child we would have liked to have participated, not to be in the photos, but have a say in what she wore.\nRecently, she decided our 1st and only daughter needed a bra.

Our children had been spending the night with them every Friday night up until this point.\nOur daughter came home with the bra on and said her grandmother had told her she needed to wear it.\nI feel the choice for the time for my daughter to wear a bra is up to my daughter and her mother, then i would be 3rd in line. \nHer mother taking this into her own hands was not cool with me. The kids didnt see their granparents for 6 months. They now see them a few timea a month but dont spend the night. I dont want my MIL treating my children the way she did my wife, and I dont want her stepping on our toes as parents.\nSo... Am I the asshole?",

I know this isn't a therapy sub but after being led on for such a long time sharing all these feelings and then having this weight dropped on me makes me want to stop talking to her.

We've had convos multiple times before but we always wind up back together because we click mostly. \nBut I am not sexually attracted to her, and I keep trying to look past it but I cannot. I need to move on. But every time I try she asks me what the problem is, why cant we work past/thru it, etc. She really wants to get to the bottom of it. I tried the \"we aren't compatible\" or \"I'm not interested\" super vague and that doesn't work and also because we are compatible on a mental way, but not physical.\nI dont want to be harsh or a dick, and I believe in honesty vs sparing people's feelings because how can someone grow if they don't know the truth? I believe that to a degree.\n\n(here's where ITA) The truth is she has no butt and it does nothing for me and I need a big booty. Just the way it is. I know what I like. \nI feel like I can go less vague route and say \"Im not sexually attracted to you\" but I know she will ask what exactly. In which I will want to say \"I need a big butt\" or something. Heck, maybe she will hit the squats hard and get one, which goes back to \"growing\" but I'm not forcing anyone to do that it's on you. \n\nSo Im just asking, if she digs and asks for the truth, do I give it to her?

      "description": "My mother came to visit for Christmas and we generally have a good relationship, I'm only 19 so we're still pretty close as I haven't been living alone for many years. My mother is bipolar. She takes pills for adhd and depression. When she's on the pills she's one of the best people I know, when she's not I can hardly be in the same room as her. she acts manic and her mood swings rapidly, always flustered and ranting about something or making super awkward and unfunny jokes. I could handle it when it was just us but now I live in a house with a family of three and another dude (Blame the ridiculously high rent in SoCal). \n\nI could tell she was off her meds immediately, she's only been around for two days and I already want to hide from her. She's just so high maintenance, I can even stop talking to her to watch a movie without her getting offended and making jokes about how I don't care about her. She lost her license and for not paying a ticket and hasn't gotten it back, her car broke down the other day (because not having a license has not stopped her from driving) and she told me she almost just bought a new one before AAA fixed it. I pulled her aside and told her that she's acting like a different person, that I love her but like, whats up? \n\nWhat I gathered from the subsequent fallout is that she can't get her pills filled where she lives (an island where I grew up) because it's a controlled substance. She tried at a grand total of two different pharmacies. She made me feel like I was using her disabilities against her and called me a spiteful bitch, saying I was acting nasty to her. I told her I couldn't spend time with her when she's like this and asked her to give me space, even thought she flew all the way out here to see me. Am I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA for not tipping my hairdresser?",
      "description": "Okay so let me start this off by saying I have never gotten my hair done ever. I know tipping is expected and I already had a $20 in my purse for the tip (and I had extra money just in case). My appointment was set at 3:15 and I got there at 3. My hairdresser greeted me shorty and was super friendly. I told her that I wanted my hair a light brown and she told me I would have to bleach my nearly-black hair to get there. I figured I would and I was totally fine with that! Now I know bleaching is a tricky thing to do right and I know it takes a while to get the color right, but it was... a rather long process. About 5 hours in total for the whole visit. Which is cool, like I said I’ve never had my hair done so I figured maybe this is just how it is. Now the problem was after she bleached and toned it it was still very light at the roots and orange at the bottom. No biggie but she then tried two different dye type toners? Not the shampoo one but ones that looked just like hair dye. When she washed it out the top of my head looked greenish toned and the bottom was more bronze. However I wasn’t worried because I thought she was just going to put hair dye on top of it to get me to that beautiful golden brown hair anyways and I probably wouldn’t even notice the difference! Welp nope. She spun me around and asked how I liked it... keep in mind the color is more blonde than the golden brown hair picture I showed her. I just didn’t even know what to say. Now I have horrible social anxiety- so bad that I will NOT ever inconvenience someone, even if that means asking simple questions. One could say it’s my fault for not being more clear on what I wanted but I showed her what I wanted and put my hair in her hands. I just don’t know if it’s normal/right to bleach someone’s hair to get them to a golden brown and not put any dye in it... it just didn’t really make sense. So now onto the price... this salon had a menu on their website and the prices varied depending on the stylists’ “level” (ex. Level one would be way cheaper than level 6). And because I made sure I read everything on their website I already knew the stylist I got was a level 1. Which was some what okay with me, I figured I was in good hands there. Well before we started anything she gave me a rough estimate on the total price, which she said would be about $160. Now i was going to get my hair trimmed too but because of time I told her to not worry about it respectively but that was before she gave me the rough estimate. So when I got up to the front desk to pay the lady said my total was going to be $190. Okay so just going off of the pricing from their website I really didn’t understand why it was this much. But then she looked at it again and then said it would be $166. Whatever I was on the verge of tears and just wanted to leave because this salon trip was a gift from my boyfriend, it’s not even my money and I did not leave with anything even close to what I showed my hairdresser. I am frustrated with myself too because I don’t know if it was my fault for not speaking up. Before I even realized I didn’t leave her a tip I paid and left. But I remembered when I got into my car. I could have easily ran back in there and gave her the damn $20 but I hated my green/bronze/blonde hair. Am I the asshole? Why would she let me leave like that?",

      "description": "My grandfather still lives at home and is self-sufficient, although he is getting on in years.\n\nI'm currently pregnant, and I have terrible morning sickness. I'm constantly sick and exhausted. I'm avoiding everyone who I don't want to disclose my pregnancy to because I don't think I can hide it without making up an excuse about having an actual illness. He is definitely someone who I do not want to disclose to yet.\n\nWhen I was pregnant with my son he was visibly uncomfortable whenever the topic came up and told me that, back in his day, a woman just hid for nine months and then emerged with a baby. \n\nAfter my son was born he started asking me when I was going to have another child, and by the time my son was six months old, was telling me stories about siblings who hated each other because their mothers waited too long in between births. What he didn't know was that I *was* trying to have another child, and I *did* want my children to be close in age, but I was struggling to conceive. It hurt a lot to hear him trying to argue me into doing the thing that I was desperately trying to do. I didn't want to disclose my fertility problems because I knew he would want to pray over me and then continue asking for updates anyway, so I kept repeating that I would have another child when I was blessed with one. This didn't dissuade him at all.  \n\nVisiting him with my son is not fun because he doesn't really interact with him. When I visit other family members they hold or play with my son and I get to sit down and take a break. When I visit him he sits and watches while I try to keep my son entertained in his non-childproofed house. It's exhausting to visit him, and I'm constantly asked about my plans to expand my family the whole time. He knows that I want more children, and yet he brings it up every time. \n\nI suggested he meet my son and I at McDonald's instead of at his house, but then he opted to order dinner and eat it on the other end of the restaurant while I supervised by son alone in the play area. He didn't interact with my son at all!! \n\nHe is not aware of this, but last year I did manage to conceive and the pregnancy ended in a traumatic miscarriage. Again, I didn't tell him because I didn't want to be prayed over and showered with religious platitudes. He is not aware that his attempts to argue me into having more children, while I was still bleeding from painfully losing the one I had just conceived, is the reason I am currently avoiding him. I just could not continue to hear it. Now that I am pregnant again, I don't like that my options are to either tell him and risk having to inform him that I've miscarried, or hide it and again be lectured about how I should be procreating. \n\nI've told him that I'll see him on Easter, because on Easter I'll be far enough along that I'm willing to disclose. He's not happy. He wants to see his great-grandchild and he doesn't think I've given enough reason why I'm not facilitating that.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "                                  \nSOME BACKSTORY:  Some things you should know about me, I’m a 17 yr old high school student. I just got my sisters car at the beginning of the school year. I have a somewhat overprotective mom, and a good dad who is a bit bipolar. Anyways, my parents went away on a trip for two weeks, and left us with our aunt from another state. In this time, because my aunt is a little nervous about driving in places she’s unfamiliar with, I took my siblings to school, and took them out on the weekends. During this time I started working out, and going on runs Later at night. I was working out all of 2018, but then winter break came and I got lazy. When New Years came around I started getting stricter, and pushing myself. \n             While they were still on their trip they texted me how’s everything going, and I said I was tired. They asked why, and I said because I wasn’t getting a lot of sleep because I had to take my siblings to school, which was an hour and a half before mine which meant I had to wake up earlier than I was used to. I joked to them that I should get paid for all this work. Then they replied u get paid with getting to keep that car( got it from my sister after she went to college in a another country). I’m very thankful for the car, and did not want to lose it so I just told them what they wanted to hear even though it was a joke. \n           A week later they’re home and I tell my mom I’m going for a run. She says no it’s to late, obviously I’m a teen so I’m like but I did it while you were gone a bunch of times. She doesn’t care 9:30 is to late to be running outside. She says to get a gym membership, which she knows I can’t afford, or to do it when I get home. The thing about doing it when I get home is that I have to do homework, also I run after I do my workouts, also it’s really an inconvenience to do it earlier because I like taking showers at night so I can brush my teeth in the shower, and put my face creams on after. \n           I start talking back, “it’s not fair, I’m 17 years old I’m basically an adult, I’ve done it before nothings going to happen to me”. She doesn’t care, so she’s like ask your father. Idk if this is what all parents do, but my mom does this all the time when she wants help.  She looks back at my dad giving him that, if you don’t agree with me in front of our children we’re gonna have a fight later. So me being really fed up because they’ve been doing this to me my whole life, and are stopping me from doing something that’s good for me, I say “he obviously can’t say no, you’re just gonna have a fight with him later if he does”. This really set my dad off, he’s got a short temper If I’m being honest. He said I wasn’t allowed to drive my car anymore. I was like “wow, thanks” sarcastically, which he then proceeded to say that Im a jerk. At this point I was pretty heated, and every kid knows how to push their parents buttons, so I was like “wow thank you so much, I love you to”. thats when he snapped, and his short temper got the best of him. He said I would never get to drive the car again. He said I was I was a shit, and I’ll never touch the keys again. Well, guess I gotta take the bus now🤷‍♀️",

We have a lot of similar interests, we talk a lot, etc etc, normal sibling things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, we were alone in the kitchen together, when out of the blue, she asks me if I masturbate.

      "description": "TW: Miscarraige.\n\n\nI recently went through a terrible miscarriage, far into my pregnancy.  When I found out I lost the baby, I had to tell friends since they knew I was pregnant.  I texted what had happened and said “I don’t want to talk about it” since I didn’t want everyone calling me and making me say awful things out loud.  Everyone gave me that night, sent me supportive texts or help throughout the awful upcoming days.  Some brought soup.  They let me open up about it at my own pace which was really helpful.\n\nOne of my closest friends-we were maids of honor for each other-took this literally and didn’t actually reach out to me until a month later.  Literally silence for a month despite knowing my husband’s number, my sister’s numbers-she could have checked on me through a variety of ways even if she wanted to leave me alone.  I eventually told her that I could have used my friend, and she said she thought I meant what I said so she left me alone.  Since then she sends things like “everything happens for a reason”, and I stopped responding because it was so frustrating.\n\nI know that some of this is because I’m angry at what I went through and she’s a good target to put it on, but I don’t think all of this.  I mostly feel like, for once, I’m the one who has a shitty thing happen so it’s not my job how to teach her to be a good friend.  For reference, she has multiple crisis since we’ve known each other (deaths, divorce, etc) and I’ve worked hard to be there for her.  I’ve dropped trips, stayed up late when I had early mornings, everything I can to support her. I’ve never had a problem like this before with her so maybe this is just her MO and I didn’t know.  \n\nShould I forgive her and figure this out, or is she just a “taker” friend and I didn’t know this whole time?\n",

      "description": "I’ll keep this short. I’m an extremely underweight female of about average height, I’ve struggled with gaining weight my whole life and have tried almost everything to do so and absolutely nothing has worked for me. At 25 I am finally coming to terms with my weight and am not so aggressively disgusted with my appearance than I used to be, although I am still insecure enough that I never leave the house with my arms exposed and always wear oversized clothing around strangers, for reasons I will explain.\n\nEver since I’ve been a teenager I’ve received blatant stares from strangers and rude, loud comments as if they want me to hear them talking to their friend about how gross I am. Of course everyone assumes I want to look this way, which couldn’t be further from the truth. I can’t count the number of times strangers have approached me and asked me why I’m so skinny. When I was younger I would give the “oh my metabolism is just high, hahaha” but over the years I’ve grown more and more irritated with the unsolicited comments and questions about my body, usually from people who I don’t know well or from total strangers.\n\nI’ve become so annoyed that in response to the “why are you so skinny” question I’ve started responding “why are you so fat?” or “do you exercise?” when asked if I eat. This obviously doesn’t go over well but it makes me feel good to give them a taste of their own medicine and perhaps realize that it’s not okay to comment on someone’s weight if you don’t want them to comment on yours in return. \n\nAs I type this I think I am sounding more and more like a bitter pill. Am I justified in my snarky comments or am I just an asshole?\n\n(Before anyone comments about ignoring the snipes- tried it, makes me feel worse)\n\nEdit: for those commenting that people may mean it as a compliment or don’t know that it’s rude- I can distinguish between people who are ignorant but well-meaning and those that seem outright judgmental or nasty. \n\nEdit 2: Thank you for all of your responses. I would just like to add that while I appreciate the thought, I’m not looking for weight gain tips. I have honestly tried almost everything and been to countless doctors. Calorie overload was the only thing that was slowly working but it made me feel physically sick all the time and I couldn’t keep doing it.",

      "description": "My parents had a horribly toxic relationship when I was a kid. Most of my childhood memories involve my parents getting into screaming matches every single night—to the point where I developed a routine on what to do when they fought. I have vivid memories of being 4/5/6 years old waking up to my parents screaming at and shoving each other, and just thinking, “Time to call grandma!” \n\nThat was how I coped with it. I called my grandmother (my mother’s mom) because she calmed me down and then my mother would take the phone when I got caught and the fighting would stop because now they were distracted. \n\nI have memories of my mother trying to stab my father in the neck/face/arms with pens, pencils, forks, etc. while I was in the room screaming and crying. I have memories of screaming for my father and begging him not to go when he’d finally walk out to get away from the mania. I remember begging him to take me with him and not leave me. (I was a daddy’s girl big time)\n\nHe always came back after a few hours, if he even actually left. \n\nI have memories of my mom secretly asking me who I would pick to live with if they got divorced. I was under ten years old, and my mother was trying to turn me against my dad with these little “questions.”\n\nI found out when I got older that this was all because my mom cheated on my dad multiple times. She met multiple men at different times and would make plans to run away with them and take me, and leave my father. \n\nThings are better between them now, but I know that my father still resents her—he stayed for me, because if they split he knew it would be a battle to ever see me again. \n\nRecently, (I’m 21 now) my friend and I were discussing our childhoods. Her parents got divorced when she was a kid, but mine never did. After I explained how toxic/tumultuous my parents’ relationship was when I was younger I made the comment that my parents should have divorced. They never should have stayed together. \n\nShe got really mad and told me I was horrible for saying that, and I should consider myself lucky to have parents that stayed together. I’m lucky I didn’t have to go through what she did (her parents split rather amicably, but of course that is difficult for any kid to understand). \n\nI just kind of dropped it. But personally, I feel like I would have rather my parents split than gone through all of the traumatic experiences I had to go through. I witnessed abuse between my parents. I was manipulated by my mother. I was terrified for all of my childhood that I can even remember—it affects me to this day. I still can’t handle it when people raise their voices around me. \n\nAITA for believing and saying that my parents should have divorced? Am I wrong for thinking that way? ",

She is the nicest and kindest person imaginable and helped me through a lot of stuff, which I tried to repay by being as nice and kind as possible back. After some time though she started distrusting me and that's where shit went bad. The talks we had on calls (when we were not meeting) started being uncomfortable and mostly ended up in fights, which made me feel less and less comfortable talking to her. I loved her fully and couldn't think of breaking up, since she was going through some really tough time and I wanted to be there for her completely. I tried to do my best to support her, but I started feeling less happy day by day until one day when I went out to a club with a friend of mine I kissed a random girl. I feel absolutely shitty about it and consider it the worst thing I've done. I didn't tell her until the worst part of her difficult situation was over and I told her about it and broke up with her, telling her that I am not happy with our relationship anymore. I feel really bad, since she is seriously the nicest person I met so far and she is in a difficult situation where she has almost no people around her to talk or to support her and I sorta felt obligated and also wanted to be there for her.",

      "description": "My best friend, (let’s call him Jerry,) and I have been friends since the beginning of High School we’re in our mid twenties now. Jerry really doesn’t have a good record for dating good people for him. I don’t like to sugar coat things to him. If I feel like something is off towards someone he likes, I let him know, that this person doesn’t sit right with me.\n\nThis time seems to be different. \n\nThe first time I met Jerry’s friend (let’s call him Chad,) at their apartment. I had been living out of state for a while and wanted to visit him seeing his place for the first time. I had never met Chad before but have heard some not good things about him. \n\nSome background on Chad and Jerry: Chad is in his 30’s and rented an extra room to Jerry. While Jerry was single, Chad and Jerry had a one night fling and Chad thought things were going to be different. Jerry then got a boyfriend and Chad was so upset at the news he punched a whole in the wall. Jerry for other reasons moved back into his parents. \n\n\nBack to Jerry and I are in the apartment (before he moved,) I meet Chad for the first time. He sees me with Jerry and the first thing he says to me was, “Who the fuck are you?!” I was very taken back by his tone and really freaked me out. I left immediately after that. \n\nJerry and his boyfriend broke up about a month ago and Chad and them started becoming flirty. Jerry asked me on the phone how I would feel about him and Chad being a couple together and I told him how I wasn’t comfortable at all with it. I told him I wouldn’t be around the guy because he seems to be violent and manipulative of Jerry. I told him I would still be his friend but I don’t want to be around Chad. \n\nJerry gave my phone number to Chad and he called me up asking why they couldn’t be together because of me. I told him how I get about him and how it isn’t a good idea. He told me he isn’t a bad guy and I’m just being an overprotective bitch. \n\nThis happened a few days ago and now Jerry isn’t messaging me anymore but is still active on FB.  AITA? \n\nTL;DR: My best friend wants to date a potentially violent guy and I told him how I feel it’s a bad idea. Now he isn’t talking to me.  \n",

      "description": "I work in retail, after a long day of dealing with people I just don't feel up to talking to anyone. I need solitude so I can get my energy back. \n\nI had a friend who was older than me, we've known each other for a long time because we went to the same high school, but I recently deleted him from fb.\n\nWe were getting along fine until he started acting all weirdly clingy one second but distant and mad the next. He would ask me to hang out alone with him, something I was uncomfortable with because I didn't want him to get the wrong idea, but I would decline since I work a lot and just want to be left alone a lot.\n\nI explained to him a few times that thats just how I was. It wasn't him, it was me being tired after work and not wanting to deal with people. I tried to reassure him that once I got my energy back I would want to chat more, and thats usually how it went. I relaxed for a few hours/a night and when I felt up to chatting the next day I would reply to his texts or send one saying hey.\n\nAfter a few posts he made on fb about how he was tired of being ignored because hes so nice and he tries so hard/doesn't deserve to be ignored/is sooo sad and depressed...I just kind of got sick of it and deleted him from fb. \n\nHe would ignore my messeges but act like I was the only one not responding, or send me nothing but rant messeges that I couldn't really reply to because they didn't make sense to me or were over tiny things that didn't seem like a huge deal to me. I would try to change the subject to talk but he would just go right back to ranting a minute later, which made me roll my eyes and put my phone away. \n\nHe didn't seem to want to accept my explanation even though thats exactly what it was. I can handle people being clingy, I can get that way some times when I've had enough solitude and want to interact with people (though I try not to be annoying about it). What I can't handle is people getting all dramatic for sympathy instead of talking directly to me about it and doing nothing but complain all day every day about problems that aren't really problems/issues he caused himself.\n\nBut I can't decide whether it was an asshole thing to do or not. Am I an asshole for apparently ghosting and deleting this guy since he wouldn't accept my explanation and I didn't want to deal with his sympathy seeking attitude anymore?",

      "description": "Quick background: Husband, toddler and I recently moved to a very WASPY suburb. We live in a neighborhood that is essentially an enlarged cul-de-sac. So when the weather is decent, we will come into contact with our neighbors a lot.\n\nNow, to the not-so-quick WIBTA issue at hand.\n\nA neighbor (who I have yet to meet in person) sends out an email in early January on behalf of her Girl Scout daughter, letting neighborhood email distribution (yeah, I know) know that daughter is selling cookies and if we want to order them, reply to email and ChasePay her money. I reply with some pleasantries (\"new to hood, hope to meet you soon!\") plus my order of many boxes of Thin Mints and others. Sidenote: I LOVE GIRL SCOUT COOKIES. I look forward to them every year. I need them to get me through the misery of February in the Midwest.\n\nNeighbor never acknowledges payment or order. I email her days later to confirm. She responds days later, apologizing. A month + goes by. I start seeing those delightful colorful boxes around my office. This past Thursday, she sends a neighborhood-wide email that daughter will be at X grocery with cookies for sale, in case anyone missed the original order opp. I respond asking when the pre-ordered cookies will be available. No response. Two days later, Saturday, she responds that they already picked them up. Period. End of email. Nothing about delivery or pick-up, or how the fuck I can obtain my cookies.\n\nI respond right away asking if they'll be delivering them or what. She responds days later (Monday AM) that she's super busy at work and can maybe drop them off this coming Sunday (over a week after they've received the cookie shipment), or she'll put on her front stoop and I can pick them up any time. Great, I respond, I will pick them up right away. No response. I go to her house that evening and there are no cookies on the stoop. WTF. I don't want to be totally psycho and ring her doorbell, so I leave and send a follow up email. This was Monday PM. SHE STILL HASN'T RESPONDED. I sent another one this AM...nothing.\n\nNow I'm sure many of you are thinking I'm overreacting about these cookies. Maybe neighbor lady has something serious going on. Etc. Fair points. But the communication around what is supposed to be a fun and light-hearted thing (Girl Scout cookies) -- which, by the way, her daughter (the Girl Scout) has had nothing to do with, even though I'm pretty sure the cookie selling is supposed to empower the child's entrepreneurial skills or some shit -- has been infuriating to me. AND I NEED THOSE THIN MINTS. And I paid for them already. WIBTA if I showed up at her house demanding my cookies??\n\nTL;DR: I'm obsessed with Girl Scout cookies. Ordered and paid for many boxes through new neighbor child's mother. Bizarro lady is stonewalling me and ignoring my polite and friendly requests to pick up what is rightfully mine. WIBTA if I show up at her door unannounced?",

      "description": "Sorry if the title is a little weird, I couldn't think of a better way to word it. Also apologies for formatting, I'm on mobile. Tl;dr at the end.\n  So I have a human anatomy course currently and the teacher is just amazing. I love her to death, she's quirky and funny and she does a really good job teaching what she teaches. Now I've always been pretty good at classses like this, I take really good notes while she teaches and I easily catch on to what we're learning. I haven't made below an 80 on anything in her class so far. Recently we had an open note test in her class and she was going around the room helping people. I was doing pretty well on my own with my notes and all, She walked by and was looking at how I was doing. Honestly I find this a little distracting, and I get really nervous and freeze a little when teachers hover over me while I'm working. She ended up picking up my notes and flipping through them to find something totally different than what I was working on, I just kinda said ok and kept working. She jokingly said \"I have the feeling you don't like me very much.\" Of course I immediately denied it because like I said, I love her and her class, and enthusiastically said \"I got this\". \n  Some background on me; I honestly have no idea what is wrong with me. I come off as a pretty tough person, I'm stubborn and set in my ways, but I'm very sensitive. It really isn't hard to hurt my feelings or make me cry. Around this time I had been feeling very down, very doubtful of myself, very guilty. I felt like I couldn't do anything right. After she responded the way she did I ended up tearing up, and the more I thought about it the worse I ended up feeling until I was upset and crying. I asked her if I could go to the restroom (I had wiped my face as best as I could and tried to keep my composure) she saw right through it and took me into the hall to talk about it. She ended up telling me that I reacted very rudely to her trying to help me, this made me feel even worse because I honestly didn't mean to be rude I just didn't need help and I didn't mean to say it rudely or anything. I ended up in the bathroom crying so hard I couldn't breathe. I'm so heartbroken because I really liked her but I don't think she likes me.

      "description": "Original post over [here](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/araeds/aita_for_wanting_to_divorce_my_transgender_wife_i/)\n\nFirstly, I want to thank all of you who gave your opinions and advice. After reading some of the comments, I realised that I have left this situation for way too long. So I had a sit down with my girlfriend and my wife and we had a long, long talk.\n\nFirstly, to all those asking if my wife is pretending to be transgender in hopes that she’ll become “my type”: the answer is a big no. In fact, she doesn’t have romantic feelings for me at all, which I’m so glad of. It turns out that the reason she hasn’t pursued anyone in the ten years that we’ve been married is because she doesn’t really feel romantic or sexual attraction at all, towards anyone. As a member of the LGBT community myself, I have heard of this. Again, I was surprised that she had never said anything to me, but she told me that she’s always felt quite ashamed of this, because it’s not normal. That’s why she agreed to marry me in the first place: she didn’t want to marry anyone for real, and marrying me was her ticket to a single life without being judged.\n\nSecondly, I’m going to come clean to my parents. It took a lot of convincing and a lot of tears from both my girlfriend and my wife, but I told them that they’ve done so much for me and it was time for me to start thinking about them, and not myself. I don’t feel comfortable doing it in person, so I will be telling them over the phone. To protect my wife, I will tell them all why she didn’t know I was gay, and now that she’s found out we will be divorcing. I will not tell them that she is transitioning. Before I tell them, my wife and girlfriend will be moving in with my sister’s family for a while, until it’s all blown over. As much as I hope my parents will just cut me off, knowing them there will probably some harassment and it may not be safe for them to be living with me.\n\nDepending on how my parents react, I may have to move house, so that they can’t track me down. I don’t believe that they would physically harm me, but I’m not certain of that, and besides, there are other ways they can hurt me. \n\nOnce everything has blown over, my girlfriend and I will move back together. My wife will stay with us too, through her transition. And she’s welcome to stay with us as long as she wants to after that. We’ll get a divorce, so she’ll finally be back to just my best friend. \n\nMy wife is a wonderful person. My girlfriend is too, and so is my sister. I am less wonderful. But I’m thankful that I’ve been given a chance to put things right.\n\nAlso: fuck the will.",

She used to be kind of bigger, which I didn't mind, and now she's in the normal bmi category but she is still saying she's trying to loose weight.\n\nIt's causing a lot of stress in my family because my parents are worried about her. Even before she started loosing weight they would make comments to me about how her eating habits weren't normal, like, for one whole week she ate only yogurt and Takis, nothing else.\n\nIt really affects our relationship because we can't go out to eat like we used to. Plus, (not saying this to body shame extremely skinny women or anything) I'm just a big dude (6'2 and 300lb)- a relationship with an emancipated chick just wouldn't work. She showed me pictures of her \"weight loss goals\" and these women are like size 000 not healthy at all.\n\nI love my girlfriend and she has always been here for me when I had problems or was going through a tough time, and I wanna be here for her but she refuses to believe this is a problem and says I'm trying to sabotage her weight loss.

      "description": "My SO and I are both 20, and I live in a house with 3 other people who are 19-21. My housemates and I are part of the same social club in college and my SO hangs out there a lot because they like my housemates company. The house that we live in was passed down through the club, so the living room, dining room, kitchen, and some bedrooms are completely furnished and we paid the previous residents for it. That means that the house had a TV that was 42\" (which they bought off of the past housemates), but it was pretty old since it had a low quality screen with burn in problems. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast summer, my SO accidentally broke the TV by shattering the LCD. Naturally, he replaced it. He bought a used 55\" Roku smart TV from his job. It was a major upgrade. With employee discount, it was between $350-$400. The retail price for it is $450-500. The TV was a whole paycheck for him and I paid the parts that he couldn't cover and it took a toll on us since we're both college students with not a lot of money. He said that if I plan on leaving, he is willing to sell it to the house for $200-300, I can't recall exactly how much at the moment. One housemate and her SO (that doesn't live here) had problems with this and wants us to leave it here. I see their point, because we did break the TV, but we dropped a lot of money on this and we really could have gotten some old CRT that was equivalent to the price of the old TV at the time we broke it. Another housemate said that she would be okay with paying, because she knows how tight it was for us to get the TV and she uses the TV a lot. I'm pretty sure that the last one is indifferent.   \n\n\nBecause of misc reasons not really relevant to this, I am moving out of this house. The topic of the TV is going to be brought up again, and I really don't know if I would be the asshole for committing to the idea of them paying for the TV. My SO stands strongly by his word. Would we be in the wrong if we pursued this?",

I hope you don’t mind, I just wouldn’t have enough time there if I left the next day. Plus we’re already staying on Y Island for a week leading up to the wedding.\nMe: the point of going to Y Island was the wedding, if you don’t plan on coming I’m going to give the room to somebody else.\nFriend: what? Why? Don’t you want to have me there? We’ll be on an island together for a week, does it really matter if I stay for the wedding? We’ll be seeing a lot of each other anyway\nMe: the wedding is the reason we’re going there in the first place \nFriend: yes, but once we’ve been there the whole week does it REALLY matter if I am also at the wedding? Shouldn’t it be about spending time with your friends and family? \nI was so frustrated, I told her she can forget about the room and thought it would be over.\nI was wrong.\nApparently one of our friends who’ll be sharing the Airbnb with me thinks I’m the asshole in this situation. \nShe thinks that the time spent together is the only thing that counts, whether it’s at the wedding or not, and that I shouldn’t exclude our friend just because she won’t be staying for the full vacation.\nAm I being crazy here? Am I taking my wedding too seriously? I just can’t believe my friend would ditch my wedding to take a second trip, especially after I’ve helped pay for the first one. Both my friends say it’s not a big deal because I can afford it, and I shouldn’t blame my friend for wanting to travel since she never really had the money to do that. \nAll I know is I paid for her because I wanted her at my wedding, why should I pay  now she’s not coming?\nSure, she’s always struggled financially and we’re doing well, but that doesn’t mean she’s entitled to my money. \nI honestly thought I was right until my other friend took her side.\nWhat does the internet think?",

      "description": "This scenario dates back from the previous summer but it's still been in the back of my mind because it seems like this was the turning point in our relationship where things got worse and eventually led to us breaking up.\n\nMy GF is a big baseball fan and during the baseball season we'd usually go to a baseball game about every two weeks or more. \n\nEarly on in the season she accidentally bought a pair of  tickets months in advance. Naturally we both forgot about the tickets up until closer to the date. At the time one of my buddies messages me and tells me that he's going to have all the boys up at his cottage. So, I messaged the GF telling her that I want to go. She says she's cool with it.\n\nAs the days proceed closer to that weekend, she asks me what our plan is for the weekend. I tell her that I'm going up to my buddies cottage. All hell breaks loose. She's telling me things like:\n\"I thought you weren't serious about going when we have tickets\"\n\n\"Yeah I said it was cool but you should have known that wasn't what I really meant\"\n\n\"You're ditching me the whole weekend and I'm just going to sit here by myself\"\n\n\"I don't know why I can't be included in the things you do too\"\n\nThere were some other profanities thrown in there and being told several times what a horrible bf I was being. \n\nRegardless I stick to my guns on this one. I would have understood if this was the one game that we went to all summer. But we were going to games bi-weekly. \n\nShe tells me it's cool but then turns around and gets mad because I couldn't decode what she meant.\n\nI suggested that she go with another one of my buddies GFS, since my buddies would be up north with me. She rejected the idea. I also suggested she take one of her her friends. I get the same reply. \n\nI get that she wants to be included in what I do. But I took her to 3 different cottages over the summer with all my friends. Her and I went away on our own mini vacation for a week together. We were literally together all the time. So, I don't think it's outrageous to have a weekend to go to the cottage with the boys.\n\nIn the end, from what I know, she just sat alone in her condo all weekend and the tickets went to waste.  \n\nI paid her for the tickets because I didn't think it was fair that she would get stuck with paying for them.\n\nEver since this incident she became cold towards me. She used this against me in fights afterwards and really made me think I did something wrong here. If I did could you please tell me?",

      "description": "I'm a recent grad and had been on the job hunt for the past 6 months. So, I picked up some part-time gigs, one of which was with a small, independent tutor center. \n\nSince I got hired there, I have functioned as a multi-subject tutor, teaching whatever they asked me to, with a specialty in math and science for all grade levels K-12. \n\nWhen I was hired, I was told I would be the only science tutor they had for now as old science tutors had recently transitioned out. I assumed they would be looking for more science tutors along the way, so I thought nothing of it. To this day, they have not hired another science tutor. \n\nI was offered a full-time job in early December and put in my 2-week notice at the tutor center. My last day was scheduled to be December 29 with a down week before I started the new job on January 7. They asked if I'd reconsider a full departure and still work for them even just one night a week since they had no other science tutors and finals are coming up. I told them that after a month working the new job, I'd see how I adjusted to my new schedule and get back to them then. So, until further notice, I should be considered out of commission.\n\nToday, I get a call asking to make sure that I'm coming in to teach tomorrow (January 5). I reiterated that my last day was December 29, but my director pushed back and said finals are coming up and they weren't able to find a replacement during the break (tutor center was closed the week leading up to December 29). Not wanting to escalate the situation, I said I'd come in to teach, restating that it would be the last lesson until further notice. This is not the first time my stated availability has been disregarded \n\nI have felt conflicted about leaving. Their secretary also left around the same time as me, leaving their lesson scheduling in disarray. All the students I taught would certainly benefit from tutoring leading up to finals. They are not close to finding a replacement for me. Although there have been many challenging moments, I have actually enjoyed teaching there. But, I would rather just focus on my new job and doing that well early on, despite the obvious need and desire of the owners for me to stay. I have offered to help interview or even refer any potential candidates, but my negative experiences make me feel totally fine with parting ways for good.\n\nTL;DR New grad. Finally got offered my first full-time job which meant quitting all my part-time gigs I had found post-graduation. Left my part-time gig as a tutor, but I was their only science tutor and not the only employee to leave recently. Reconsidering my offer to potentially stay with them after I become accustomed to the new job.",

      "description": "My sister was offered a job and told me about it. A friend asked how my sister was doing when we were at a party with some of his co-workers and I told them about the job offer. My friend and my sister both work in marketing and we live in a fairly small town, so they have a lot of common acquaintances. \n\nMy friend's boss knows who my sister is and she was with us when I mentioned the job offer. I knew she was there, but I still mentioned it purely for the sake of conversation without considering her being there.\n\nMy sister somehow found out and asked me if I had told my friend's boss about the offer. Apparently my sister has an interview at my friend's company and wanted to use her job offer to potentially get a better offer there. And now the boss is prepared for this. \n\nShe hasn't said she's mad, but it's been a few days and it's pretty obvious that she's not happy about it. I feel like an idiot asshole for saying it, but at the same time I feel like she could have told me explicitly not to say anything instead of relying on me assuming secrecy. She knows I hang out with that crowd, and I think she shouldn't have have assumed anything and rather told me clearly. She also clearly told me at one point that she was not interested in working at my friend's company. That doesn't really matter, I didn't think about that in the moment anyway.\n\nAITA? This has happened a few times with me, and only once did I feel like I said something I obviously shouldn't have. It seems like I don't have this \"sense\" of what to say and what not to say except for more obviously serious or personal stuff. I hate keeping secrets and I really think that if someone wants to keep something secret they should tell me explicitly.",

Her and I are extremely close with each other, where we would have some boundary issues and really only have one another to chat and hang out with. She really doesn’t have any friends, and mentions that I’m her closest friend she’s ever had. I’ve had friends in the past, but they come and go, as is life. We’ve also bonded over our mental struggles and upbringings, video games, music, food, she was my best friend, and I started to feel more. \n\nWith her, I’ve developed strong feelings for her the first 3 months of hanging out whenever we met. It was unrequited love. She didn’t feel the same way. I was heartbroken, yadayada, but a part of me feels like if we were to live with each other, that boundary I try not to cross would be extremely crossed. \n\nA part of me still feels that way, still daydreams that way, wishes it could be that way. I hate it, it’s disgusting and selfish and so egotistical of me. We’ve had arguments and countless fights in the past about the topic, and other things, where we’ve stopped being friends for 2 months or so. \n\nI found out my current roommates aren’t resigning our lease, and I move out end of April. I texted her saying that “none of my roommates are resigning lol”(she knows there’s been drama, BS, etc), and she immediately jumped to her moving out with me and my brother. And expected an answer right then and there through text. I told her we should talk about it in person. We did, I told her about the countless fights, the boundaries, my feelings that are still there somewhere or might resurface. So I said I’d have to think about it. She ALREADY resigned her lease, and called to cancel it. \n\nShe cancelled her lease. \n\nIt took me over 2 weeks to think about it my decision, and I leaned more towards no and found it hard to say yes. So I told her no over the phone, and she blew up, saying I’m selfish, all I care about is myself, I’m playing the victim “so hard”. If I lived with this girl, it would be unhealthy, as much as I love and value our friendships, I can’t do that to myself. Reddit, Am I the asshole???",

      "description": "So about a year ago I was going abroad for a period of time. On the day I was leaving my mom gave me a credit card in my name to use as an emergency. This bothers me because it means she had to use my identity to open the card in my name. This means she gave them my Social number and name, etc. She did not inform me that she would be using my identity as such and frankly if anyone else had done that I would be calling the police. At the time  I was so focused on actually moving far away for the first time that I had to push it off. I never liked the fact that she went behind my back and opened a credit card in my name without telling me. Although I do admit that I ended up using the card once or twice, it's mainly the fact that she did not tell me that she was opening a credit card in my name. Something that directly impacts my credit.\n\nSo today, a year later I  finally canceled the card and she got very upset when I told her that it had never been ok to open a credit card in my name. That I had never been okay with her impersonating me, even though I had kept it and had to resort to using it once or twice. \n\nI had no trouble deactivating the card with my information and I do not plan to take any further action against my mother. But she is now refusing to talk to me and gave me the cut up card with a note that says she doesn't see how it's any different than helping me with the loans for school. My reasoning is that I was aware she was doing the loans, I was unaware that she had opened a credit card in my name until the day I was leaving for another continent. That's a serious breach of trust for me. AITA?",

      "description": "English isn't my native language so bear with me. \n\nWhat I mean is not the part about moving out, but more specifically me standing my ground and insisting on one specific date that I'm not willing to add more days to. Which is the end of february aka the 28th of feburary to be specific. \n\n**The moment we broke up (17th january) I told him to move out latest by febuary 28th. So more than a month.**\n\nWe broke up mid january. Luckly overall on good terms and decided to try to stay friends. No yelling, no insulting. We just figured out that the way things are at the moment aren't working out for us. We are in two completely different stages of lives which makes it difficult to find common life-goals; but I digress.\n\n**Info about him, to make this judgement against me more fair:** He's currently unemployed, he has no flat and he doesn't speak my countries language perfectly. He suffers from a variety of physical and mental health issues and financially he's not so great; it's sufficient for him to get food and small stuff, but I pay the rent for the currently shared flat by myself.\n\n**Why I think, that not all of that is a valid excuse:**\n\n* Even when we got together and through those two years that we were together, he was never really eager to find a job. His explanation was that it's because he doesn't speak the language well. Fair enough back then. But by now he speaks it more than fine for any small side job that doesn't require difficult language. Also he is perfectly fluent in english. \n* He has some family that lives in our city. He doesn't like them at all, but yet they offered him help mutliple times. Whether it be financially, as a place to stay or to find a job.\n* He neglected his health for a while now, although I tried and still try to give him a helping hand and convince him to see the doctor more often\n\nUsually I'd be more easy-going and give him more time, but I've asked him in the past multiple times to both find a job and check for a place to live (Yes the latter too, as things weren't amazing between us for a while, so we thought that maybe if he moves out and we both get more space and privacy, things will work out better). That has been easily 4 months from now. \n\nEversince we broke up it's simply \"unfun\" to be around him. When we were together I would just turn a blind eye on things that bother me, but now with the \"romanticism\" gone, I don't feel like I should be okay with certain things. He doesn't pay rent, he's messy, he doesn't make groceries often or barely, taking out &gt;our&lt; dog on proper walks/dogpark is not done often. He does take him out for a quick pee but that's it. \n\nI really don't want to be the asshole and I'm really aware of his problems and situation. After all I made sure he can focus on his language classes for a whole year without worrying about rent or other expenses. I helped him a lot with various paper work in my country and helped him to improve his health and get him health insurance. NOT mentioning those things to brag; I'm just trying to point out that I understand him.\n\nThis situation wears me down a lot. I feel uncomfortable in my own home. :( I still love him and with him around I can't start to process everything and move on eventually. I don't want to get back together with him the way he is now. \n\nAITA reddit?",

      "description": " I've been in a group at school since the beginning of the Spring semester. Other than one girl (GIRL A), my group is the absolute worst. We had a huge part of our assignment due this past week. For weeks now I've been telling them that we need to get this done and work together. There's two huge components that I felt it was only fair if we all worked together. To make sure everyone knew what was needed to be done I created a folder in google drive with a list of names and what needs to be done and who's responsible, resources for our project, and I uploaded the main two components. I shared EVERYTHING with them so that we could all log in and do our work. Every class we talk and discuss our project and what more needs to be done. So it's not as if no one knew what was going on.\n\nThis past week comes and one of the members (GIRL B) texts the group chat asking what's due. I responded with what was due and even told her that the links and whatnot are online and that she can go in to do her portion. I then send another text for the whole group saying we should all do our portion of the assignment and if we do we can get it done fast. No one went in and did anything except me. I get to class and find out it wasn't even due until next week. Girl B sees I've done it and gets mad and claims I never told her to help with it. But..I did. They all wanted to meet up to do a final together but I told Girl A I wasn't coming because I was frustrated with doing all the work. Girl A &amp; B meet up to do the assignment and I guess Girl B keeps bugging Girl A asking why I'm not there and saying I must be too good to not come help. So Girl A tells her the truth, which I was ok with.\n\nNext thing I know Girl B sends me a long text saying if I want help with assignments I should be grown and let her know. Claims to be direct and likes when others are too. It was honestly a really long and mean text. Then she sent a group chat saying the same thing and said \"No reason for some people to cry about it.\" I'm not going to chase and constantly remind grown women to do their work. I can just let the teacher know who put in what. I think it bothered me more that she tried to make me feel bad for not letting her know what to do. Which again, I did!\n\nI didn't even know how to respond because I was shocked. I'm even more shocked because when I talked to my bf he initially said Girl B wasn't wrong. Even my dad said the girl was right. It's frustrating even more now because I had been nothing but nice to Girl B, helping her with quizzes, being her partner during class and being ok with it that she only wants to type, maybe I was a bit of a pushover and let her take advantage of me.  \n Im just trying to figure out am I really the asshole for not constantly telling and reminding a grown woman to do her work?",

      "title": "WIBTA If I put my ex's dog down and didn't tell him about it?",
      "description": "Let's start with the dog. His name is Scooter and he has arthritis and bad legs. We have been through a lot together and I'm not ready for him to cross the rainbow bridge just yet. I just need to have a plan in place for when he does need to go the big farm in the sky. He spent most of his life with my ex and his family. He is basically my ex's childhood pet. My ex (who we shall call Steven) and I then became primary caretakers for about 2 years until our break up. I have been the dogs primary caretaker for the last year. \n\n\nThe reasons I am hesitant: \nTo put it bluntly: my ex is a psycho. He was a volatile and abusive drunk and he would lash out at me and Scooter, threaten us, threaten to harm himself, drive aggressively to scare me. He even crashed the car on purpose because i had the nerve to hop in the car and ask him not drive because he was hammered. He would tell me that I would never be able to outrun him so I shouldn't try, he would scream and curse and tell me he hated me, he would cry and say I was all he had in this world. He bit me, threw rocks at me because the thought I was talking to other guys. Quit his job, which forced me to work 2 jobs, 7 days a week to support all the drinking and weed and cigarettes. He hit me, choked me, screamed at me, laughed at me while I cried, accused me of lying when I tried to explain that he hit me again during one if his blackouts. I have absolutely zero interest in EVER speaking to him again. \n\nThe last time he saw me and the dog he was trying to beat the shit out of us. He got blood all over my car, threatening to hurt himself, to hurt me. Physically picked up Scooter and threw him on the ground. The last time Scooter saw him, he cowered on fear. I spent an hour holding the old dog and crying in the car after I finally kicked my ex out of my life for the last time. I told him he wasn't allowed to have Scooter if he was going to mistreat him. So essentially I assumed ownership of the dog with little argument from Steven. \n\nI don't want to break no contact and bring this traumatizing person back into my life. Not after I've gone so far in improving my self worth. \n\nBut Scooter was his dog so I don't know if Steven deserves the knowledge that he's passed on. Should I let him say goodbye? AITA for even thinking of putting down a dog that spent so much time not being mine? My normal isn't normal so I really don't know what's okay in this situation. I'm worried because it's getting colder and Scooters arthritis is getting worse. I don't want him to live in pain. \n\nTl;Dr \nMy ex sucked and I don't want to break no contact to tell him his dog is getting out down (when that time comes)",

      "description": "To start, I'm an 18 year old security supervisor. The site that I manage isnt difficult and is very laid back. The only people that work security here are me and one other person, who I manage.\n\nThe other security guy i used to work with recently got fired. His replacement was an older guy (late 60s) that I'm going to call fred. Fred was extremely incompetent at first, he struggled to understand basic concepts and was very hard to train. I eventually expressed my concerns about fred to my OP manager and they said they would see what they could do.\n\n After about 3 weeks of having this guy work with me, I got a call from another security guy, I'll call him rob, who is pretty good at his job, he tells me that he is losing his job at where he works, and wants to come work with me. At this point, fred was still not doing to well, and I told rob that I'd be glad to have him instead of fred. \n\nEvery week I would get a text from rob asking if I could call him. These calls would be short, but rob would always be asking me questions about things I cant control, like his start date, when to get his uniforms etc ( I dont control this stuff, our branch takes care of this stuff). Every call, I would get a sense of entitlement from rob, he acts like people owe him this job because he has Bill's to pay, and has nowhere else to go. He constantly talks down to me, talking about how I dont know his situation, and acts like he knows everything because hes been working security longer. Every call was like this.\n\nNow that a couple weeks has past, I've been able to work out the kinks with fred, and hes finally doing a pretty good job, no recent screw ups. Today I got a call from rob  stating that he will report in this next Friday, and after a bit of conversation he revealed to me that he would leave if his old boss told him to come back. This would make a headache for me since I would spend a bunch of time training him, for him to leave so that I could just end up training someone else, that could end up being unreliable (hard to find reliable people around here). \n\nFred on the other hand, is and older guy that collects social security, and is very unlikely to leave. Hes not the best, but hes reliable and he doesnt talk down to me. I have to say, I dont really want to kick fred for rob, even if rob might be a little bit better at the job.\n\nWIBTA if I denied Rob the job I initially said he could have?\n\nTLDR; Fred isnt the best but hes reliable and he doesnt talk down to me. I told Rob that he could have this job, but I later learned that he acts very entitled and talks down to me a lot because I'm younger. He may also prove to be unreliable, and may leave later down the road, causing a potentially big headache for me. Fred is very unlikely to leave. Rob is slightly better at the job than Fred is.\n\nFirst time I've ever had to make a decision like this, so any help is appreciated.",

      "description": "This happened last year, in December, but I haven't stopped questioning my decision since it happened. I had been friends with this guy for about 4 years. We met in high school and had been close ever since. He moved about 5 hrs away to go to university where I stayed in our town to do community college. At the start of winter break, he hit me up saying he didn't have a ride back from university, so I told him that I'd be happy to pick him up, I hadn't seen him in months, he'd just have to reimburse me for the gas. So I drive to pick him up, a total of 10 hrs there and back.\n\nHe was home for 2 weeks and didn't hit me up ONCE. His excuse was \"I'm busy with my family\". The thing is, his family fucking loves me. His mom calls me her son, I'm basically extended family to them. Hell I'm sure they would have let me stay with them for Christmas (I was home alone for Christmas because my family was out of the state). Half the time I texted him to hang out he'd say he was with his girlfriend. I just feel like he could have taken at least one of those days he spent with his girlfriend just to come see me for at least an hour. Or he could have invited me to come see him and his family, but he didn't reach out. Didn't even call on Christmas. So I told him he was fake and a shit friend and he said I was tripping, that he was just busy with his family and I should let it go. I told him to fuck off and then blocked him. Recently I heard from one of my friends who spoke to him that he's telling people that I overreacted. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I recently (within a month) ended things with my ex and moved out of our shared apartment, taking my cat with me. We originally got my cat (1Y/O) to be company to my ex's cat (3Y/O) but it was always clear that she was MY cat. Out of kindness after the breakup I agreed to let my ex have her one week out of the month so he could see her and she could play with his cat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy new roommates have a cat and a dog respectively, and I've been trying to get my cat to adjust to the new animals, and thus didn't want my cat at my ex's apartment for a whole week to try to avoid confusing her. So Sunday when I went to drop my cat off I explained the situation to my ex and asked him if I could get her back on Wednesday instead of a week later so she doesn't get too used to being in her old space and doesn't forget who my roommates animals are. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to last (Sunday) night- I get a call from my brother saying he's checked himself into a psychiatric ward for a severe depressive, nearly suicidal, episode. All I wanted was to have my cat at home with me for comfort (I have anxiety and having her around helps keep me calm) and when I text my ex this afternoon (Monday) if I could come get her today or tomorrow instead of Wednesday under the pretext of missing her and having to work all day Wednesday (I didn't want to use the brother card, my ex never understood how important my family was to me or how bad my anxiety gets about my loved ones being in distress). My ex said no, I could come get her Thursday though. When I countered that I had work Thursday and Friday as well my ex said I could come her on Saturday then. I told him about the situation with my brother after that brief exchange, and he immediately fired back saying we got her for his cat, that she's OUR cat, not MY cat, and that we had already agreed on him having her for a week, and completely disregarding the personal reasons I wanted her back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for wanting to cut my ex's visit with my cat short?

      "description": "Okay reddit, I'm at the end of my rope. I've shopped and shopped for bridesmaids outfits with both my MOH and bridesmaid, and my MOH says no to almost everything. I think this is because she feels self conscious of her weight and has no money.\n\nI've been best friends with both these girls for years. My MOH used to be stick skinny, but she started smoking really heavily and gained weight, probably &gt;75 lbs. Now nothing fits her, and getting her to go shopping is like pulling teeth (she lived 6 hours away, but comes home frequently to see her family). \n\nAnother thing is, because of her smoking, she has no money ever. The tradition around here is the MOH pays for the bride during her bachelorette party, but my MOH is doing everything she can to get out of it. She has next to no bills since she lives with her grandparents but still cant save money. Shes known about the wedding and her financial responsibility during my wedding for +5 months, and hasn't saved a dime. This is really frustrating for me and my bridesmaid because we had an idea to rent a cabin for my last night out, but my MOH said she couldn't afford it. At this point I'm planning on paying for her as well as myself because shes so unreliable, on top of paying for her bridesmaids outfit (traditionally around here the bride gives a gift to her bridesmaids and since my MOH can't afford her dress I'll be paying for it and giving a small gift after the wedding).\n\nI feel like I shouldn't have to stress this much about it but here we are. \n\nWIBTA if I asked her to cut down on her smoking, work out a bit (for her mental health and body both), and to save money? \n\nTl;dr: my best friend and maid of honor smokes so much she has no money, ever, and has gained a lot of weight. shes also depressed and I dont know how to help her. WIBTA if I asked her to cut down on smoking, work out some, and save money a bit?",

      "description": "Without going into the world's most convoluted family history, at Thanksgiving this past year my father (60s) got drunk and groped me (his 36 year old daughter). I have a 10 year old girl and an 11 year old step daughter as well as a son who is 14. He also acted very inappropriately with the girl children. \n\nMy mother, my boyfriend, sister, brother in law, and stepmother all witnessed this and also heard him say \"I have always wanted to do that.\" My family has urged me to let it go because he was drunk and had a stroke a year prior. \n\nNot long after he had surgery that has left him temporarily paralyzed. I did not visit him nor do I allow him to see my kids when I have them. My ex husband takes them to visit my family because I refuse. \n\nMy mother uninvited me to Christmas dinner and instead hosted my stepmom, my children, my ex husband, and my dad. She said she did so because she assumed I hated all of them. \n\nI am in therapy and working through the gross thing my dad did, but my boyfriend thinks I need to reach out to everyone and make amends. I maintain i have nothing to apologize for, as I did not grope anyone nor did I show up uninvited at Christmas. Neither of my parents or stepparents or sibling has expressed regret over my dads actions, so I am wondering, am I the asshole?\n\nTL;DR my dad groped me and I don't want contact with my family nor do I want my kids around him.",

      "description": "I live in a city and my kids go the public school in our neighborhood, it’s a good school and we like it, but like all big city public school systems there can be issues etc.  Friends of ours applied for seats there in the summer because it’s in their zone too, got seats, but then decided at the last minute that the school wasn’t good enough for their kids and stayed in a private school.  This can really screw up people waiting for seats to open up since there’s a wait list for some grades.  Last month we found out they got their oldest into a different public school in a different neighborhood that has a very good reputation, is attended by a lot of very wealthy families who support the school beyond regular funding, and also has specific programs for kids with learning disabilities e.g. dyslexia.  They are telling most people they were able to get into the school because their oldest needed the special programs but told us and a few others that they really got in by using a work address that they had started sending credit card statements too to seem legit.  It pisses me off that they gamed the system and cheated like that and the parents seem to thing they did nothing wrong and are entitled to the seat in that school.  Their other kids will now be able to go their too because there’s a sibling policy.  There’s also one less seat now for a kid who really lives in that zone or needs the special services.  The school system has a anonymous hotline to report residency issues, I’ve held out from doing so in part because I don’t want to ruin their Christmas but am considering calling after the new year, WIBTA?",

      "description": "I am in college but I work at a restaurant in my hometown over the summer with three other people I went to high school with. We'll call them Alex, Hayden and Taylor (not real names).\n\nA little background. In high school, Taylor was my best friend. We did absolutely everything together. But towards the beginning of last summer she told me point blank that she wanted to \"drop me as a friend.\" She told me that this is because she feels like she is becoming a famous \"influencer\" on instagram and that I simply don't fit into the lifestyle she is looking for. It's true that we'd been drifting apart for a while, but I don't really understand why she felt the need to formally cut me out of her life like that. It was really hurtful.\n\nAt work Taylor would act absolutely insufferable about her \"instagram career.\" She was getting actual offers from local businesses to promote their products on her account. She would constantly brag about these offers at work to me, Alex, and Hayden. We were all pretty fed up with it.\n\nThis part is where I feel like I took a wrong turn. I was furious and wanted to take Taylor down a peg. I know she spends a lot of time on dating websites so I set up a bunch of accounts on popular dating websites to try and catfish her. After a while of talking to her online, I sent her a message from this catfishing account asking her to meet up for a date at the restaurant. When her \"date\" didn't show, I took a picture of her and posted it on social media, showing what had happened.\n\nThe next day at work I come in and the manager is furious with me. (This part requires a little background - months ago, when Taylor and I were still friends, I accidentally broke an expensive piece of equipment in the restaurant. I told Taylor about it but never fessed up that it was me to our manager) Taylor told the manager about how I had broken the oven, and I was FIRED that day. To make matters even worse, the manager threatened to SUE ME for tens of thousands of dollars for breaking the equipment.\n\nWhen I got home that day I noticed that Taylor had posted a picture on social media of herself smirking and tagged me in it. The caption said \"TFW I win.\" I knew that her followers probably wouldn't get it but it was a message at me gloating about me getting fired.\n\nThat's when I left the mean comment on that post. I won't put the whole thing here, but I said some really mean things like \"You deserve to die\" and \"When you're dead, no one will even miss you.\" I also said \"Watch your back, I'm coming for you.\"\n\nI went back to college pretty soon after that and basically cut contact almost entirely with Taylor, Alex, and Hayden. Alex told me that Taylor said she was actually pretty disturbed by my comment, calling it a \"threat\" and saying it made her feel afraid. I thought I was justified at the time because she's the one who dropped our friendship, but when I review my actions I really feel like the asshole here",

      "description": "I'm in college and was at a closed event for my sorority and one of the fraternities. We were playing dumb truth or dare type games and someone dared me to kiss one of the guys. Of the guys, there were two that I knew well:\n\n1) This guy and I have known each other since move in day. He's a fine person, but I am not even the slightest bit attracted to him. I know he's very into me, since he has asked me out a bunch of times. People tell me how great he is and how I should give him a chance, but I'm not into him like that and he should know it by now.\n\n2) I met this guy at the beginning of the semester and we really vibe. I think he's super attractive and athletic and funny. We talk a lot and there's definitely tension between us and I've been feeling like I just needed a little kick to take the next step with him.\n\nI figured this was an easy choice, and kissed the second guy, and we left together pretty soon afterward. However, today I am getting a lot of messages from guys and girls telling me that I disrespected the first guy and threw my attraction to this other guy in his face and made him feel bad. I have also been accused of stirring up drama in their pledge class because I went home with one of his fraternity brothers and they say I should have picked someone that the first guy doesn't know. Did I fuck up and am I the asshole?",

      "description": "I have three kids, one is 4 and two are almost 2. My 4 year old is fine on planes but the younger ones hate takeoff and landing.\n\nMy husband is currently working almost all the way across the country, and I take my kids to see him whenever I can. Of course, it’s easier for everyone when he comes to us and that’s what we do most of the time, but sometimes it’s logistically impossible and I just want my kids to see him (and I want to see him!)\n\nI took my kids on the plane and got them settled. I’ve learned that getting my younger ones to “chomp” during take off (aka, making gum chewing motions even though they’re too young for gum) usually keeps them from screaming blue murder. They usually yetch a little, but no screaming and crying and such.\n\nAnyway, I’m getting them to do the chomping thing and saying “chomp chomp chomp like alligators” or whatever, which I’m sure is annoying but it’s better than screaming and I wasn’t doing it loudly.\n\nThe guy in front of me sticks his head out from his aisle seat and is staring at me and glaring. I just made eye contact with him and kept chomping and telling my kids to chomp. We were staring each other down and I didn’t really know what to do, but it really pissed him off that I didn’t stop and he started lecturing me and telling me that I was disturbing him. I said, “im sorry but it’s either this or screaming” and he told me that I’m inconsiderate and irresponsible for having so many kids and flying with them. He made a couple of comments about the fact that my kids are half black so I was sleeping around with deadbeats and such which my kids didn’t hear, so I just ignored it so it wouldn’t escalate.\n\nI’m pretty certain the other guy was an asshole for how he handled it and what he said, but AITA also for flying with kids and doing the chomping thing (just during takeoff and landing)?",

I worked a 6 hour shift last week, he came in for breakfast for an hour then returned several hours later to see if I wanted anything from the shop.  It's not unusual to get a visit at least every second day with a question or some important fact he needs to tell me.  \n\nI tried to talk about it to him.  He asked if he was visiting too much and I said, \"well.... you came in yesterday, and today so yes, every day is a bit much\"  so he told me he wouldn't visit the next day.  The next day I woke up earlier than him and went to work.  Within an hour of me starting my shift he was there with a question.  And he followed the next day with another visit, by which time I'm getting pretty pissed off.  \n\nI feel really mean that I just want him to PO and leave me alone while I'm at work.  I've worked there 6 months and seen each of my co-workers partners ONCE!\n\nAITA?

      "description": "So, me and DJ moved in together as best friends. Somewhere along the line he stops liking me but gives no indicators. One day we were planning a business together, the next day he told me to move out because I got the wrong off brand coffee before I could get up to the store. \n\nHe admitted he hated me, and told me he never wanted to talk to me again, and I was really sad and didn’t talk to him, didnt talk to anyone about it really. My dog was very pregnant, so I needed to focus on that. (He was fully aware of my plans to breed her, he never said anything negative, in fact he met a potential mate for my dog and told me he loved that dog). \n\nSo one day he brings a big chair into our shared space, the kitchen, and spreads his shit out and occupies the area - he even takes naps in the kitchen now. My room is connected to the kitchen with a doorway and no door. (He has a door to his room). He blasted his BT speaker facing into my room, and when I asked him to turn it down he told me to go fuck myself. I yelled at the same volume to harass him back and then gave up. \nThe next day as punishment, I presume, he woke me up at 9am by blasting music again. He had headphones in while our “couch guy” (CG) was home, but when he left for work he turned on the BT. I had fallen asleep at 8am because the newborns pups, and my dog, needed tending all night, and I have my own hours (I clean) so I went to work at 5am. CG and DJ saw me come in and pass out. \n\nDJ and I got into a physical fight over this, he put his hands on me first, and I refused to back down until he turned off his music. Neither of us would and he put his hands around my throat to stop me, despite being twice my weight and size. I took pics of my bruises but we made a truce. \n\nHowever he abandoned the truce for no apparent reason, and has been throwing away my shit whenever I am away at work and hes here. I took photos of all this too. Then he escalated further by scratching up the one video game I play. I didnt retaliate or respond but I did ask a mutual friend to intervene. Things seem quiet but idk if I am just waiting for something even worse to happen. \n\nIf i report the physical assault to the police now, which will most likely result in an arrest and ruin his plans, WIBTA? \n",

She claims that this isn’t at all sexual, that it’s mainly companionship and that these men are lonely and in need of someone to talk to.

I have asked her to give this up, as I am not comfortable with the thought of other men jerking off to my girl, but she says she doesn’t want to stop.

      "description": "I'm 36 weeks pregnant with a little girl. There have been some pretty major complications with this pregnancy that were discovered around week 30. She's small for her age and, the most serious one, I have an umbilical cord aneurysm. The small size could have been due to a chromosome disorder, but thankfully it wasn't. It could just be because I'm pretty small myself and I have small babies.  The aneurysm, however, is very serious. There have only been 14 documented cases of this and out of the 14, only 4 of the babies turned out ok. Because it's such a rare condition, the Drs don't really have a lot of information or research to go on, on how best to proceed. We finally decided that we are going to do a planned C section on Friday. I'll be 36 weeks and 5 days. We will do steroid injections to strengthen her lungs beforehand. \n \nThe issue is, my husband wasn't a part of this decision. And the groups of Drs I see only deliver at 1 hospital in my city. When I first told him I thought it would be a good idea to take her early, he got mad at me and screamed at me that I was just going to do whatever I wanted anyway and not to bother telling him. He also has a hatred for this particular hospital, because I guess his brother and his wife had a bad experience there when they had their son. However, I want to have her there because my step mom has worked for this particular Dr for almost 30 years and worked in the hospital with him for about 10 of them. She knows everyone there and they are all really nice and kind to me. The hospital itself is a good hospital. They have a NICU. They have good ratings and technology and all the things you want in a hospital. \n\nMy husband wants me to go to a different hospital that is a teaching hospital, which has more advanced technology and is more modern. The thing is, I'd have to change my whole birth plan and be ok with a completete stranger delivering my baby,  because none of my Drs deliver there. I'm really not ok with that. I don't think I should have to compromise on this. I'm the one who is physically going through this. But, it's his kid, too. Am I the asshole for just kind of doing what I want and not taking his wants into consideration? ",

      "description": "Some backstory...\n\nMy husband's mom and step dad live out of state and frequently (99% of their visits) stay with us. I have never said no when asked. I don't like when they stay, I feel like I have no privacy, they never let me know when they are coming or going and I can't feel like myself or even comfortable in my own home.\n\nWe've recently moved into a new house. I had been looking forward to the three of us having a little Christmas morning then going to visit family. That was derailed when my husband said he wanted to visit his mom and stepdad for Christmas. I agreed because we spend alot of time with my family and his grandmother is still alive but unable to travel, so I thought it would be nice for her to spend some time with her great granddaughter. I gave up on my version of the perfect Christmas morning.\n\nWhile there, I gave out invitations for my daughter's birthday party next month. She had asked me if they could stay with us. I explained that it would probably be best if they didn't as I would be a maniac with all the cooking and cleaning on top of my 40 hour work week. It was all very respectful, and I thought that was the end of it. I really just need the house empty so I can prepare for the party.\n\nWhen we get home, I find out that my mother in law went to my husband about staying with us after I politely said no. She said she probably wouldn't be able to come if she can't because of the money. His brother lives alone and is within driving distance, they also have friends they have stayed with in the past.\n\nJust to clarify, they are genuinely nice people, but I don't really fit in. I like my space and my privacy.\n\nI feel like it was manipulative to go to my husband about the money and staying with us. I'm bitter that I can't throw my daughter a birthday party without feeling this way. I'm worried I'll never get to celebrate a holiday the way I'd like to because of them.\n\nAITA for feeling this way?\n\n",

      "description": "(Idk if many people here are gamers so I'll to keep the gamer lingo down a bit and make it easy to understand for all.)\n\nSlightly long so get ready.\n\nSo my brother and I are both pretty hefty gamers. We both spend a good chunk of our days playing games for both fun and competition. Now my brother doesn't consider himself pro level or anything, he actually doesn't like most gaming content creators or professional gamers calling them \"no lives\" and whatnot. He definitely thinks that if he's played a game for a while or started playing it competitively that he's awesome and can outplay most people. The sad truth though is that he's actually really bad at most pvp games he plays.\n\nUnfortunately he can't really accept that he's bad. He always has some excuse to shirk losses in a game on someone else. Now that would just be annoyign in itself but he has a really short temper. He claims that these games mean nothing to him but he gets extremely pissed off and toxic when he starts losing. Still wouldn't be all THAT bad but then he does something kind of unforgivable in any team based game; he goes out of his way to throw the game and make it as miserable for his teams as possible.\n\nHe mostly plays League of Legends and he can become a terror to play with if he loses even 1 game. He first finds excuses for misplays he makes (\"I wasn't trying when he killed me!\", \"I knew he would do that but just didn't care.\", \"Why didn't ____ help me?!\", etc.) and steadily gets more and more agitated/angry. Stage 2 is when he starts to blame other people and gets kind of toxic. The final stage (3) is when he starts outright throwing games, is straight up using words you should never use on people (Re****ed has become a new favorite of his), and will even gleefully admit that he's doing it.\n\nNow I've reported him a few times and made it clear with different game developers/companies that I am perfectly ok with him getting (permanently)banned for this. He gets way too out of hand. The thing is though that a lot of people I tell this to tell me that I'm being \"an asshole dick head\" for reporting my own brother. The thing is though that 1) if talking with him about it had done anything he would have stopped a while ago, 2) It's never right to deliberately throw matches and call people you don't even know and who are just trying their best vulgar names (online or physical), and 3) They would report him if they could. I don't see how me being a family member makes my ability to get him punished any different. \n\nSo, AITA or does he deserve to have me closely monitoring and reporting his negative actions to people of more authority?\n\n(I hope this was easy to read. I tried to keep this post easy to read for anyone who doesn't game or understand the gaming lingo.)",

      "description": "This happened over the weekend and I feel pretty bad about how it went down, but my intentions were honorable here. I was the Best Man at my pal's wedding. \n\nI got the idea to start up a bet and collect a pool from other people attending the wedding. The basic idea is that participants guess a year in which the couple will divorce and put in a certain amount of money (minimum bet $50), and IF they end up divorcing during that year whoever guessed that year wins the whole pot. \n\nSo for example, if 2 people guesses the year 2025, if the couple actually divorces in 2025, those 2 people would split the whole pot. (We raised a little over 3 grand total, so like $1500 each in this example.) \n\nBUT, if the couple is still married after the latest bet in the pool (somebody put 2040) then the couple gets the entire pot. \n\nSo that was kind of the twist that I meant to convey to them, that yeah sure it was a real bet, but that if they stayed together they could expect 3 grand in 2041. \n\nWhen I was explaining the bet during my best man speech that was how I was going to end, kind of with a charming/corny line that \"But we all know none of us are going to be winning the bet, because you two will be together forever, so you can look forward to cashing in in 2041!\" \n\nYes, if they actually divorced and if somebody in the betting pool nailed the right year we would follow up and that person would get the winnings. But I don't think these two will get divorced, they're perfect for each other. \n\nThat was supposed to be my intended message, it was supposed to be a kind of fun silly thing. \n\nBefore I could even get to that part the bride started crying and the parents and bridesmaids and all that were almost yelling at me, and the groom (my best friend of decades) was furious. \n\nEven later that night when I explained to him my intent he wouldn't even listen to me. The bride especially apparently \"feels betrayed by everyone\" who participated in the bet. Even though I explained that I had misled all of them by saying the bride and groom knew about it in advance that wouldn't make them less angry. \n\nSo needless to say I feel extremely bad. But I meant it all as a nice gesture and I feel if they could just see they have a near certainty of getting a free 3 grand in 2041 they could see this intention. I think by then it will be a fond memory and a \"look back on it laugh\" kind of thing when we get to the 2040's, plus a nice little bonus of a 3 grand prize. \n\nI keep trying to explain this but my friend isn't hearing it, especially when I told him that I still had to follow up with whoever \"wins\" on the off-chance they do get divorced. But I really doubt they'd ever get divorced. \n\nI know I went about it the wrong way but I don't feel I was the A here, but I want to see what reddit thinks. \n\ntl;dr - Collected bets to see what year my friends would divorce at their wedding, but if they don't get divorced they win, I meant it to be nice/sweet but they are both furious at me.

      "description": "I (F22), just graduated college and took a gap year cuz of reasons I'm gonna enlist below. \n\nSo pausing for a minute to give a family BG. I am the youngest out of 5 sisters. So around 4 years ago, around this time, all of my sisters either got married or got incredible career offers and moved away from our not so big, humble city. Leaving me behind with our parents to take care of. Now, before it irks you, my parents are old and my dad has glaucoma, so they need one of us to be there for them. \n\nWhere I'm from, it's not frowned upon if you don't go away for college but it's still something that has started to catch on with people here. Of course, it did so with me too, and when I had to stay back for my degree, I got thrown into a mess of depression, anxiety and low self confidence. I have blamed everyone for making me stay back, and for my mental health deteriorating. But never to their faces, because they try, they really really do! But they don't do enough, and I swear I don't blame them.\n\nHowever, in these 3-4 years, my father apparently saw this ability in me to excel in our family business (I have helped him with many things in his business, and gradually started doing so quite regularly). He now wants me to stay back and get into the business full-time, and not leave for my higher studies. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for wanting to go out for 2 years to see what is out there and then make the decision? Also, do I sound extremely bratty for having this cushion of having the business to get back to when all else fails, and yet still almost cribbing about it? \n\nTL;DR Father wants me to get into family business, while I want to go out for higher studies for at least 2 years and weigh my options then.

A couple of days ago, while I was getting ready to go out, she mentioned how she was starving, but she didn't bring any money with her, and therefore wouldn't be able to each lunch. I asked her if she wanted come with me, and I would just pay for her meal (I feel it would be awkward if I didn't offer, as she was seeing me going out, while stating she was starving and had no money). \n\nWhen we went out to eat, I let her decide the place we would go, and it ended up being this mildly pricey place, but I agreed to go (although I would have preferred somewhere much cheaper, but I thought it was no big deal, I'll just bring lunch from home for a few days, also I hate arguing and confrontation). My co-worker proceeded to buy a $35 meal, and upon seeing this, I ordered a smaller meal that was $10 to try to save some money. \n\nNow, when I pay for someone, I usually don't ask them to pay me back, unless they vehemently offer. After a bit of small talk, she mentioned how she would pay me back the price of both our meals the next day, and I declined this offer. After she insisted more, I said if she really wanted to pay me back, she could just send over the price of her meal only. Again, she very clearly insisted that she would pay for both meals. Ok fine, I didn't argue. \n\nIt has been about a week since this happened. Recently, I have gotten into a problem, and needed all the cash I could save up. I have been bringing up the topic of her paying me back for a few days now, and I have gotten around to mentioning my problem to her, which she just hasn't been acknowledging. After a couple of more days of pestering, she snapped at me saying how I was the one who told her that I didn't need to be paid back and stated that it seemed like I clearly wanted to treat her and not be paid back. I told her I acted that way out of pure mannerism. \n\nHalf the office thinks I'm the asshole for going back on my statement, but the other half of the office thinks that if she said she would pay for both meals, she should have.

      "description": "So to start off, we are a gay couple of almost 2 years. We are both Mexican-American. I have been so blessed to have a family who not only accepts me for who I am, but also welcomes him with open arms. He isn’t so fortunate.\n\nIn hispanic culture, homosexuality is not the most popular thing, and his parents are also very involved with the church. Thankfully his family ignores that he’s gay and he is still close with them. They have no idea about me aside from a couple siblings. I completely understand and have no intentions of being a part of their lives if I’m going to be a problem just by existing. \n\nI’m going to be graduating the same weekend that Mexicans celebrate Mother’s Day, and he told me he’s planning on going to visit. I know his family will want to know why he won’t visit if I have him stay, and a boyfriend is just an unacceptable excuse. I don’t want to cause tension in his family, but I’m also very excited to graduate and I would like him there. I also don’t want to guilt him into feeling like he’s choosing me over them. \n\nI don’t want this thread to bash them for being homophobic, though I know it’s ridiculous. They believe their views are correct and I have no intent on swaying them. It’s a shitty situation but I will feel like a huge asshole if I ask him to skip it for my graduation knowing it may cause a bunch of other issues. But if he misses my graduation I know I will be hurt. \n\nWIBTA?",

      "description": "This is mostly sex based, and probably childish also, but he always seems to think I'm picking on him and I suppose in a way I am but I don't know if it's wrong of me because he won't listen when I try to bring up the real issue.\n\nHe essentially treats me like an object. Constantly making comments about how I'm \"so hormonal\" and how I'm being a \"typical woman\". If I'm doing something he dislikes or get an attitude he'll tell me to stop because it's not attractive. I find this rude but he says it's what older men do, he's 38. I'm much younger. \n\nHe also mistreats me during sex. I can repeatedly and very sternly tell him I don't want something, the word no being important here, and he (non-aggressively) makes it happen or whines and begs until I give in. If something is hurting me he claims that the faces I make are unattractive and I need to stop behaving like a child.\n\nTo combat this, because he won't talk with me about it, I often make rather cocky remarks about things he does. This morning he was on the phone with his boss and was complaining about something his boss was telling him he could not do. I said \"you don't seem to have a problem forcing other people into things, what's the deal with him\" and he gave me a nasty glare.\nIf he mentions my \"hormonal female typicality\" I tend to be quite mean and say \"so your mother is just as useless as me considering she's female too\". \n\nTl;dr: My boyfriend is mean to me often and he won't talk about it so I pick on him instead. \n",

      "description": "Just want to start off by saying this happened over a year ago so the exact details of how this went down are hazy. Also forgive my formatting, I’m on mobile. TLDR at bottom\n\nSo this all happened during my freshman year at college. It all started when I used a hookup app on either the first or second day I had gotten to school and ended up getting head from a dude, who I’ll refer to as “X”. X seemed like a nice enough dude but I was put off by the fact that he didn’t look like his pictures as well as his really bad bj skills (this will be important later trust me).\n\nAbout a week later my roommates and I had gotten to know the girls that lived across the hall from us in our dorm building. One day about 8 of us where all hanging out in the girls dorm when X comes over, not knowing that I was there.\n\nEven though my hookup with X wasn’t the best experience, I didn’t want to be rude so I gave him a friendly hello. He seemed to be uncomfortable so he left fairly quickly and once he was gone the girls he was friends with started asking me how I knew him. Given that I am pretty blunt and brutally honest I nonchalantly tell them how X had given me a blow job last week. Three of the girls start looking at each other in shock while the one starts giving me a death stare. We’ll call her A.\n\nA: “Hmmm no you’re probably thinking of someone else, X is straight” \n\nMe: “Nah I’m pretty sure he’s the dude, he wasn’t that good either, way too much teeth.” \n\nThis makes A even madder and she then motions for me to talk to her outside. All this time I had never considered the fact that X might still have been in the closet. Honestly I just assumed that if someone uses a hookup app and doesn’t explicitly say they are DL (down low (closeted)) that they are out and open. A then blew up on my telling me that X wasn’t out of the closet and that he’s insecure about his sexuality, hence the reason not all his friends knew. I obviously feel bad for outing X but luckily his friends all turned out to be really open-minded and accepting people so I don’t think it did too much harm. So AITA???\n\nTL;DR: Dude gave me a toothy blowjob. Meet some friends of his, told them about our hookup and accidentally outed him as gay.",

      "description": "I’m FTM and if you’re trans, you know what this is about. I just don’t wanna be ”a trans guy”, I’ve never gone to a pride and I never will. I feel, or at least the community makes me feel, that I should be more active in LGBTQ stuff and be more thankful for the work in equality that others have done before me.\n\nI just don’t feel ”trans”. I know I have an illness, my body is female when my brain (and my soul) is male. I don’t know why be ”proud” about that. I’m not ashamed or anything, I just AM. I want to get the transitioning out of the way and be the man I was born to be. Just a man, nothing heroic or brave about that. I don’t want to be ”trans” for the rest of my life.\n\nI’ve always felt that gender minorities (and sexual minorities as well) have always been ”weird” and ”loud” and just something I want nothing to do with. They attract attention and then complain when people respond. I feel they should get off their high horses, nobody’s that important. Just be happy about yourself, for yourself and stop trying to force everyone to accept you. The only people that matter are the ones you love and that should include YOU.\n\nI don’t want special treatment, I don’t want recognition.

      "title": "WIBTA if I told my husband I don't want him to have contact with a \"friend\" he was in love with a long time ago",
      "description": "So this will be long. I posted parts of this over time in advice subs but now I’m at a point where I need to find out if I WIBTA. I'm marking as NSFW, but admittedly I don't think it's too bad.\n\nI posted this first part elsewhere originally asking whether I should be worried or not. I’ll try to do the abridged version (if you look in my post history you can get more details). I met my husband in college. I let him know I was interested but he would ignore my advances. We were friends at least, but I picked up he was hung up on a friend from high school whom he had stopped talking to. Later I found out the two were talking again and I saw less of him.\n\nA long while later he asked me out. I asked about his friend, he just said it just wasn’t going to work with her and left it at that. We started dating, became exclusive, and it would lead to us being married.\n\nThis “friend” of his has been in the background through our whole relationship, though. I accept that a lot of the issue is more than likely with me. I’ve never met her and as far as I know he hasn’t physically seen her since before we started dating. But things would keep happening over the years that would concern me. I learned more about her through his other friends, who told me how close the two were. They were inseparable, did everything together, and were pretty much a couple but not. She actually had a boyfriend: she moved from elsewhere and her boyfriend lived back where she was from. But she easily spent more time with my husband to be. The two had been through a lot, he apparently grew feelings for her, never told her, and the two drifted apart before going off to college. That’s all I got.\n\nWe told each other about past relationships and we have both been fine. He’s even still friends with a couple of exes, I met one and she’s a sweetheart. But he had never really told me everything about this “friend.” I asked him and he really didn’t want to talk about her. He told me that yes, he fell for her, but he said he was confused and it was nothing, but the two had drifted apart and weren’t talking.\n\nAfter getting married I found a box that had some printed e-mails. There were some from me but there were a lot between him and his “friend,” all written before we were dating. To my shame now I did read them, and I was taken aback. It was apparent he had told her his feelings for her. Though their e-mails were going over things going on in their lives, he would pepper his feelings for her through them, and she welcomed it and I feel even encouraged it. She would mention her boyfriend in passing, but never discouraged my future husband. She’d also compliment him, tell him how wonderful he was, and just flatter him. Eventually she dropped an “I love you, too” in one of these e-mails and she became more affectionate after that. It became obvious throughout they were starting to see each other and do things together. Then another hit me: she told him that her roommate wouldn’t be around and he should go over to her place the day they were gone. In my head I figured the two had had sex, though nothing following confirmed this. The e-mails ended with no resolution. I was upset from these but I didn’t say anything.\n\nYears later we have a house and are looking to start a family. His laptop was on the living room table and I saw a couple of Facebook e-mails come in, one a friend request, the other a message, and they were both from his “friend”. I wasn’t happy about this, thinking they had been talking. I asked him what was up with that and he was just as surprised, insisted they haven’t talked since before we dated. We looked at her profile (and this was the first time I saw what she looked like, and I need to say she’s gorgeous), saw she had just married and so on. The message was a little condescending but was basically just her reaching out. He asked me if it was okay if he accepted it, he always felt bad for his feelings killing their friendship, and he just said he missed his friend. I knew there was more to it, but didn’t tell him about the e-mails, but I just asked him right out if he had slept with her, because I really wanted to know if there was more. He said “no.” I said it was fine but I wanted to see interactions (this was dickish on my part, I admit this now, but I knew he was hiding something). For the first while I looked at stuff: messages, posts, likes, etc. There was nothing noteworthy so eventually I dropped it.\n\nCut to a few weeks ago (many years afterwards), I’m watching TV and I see his phone light up. I see a Facebook message bubble on his phone with her face. In retrospect this is awful (and I got beat up in the other post I made) but I looked at the messages and saw that the two had been messaging consistently for a few months, though hadn’t talked for years prior to this. For some reason they were talking a lot all of a sudden. The messages had nothing in them, the two were just talking. There was nothing romantic, nothing like their e-mails. It was just two friends catching up, but I was a little uneasy.\n\nI posted about all of that and wondered if I should be concerned and was encouraged to confront my husband. I did. He didn’t take kindly to me looking on his phone (not surprisingly) though didn’t care I had looked at the e-mails (he forgot they existed). He was upset I could accuse him of cheating. I told him that I knew he had confessed his feelings to her and their e-mails told me there was more there than some one-sided infatuation. I told him I’m concerned because he’s been open about his other relationships but not this one, which he insisted was just a friendship. He got frustrated but eventually relented. He told me they had had a falling out, stopped talking, he finally told her his feelings, and then suddenly they’re talking again, e-mailing, calling, and then spending time together. But she had a boyfriend still. He really felt they would end up together, though, because of what was being said, but “things happened” and he felt he couldn’t trust her and realized she had been pretty much leading him on.\n\nI pushed him some more and he admitted that the “things happened” was they had indeed slept together. He always felt awful about it because she was with someone else, but he wanted something with her so much at the time and felt that maybe that would push it. But he realized she wasn’t going to leave her boyfriend and just stopped talking to her. He had been severely hurt and ashamed of what he did and it was worse because they were such close friends prior. He had planned on being by himself for a while but asked me out because he didn’t want to miss his chance with me. I asked him if he felt he jumped into a relationship too quickly with me and he said he didn’t, that he fell for me hard, that we were just completely compatible in ways they weren’t, told me all of these early memories he loves. He admitted at first he was still hurt, and she was still there in his heart, but after a number of months he didn’t care anymore. Still, he admitted he missed her as a friend. He told me that he feels he has closure on that now that they’re talking, is happy she’s still in his life in a small way, but insists he doesn’t feel that way for her anymore. I do believe him. We have a lot between us and I know I love him and I know he loves me.\n\nThe two have apparently “forgiven” each other, though have not talked directly about what happened, basically they just said they’re good with each other. She was apparently not happy that he stopped talking to her.\n\nI know he lied to me, I’ve forgiven him, but I told him it can’t happen again. It stings a little that they slept together, I’ll admit that, because I know he really felt something, but I’m genuinely not concerned about that. He’s had other partners as have I. My concerns are not around this.\n\nThese two were incredibly close, and there is a lot to it, and I understand this. They were there for each other when they each needed someone at that time and I know they cared for each other, and I’m sure they still do. I do not, for the life of me, understand why she did what she did. I think it’s awful, and I figure she was filling some need. I can’t imagine hurting someone you care about like that, and I’m sure she did care for him. I hate he was hurt, but it obviously worked out for me. They’re close friends, and again the messages are just two old friends talking, catching up, I don’t see a romance or feelings beyond friendship of any kind. But I’m concerned about the history. I’m not saying my husband is innocent in all of this, he feels guilty and he willingly slept with her, was essentially “the other guy,” but I still don’t like her and what she did and still feel it falls heavily on her. She should not have given him the okay if she had no intention of building anything more with him, because she knew how he felt. She could be in a different place now, found what she needed in her husband (who is not the same boyfriend she had back then I should add), but I don’t know if I feel comfortable with her still in his life. I don’t think my husband would do anything, but I fear her being emotionally manipulative. I feel she could be a toxic presence. I really don’t want to tell my husband he has to lose his friend after feeling he repaired their friendship, and I am willing to believe it was a stupid time and maybe they confused their feelings for each other but… I’m still not easy with her being there, so: \n\nWIBTA if I told my husband I do not feel comfortable if he continues to have any contact with this woman, even just on social media?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "This happened just a little before thanks-giving. My GF is from out of town and moved here for work. We currently live together in an apartment that's just a little over 700sqft.\nHer parents were planning on coming to visit her for her birthday/early Thanksgiving since we wouldn't be able to go to theirs out of state. I have no problem with them staying over, but mind you.  700sqft isn't the most lavish living space, that could accommodate 2 people max. The posse is coming over and that's about 5 of them, putting us well around 7 people in that much space. In order for me to get her birthday off, I had to work a double on sunday (they came sat morning- planning on spending the night in our apartment) the double was 2pm to 6am.\n\nMy parents  live in town so I thought  it would just make life a little easier if I just went to spend the night over there and get some proper sleep while freeing up some space for them. I honestly felt like it was the right decision, I told them about it and they didn't seem to care at the moment, up until I didn't come home after my shift around 10pm. My girlfriend texted me around 11pm, telling me that her parents felt really disrespected, and that if they were such a bother that they should've just got a hotel room. Flabbergasted, i told her we talked about this and i don't understand why they felt this way. \n\n I went back home for breakfast and her dad kinda confronted me and then left to go gamble (whatever dude.) Her mom scolded me also but honestly, I respectfully told her my side and brushed off whatever I had to because this was the least of my worries 2 hours before my 16hour shift ( that I was doing in order to spend time with their daughter on her actual birthday.) \n\nAm I the Asshole?",

      "description": "I've been friends with Tim for 20 years. We grew up together and have always been best friends. We went to different colleges and during that time he was diagnosed with depression and bipolar. I stuck with him, helped as much as possible. During this time he would have meltdowns and run away from campus, destroy his room, cut himself. It was a dark time and heartbreaking for me and his family. He eventually found medication and therapy that works for him which is great and he's been stable for about three years. \n\n\nThese days, he rarely speaks to me, and when he does he has a rude comment to say or some condescending opinion about my life.however he always talks about me calling me his BEST friend. We had plans last week, at a set date and time and when I called to confirm he just said \"I'm spending tomorrow with my girlfriend sorry\". He belittles my own relationship and makes fun of my job even though his is very similar. \n\n\nThis is all stuff that has annoyed me in the past, but the last straw was yesterday. He has a small YouTube channel and and he posted a video going into great detail about his suicide attempts over the years. In the video he talks about it in a very upbeat tone with happy music in the background. It was honestly very disturbing. I had no idea he had ever attempted this. I've recently lost someone very close to me to a suicide and he knows this. He knows I watch his videos as I always talk to him about them and comment on them. \n\n\nI understand using a video as a way to vent out your ideas and experiences and he isn't obligated to share anything with me. But he didn't warn me of the content in the video in any way, knowing I had just lost a family member to suicide and the wound is still very fresh for me. Continuing to be his friend is now effecting my own mental health, as I went into a panic half way through the video and couldn't continue watching.\n\n\nWhenever I tell someone of the rude things he says or does they say he probably doesn't realize what he's saying is hurtful but I don't believe that. Especially because he is capable of treating his girlfriend perfectly fine. I genuinely believe he may have become more socially awkward as his issues developed, but I also believe he uses his disorders as a crutch to say and do what he wants with out consequence. \n\n\nI don't want to be friends with someone that doesn't take me and my feelings into consideration. I realize this may make me an asshole but I just can't do it anymore.\n\n\nTl;Dr \n\nMy friend who is bipolar and has depression is rude to me and does things without taking my feelings and experiences into consideration. It's taking a toll on me and I want to cut him out of my life. ",

They have known each other since they were kids and their friendship has always been closer then the average friendship. They hang out all the time and can be very touchy-feely. This had never bothered me though, even after finding out that H was gay. I never had a reason not to trust the both of them until recently. A few nights ago, my boyfriend came home and told me that H and told him that he was in love with him. He says that H did not ask him to leave me and didn’t expect anything to happen he just wanted to be “honest to the both of them”. I cannot see their friendship the same anymore and told my boyfriend that I thought he should cut H off and that the friendship made me uncomfortable now. My boyfriend got pissed and said that it was never going to happen and that H was too important to him. My boyfriend agreed that they need some time apart so H can get over his feeling but other then that nothing was going to change. He says that but ever since this happened, my BF has been withdrawn, confused, and lost in his head so it already is affecting our relationship. AITA here? ",

In the winter (Nov 15 - April 1) we have street parking restriction where you cannot leave your vehicle on the street between the hours of 2am - 6am due to street ploughing. They have neglected this rule and done just that on numerous occasions.\n\nThey park their car between our two driveways. When plough comes by at night, it has to steer to avoid their car leaving a massive windrow of snow in front of my driveway stretching out 1 m into the road. So now I am tasked with clearing my driveway and half the street if I want to make it out of my own driveway. \n\nThe local parking enforcement is useless. Next time that happens, I want to take matters into my own hands and use all the snow I cleared from the street (not my driveway) and pile it next to their car door.\n\nSide note: one time this happened last winter, as I was shoveling the damn street, the neighbor came out. Laughed at me. Got into their car (the one that was still parked on the street) and drove off. We are not on good relations.\n\nWIBTA if I just fucking bury them next time?",

      "description": "I am an early 30’s, married, Caucasian male. I work with a 30ish, engaged, Asian female. We started working at our current job at the same time, are work buddies, and I think we’re relatively close as far as co-workers go. We’ve hung out outside of work a few times, met each others significant others, and talk about our personal lives. You get the picture, friends but not best friends.\n\nSo coworker comes into my office earlier today and asks if I think another of her friends (another young Asian female that was at an event we both attended the other day) is attractive. Seeing as I’m a married guy and the question came out of nowhere, I was a little taken aback and asked why she was asking. She said the friend had been hanging out with her more and people had been asking her who her “cute friend” was and she wanted to know what I thought. I told her that I frankly didn’t even really notice her friend, but if she’ll show me a picture of her or something I’m happy to weigh in. So co-worker pulls out her phone, goes to her friend’s Facebook page, and lets me go through her friend’s photos. They’re all your super stereotypical and superficial selfies. You know the type, super made up with Snapchat filters and her head tilted to the same 10 degree angle to the right with her lips pursed. Basic selfies.\n\nSo I tell my co-worker that I could see how some people might find her conventionally attractive but she’s not particularly my cup of tea. Co-worker asks why, and here’s where I potentially was a jerk. In response, I said:\n\n“I don’t know. She just doesn’t seem genuine. Lots of make-up, 40 of the same selfie posted one after the other with nothing in between. I mean I get how someone might think she’s pretty but I don’t really get it. I’ve also personally never really been that attracted to Asian women, but hey that’s just me so I’m probably not a great judge for this.”\n\nMy co-worker immediately gets really quiet (as opposed to laughing and joking earlier), says “Oh. Ok. Got it. Well anyway thanks for weighing in.” then walks out of my office. I immediately got the sense that what started as fun office banter had gone south. I did some thinking and presumed it was probably because she took the comment as racist despite my intentions. I messaged her later and to apologize if I offended her. Her response was: \n\n“That’s your personal preference and it’s really none of my business. Plus I have someone who does find me beautiful and sees me as a person before seeing me as an Asian. So it’s all good. I did take it personally when you said it, but that’s just how the world works and I’m an adult.”\n\nI feel guilty but I’m not sure that I should. I didn’t mean to say something potentially racist and was just expressing a personal opinion after being directly asked. I have zero issues with people of any race, but I also feel like I’m allowed to have my own preferences when it comes to being attracted to women.\n\nSo what do you think Reddit? Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "So I got called into my managers office today for a serious sit down about my \"customer service skills\". Which was interesting enough. But then I found out exactly what the \"incident was\".\n\n3 days ago was remembrance day and at 11am we observe a minute silence for those who have passed. Seems like a simple enough concept.\nMy city had basically just a city wide booze fest where people just kinda hop from bar to bar getting wasted on overpriced wine and craft beers and as per usual, we were listed as one of the venues. Which is fine, I don't mind working but you always get the arseholes who come in on a Sunday because they want to get the full weekend experience. \n\nEverything was going fine, and at around quarter to I started telling customers that we would be observing the minute silence and that they wouldn't be able to order for that minute. Which everyone seemed fine with. Until we had the woman who I will call drunk fuck Jane (DFJ for short).\nI'd refused to serve DFJ as she had had a few at this point and it was 11AM IN THE GODDAMN MORNING, and she was beyond the point where I could reasonably serve her more. DFJ came up at 10:59 and started to ask for another beer. Which I refused and told her that it was nearly 11 o'clock and I'd explain why I was refusing her at 11:01. DFJ was not happy. As the clock hit 11 and the bugles played, DFJ decided she would try to be louder than the bugles and have a rather colourful complaint about how I was refusing to acknowledge her and how I was so unprofessional and discriminatory for refusing to serve her another drink, and I quote \"Because I'm a woman\". \n\nThe entire minute she was going off at me, and, because I choose to observe the minute silence, I  stayed silent, which only made her louder and more obnoxious. After the minute was over,I thanked her for waiting and explained why she was being refused. DFJ was NOT happy at this and tried to climb over the bar. I kindly asked our bouncer to escort her out of premises and thought nothing of it.\n\nUntil my boss told me I should have continued to speak to her during the minute as she was still located on our premise and therefore, our client. My hours have been cut back this week because of the incident.\n\nAITA for not serving her during the minutes silence? ",

      "description": "going to try and make this quick \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni met this friend (I'll call him R) through my friend/roommate/teammate during college. me and the original friend drifted apart and we don't talk anymore, but R and I continued to hang out a little. In the beginning he was fine, a loud person and kind of immature. I had to talk to him once because he just wouldn't stop doing anything when id ask him to stop, whether it was pushing me around or yelling, but he seemed to get a little better with that.  I owe him a little money because i threw up in his bed, which i dont mind paying back eventually, i respect him, just dont think being friends is the best thing for me anymore. but here's the thing i dont understand...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhe prides himself as a great person who helps others, which is true in some ways(helped me store some of my stuff over the summer when i went home from break and is an EMT) but in other ways he is a terrible person (has no problem using the n-word (hard r if you care) and judges most people he sees in some way when we go out (making fun of how they look, dress, etc.) , some of them even being acquaintances of mine), plus he's one of the most immature college students ive ever met in terms of how he acts when were just hanging out and don't have work to do. i'm into fashion too, and while it doesn't hurt me at all, he often calls me gay for what i wear (in a joking manner), but still why would i be friends with someone who even thinks to call someone gay as a joke. i really cant read what kind of person he is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanyways, the last day before break, he said he'd take me to the train station at 4 am (there is the nice person in him, also keep in mind i am reciprocative with favors and have helped him too), but that same night he was screaming in our house (which we share with our landlord) and was just being disrespectful to my roommate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhe texted me and dm'ed me since ive been home, but i dont know if im being an asshole by ghosting him and ending our friendship. Like i said, i dont mind still paying him back for the damage i caused when i can, which i think is reasonable. he almost definitely thinks i used him, but i find myself being annoyed more times than not when we hang out. anyways, thanks (this ended up being a lot, but theres a lot that went on between us)",

      "description": "Original post here:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/al7ftg/aita_for_refusing_to_see_my_brothers_baby/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nHi everyone,\n  So my post really opened my eyes to a lot of things. I tend to be a very stubborn, protective sister and I was realizing I was letting this get in the way of many things in my family relationships. I read a lot of good comments on that post, both expressing NTA and YTA and decided to try and meet in the middle. I met with my brother privately. I expressed to him my concerns and told him I will always love him. I offered to watch his baby if he needed time alone and apologized for being distant. I pointedly asked him if he would be with Amber if he found out the child wasn't his. He tells me no, he would feel betrayed. He told me he was terrified of the DNA test and what if the results turned out horribly? I hugged him and said no matter what happens, I'd be there. Even if he decided to stay. He said \"I want to do it. I'm tired of being afraid\". He agreed to take the test and I even paid for it. Results came in and the baby is his. The test stated \"with &gt;99.999 % accuracy\". He was so happy and relieved. He thanked me and gave me a big hug. He said he can sleep better knowing with scientific proof it's his. I apologized to him for being so headstrong about it. Everything is great and we hugged each other tightly, assuring each other we will always be family through anything.  \n\nI again made it clear I would love to visit his baby, who is a boy named Leon by the way. I meet Leon today and I am excited.\n\nThanks again for the advice.",

      "description": "I purchased a good/service from a person online in June via Paypal, and at the time they told me it would take a while and I understood and asked them to let me know when they were getting close to doing so and to update me. Months go by passively until I notice they deleted their social media accounts that I was communicating through them with. I then started to see more of their work posted, but couldn't find a source that led back to them.\n\nThat brought me to this month where I decided to try and reach out to them, sending an e-mail to the original address I sent payment to. Paypal's resolution center says you have up to 180 days to dispute a purchase, which would have been the end of December. I sent a formal e-mail to the seller asking for an explanation, and also stating that at this point I'd like a refund.\n\nThey contact me through another account on social media and tell me they had a slight complication that meant they had to delete their accounts, but forgot to tell me about it and apologized. Furthermore, they told me they could file a refund possibly, but they needed the money for a down payment on a home. They also told me the situation had left them unmotivated to continue their work, but didn't have the money as is for the payment in January.\n\nThey told me they could send the money as a separate payment in the future, though that would mean from January on, it would be up to them and their good faith to give me money back, and I couldn't dispute it with Paypal anymore. I explained them my thoughts and the seller went ahead and instantly refunded me the money, leaving me a brief, 3 word, cold note in the Paypal transaction note.\n\nI feel bad about ask for my money back because they expressed they may have been tight on money, but at that point they said and showed no real desire to complete my purchase, but instead wanted to use the money for a down payment on her home, am I the asshole for asking for my money back?",

      "description": "Couldn’t figure out a good way to write the title, but let me explain. I was at a restaurant with two bathrooms: one for men and one for women. They were both the type of bathroom that only has one toilet and is meant for one person at a time. Anyway, both bathrooms were occupied and one girl was waiting to go (I’m a guy). As I walked up to the bathrooms, the person in the men’s bathroom walked out, so I immediately walked in even and used it, even though the girl was waiting. After locking the door, I think she started yelling at me for cutting her? It was really loud in the restaurant, so I couldn’t tell for sure.\n\nAITA? \n\nOn one hand, it was technically the men’s bathroom... and since she is a girl and I’m a guy, and no other guys were waiting, it was my right to use it. But on the other hand, since it was a single-occupant bathroom, there was no reason that she couldn’t use it, even though it was marked for guys.",

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst post here! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother and I basically grew up together (my parents split up so I had to babysit him a lot as a kid). When we were growing up, my mom essentially had us share everything together from rooms, toys, books etc. Now as an 8 year old kid, that ticked me off but I didn't really have a say because it was just the two of us most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to him growing up as a teenager, he went through the whole angsty teenage phase where he demanded nothing but privacy and space (we still shared a room at this point) so I was just do my best to ignore him and go about my business. I didn't ask him where he was if he was out past curfew, I didn't tell on him when he snuck girls in our room, I literally just minded my own business. During this teenage phase, he developed a temper as well as severe depression and attachment issues with girls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom did her best. She drove him to therapists on a weekly basis, would not pry into his life like he asked (he was 17 and I was up to my eyeballs in his bs but couldn't say anything). However, when he would get into an argument or break up with a girl, he would threaten to hurt himself in front of others triggering them to call the police. That meant a trip to the hospital. And that meant that my mom would come running to me begging for me to drive her to these hospitals (she doesn't drive well in the city or in long distances). This meant that I had to take time off work, drive her back and forth the hospital and wait for him to come home. This happened twice his senior year high school. I was engaged and living with my fiance at the time, so he helped out when he could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first two times I cried and begged for him to open up to me, so that I can help. I was where he was at before, literally. I picked up him from the same hospitals cops took me to when I was suicidal at his age. I pleaded that he at least gave me a call if he needed it. Or to call my fiance if he needed a male to talk to. Nothing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a while he got better, got into college and my family and I helped him move into his dorm room. You couldn't believe at how excited I was. He cried when we left and I told him I was so so so proud of him and have fun while he could. Now he's not the texting type, but I'd always try and see how he was doing (mostly ignored texts) and to send him the occasional picture of my cat. I would even visit him on weekends too, just to take him out to dinner (the school's food sucks) and meet his friends. His close friend mentioned that my brother was all over the place and has never seen this kind of energy from anyone before. This was when I started suspecting something more than just depression running in the family. My brother would randomly go off on random rants and I thought he was just being the philosophical bratty 18 year old but then he would go off saying, \"I don't care what anybody thinks about me, I'm smarter and better than most people anyway.\" Uh, okay dude. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree months later, I get a call from my mom saying that he's back at the hospital. Apparently he had broken up with his high school sweetheart and since the school didn't offer weekly counseling he didn't know how to cope and threatened to kill himself. Again. So there I was to the rescue, again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I had just started a new job and I didn't want to mess up. My mom told me what the address of the hospital was and it was a two hour drive from her home and she begged me to take her. Of course I went. But this time was different. He constantly ignored me and told off my mom saying that he was an adult and he could/would handle things himself. I stayed in the car while she visited him, and she comes running back out saying that he wanted to see me. Honestly, I didn't want to. This was the third hospital visit I'd had to do in a year, and it was just really messing me up. At this point, I was just asking myself, \"What's it gonna take?\" I walked to the visitor area and he was just sitting there, drugged up. While my mom cried and begged him to get help. I offered to take him to the doctors or pay for  transportation to get him to where he needed to be all he had to do was meet me halfway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days later, he gets out of the hospital and my mom asks if I can take time off work (again) to pick him and to drive him back to school (literally an 8 hour drive). I told her I couldn't do that because I was exhausted and needed to rest. He got upset and shot a snarky comment at me, \"it's that big of a deal why couldn't you take me? so, *no one* can take me back to school\" No, dude I'm tired. My mom paid for his bus ticket to go home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward another two days, my brother tells us that the last hospital visit, cops show up at his dorm room to search him stuff and find a baton in his things. I asked him, \"Why would you bring a weapon  to school????\" His reply, \"idk I forgot about it.\" He gets suspended from school and is banned from the grounds and he and my mom are asking me to help him move out of his dorm room. On Christmas Eve. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I'm fed up. I tried to be emotionally supportive, I put my career on the line so that he'd get help but it's just a never ending pattern. He'd break up with a girl, decide he can't cope anymore and I have to pick up the pieces of all this. I told my mom he ruined Christmas and she got mad at me and said that nobody's perfect so I shouldn't look down on someone like him. I told her that I knew where he was coming from and I've hit bottom before but the way he tries to get attention only sets him back further and further. He refuses to make doctor's appointments (he'd rather my mom do it), he doesn't want to drive his own car (he doesn't have a job so he doesn't want to spend his money). But he'll spend all day in my apartment using up my internet and watching YouTube or playing video games all day. He'll get upset if I question him, and in his words, \"You're making a bigger deal out of this.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter I helped him move out of his dorm I told my mom, \"I'm not doing this shit again.\" She goes, \"Please don't give up on him.\" I didn't say anything back. Now he's been living in my apartment rent free for three months (he can't seem to get a job anywhere now) and is back to using up my internet and started stealing small things from my drawers. I noticed because he kept a card from one of my poker decks in his phone case, \"because he liked the card.\" Normally I wouldn't say anything but I was irritated and said, \"well...you know how I feel about people touching my things without asking me. Please give it back.\"\n\nHim: Why, I like the card.\n\nMe: it's not about the card dude it's about the principal. If you wanted it, you could've asked me.\n\nHim: But you don't use this card everyday. \n\nMe: Like I said, that's not the point, I just don't want you taking my stuff without my permission.\n\nHim: \\*rolls eyes\\* you're making a big deal over this.\n\nMe: I am..having a normal conversation with you, just give it back please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe doesn't give it back. So now, I avoid him at all costs. I come home late and I don't talk to him when we're in the same room. I just don't feel good about someone who I felt like I trusted take advantage of me. I told mom that I wasn't going to deal with this and I was kicking him out if he kept acting so entitled to everything I had/owned. I don't ever ask anything from him. I just want him to be okay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for cutting my brother off?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Brother &amp; I grew up with has anger issues, gets kicked out school. Big sister to the rescue most of his life. Brother lives with sister rent free and starts taking little knick knacks from me after years of being pushed out of his life. Only talks to me when he needs something from me. Sister decides to cut him off. AITA?**",

      "description": "So a couple of really good friends got engaged recently. I was asked to be one of the groomsmen, and I happily agreed. However that happiness as waned of late.\n\nAs they have been planning the wedding, I've noticed that the cost has been spiraling out of control, a cost that I doubt they are able to afford. Now that usually wouldn't concern me. It is their wedding, their business. However, that cost is now starting to effect those of us in the wedding party. Their engagement party was at a chalet and we had to spend the weekend there, so that cost. Then they have planned a weekend away nearer to the wedding, a kind of stag and doe trip, and we've already booked and paid a deposit, so that is another cost.\n\nThe final straw was this weekend, when we were discussing suits. The groom has decided that we are getting suits made from a Made To Measure boutique that he knows. The problem is the suit is going to cost about $1000. Each. That is way more than I am willing to pay for a single suit. I suggested that we go to a place where we can get designer suits off the rack and have them tailored and it would save us a few hundred each and we would still all look great. But no. It had to be this.\n\nSo I made the decision that I couldn't really being their wedding party and keep paying. I told my sister that I am going to tell them that while I appreciate them involving me in their wedding, I don't think I can be involved. To which she told me that I would look like the bad guy here because I had already accepted being in their party. The ironic part is that ultimately I can afford to do these things more than the others. I am doing alright financially, but I don't want to keep paying. I'm doing well because I look after my money and don't want to blow it all.\n\nSo would I be the asshole in bowing out of the wedding party at this stage? Is there a way of getting out without looking like one?",

      "description": "This kid, let's call him Joe, agrees to play video games with me at 3:20. Joe and I get home from school at around 3:00. Then, right on 3:20 I send him a message asking if he's ready to play.\n\nI wait until 3:25, with no response. So I decide to go and play a different game by myself. Half and hour later, I check my messages and find some irritated messages from Joe. At 3:26, one minute after I left to play a different game, he messaged saying he was ready. I, of course, was playing a different game and did not check those messages.\n\nThe next day when I see Joe at school, he asks me why I didn't play with him, so I explain that I waited for him but he didn't show up. Joe then says that he was walking his dog and didn't see the message. \n\nAITA? I know I didn't wait very long, but should I have waited longer?",

      "description": "A little background: I work for my mother and father-in-law. I live with them 700 miles away from my wife(married 3 years) while I finish college (I stopped going for a while and finally decided to finish). They run their own business and therefore it needs to be open almost all business days except major holidays. During this last school year I worked in the office Monday, Wednesday, Friday full day and Tuesday/Thursday afternoon. They average maybe 18 hours in office each during the school year because they know I’ll cover the office. They could have visited my wife any given weekend for 4 days max. Now that school is in break they decided to go visit her (understandable) and ask me to cover the office until they get back (cool, I visited during Christmas and they’d stay an extra week). What aggravated me was when I had already been back they then called me and said they were thinking of staying another 6 days and I should be able to handle the office. I can handle the office but now is the only time I’ll have until spring break to visit her. I tell them this and they say they’re going out of town on my spring break for vacation so I’ll need to cover the office then too. Now I’m beyond pissed and I tell them they’re cutting into my time with my wife because they want to use me for their own extended vacation. My wife hears about it from my mother in law and gets mad at me and says I just have 5 more months of this until I graduate. That shouldn’t be the point and I told her she never just sides with me.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

For example, she is utterly convinced that Lady Gaga is cyberstalking her to steal her \"art\" (she cuts the heads off barbie dolls + poses them for photos) and posts about it weekly.\n\nAnyway, she posted something yesterday about how transgender people deserve equal rights. I responded with support, saying the following:\n\"I support human rights. One of which is freedom to do what you want without hurting other people. I might not understand firsthand the life experiences of furries, trans, gay etc but as humans everyone deserves the same opportunities for happiness.\"\n\nShe immediately was offended, and started ranting about how my comment was 'pigeon holing her into a feeling of other-ness because I marginalized her struggles'. I explained that she's creating her own feelings of 'otherness' when she finds herself starting arguments with people being supportive, and that she needs to check her perspective if she's going to be 'millennial triggered' by what I said. Pretty sure I'm not the asshole this time, right? ",

      "description": "I'm sorry, guys, I don't think there's a tl;dr for this one. Basically, he willing set up a handful of mfm threesomes about 4-5 years ago; our initial plan for equal fun was to also find an fmf threesome, and we've failed. They don't call them unicorns for no reason.\n\nSo, his current expectation is that logically, he's owed, and it's much easier for him to get his if he just has sex with a girl rather than having her with us both, as we'd done in the past. Granted, this is a year or so after I let him go bang a hooker to get this out of his system, apparently wasn't good enough.\n\nA couple of months ago, he starts pushing to be able to try with a girl at work, initially with us, eventually just by themselves. A few drunk fights ensue, we stalemate because I don't find it okay that he has a one-on-one encounter unless I'm trusted with the same freedom, which has NEVER been okay to him. Last night I found out that the hard flirting had begun a week ago, he's spending extra time drinking with her after work (not alone, but still) and not telling me, she's saying shit like wanting to take him to a concert, and then, \"should we *shake emoji* on it or *kiss emoji* on it?\" He claims he hasn't cheated in any way, just flirted and talked so far, just that he has every right to \"get his too\" and then cut it off with her. He went as far as to tell her we \"have fun\" sometimes in this sense, but we've never touched anyone else without both of us present.\n\nAITA for thinking this isn't right, that there's so much more wrong with a private duo building up to sex for weeks than bringing his trusted buddy in for one night? For wishing he'd have clearly said, sober, \"YES, I am going to for sure try to fuck this girl,\" before starting to cross lines conversationally with her to initiate? For it to be strictly one-sided while he's out and I'm at home with our kids? For feeling like it's incredibly insensitive to do this with a girl he works with, given that A.) she knows who I and his kids are, B.) ALL the employees know who we are, and C.) that he has to see her regularly no matter what, that he can't really disconnect when he breaks it off?\n\nHonestly, just to clarify, the one thing I don't need to be told is the best course of action for the relationship. Any woman with a shred of dignity would leave and find someone who wouldn't put her through any of this, I know. I've treated him like a king most of this relationship. I really need to know if my feelings on this actually deserve his indifference or not based on what's happened, for myself.",

      "description": "I have a friend that has stood by me for 15 years and, more recently, has called me his \"brother\" after having moved in with him after ending an 8 year relationship. All too often little things I ask seem to be major inconveniences to him, and I'm sick of being treated as though I'm just here to make him look like some kind of god.\nIt begins with me being interested in a girl that he recently decided he has \"fallen in love with.\" He had his sights set on her friend and then decided he \"didnt realize she had such a great body\", when things had fallen through with his initial interest. Despite me knowing that I wasnt doing the most to try to keep in contact with this girl, I'm upset that he had no problem swooping in and trying to get her attention; meanwhile he talks about another girl he would have liked to date but couldnt do it to his other \"brother\",whom he has known for maybe 5 years, because he was interested in her. \nThe other \"brother\" is someone he has gone to bars and also done coke with; whereas I spent many summers living at his parents house while growing up and been considered a member of his family. Maybe its jealousy, but it feels more to me that I'm just a fallback most of the time.\nMy friend always makes it out like little things are the biggest inconveniences for him, and I'm sick of asking small things of him, only to feel resented or that it's the worst things he's ever had asked of him. \nSince I've moved in with him I've made our home a place that he wouldnt be embarrassed about inviting girls to, and never asked for much (if anything) in return. Now I'm contemplating leaving him with rent that he would tell everyone else he has no problem making, partially because I know that not being on the lease means that there could never be any legal repercussions for doing so, but also as a \"dont take me for granted\" message. To make it more difficult, he got me a job with his uncle where I'm making more money than I have at any previous job. I am sure it wouldnt go well at work afterword, but I'm at a point where I couldnt give less of a fuck about what he thinks of me.\nI'm ready to be respected, but I'm not getting any level of respect from this friend.\nTLDR: my friend/roommate has no respect for me and I'm not on the lease at our place. Should I feel bad about wanting to move out?",

We talked things out, fast-forward and we're happily married.\n\nThree years into our marriage, she joins an art group online. So far so good, she's always practicing and her work is amazing. Really proud of it. Bought her a new tablet and whatnot.\n\nThen I notice she starts closing the Skype chat whenever I enter the room. Weird, huh? I don't confront her.\n\nWeeks go by of this, and eventually I start waking up in the middle of the night only to find her sitting right next to me, tapping away on her phone. I'm visibly upset and when I mention she should sleep, she gets offended as she had nothing to do the next day (she was unemployed for a very long time, but it wasn't an issue since I was supporting both of us).\n\nA few days later, I see her phone light up as she's sleeping. I grab it and forward the entire WhatsApp conversation to my e-mail. Lo and behold, they were flirting. Nothing past that (in the logs), but heavy flirting to the point she was pestering him to say he liked her. Now, I've never done something like this before and only did it because of what I said regarding the break up. I saw the same thing happening again and had to be sure.\n\nI woke her up and while never admitting to reading her conversation, we had a very long talk. I asked her several times if she liked him and/or if they had something going on, to which she denied vehemently until eventually she broke and admitted to it. We talked some more, she begged me not to divorce her -- which I accepted.\n\nAm I The Asshole?",

      "description": "My workplace is trying out some new initiative in the name of camaraderie or teambuilding or whatever where we have to give each other heartfelt ideally handmade (lol) gifts. They're hoping it will boost morale. It doesn't. Knick knacks and itchy sweaters (which are against uniform code in the first place...) don't change a damn thing.\n\nAnyways today was my turn and I was supposed to get something for my coworker but I forgot all about it so I bounced on my break for a last minute gift. I couldn't think of anything he'd want so I just ended up picking up a pie from the food truck outside lol. I showed my boss to get his approval but we found out it a was a pretty nasty pie. Like. Disgusting this is going to destroy you from the inside out if you even go anywhere near it kinda pie like RIP your insides. We left it unattended while we were talking about what to do about it but my coworker ate it ALL before we could warn him.\n\nI didn't mean anything bad by it nor did I have any malicious intent. He's not my favorite person to work with but it's not like I'd wish food poisoning on him or anything else but this is pretty fucked up and I feel really bad about it. I was planning on at the very least trying to make it up to him by spending the day with him doing whatever he wants if that will help\n\nSo reddit AITA? My boss is convinced that I am. He thinks it was really awful of me to do this after he knitted me not one but two sweaters for his gifts. Anyways please respond asap because he blows up at sunset so I don't have much time to waste thanks",

He is almost completely silent whenever hes here which worries me that he might have poor social skills. I was tired of him being on the PC for over 7 hours nonstop, so I shouted at him to stop, he didn't. I then made a huge fuss out of him playing too much, he responded and easily beated me in the argument from that point I stopped caring.\n\nEventually my mom also said that shes angry over that. He has good grades, and if theres an exam coming he would often study for 3-5 hours. He can control it for important times but other times, rarely. \n\nAnother thing is that he isn't obsessed with computer language etc, hes obsessed with games or gaming in general.\n\nI started a long argument about his addiction, in which I won, he rarely plays now but has been showing signs of stress and even depression.

My fiance however is less than thrilled and it trying to get me to not get the surgery. He says I don't need it and this it's a stupid unnecessary risk. He gets really heated about this, but I feel like I almost need this surgery. My family all has a history of being overweight and dying young, I already have heart problems (unrelated to weight, just a shitty ticker) and any stress off of it is a win for me. This would also really help my mental health as most of it stems around my weight. This is causing a lot of turbulence amongst our relationship and I'm thinking of backing out of the surgery so it will stop. I'm beginning to feel like I'm in the wrong for putting myself through this, but I've tried diet and exercise, it just doesnt work. He wouldn't pay for anything for the surgery or even have to take care of me after. So reddit, WIBTA?\n\nTL;DR: Have a chance to get a life changing surgery, fiance doesnt want me to. Thinking of backing out because it's causing so many problems.",

I knew the pen was actually from one of my GF's best friends as a gift to me. (Its complicated I know). \nSo I took a photo of the pen and sent it on snapchat to my GF's Bestfriend and just said thanks. Well somehow my ex found out and is flipping out on me over this stupid pen. Saying I'm just a dirty liar and sore loser who cant get over her. \nAITA??\n\nAll of this over a dumb ass russian pen. ",

      "description": "So about 3 months ago now I let my friend borrow my backpack to take home some books I let her borrow. The books were a gift to me but she seemed interested in reading them so I let her.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks, I'm at their flat to help them clean it for an inspection and I find one book open and bent to hell under a pile of dirty clothes and rubbish. She sees me straightening the pages but she says nothing so I just keep quiet too. I was pretty pissed off, my boyfriend had just bought me that. I don't see any of my other stuff though which is worrying seeing as I helped clean her whole damn flat.\n\nI let it go for the time being but after a month I really need my stuff back, (it's my biggest backpack and I can't afford another one right now.) so I messaged her through facebook asking if we could meet up so I can get them back, she agrees but cancels last minute. So I message her a week later and she does the same thing again. I'm getting pretty sick of asking by this point but she's my only friend and we've known eachother for 10 years so I certainly don't want to argue over this. Few days later I ask again, this time she replies being really short with me saying that she's pregnant and and tired and doesn't have the energy to be running round for a bag and some books. Okay, I get I'm annoying and pestering her at this point which I hate, but I really need my shit back, so I message her again and say I can just come over and she can throw my shit out the window if she doesn't want to come downstairs. In the end she offered to send her boyfriend to meet me amd give me them back but I was busy that whole week and couldn't, (which she knew). Its been months now and I just stopped asking because I feel like I'm being annoying, I know shes preggs and tired but its my stuff.\n\nI've seen her a couple of times since all this and she just doesn't bring it up, she's been to mine but she didn't bring my stuff. I've been to hers and she never said a word. I didn't want to bring it up and put her on the spot, I'm so scared of pestering her incase it turns into an argument, which isn't unlikely as she was really short when I was persistent with her. \n\nWill I be an asshole if I keep asking her? I'd never be short or rude about it with her, but I get that persistently pestering someone can get annoying, especially as she's pregnant and ill. ",

He came to the UK with his parents when he was a teenager and he never really liked it here. I get that. He didn't come here voluntarily but because his parents didn't see any other way out of poverty.\nHe finished school here and is a really smart guy in general but he never really did anything but work in retail. He hates it but he doesn't want to change anything. On really bad days he tells me we're going to move to Albania, he can't do this any longer. Ever since dating he told me it's his wish to go back home someday. I accepted that and I told him \"if you can make a living there and a safe home for us we can go.\" however, he has no plan, no funds and we would live in poverty without access to welfare or anything. So I refuse, he gets upset and tells me he never wanted all of this to begin with. I feel sad knowing the kids and I are the reason for his unhappiness. I just don't see a future there because he has no qualifications, no university degree to build on. \nSeing him sad breaks me heart because I really love him. He's a great dad to our boys  and a good husband but deep down I know he won't ever be happy here. \nHis depression or home sickness has gotten so bad whenever something bad happens he blames it on the UK. Like, literally anything.  Someone accidently pushed him on the crowded train? - Damn English people. The kids are ill and I take them to the doctor, he prescribes them medication - damn doctors here  only want to make money off ill children.  When he was a kid he only got to drink the medicine his grandma made out of herbs and it helped...and so on. It's gotten to a point where it offends me on a personal level. I grew up perfectly fine here and so will our kids but he's so obsessed with the idea how in Albania everything is better. We live in a safe area, lots of families, nature and we live in a nice flat. Yet he just sees the negative. \nMaybe he is right and I am just arrogant and selfish?? ",

      "description": "Backstory: friend and I have both had rough years for very separate reasons. I’ve been back in therapy to cope with anxiety, and she just started a new career as a social worker. \n\nShe’s only been in role a few months, but I think compassion fatigue is hitting hard. She’s grown increasingly negative and combative. Nothing makes her happy, and with my current state of anxiety, it feels like my fault - I give in, back off, or shut up when there’s the least amount of tension. \n\nShe’s also been making an increasingly bad series of life decisions. Started by deciding to hook up with her roommate - another close friend - and then getting disgusted and lashing out at him when he caught feelings, even though she suggested dating. That blew up and ruined a friendship, leaving him broken-hearted. \n\nThen she secretly started hooking up with my best friend and chose to hide it from me. Without knowing what was up, when they both stopped returning my calls, my anxiety went wild and assumed they both hated me because I was too hard to deal with. When I found out they were sneaking around behind everybody’s back, I confronted them both for hurting people. Keep in mind, this point, she still hadn’t dealt with the roommate - and now she was pulling the exact same move with someone else, hurting me in the process and asking others to lie for them. \n\nThis is when I was labeled an asshole. I was told “this doesn’t involve you” and she refused to hear when I said my piece. The guy heard me out, admitted he put me in a bad place (because I’ve also been expected to lie to the roommate to cover for her), and we’re fine. \n\nI was told to give her space, and did. Now she’s upset that I’m “blocking her out” and spending time with “her” friends. I was also told by another friend that it was my responsibility to fix it because she won’t.\n\nThat didn’t seem fair, but I tried to reach out on a healthy basis and explained that I haven’t been avoiding her, but I needed the space too. This apparently wasn’t acceptable and now she wants a sit down to hash it all out. \n\nI’m pretty sure I’m not the asshole. Like 99%. But I don’t know how to approach this conversation with someone who so clearly believes that I am. So Reddit, help me out - am I the asshole? If so, where do I fix things? If not, how do I approach this?",

Recently people have been distracted with food drinks and other stuff during service \n\nSo yesterday was any other Wednesday I was having fun eating pizza and talking to my friends before service now one of my friends likes to stock up on soda before service starts (cause some kids are vultures) and during service he gave me a can of soda, now I couldn’t open it then because your not aloud to.\nSo fast forward to prayer before we sang worship songs \nI had the soda in between my legs to hold it while I prayed, with that in mind while I adjusted myself in my seat the soda fell to the floor \n[soda opening noise] and then proceeded to leak with a little bit of power so it still made a sizzling like noise for a little bit. So I grabbed a paper towel and pressed it to the can to stop it from leaking and fast walked to the bathroom to let it leak while the other leaders gave me dirty looks. So after worship was over we went to small groups and the leader said (while looking me dead in the eye) “because of some people we are the only group in the many years I’ve been here that can’t bring drinks or food into service”. Then my one friend who gave me the drink said “ great job ruining it for everybody \n\nSo AITA here or is NTA\n ",

      "description": "**Backstory**:\n\nMy wife died in a hit-and-run accident when my son and daughter was about 4 (they are twin brothers and sisters, pigeon pair as some would say). She did not have life-insurance, and I did not get any financial support from her family because they pretty much are all dead or very poor. I am a only child, and my family has kind of a tradition for having only child (I think I am the first one to break it). Being so, I don't have any cousins and my father died last year, he donated all of his estate before he died. Basically no financial support from my family either. Although I do earn a good salary, ever since my wife died I have to drop my position and switch to a lower position to take care of the kids. The pay on the lower position is absolutely crap, but my boss recognised my talent and said that he would grant me a swift promotion if I can spare the time.\n\n**Story**:\n\nMy son and daughter are equally bright, but for some reason my son is very mature early on and recognised the importance of studying. Ever since middle school, my son has consistently gotten top grades for all subjects, and got the \"dux\" award (basically top student in school academically) in both middle and high school. Got 1580 on the SATs, 800 on three SAT subject tests and 42/42 on IB\\*. (Basically, excels academically) On top of that, he also does competitive programming, tennis and also math Olympiad, scoring very good placings in competitions. He also does a lot of volunteering stuff in school. \n\nMy daughter, on the other hand, is the average kid. Above average in academics, plays tennis, and goes out with friends on the weekends. Compared to my son, she got 1480 on the SAT (good score), didn't do subject tests and 37/42 in IB. I accepted this because I frankly don't have the time to push her around too much. Just like her brother (my son), she does her fair share of extra-curriculars and volunteering, though she never participates in competitions.\n\n**The dileema**:\n\nNow is the time for university applications for my son, and I face a very difficult dilemma. My daughter and son are planning to apply to universities right now. My son's dream school is Stanford in the U.S, as he wants to major in CS . My daughter wants to aim at Rice, and wants to major in Biology, but due to being international students, I roughly still have to pay the same amount. Because of all the years of working at a lower paying job, I never really saved up much. I calculated and basically I could only afford one to go to a U.S university, the other one either has to go to a local one, where he/she can take a student loan, or a cheaper overseas university. I haven't told my children yet, but if I had to make a choice like this, I obviously wouldn't not pay for either just for the sake of equality. I would prefer to pay for my son's university tuition and convince my daughter to attend a local university. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "So just as some context, I'm in ballet, and earlier in the day my mom was trying to stretch my feet. I was getting a bit frustrated because it felt like it was hurting me more than stretching. Then later she was making my sister study so much that she threw her phone and told my mom she was done.\nSo on to the actual story. I just got home from helping my dad get groceries, and my mom tells us that there's this new dance called the Triangle dance, and that she, my sister, and I all had to do it together. I said I didn't want to, but she proceeded to teach me how to do it anyway. Once she was finished I told her again that I didn't want to do it, and walked away to do my homework on our computer. She then told me I wasn't aloud to use it, even though I told her what I was doing. She then started talking to my dad, saying things like \"I don't even know why we had kids, they're all being jerks.\" (A.k.a. the \"I wish you were never born\" card). So I got up to go to my room, but she told me I couldn't go there either. Then she decided she was going to do it with my dad and sister, but she wanted do do it where I couldn't see so I couldn't see \"how much fun they were having.\" Annoyed, I went to the laundry room instead to clean out my backpack. After they're out in the living room practicing the dance for a while, my mom comes into the laundry room to talk to me, basically telling me that I was being selfish for not considering her feelings, and how she thought it would be fun. But she wasn't considering how I might've felt about it. So she goes back out and they start dancing again like nothing happened, and she comes back over to me to talk some more. She starts asking me if we're going to just be enemies until I graduate because I wouldn't do this dance with her. She goes back out again, and by then everyone was tired so they're all on their phones. My mom then says \"hey, this dance is on TikTok! Ha, CC doesn't know it!\" Which I'm sure she said to try and make me feel bad, as I'm an avid TikToker. Later in the night we started talking about it again, and even though I told her I didn't feel like dancing regardless of what had happened earlier in the day, she disagreed like she knew me better than I do. \nIt's been a couple weeks since that happened, and one night my sister was talking about how in her class she saw some people doing the dance. My mom then threw that in my face like I'm still supposed to care. \n\nSo, am I the one in the wrong here?",

      "description": "I’m on mobile. Formatting. Etc.\n\nAt the beginning of this semester I moved into a new apartment owned by my university. When I applied to live here I wasn’t told that there would be frequent construction going on in the complex as well as our apartment. The apartment is in really good shape and i don’t really have any issues with it. Currently the only thing needing to be fixed is a huge square hole they cut in our ceiling. It’s been there since the beginning of February and they have yet to do anything with it.\n      As soon as the semester started we began receiving papers saying that our apartment could be entered between 9 am and 5 pm for a full month. I was frustrated with the first one but figured I couldn’t do much about it. At the end of that month we received another of these letters. I feel like giving staff the ability to enter an apartment at anytime is intrusive. I’m constantly on edge about being able to shower during the day because what if I step into my room to find a staff member? I can’t even take a short nap between school work because half the time I’m woken up by someone needing to work on the apartment. \n       I feel like I live in a constant state of being prepared for someone to enter my room. I can’t relax until after 5 pm. My roommates and I keep a tidy apartment so we don’t have an issue with receiving a citation for cleanliness. I have an anxiety disorder and i feel like this constant stress is making it harder on me to be a functioning person. I feel like I don’t have my own space because of this. I also feel like a have almost no privacy.\n       I just need to know if I’m being an asshole about this.  I would like to complain to my university housing department but maybe I’m just being way too sensitive. I understand that sometimes things need to be fixed but currently our apartment is fine and livable. Summer is approaching and we are being kicked out for further improvements to the apartment. I don’t understand why these issues they see can’t wait until then. ",

      "description": "So I am part of a newly blended family. My father married my step mother 3 years ago and as such, we are celebrating Thanksgiving together. I \\[23F\\] and my sister \\[28F\\] have inherited two new step siblings \\[29M\\] \\[32F\\] whom are both married and one of which who has kids. I am the only one who lives in state. So everyone is traveling to our parents house for Thanksgiving. However, my sister and I have just been told that our aunt (our deceased mother's only sibling) and our grandmother (my father's mother) are not invited to Thanksgiving dinner. \n\nMy sister and I obviously flipped out a bit since we have spent almost every Thanksgiving and Christmas with them. My dad has been playing mediator with my stepmother and my sister &amp; I. He says that her vision for Thanksgiving is one with only the \"core family\". This comes from her tumultuous relationships with her two kids, that has finally now calmed down a bit. We've been told that our aunt and grandma can come to the house after my stepmother's kids leave on Friday and that we would have another dinner. That doesn't seem good enough for me. So my sister and I have come to the agreement that if they are excluded that we would not attend Thanksgiving with them and instead have Thanksgiving with our aunt and grandmother instead. So WIBTA for boycotting dinner with my stepmother?",

      "description": "I had mentioned to a friend (steve) that I would be in his town for an event a week beforehand. I suggested that we just get coffee since I couldn't be there long, as I had to drive 8 hours to get back home. Steve said \"ok sounds good\", and we left it at that, I figured we could make plans a little closer to the time. The day before, I texted Steve \"Hey I'll be coming into your town for coffee tomorrow, when are you able to meet?\" and his response was \n\"Oh I'll be with my grandparents all day\", so I responded by telling him ok, I won't be coming through, a little bummed. Steve said\n  \"I didn't think you were serious when you brought it up the first time because you made it seem so casual\". \nI asked if I SHOULD visit then, but Steve kept saying that it was out of the way to see him, that it was strange I would do this, don't bother, even though I had no problem with driving extra; Steve's my friend. \nI apologized for not communicating better and that I should've talked to him earlier, and that I would work on making better plans, but I never heard from him again. We haven't talked in weeks and he has ghosted me on every social media platform since. I texted him for his birthday and got left on read. Was this really poor communication on my part? Am I the asshole for making it seem too casual? ",

      "description": "I've been living at my flat now for close to 5 years, and as part of the rent, I get my own parking space. However, a while back, someone started repeatedly parking in my parking space without ever asking whether it was OK with me. I went to them with my landlord over this twice, and it seemed that they got the message. As part of this conversation, it turns out that they have their own parking space, which is not in the bay that my parking space is in but they don't want to use it since apparently they had issues with their car when it was out of their direct sight.\n\nHowever, after this situation, they started parking in such a way that it overlapped into my space (to varying degrees); As a result, I left notes on their car windshield, letting them know that they were overlapping into my space. I didn't use threats or anything overly aggressive. As things went on, I was immature by flipping off their house when I went past it - never directly to the residents of the place, but still not cool of me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a period where I stopped putting the notes in their windshield, but the issue got to me again late last week, so I put a couple of additional notes in their windshield, with the most recent one saying that it was offensive and disrespectful of them to first use my space without asking, and then to constantly overlap it, despite there being clear markings as to where one parking space begins and another one ends. As I was leaving the building where my flat is the other day, the woman of the house saw me and, amongst other things, said that I was unbelievable and that she's never met anyone like me and so on. She also said that she didn't appreciate the letters, and I responded that I didn't like her parking over my space. I walked away while saying \"Morning to you too.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA here? I saw this whole ordeal as a matter of principle, rather than whether or not I have a car or not.",

I was heartbroken because of that but not for long because 2 weeks later i work as a technician in a promotion and i meet Girl 1 ( the main character here) and we both fall in love at first sight .\n\nWe were together for 1,5 year until i got a minor STD. I go to a doctor that assures me that my girlfriend is cheating on me . After that i begin to not trust her anymore.She swears in everything that she hasn't done anything with anyone but still i was not sure and even though i stayed with her for 2 months never was the same.Anyhow she breaks up with me and i almost felt into depression .'Funny thing \" i went to a second doctor at that time to get a second opinion and told me something completely different.That this STD could be inactive in a woman for more that 2 years and that meant that she was probably right and i was wrong. \n\nI tried to get her back for almost 1 month until she agrees to meet me for a coffee.We get there and she was distant and cold.She told me that i should have trust her i agree with that.I was worried though that she was so cold so i asked what is going on and she tells me that she slept with someone else.I was upset and left not answering her messages for a week until she stopped.\n\n**10 years later** \n\nNo more that a few happy birthday SMS all this time.She gets FB account and i have a friend request from her.Nothing more than  smalltalk for 3 months until she starts talking more and more about us and what a good time we had and what a fool she was to left me .A few days later she announces me that she took a seminar job (she is a dancer ) in my island hoping that we would meet and catch up .I had a really hard time getting over her so i wasn't willing to meet up  since i knew our chemistry would overpower my brain easily. I declined her suggestions to meet and then i go to camping trip in a remote beach to fish and get her out of my head.That didn't happen though because we kept talking and ended up  telling her where i am  and she just took the last bus to come and find me.The bus stops like 30km away and she hitchhiked the rest of the way to the beach.I was astonished and flattered.She really wanted to see me..\n\nThings escalated quickly and we hit it of once again like nothing had happened.She finished her seminar after 2 weeks and stays with me for 1 week .While talking she said that she was sorry about the way we broke up but  i should have tried more.I explain that i tried until i learned that she had slept with someone else.Says sorry multiple times and i have no bad feeling about it ,it has been 10 years since then.Everything was like the first time.\n\nShe left and went back home to the capital while i stayed in my hometown since i had jobs planned for the next 10 days.After that i was going to meet her and stay together for 2 weeks before i returned.We were talking through skype every night until we went to sleep and planning what we were gonna do while i was there,planning what shall we do to the future.Until 3 nights before i travel to find her she disappears.Called her twice no answer . Next day she calls me and something felt off.She admits that she slept with another guy and says that it just happened. I cancel my trip and after a while i stopped talking to her.We never said we are a couple the second time still i felt horrible once again and couldn't continue talking to her .\n\nAm i an ass here? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I've invited a bunch of my friends and my brother out and said they're welcome to bring their partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediately after sending the invites I receive a text from my brother asking if I'll invite Betsy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a rerun of a conversation we had last year, where I essentially said no, I won't invite her. He kept asking and I held my ground. They're not technically dating, despite him clearly being crazy over her. He's over there most evenings but this has now been going on for years and they'll briefly date then break up because they're a terrible couple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy reasons for not wanting her there are multiple, we'll start with those not relating directly to my brother:\n\n\\- She propositioned one my brother's best mates (who I'm also friends with, we'll call her Flange) boyfriends on a night out. Flange was on holiday, so she'd never know was her argument. The boyfriend turned her down and told Flange. Betsy has given me two different stories on this and has reason to lie, so I believe the boyfriend who is a decent guy and adores Flange.\n\n\\- She slept with (another) one of my brothers other best friends (again, who I'm friends with) while she had a boyfriend with whom she has two kids with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are all things that happened before my brother knew her, in fact he started talking to her just after she propositioned his best friends mate. His judgement is not sound. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother loves to white knight, and she's a single mother with a severely disabled child, so she's essentially his wet dream. To her credit, she's a really good mum and the dad is barely present when it comes to the disabled kid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI gave her a chance when they started hanging out and briefly dating. She's a prime example to me of someone who is fun enough to be around but has a terrible character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI inadvertently managed to break them up 18 months ago when, on a night out she was telling me how I should be more like my brother with dating and I, somewhat drunkenly (and I AITA here) replied \"I'm not planning accidentally knock up an 18 year old\". She apparently didn't realise how old my nephews mother had been when they were together, she freaked out at him and broke up. A few days later my brother, devastated, asks me to talk to her. I do, and her response is basically that he's a child molester (to clarify, he is not and all was above board). I am frankly done with her at this point. If that's what she thinks of him having known him then she's not worth my time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, they patch things up because she gets lonely and wants company a week or so later but are \"just friends\". He at her beck and call. He still chases her, she still leads him on, letting him think they'll be together, a month ago I was told by a third party he had a girlfriend. When I asked him if they were dating again it was \"not official yet\". It still isn't and her Facebook profile repeatedly states she's single.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's said previously, by my brothers own admission she doesn't love him and likes him because he buys her things. None of his friends like her but they tolerate it and don't tell him what they really think. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want to encourage this, or have Betsy there on my birthday. I've said partners are welcome and if she's his partner then she counts too, but I don't want her there and I won't extend a personal invite. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "A couple weeks ago, my neighbors had a karaoke party that started at about 6pm. They have a shop that backs up to our land (we live a half mile outside city limits) that they used to host this event. The music was so loud that we could tell what songs were playing inside our house with the tv on. We were good sports up until about 11pm when it appeared there was no end in sight. We also had 3 other neighbors ask us if we were the source of the noise since it may have seemed that it was coming from the back of our house. \n\nI called a cop relative and asked what we should do and he said absolutely call the cops. We didn’t reach out to them first due to a previous party they had that they ignored us for which is why we went to the cops initially. I also didn’t want to walk into a party of about 20 people who had been drinking for 5 hours and tell them to cool it. Sounded like a bad recipe to me. Well, the cop shows up and shut the party down around 11:30 and we never heard another peep. \n\nFast forward to this week and the neighbors finally confront us about it to which we explained the situation. The wife of the house got all up in arms and said there was no way their music was too loud and we were lying about the other neighbors hearing the music (we weren’t). I have video evidence of the noise from my house as proof that they didn’t want to see. Now tensions are bad between us and the neighbors. AITA?",

      "title": "AITA for walking out of Thanksgiving dinner after my family went out of the way for me. It was a DISASTER.",
      "description": "There are a lot of moving parts to this story, but here’s a brief backstory. \n\nEvery year since I was a child thanksgiving has been held at grandmas. In 2012 my step uncle took advantage of be being blacked out drunk, came into the room I was passed out in, and molested me. Took years to get over it. My whole family still talks to him. As if it never happened. Pretty sure no one believes me. This man lives in another state. \n\nSo fast forward to this year and a week before thanksgiving grandma calls to give me a heads up that this man will be in town this year. So obviously, my self and my husband and two kids won’t be going. I am the one who has to rearrange my plans, my family has to miss out. Not him. Which I think is just mind blowing... but moving forward. \n\nMy mom is torn. She feels bad for grandma but also wants to see me and her grandkids. So she decided to hold thanksgiving at her boyfriends hours for her immediate family. She tells me to be there at 5, but that I can come over whenever. I’m tasked with desserts so I spend my day baking pies and wrangling my twins to get everyone ready. \n\nWe arrive at 5:30ish. Late as usual. It’s a kid thing. Thing are going great. Food is delicious. We decided to play cards against humanity and I leave to run home and grab it really quick. While I’m gone husband calls to say my mom, sister, brother, and the boyfriend and left to grandmas but will be back soon. TWO god damn hours pass and they still aren’t back. They’ve been gone longer then they were there meanwhile we are in this house with two other people we don’t really know. The roommate of the boyfriend and another girl. I’m furious. \n\nSo I decided we are leaving. I pack everyone up and text my mom as we get in the car and she says they are almost there. She also sends another text that was a little garbeled but said that I’m not leaving because we are going to get.. and I quote, “tore up from the floor up.” Let that sink in for a minuet. My MOM, who has never said that in her life, is speaking to me like a 17 year old thot. What in the actual fuck? So they show up and she is wasted. We are all outside and I say three times we are leaving just because I want to go. She pushes for an answer and I blow up. I tell her it’s complete bullshit she left in the middle of OUR thanksgiving to go to grandmas. Like why didn’t she go earlier in the day?? It’s bullshit that she assumes I’d want to get drunk on this day. I don’t drink on thanksgiving. I haven’t since 2012 because I CANT. I’m always the DD and I prefer it that way. Too much anxiety. \n\nMy bitch ass sister decided to pipe up and says “but we moved thanksgiving for you!” And that’s where shit hit the fan. I didn’t ASK for that. I asked to see them in a different day. They didn’t move thanksgiving FOR me, they moved it BECAUSE of me. Because it’s awkward for everyone apparently. I hear my sister loudly apologize to her boyfriend for having to witness such a monstrosity as her black sheep sister, and I get in the car. We drive away and I haven’t heard from my family since. I ruined everyone’s thanksgiving. I feel extremely angry at my family, but I also feel guilt. I have no idea why. AITA? ",

      "description": "Okay so to keep it short and sweet, I’m obsessed with makeup. I own a lot of it and I make purchases regularly. Recently I evaluated my unopened inventory and realised I had way too much to get through before it all went bad. Not only that, I needed some money to pay off a fee for drivers license (broke freshman feels).\n\nSo I asked my sister if she wanted it all for $15. Note, this is $200+ worth of eyeshadow, lipstick and highlighter. For FIFTEEN DOLLARS. I would have sold it but shipping costs would just be too much of an issue and none of my friends wear makeup. Sis was a bit hesitant but eventually agreed after checking the goods. \n\nImportant note!! Prior to this, I ALWAYS gave her makeup for free. I would let her have pretty much anything she wanted as long as it wasn’t something I was obsessed with (even then, I would still let her use it liberally.) \n\nNow when my mother caught wind, she was LIVID. Screaming that I was a big sister who should be taking care of my little sister. That I should never charge family for anything. And now I feel like shit and being a big ol crybaby. I will probably give the money back while still letting her keep the makeup. \n\nAITA?",

Yesterday she came to the house, to bring some of their stuff, and ask me when I was going back to my old room. I say that I wasn’t going to and she start arguing with my parents that since she’s older and have kids she should have the bigger room.\n\nThe room I have right now (her old room) is the biggest in the house but there is also a bathroom (with bathtub), a pretty big closet and an another room attached to it kinda like a living-room. \n\nI need this room because I use the « living room » as a dance studio. I also have too much clothes they don’t enter in the smaller bedroom (my old room) closet, and the room doesn’t have that much place to put more thing.\n\nMy sister say she  need it because her daughter, only 1 y/o and 6 months old, need to take bath (I don’t mind letting them us the bathtub) and because she want the living room to serve as the kid playroom (there’s already a room for that but ok?). Her only others reason on why she should have that room is because she’s older and that it use to be her room.\n\nShould I give it back when it’s clear I  won’t have enough place in the other room?\n\nAITA for thinking I shouldn’t be punished because of her bad life choices?",

She went on a rant about how selfish and inconsiderate I was and just a bunch of horrible things before hanging up on me.\n\nTheres a few reasons I dont think its a big deal...\n\n- Hysterectomies are pretty routine. Theyre serious sure but very rarely fatal, and it definitely has a low complication rate for a woman thats already menopausal.\n\n- Im still texting and calling her with support daily. I dont really understand why I need to be there in person if shes just gonna be unconscious for hours.\n\n- Im ridiculously exhausted.

      "description": "I (22F) am living with my boyfriend (24M) of 2 and a half years, his mother, and her best friend. Weve been living here for about a year since my family moved out of state. Today his mom wanted a ride to the store and my boyfriend tagged along because he wanted to purchase a videogame. When his mom got wind of this she got really upset at him because she claims he owes her money for weed she gave him. Its worth noting that when she denies him he sometimes goes into her room and takes it. He claims he didnt do that this time and that he has paid her everything he owes her and more. Im not sure what to believe because they both are being ridiculous and wont calmly talk about the misunderstanding. I want to believe my bf but since he has a solid history of taking weed from her its a little hard to say whats what.  They fight. BF decides hes not buying any video game. His mom decides shes only getting milk and bread instead of doing a full shopping trip. Bf and I go to the car where he demands me to take him home and leave his mid 50s mom with some minor physical disabilities to take the bus home or walk in the cold (snowing). Not wanting to I say no we will wait for her but he doesnt want to or to be in the car with her and huffs off.  She gets back all of five minutes later meanwhile im pleading for bf to come back. He tells me to fuck off and that he will walk home. Also for reasons I dont want to discuss its unwise for me to drive in the first place so I cant make 2 trips. I find him and pull over for him and he blows me off and walks to the other side of the street. We get home and he is fuming at me for not sticking up for him when all I wanted was for both him and his mom to be adults and go home and talk things out and not be drug to the center of a situation where I feel like my home life will be endangered if I abandon his mom. He says \"why should I have a girlfriend who never sticks up for me?\" Not going to make this huge post longer but I personally dont think that is true at all. Also worth noting that he broke up with me 2 days before christmas and 3 before my birthday for something similarly silly and then asked to have me back so this feels especially raw and hurtful. Now Im starting to feel so confused and wondering if I am being the asshole here like he claims.\n\n I apologize for bad formatting and writing .",

      "description": "So we are both chemistry majors who met during freshman year. We were lab partners for our chemistry lab and quickly hit it off. She is a military wife, a mom to her daughter who is 5 and three pooches. I find it amazing how she handles her personal and professional life and is great at it. \n\nHowever, now that we are graduating seniors and everyone is trying to get a job or get into grad school, she has become increasingly bitter about everything in her life. She constantly bickers about how everyone is so young and accomplished. How she is old and is nothing but a military wife and a mom. I happen to be an extremely type A 4.0 student who just got into an extremely competitive grad school and it feels like she constantly tries to compare herself to me. She is trying to get into medical school and constantly bickers about how every pre-med is 21/22 and how all grad students are the same; young and smart. \n\nI'm tired of telling her that age is just a number. And there are so many amazing students that start or go back to school later in life. She cannot seem to digest that and constantly tells me that I'm only saying that because I am 20 and smart and young and have my life figured out. And I cannot seem to get her to appreciate all she has in life. Her loving husband, her daughter, her family, her ability to handle a child while being a full time student and all. I couldn't have done it had I had to take care of a child and a husband and everything that she does. \n\nOnly last week this bickering came up again and I ended up telling her that she needs to accept few things in life that cannot be changed - like her age and since then things have been kinda meh between us.

      "title": "AITA for telling my friend’s teenage daughter she should stay in school in case her plan of being an author doesn’t pan out?",
      "description": "My friend’s 14 year old daughter hates going to school and lacks motivation to do anything outside of fandom. Now she’s morbidly obese from sitting around all day behind a computer, drinking up to a 2 liter of soda and eating junk all day every day. She only goes back to school when my friend gets a letter in the mail saying enrollment in school is mandatory for kids under the age of 16. But even then, she stops going after a few weeks.\n\nYesterday, my friend asked if I could take her daughter to an appointment since she had to work. I said sure. The appointment didn’t last very long, so I decided to surprise her daughter by taking her to lunch and a movie. \n\nAt lunch, I asked her daughter what she wants to be when she’s grown. Our conversation went: \n\nHer: “I’m going to write novels”.\n\nMe: “that’s awesome! I love writing, too! But you should probably know that it’s REALLY hard to make a living as a writer.”\n\nHer: “what do you mean? There’s so many books out there that are so bad I can’t even read them. I think I’ll make a great living with how good my writing is getting.” \n\nMe: “well yeah, it’s true there’s a lot of authors out there, probably more bad than good. But even the good writers have to work very hard to get their books published, and that’s not even guaranteeing they’ll get a lot of readers.”\n\nHer: “yeah, but I already have a lot of people reading my fanfic. I already have a base. I just have to self-publish novels and they’ll buy them and tell their friend and then I’ll make a lot of money”. \n\nMe “while I’m sure that’s true, you should still probably stay in school, at least until you get your diploma. Maybe you could go to [local community college] and major in English or writing?”\n\nHer: “but why go to school to learn how to write when I’m already really good at it?”\n\nI gave up and said “I don’t think that’s how it really works, but what do I know.” And the conversation turned to her latest fanfic she’s writing. \n\nWell last night my friend called me in a rage. “You CRUSHED her dreams of being a writer! She’s been crying all night because she’s questioning herself now. How DARE you go behind my back and tell her she’s wasting her time trying to be a writer”. \n\nI told her I never said she was wasting her time, just that it’s unrealistic thinking she’s going to become a successful author because a lot of people read her fanfictions. My friend said “she is MY daughter and her education is MINE and HERS business. If she wants to believe she’s going to be a writer, let her believe that until she’s forced to grow up and get a job like we all have to”. \n\nI said “but don’t you think that allowing her to just sit around and only do things when she feels comfortable will give her a bad work/school ethic like us?” All she said was “we get by just fine and even if we don’t that’s not your business. Now I have to go console my heartbroken daughter.” And she hung up.\n\nAITA? Should I have just not said anything? I’m really torn up about this. :(\n",

I can’t focus on studying if I can’t spread out my work or if I feel self conscious of what’s happening around me. \n\nNow last semester I had to leave college almost two weeks due to an emergency. When I got back I wanted nothing more than to hang out with my friends a few hours in my room to relax and cheer up. But my roommate asked if we could move somewhere else since they had to work so I went elsewhere with my friends. \n\nCome finals week I go to my room to study and my roommate is there with multiple people being pretty loud. I said I really need to study and ask if they can move to a new space. Multiple people lived on that same floor, why not go to one of their rooms? My roommate acted like my request was asking a lot and seemed pretty offended. I know they might not see these friends for a a while, but this was while quiet hours were in effect and at a point where I needed to make sure I kept my grades in good standing. Was asking them to leave wrong of me or was my roommate being a hypocrite about the space? ",

      "description": "Fair warning....this will be long so I apologize. \nBack around 2016ish I was in a mess. I'd rather not go into it, but it impacted my mental and physical health a great deal. I pushed people away out of fear. When he came...i didn't push him away for some reason. We ended up friends. But we'd fight because of some things that I ended doing out of fear. \n\nWe had a massive argument in early 2018. He left and I just had. My mental health deteriorate extremely to the po8nt I was nearly placed on a 72 hour hold 2 separate times. I eventually had someone snap me back to reality and get me out of the mess I was in. And I'm grateful to her for that. I had fixed my head and health and went back and tried to apologise for how I had been in those few years. That I changed and wasn't around those people that caused my life to be hell. He responded and we ended up becoming fast friends again. For a while......the arguments started back up and over stupid or minor things. \n\nGot accused excessively of hiding things from him if I didn't give all the details. Happened quite a few times. Over things like why I couldn't afford something, expecting me to give my parents buisness away. Or my buisness about my work. Would sit there and try to do whatever to have him kept happy. Eventually started to feel like I had to tip toe around topics in order to avoid a fight. Worked for a bit.\n\nAbout a week ago I got sick and told him that I lost an unhealthy amount of weight due to it and joked about it and that I needed to gain weight. He didn't like the weight that I wanted to be, kept saying I should be 130 instead of my 120 which is better for my weight. In the middle of the argument as to why I didn't want to gain....i told him that I had had some sort of eating disorder and went down to as little as 94 pounds in early 2017. I didn't really not eat or throw up or anything. I ate but only maybe twice a day and not much when I ate. I snapped out of it and gained weight back, but it didn't really stop him from trying to seemingly control my weight. \n\nAfter that i just wanted to leave, explained and we got into another fight where later on he begged me to reconsider. Which i stupidly did and tried to stay. Though I was cold because I was still rather mad. But I ended up having enough today after I told him something i was fearful about and had him put me and a friend (who he doesn't know) on blast. Wanted to know her name to which i refused after what he said about her. It got to the point we just started making each other hate each other. Blocked him because I couldn't handle it anymore. \n\nI understand friends wanting to know things, but he acted as though he needed to know everything. Which bothered me because of what I had gone through for the past few years...which ended up involving me being irl stalked, and just wanted some privacy of some sort. I've felt guilty a lot and conflicted about if I'm just being stupid the entire time and wrong every time we fight. Others have seen some of the convos and said that I shouldn't feel guilty and that he needs to just accept answers for what they are. But it's also gotten to points where he threatened self harm on himself a few times when I refused to answer and other manipulation tactics including guilt tripping. It makes me feel guilty but angry at the same time and also feel like it's somewhat my fault for staying after he presented clear red flags with some things. \n\n~thanks for reading, and I again apologize for the length of the post.

      "description": "So for some context my boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year, I am 20 almost 21 and still live at home, and my mom is offended that my boyfriend no longer wants to come over to my house. When we first started dating and we would just hang out and not go anywhere we would stay at my house and my mom would say he was over too much. When my mom learned my boyfriend was currently unemployed (he had just quit his job before we started dating) she decided that he wouldn't be a good fit for my future. She started saying things like he's a weirdo and will never amount to anything, that was her first strike with my boyfriend. When the relationship started getting tense between my mother and I and she would take her anger out on me by yelling and generally making me feel bad he decided he no longer wanted to come over as to avoid saying anything that would cause the situation to get worse. My mom has now taken this as my boyfriend doesn't like her and that he has no respect for me because he won't have anything to do with her. I have tried to explain many times why he refuses to come over and why we prefer to be away or at his house but she either doesn't understand or doesn't want to. I love my mother and it hurts me that she is this upset but at the same time I can't force my boyfriend to do something he doesn't want to, and it isn't like they haven't met, as I said before we used to be at my house all the time before this. Am I in the wrong? Should I try to make my boyfriend come over just to please my mom even though I'm sure that one of them will say something that will upset the other?",

      "description": "So my girlfriend is a massage therapist and she has had classes on and off with said friend above in the past. They only see each other when they have classes every few months but don’t talk much. The friend texts her out of nowhere and asked her to swap massages one on one. In class they’ve traded massages with others around, but never alone in a room. She said if I wanted to meet him I could, which I’m all for. But the thought of them alone in a room being friends, and him texting her out of the blue makes me uncomfortable. I really don’t like the thought of her male friend rubbing on her, regardless of occupation. I know I’m being a bit paranoid, but i brought up the reverse if I was the massage therapist and my female friend I never see much texts me out of the blue and asked for a massage. And bringing up this made my girlfriend think she’d be uncomfortable with that situation. It’s not a super serious thing and we’re not arguing much about it, but just knowing her guy friend is rubbing on her while she’s half naked makes me uneasy, and uncomfortable. She brought up that it’s beneficial for her because she’s trying to move salons and he might know of better places, and she’s always giving massages and never getting them, and getting one for free and from a friend would be nice. AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to get a 1 on 1 massage with her guy friend who’s a massage therapist as well, that texted her out of the blue? ",

      "description": "I'm aware the title alone sounds bad, but please read on.\n\nI \\[26F\\] work an office job in a team of around 15. It's a small-ish city, so we're all close friends and often hang out after work with our SOs and families. For reference, I am single.\n\nAround a month ago, I was working on a proposal with a colleague \\[29M\\], when I noticed he was looking kind of down. I asked if he was okay. Eventually he explained his girlfriend of 3 years just told him if they got married, she expected him to move to her home country permanently to look after her parents in their old age.\n\nHe told me he loves her and they were planning to get married, but he isn't sure whether he can commit to doing that, as he very much wants to stay here with his friends and family and career. He said he's scared of bringing it up again, because this might be a dealbreaker for them both. He said she has never brought this up before so he was blindsided, and asked if I had any advice.\n\nI've met his girlfriend before. She's beautiful and accomplished, and they seemed like a good match. Maybe I should have just stayed out of it, but I told him not to freak out and just talk to her about options, like:\n\n\\- if her parents would be willing to move here\n\n\\- what life in her home country is like (he might find he actually likes it)\n\n\\- what moving to her country would involve for him (e.g. learning the language, employment opportunities)\n\n\\- whether it would be possible to spend part of each year there, and part here so they would get to see both sides of the family\n\nAt the end I told him I believed they could work something out, and in the worst case if not, it's better to let her know he can't give her what she needs sooner. Because she has a right to know how he feels and work out what she wants to do accordingly.\n\nAfter this he thanked me for the advice, and that was it. Over the next few weeks I did ask him if he was okay once or twice, and he said he was taking my advice on board and thinking about how best to approach the topic.\n\nWell he did bring it up a week ago. Apparently he told her he wasn't sure he could do it, and this might be a dealbreaker if they can't find a compromise. Apparently she asked him where this was all coming from, because she thought they were 100% getting married, and he told her he had been thinking hard about it and asking friends for advice. Apparently she asked what friends, and he named me.\n\nI know all this, because she has now told a bunch of my coworkers that I was having an emotional affair with her boyfriend, and trying to break them up so I could have him (???). So for the past week I've been getting vague lectures from people about how affairs aren't always physical, and I crossed a boundary by being emotionally intimate with him.\n\nI agree emotional affairs can be just as bad as physical, but I don't think that's what happened here?\n\n1. He asked me for advice, which I gave to him ONCE\n2. I told him to communicate with her and gave some options of how they could overcome the issue\n3. I never even said she did anything wrong, or criticised her in any way\n\nBut now everything is awkward and my teammates are giving me the side eye, which is making me question myself. So Reddit, AITA?",

      "description": "This happened a few years ago when my sister graduated college. She went to a school in the middle of nowhere, but was near a shore town (Imagine Bob's Burgers with a boardwalk and stuff). My family decided to go to her graduation, then go to the shore town, rent a condo, and celebrate all weekend long.\n\nSo I take time off of work, drive out there (about a 3 hour drive), and spend time with my family all weekend long on their dime. I'm very proud of my sister and have a good time, but everything we do is what she wants (naturally, since it's her weekend). I never complained, and it wasn't like she picked weird and awful things to do. Honestly, it was a pretty good time. 8/10 would recommend.\n\nSo at the end of the trip, we're all packing up and my mom asks me \"So did you have a fun vacation?\" Mostly joking, I reply \"I don't know if I would classify this as a vacation, but yeah, it was a blast.\"\n\nMom: \"What do you mean NOT A VACATION? You got to eat and spend time with us!\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah. It was fun, but this trip wasn't for me. I got to see you all and party, but this was all about my sister and celebrating her graduation.\"\n\nMom: \"You are so selfish! Why can't you have fun with your family! This was a huge accomplishment for your sister!\"\n\nMe: \"I'm not saying it WASNT, I'm just saying this was a fun family trip. I came out here for her, not myself. To me a vacation is going somewhere fun that YOU wanted to go to and do things that YOU wanted to do. But I still had fun and I'm glad I came. I guess we just have different definitions on vacation.\"\n\nMom &amp; Sister: \"NEXT TIME WE JUST WON'T INVITE YOU SINCE YOU APPARENTLY HATE SPENDING TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY\"\n\nWe've all gotten over it after a few years, but it still hangs in my mind from time to time. I just have to know, Reddit. Was I an asshole for not considering a trip I was pretty much obligated to tag along on a vacation? I swear this almost reads like an episode of Everyone Lives Raymond.",

      "description": "Posted on a throwaway. This post isn't meant to bash anyone with conservative views, or anyone that likes conspiracy theories! Sorry if it comes off that way. Thank you for understanding!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family's pretty varied in terms of political views. My dad and brother are mainstream libs, My mom is an independent, and I'm an ecosocialist. My parents used to have very similar political views, but over the past several years my dad, brother and I have noticed her starting to veer right. This began with her getting really into New Age stuff, which led to conspiracy theories, and eventually, right-wing news and YouTube channels and all that. Consequently, we tend to butt heads a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has started to annoy my brother and SO. My brother says he's tired of our conversations devolving into hour-long debates, and my SO sees how emotional I get during these conversations and is worried about both my mental health and my relationship with my mom. There's honestly no harm done on that end. Our relationship hasn't been damaged at all, and my mom thankfully views it as something important to engage in. She says it prevents either of us from getting too extreme, \"steel sharpens steel\", etc. Which I'm inclined to agree with. Still, I've been trying not to bring up political topics in front of her when there's other people around. There's no reason other people should have to suffer our conversations, haha. But when she says something out of place, I feel like I just have to say something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I don't trust the sites she's on. They're all far right fringe sites. She claims she checks out sites \"on both sides\" to get a more objective view of things, but most of them don't fact check, and she believes them without doing any more research. It's gotten to the point that she believes in QAnon, Pizzagate, and other things like that, and it kind of scares me. She also believes in much weirder stuff- Queen of England is a lizard person, aliens built the pyramids, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't even like engaging in these debates half the time, but I'm scared that if I don't make a point of rebutting her viewpoints and fact-checking these statements for her, she'll continue down that path and get even more unhinged from reality. A lot of the sources she refers to are known for being alt-right gateways, and I'm scared of her beginning to unknowingly espouse anti-semitic, islamophobic, or downright racist views- Holocaust denial level shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Is it fair to subject others to our conversations, even if it makes them uncomfortable, for the sake of trying to help my mom keep an even point of view? Is it even my place to do that? Am I over-reacting/being a dick or am I justified? Is there a better way of going about this? Everyone feels like they can't talk about politics with either of us in the room, which isn't good at all. But I'm worried about what will happen if I stop.",

      "description": "\n\nI'm 15, and about 2 months ago I started my first relationship. The girl was almost 17 when we met and me, having the fucking horrendous self-esteem I've always had, never really understood what she saw in me, later to discover she had the same self-esteem problems and felt the exact same way.\n\nThing is, self esteem later showed to not be her only problem, and she ended up telling me very early on in our relationship about an extremely troublesome past, like 100 times worse than what you all are most likely imagining, and many abusive relationships she went through. This lead to her having bag anxiety, trouble expressing her thoughts, and terrible mood swings, but hey, I have mental problems of my own so I've never really complained.\n\nSo, a couple of weeks into our relationship, she started getting mad at me. Saying I wasn't giving her enough space, which I didn't agree with because I never demanded or insisted she spent time with me, I simply asked politely if she could come over to my place. But apparently she had trouble saying no.  I didn't think it was fair she was getting mad at me for just asking, but who gives a shit, I stopped asking as much and let her do her own thing. I thought the problem, which for a week or two got us into quite a couple fights, was done, booooy was I wrong. \n\nShe started coming up with a new problem every week pretty much, and continues arguing that they are genuine concerns that she has, which I believe, but the thing is she barely ever even talks to me productively about them. She just gets all pissy and responds in 1-2 word sentences when I write her entire paragraphs about said problem, which I have tried to talk to her about over and over again with no real result. \n\nLast night she got pissed off over some joke I made, leading to an argument about this whole short temper of hers regarding relatively small problems that really shouldn't matter. It got late, I was tired, I overreacted and said some shit I don't really mean, including that she was using me as an emotional punching bag and that she was being an abusive girlfriend and making me upset constantly. Although somewhat truthful, these claims where a huge exaggeration and I most definitely hurt her feelings by stating them. I tried explaining how I was feeling in many different ways and I still couldn't get through, so I eventually just broke and ended up guilt tripping her in a really douchy way. \n\nConclusion: My girlfriend has many emotional/ mental problems and a troublesome past, I overreacted during an argument and ended up guilt tripping her in a really shitty way that involved that past.

      "description": "Let me start by saying that me and my parents are pretty close and by no means would I ever let this get in the way of our relationship.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old my great aunt died, and she left $500 for me and my siblings to inherit when we turned 12. So obviously with my 12th birthday close by I was constantly dreaming of things I could use that money for. At the time I was really into the whole “use money to make money” type mentality and was constantly making businesses and things to earn me extra cash. With my birthday nearing my Dad sat me down to have a talk about the money. He had just been offered a deal on a penny stock which was selling for $0.50 at $0.10 per share. He told me how the shares were expected to rise up to around 2000% by the time they hit the market. He said he and mum didn’t quite have the funds to make a minimum investment (I don’t remember all the details correctly and i’m not very fimilar with stocks so i’m not sure what was going on). Dad said that he needed my $500 inheritance to buy the stocks BUT he said it was completely up to me whether I chose to invest in it. \n\nSo of course me being the money driven 11yo that I was I let him invest my inheritance because I was convinced that I was going to be making a fortune. Unfortunately I did not. And the company basically went bust and we haven’t heard from them since, apparently we could still get our money back but I think it’s unlikely.\n\nI can’t help but feel like I was taken advantage of as an 11yo. My dad had me fully convinced that I would make a fortune from this and it could be a once in a lifetime deal only to have it all wasted. Am I the asshole for having this mindset? As an 11yo I feel like I wouldn’t have known better to say no to that deal as it seemed so perfect. I am now 16 and doubt I will ever get that money. \n\nTLDR: My Dad convinced me to waste my inheritance on penny stocks and I’m mad because I feel like I was taken advantage of",

      "description": "A girl I know who, as long as I’d know her, was loud, rude, and disrespectful towards lost everybody, was somehow nominated to be in a parade of, basically, niceness. She did a lot of community service and was nominated to represent the community, and now has to win a Miss America-like “contest” by the city.\n\nIn one of my classes, my teacher passed out papers and markers and asked us all to write down well wishes for her to win the competition. Immediately, I wasn’t interested. Everybody else started writing (most never knew her), but I just left the paper and marker there. The teacher did not question this.\n\nI noticed the girl next to me also hadn’t moved, so we got into a conversation about how the girl treated us in the past. I made a point to continue the conversation while the teacher was near so she might understand. We never trashed her appearance or called her vague things like “a bitch”, but used words such as “inconsiderate”...you know, more clean things. The girl I was with mentioned how she spent time with her for days once and the girl made personal attacks when upset or irritated.\n\nAfter, my seat mate decided to leave a vague message, and I didn’t leave one at all. Still, nothing from the teacher.\n\nUntil...\n\nShe gets in front of the class and says along the lines of “I can hear what all of you say and if I were your parent, I’d be disappointed. You should never be mean about your classmates. It is disgusting and inappropriate. You should be ashamed. You’re almost adults,” and so on. My classmate and I immediately noticed this sounded like she was referring to us. I was unfazed (I don’t feel bad) but the friend was quiet.\n\nAWeTA? ",

      "description": "Every year of my life i've celebrated thanksgiving with my family (I'm 19). This year is a little different because it's being celebrated at my aunts house, i'm not particularly fond of her because she can be loud and me being an anxious introvert  I am, I find it hard to partake or enjoy conversation with her and some of the family that will be there, not that I don't love them, because that isn't the case at all.   \nThis year my best friends older sister and her boyfriend are visiting and I havent seen them in a while and I wanna make sure I don't miss there visit. On top of that some of my friends are gonna be hanging out and they want me to tag along, I've never celebrated thanksgiving with friends before so I figured it'd be fun to switch it up for once. My family is also moving to Europe next year and I'm unsure of if I'll be going with them or not, so I want to take this chance to spend my favorite holiday with my friends before I possibly go away to another country and am unable to be around them next year. My mom thinks I'm only doing this because I only care about myself (which I dont blame her for, I can be an a-hole and I'm glad she puts up with me). She thinks I don't want to go because of me not liking my aunt, or being an anxious hermit, that isn't the case though, I wouldn't mind being around them at all and I really looked forward to eating a bunch of food at my aunts because we haven't celebrated there since I was a little kid and I know it'll bring a bunch of nostalgia and make me feel happy, I just want to show my friends that I'm grateful for them and everything they do for me, because my anxiety gets to me a lot, causing me to bail or avoid plans with them or anyone.  \nI'm really grateful for my group of friends because me being the very depressed person I am, its hard to keep going sometimes, but they always find a way to cheer me up or get me to keep going without trying or even knowing. I've never fit in growing up and going through school, but somehow my group of friends just formed out of no where and I always am grateful for everything they do for me because they're the kindest and chillest people I've ever met, I genuinely love all of them like a family. Which is why I want to just spend time with them and just hangout and chill like we normally do, we aren't even doing any celebration as far as i'm aware.  \n(Sorry for the poor quality writing, i'm just waking up as i'm dealing with my mom being mad at me and telling me to talk to her when \"I want to be her son again\", so im kinda stressed and my brain is frazzled)",

He was at the point of taking medication, on disability, and barely going through the motions of everyday life. As of now he's doing better but it's a subject our family doesn't really bring up, as we've all dealt with it in our own ways.\n\nI'm working on college application essays right now, and we're tasked with multiple essay prompts about life and whatnot. My mom, and older siblings who are already in college have been pushing me to use my dad's depression as a theme for one of the essays. They argue that since it's affected me indirectly it's totally okay to write about it. I haven't asked my dad as it can feel like a touchy subject, and to me it can feel almost taboo.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel as I know that I was affected, but as to the magnitude I'm still not sure since it's something I don't really try to think about anymore. I'm not sure if it's being manipulative, or if using a family member's mental sickness is wrong.\n\nWIBTA for using his depression in a college application essay?",

Our apartment smells AWFUL because of this cat, and it is really stressing me out because I know we will never get our security deposit back and we have a small child we also has to smell it. We've paid to have our carpets treated, and we've paid for flea medicine as well as having our apartment treated for fleas. My sister has not offered to help with any of the cost.

When she brought me the money and clothes I immediately saw the Macy’s bag and knew what she did. She bought me a 60$ pair of jeans and a 65$ shirt. I’ll say it again, I appreciate the clothes more than she knows but 125$ for two items is crazy especially when she knows my current situation. That money could have got me a lot of bus rides or food for a month or many other things I needed. I would have been grateful for a 10$ Walmart shirt and 10$ Walmart jeans.

      "description": " My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.\n\nMy husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said \"We might not even have kids\" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.\n\nSo this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.\n\nI was annoyed by this and said \"There's really no chance.\"\n\nMIL, all wide-grin, said, \"Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!\"\n\nI said \"We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,\" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.\n\nMIL gets more annoyed and says \"Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!\"\n\nHusband said, \"Mom, enough.\" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said \"MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.\"\n\nWell, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how \"I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother.\" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.\n\nMy MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really \"need\" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said \"Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding.\" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)\n\nI hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?",

      "description": "So I'm a part of a Discord server with a friend of mine, and some mutual friends of his. The server was made, originally, to discuss an idea for a video game we wanted to collaborate on (and, naturally, the majority of the conversation is just swapping memes back and forth.)\n\nNow, one of my Discord friends-by-association lives in South Africa. Every now and then he'll talk about the political and economic troubles in his country. Most recently, he posted two Youtube videos explaining why South Africa is \"a failed state.\" I did some Googling and found the channel he got the videos from leans into alt-right stuff and other conspiracy theories. I informed him as such, and asked him if he had any better sources for the stuff the videos were claiming. This lead to a long discussion of my showing what I found, showing the Youtube channel wasn't a trustworthy source, him talking about how farm killings are being committed by paramilitary professionals, and me trying to explain why sourcing your information was important.\n\nNow I'm not South African, so I don't have a frame of reference. I'm mainly just trying to figure out if this guy just used videos from a bad channel but there's a *lot* more bad shit going on in South Africa than I knew, or if this guy is just into some conspiracy theories. Am I the asshole for not fully believing him and wanting credible sources, even though he actually lives in South Africa?",

      "description": "Okay, I’m going through some emotional ups and downs an nothing soothes my mind more than a nice bowl of ice cream! \n \nThe only issue is I’m out of my own ice cream. So, being that it was after 10:00 and all the stores near me were closed, I come up with a plan.   The plan is to steal my already asleep roommates ice cream and replace it tomorrow evening.   I did just that and I have to admit that I felt so much guilt that the ice cream hadn’t even tasted as good, but it was still pretty ducking good.  I come home and put the ice cream next to the it’s half empty predecessor.  It’s all fine, we joke about it and continue on. \n\nFast Forward to just 30mins ago, my roommate finishes the ice cream. He keeps talking about how good it is and how terrible I am for stealing their ice cream. The more he joked the more he meant it. He eventually grabs the little bit of stolen original ice cream that is now mine, and tells me he’s gonna eat it. I think he’s joking and I playfully tackle him and take the ice cream from his evil hands.  He is now visibly upset.  I put it in the freezer where it’s safe and waiting for me to eat it, me!  He goes back in the freezer takes the ice cream from its frozen place of solace and looks dead in my eye. \n\nHe says “ this was originally mine. It is still mine, and I will eat it.” \n\nI ask him if he’s serious and he was indeed.  He wouldn’t even mention the fact that I went to the store bought him a brand new one and I even shared my cookies with him! I got the ice cream back, but now he sits in his room talking shit about me on the phone. This really hurts my feelings but, I guess I can empathize with his point of view.  Tell me Reddit, AITA? ",

      "description": "(Weird title I know)\n\nI was waiting in the line for a bathroom at an orchestral concert, and women's bathroom lines are always long as fuck so I was there for quite some time. I have a habit of quietly singing under my breath when I'm bored, which is pretty important to the story. Behind me were two older women, 50-60 ish, who were doing the typical older lady thing of being judgmental as fuck. \n\nSuch highlights including:\n- pointing out someone's highlights and saying how she looked like a skunk \n- saying someone's shirt looked like a huge stain\n- looking at my shoes and calling them dreadful\n\nYou get the gist. We were in the queue for about 15 minutes (the whole intermission) and when we were t the front of the queue a smaller lady dashed in to quickly wash her hands. The women behind me noticed this and were quick to start on the 'we were waiting longer and first' etc etc, which is fine- they misunderstood her intentions. \n\nThen one of them turned to the other and said 'I bet she's Russian, all Russians are terribly rude.' Her friend nodded along and recalled her time in Russia when the first lady finished with, 'Any Eastern European really, rude and dirty.'\n\nAlthough I speak very little Russian, I am not Russian in the slightest. Nor am I Eastern European in anyway, but to hear someone stereotype like that really got me, so I decided to drop the hammer as such. I pulled up my emergency screenshot of my dad's phonescreen to make it look like I was actually in a call and began to loudly speak the little Russian I know and formed it into what sounded like a conversation ('Hello', 'Good, Thank you.', 'And you?', 'Yes, No', 'Goodbye') or at least something a non-native speaker wouldn't cringe at. After my quick 1 minute phonecall, I hung up and then helped another different old lady with something and spoke to their in English so that they would know that I had understood them. One of them ended up needing to use something before me so I used the Russian form of 'after you' to address her. They were both quite embarrassed and now I feel quite bad. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My cousin wasted his life on drugs and booze, barely graduated HS, never went to college, never did much of anything beyond high school. His parents divorced when he was young, but neither died, and he is middle-class. I worked my ass off straight through HS, graduated in the 97th percentile, got a half-full-ride, took out some loans, now I'm working my ass off in college and I'll hopefully be graduating eventually. My and my sister's mother died when we were young, and we were raised middle-class by a single father. My cousin recently had a baby with his GF, they have zero financial resources to raise this kid, yet the family lavishes praise on him, and I can't remember the last time my family even half-thanked me for what I've done. If anything, they point out my flaws wherever they see them. They've accused me of being gay (I'm not, but they'd see that as a problem), of being a disappointment to my father, of being lazy of all things, etc. Look, I'm not angry at the baby, of course. It just sucks when I spend my nights bent over a computer screen working, foregoing parties, alcohol, whatever else, getting about 5 hours sleep per night, holding down grades, current job, clubs, the job search, student debt, etc. only to see it apparently go unappreciated while he's showered with praise. I feel like I'm the bad guy in that Bible story, the prodigal son. So, Reddit, AITA for being jealous of my cousin?",

      "description": "I'm waiting for an official diagnosis from a specialist, but it is strongly looking like I have a something called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS.) **EDS is genetic**, and frankly this is where my problem is.\n\nI have siblings, and the one sister I am very close to (G,) has some similar symptoms. So, I've been talking with G about the medical concerns. My spouse and I have only told my medical stuff to my parents, his parents, my best friend/her spouse, G/her spouse, and my husbands boss. Basically, we only told people who are a part of our emergency childcare plan as my symptoms can flare up unexpectedly, can take significant time to recover from, and my spouses career sometimes has him away from home for extended periods of time.\n\nUnfortunately G has a history of taking my personal information, and telling others, under the guise of being 'well meaning.' Since *I do not have a 100% confirmed diagnosis*, I said I was not telling our oldest sister, C, and I asked G **specifically by name** not to talked to her about it either. I stated my reasons not to tell C yet is because she lives nearly 3000 km/2000 mi away, does not have any family nearby for support (as she's in a different country,) and our healthcare systems are different – I do not want to jeopardize her healthcare on the off chance that my health concerns are an acute issue just limited to me.\n\nSure enough, G told C. And, she told her incorrect information on top of it. G stated that EDS is just like Fibromyalgia (it's not,) had C and her spouse run through a physical test (the Beighton Score,) that my diagnosis was absolute and set-in-stone (again, nope,) and I am officially disabled for life (which is something that can only be speculated once I have the diagnosis in hand.) I completely understand that G is concerned, may have questions, or may be frustrated that it's 'another thing to add to her busy life.' BUT I ensured that she could talk to her spouse or our parents if she didn't want to discuss this stuff with me.\n\nI approached G after taking a night to calm down, and reinstated that I do not want her to share my health concerns with anyone. I said if she wants to talk to people about her health, she is welcome to, but please do not talk about mine. While when I confronted G, she claimed she 'only mentioned I had back issues,' which C already debunked. I told her that while I understand that she is likely very worried herself, that she really betrayed my trust, even after I pointed out to her her history of sharing news that isn't hers, and plainly asking her to not mention this at all with C. I said that she knew she had other people she could've talked to (our parents, her spouse,) and she directly went against my wishes. In response, she said again 'it isn't a big deal, I apologize but I was worried, and if you feel that way, don't talk to me again.' She called me an asshole, and ultimately blocked me.\n\nSo, AITA here?",

      "description": "Backstory: From the age 6-18 I was a student at dance studio. My mentor (now referred to as DT) took over my training when I started with the competitive teams from 11-18 years old, she also bought the studio when I was about 11. I was going through a really traumatic point in my life and was severely bullied by my teammates which lead to a deep depression and developing an eating disorder. The bullying from my team continued in plain sight to the point more than 1 other teacher spoke to me about it but it never got any better. DT would have to be blind not miss it since these girls would make nasty remarks about my body in front of her when we tried on costumes, tell me I was never good enough to be on the team, mock me at every chance they could and were just monsters towards me. I finally broke down at 17 and had a meeting with DT about all the years of abuse and torment these girls had put me through to which she said she had no idea. She then brushed it under the rug and never addressed it again resulting in me only competing in solos that year and being pulled from all of the competitive teams. Not only did this ostracize me but it made the bullying worse. As company owner and head choreographer DT also pulled me from all solos I would have gotten for the final ballet I ever did with this company. I was so defeated and broken by the end of it all that I left and refused to ever again set foot near the place that cause me years of torment.\n\nI removed everyone aside from a small number of people who were a part of that studio from my life and went on to recover from my ED and put my life back together. A few months ago I got a call from one of my former teammates that my DT had passed away after battling cancer and that her memorial would take place a month later. My mom had been on the board for this studio as the Treasurer so she knew DT and most of what I went through there. She kept asking me in the week leading up to my DT's funeral if I would go and I kept saying no. I didn't feel comfortable being surrounded by the people that made my life hell to celebrate the life of the woman who not only watched as it happened but never made any attempts to stop it. The day of the funeral my mom calls me to again ask if I would come with her and I say no. She proceeds to tell me how selfish I'm being, how much my DT had done for the community and all the people’s lives she enriched and that I owe it to my DT to be there. When I wouldn't budget she changed tactics by saying that I should go because my DT had been such a huge part of my life, that I was being cruel for not wanting to show my love and support for DT's mother and how unchristianly I was being (note: I am not religious but my parents are). In the end I called my dad and cried about how horrible my mom had made me feel and he agreed with me deciding not to go.\n\nSo AITA for refusing to attend my DT's funeral?",

I’m annoyed, but decide to leave it this time. I hand him my card, and he hands me the drink only 3/4 of the way full! I kind of look at him and just ask if I can get that filled up the rest of the way.  He kind of glared at me and scoffs, before taking my drink and filling it to the brim. He then hands me the drink and my food and then closes the window.  I just drove off at that point and enjoyed my food but it just left a bad taste in my mouth, so AITA for just wanting my drink to be filled to the top?",

      "description": "Hi, sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile, but I'll do my best! Also, south hemisphere, so I'm in summer and school year has just ended.\n\nSome very necesary backstory. I am 20 and have a beautiful 4 month old daughter. It was an unplanned pregnancy, but she's amazing and I regret nothing. I live with my parents and my 3 younger siblings, they all have been amazing, and have made sure LO and I have everything we need. My parents paid for everything, all the doctors appointments, the birth (wich is not cheap), everything. My SO studies law, and struggled a lot finishing his semester, but he passed everything and I'm so happy and proud of him. \n\nThe thing is, he hasn't put a single penny for our daughter. We don't need the money, my parents have us covered and have made sure that I never get need anything, but still. I feel like he hasn't made any effort to prove that he's up to this, like to show he's serious. He worked for a friend for a couple of months, and made some money, but got into a pointless fight, and lost the job, and then spent the money on a ps4. He said he would sell it when LO was born, but he didn't, and has spent even more money on games. \n\nTo be fair, he has bought diapers twice, but that's kinda it.\n\nAlso relevant to this story, we talked about living together a couple of times, but he barely makes it on his own, and two extra people to feed would be a lot, besides the fact that babies are crazy expensive, and he really did not have the cash, and I haven't finished my studies either. It was just simply not gonna work out, so I backed up and that led to a huge fight.\n\nHe had the chance to study a class during summer, but he declined, cause he'd rather chill and relax. I have a horrible time telling people when I have a problem with them, I'm always scared they would leave me or something like that, so when I talked to him about this, I was terrified and was very careful, told him I love him and I think he's a great dad, but that I feel like... y know... he should use his summer in something, so he could get some money for our LO. He freaked out. Like guys, next level. He began saying that I'm only interested in his money, that I was basically calling him lazy and useless and a bad father. He said that I was completly out of place, but that if I needed his money so badly, he'd give it to me. I insisted on that it wasn't about the money, it was about commitment and doing a gesture of supporting our daughter. He continued to rant about all of us being interested and completly money based, that we only see family as a small company, that I only cared about him for the money he'd produce. I tried everything to get him to understand that it was not about the cash, but it was useless.\n\nI've tried talking to him, but he's just mean, if I tell him I love him he laughs at me. Cancelled our weekend visit (we were gonna go and spend the weekend at his place) saying he is too busy trying to find a job.\n\nSo now I'm wondering, was I really overstepping? I didn't mean to make him feel bad, and I feel terribly guilty for doing so. \n\nSo, AITA? ",

      "description": "Last night my SO and I went out to have a date. They doesn’t like going on dates since they don’t have a job right now and I do. I don’t mind paying cause it’s for the person I love and since I’m still in school living at home I always have extra money to spend. \n\nWe went out for dinner and everything was going great as always. That was until we started talking about how to raise our kids (we’re not serious about it yet but it’s a fun or cute scenario). Until they said, I think seriously but I’m not sure, that they’re all going to therapy. \n\nFor context super quick I suffer from hardcore depression and anxiety. I’m naturally already a sensitive person but without my meds I’m twice as sensitive and twice as emotional. While we were in this date I was having specially made meds for me so I was off them for a week or so. \n\nAnyway, I got confused and asked what they meant. They laughed and told me they didn’t want to finish the joke but I just laughed and said “Come on finish it.” They said laughed and said “Because one depressed Twilipig is enough for me to handle.” \n\nI won’t lie, that stung a little. I can be a handful and I’m aware. I don’t have many friends and every time I try to make friends they either reject me or drop me fast. That was towards the end of dinner so we just paid the cheque and left. When I’m upset I need time to process and thing of the proper words to say, my SO knows this. The drive home was very quiet. \n\nHe dropped me off and left and texted me asking if I was okay. I didn’t respond cause I was still upset and still needed time to think of what to say. They called a few minutes later and I picked up. \n\n“Hey, what’s wrong?”\n“I won’t lie SO, the therapy remark kind of hurt my feelings. You know how I feel about that kind of talk.”\n“Oh my god babe it was a joke!”\n“I know but it still really hurt my feelings.”\n“Oh my god I can’t make any jokes with you it’s so annoying.”\n“That is so not true, you just know I don’t like mental health jokes.” \n“Yeah right whatever. I’m tired about you being so sensitive about it. It’s not even that big of a deal, people have it-“\n\nI hung up on them in tears. They had always been supportive but to hear they found my mental illness annoying really hurt. We haven’t talked since then. I know I probably should have handled things better but I got caught up in the moment. Am I the asshole that should apologize?",

Offered to let her stay with me until she gets her shit together for reasons detailed in the above post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe's looking into moving back to where her son's father is, which I think is a good move. She looked at some places last week and listed me as a reference. Here's the honest truth:\n\n* She has never contributed to rent or other bills (gas, electric, cable, internet, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime) in the year+ that she has lived here, despite me regularly bringing it up (I waited for her job situation to stabilize but it never did).\n* In the eight months I lived with her before we moved here, I had to pay to have her internet restored twice and paid for her last two months of rent because she couldn't afford it.\n* When I lived at her place, she trashed it. She refused to take the trash to the dump and when I finally took it, there were 21 bags of trash that she just stored outside of her place.\n* Her mom had to fly in from out of state to help her clean up her place when she moved here and was appalled at how much of a mess it was. If it wasn't for her mom, she probably never would have cleaned the place.\n* She regularly smoked cigarettes and weed in her place.\n* She does not have a job where she is planning to move. She has left, been laid off from, or been fired from a total of nine jobs in the less than two years that we've been together.\n* She refuses to hold a full-time job, arguing that she likes to have her free time during the day (she's very immature).\n\nThe guy has called me twice asking for a referral. If this was a property management company it'd be one thing but it's a guy renting his place who stands to lose money to her immaturity. I originally decided to ignore the calls because I didn't want to lie to the guy when I know how bad of a tenant she is but with her behavior since we broke up, I kind of want to reach out to the guy and let him know the truth. Am I being petty? She's out of here either way.",

      "description": "Recently my GF of 3 1/2 years broke off our relationship and basically declared each other single ( December 2018).  Over the few months we discussed about working it out, taking it slow , so on and so on.   We never said we was back together despite still sleeping together,  As well as i live in her house til i got my own ( which is in two weeks now).   Mind you, i was totally against the whole break up and taking it slow crap, but she was pretty gungho on it and preached about what good it can do to really show us if we truly want to be together  ( which i do)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to Yesterday,   My best friend from work wanted to go out, so we did.   We ended up running into this girl i used to work with a few years ago.   Back then my GF (or ex)  was totally against us talking, being friends  because she thought she liked me and what not.  So for her wishes i blocked her off social media ect and haven't talked since ( I did unblock her after a drunk night not to long ago  and just said hi but i dont count that).  So the convo spark up and it's honestly great,   we talked about work,  old times,  and yes she did admit at our old jobs, she thought i was pretty cute.   She also talked about how she knew my GF hated her,   we discussed the whole blocking and unblocking of social media. I won't make excuses the talk turn a bit flirty ( she was basically just wearing a bra in the club),   commented on that,   told her  she quite beautiful and so on.     After a good 20 minutes time to close,  So walking out i asked her how can i make amend to her because it's been wonderful seeing her.   She said a good start would be to readd her on social media,   boom no problem i did it.   We been messaging back and fort today,   suppose to meet up but she feeling a bit sick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo i'm not sure if i'm the asshole here by reopening a old friendship that's wasn't approve of before when i was in a relationship,   I personally believe i shouldn't have to disclose every single thing to my Ex(?),  especially if it just friends.   I know without a doubt,   She'll be UPSET (understatement)  when/if she find out about us running into each other and talking ect.  Cause obviously there still feelings involve,  there chances it could work out between us or it couldn't.   I wasn't really looking for nothing that night i considered it just running into a old friend.   I'm debating if i even want to tell my ex(?)  what happened.    What if she see a messages from her and think i was trying hide it,  surely that'll be even worst.   End of the day i probably would prefer not to  disclose it   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I have five housemates, 2 male and 3 female. I'm male. We are all between 19 and 22 and go to college together but don't really know each other too well.\n\nAnyways I have a female roommate that has a horrible habit of NEVER knocking and assuming people will always lock doors. She opened the bathroom one time while I was showering and yelled at me for not locking the door and then asked to brush her teeth. Another time she opened my fucking bedroom door to ask me a question which is a huge invasion. I regularly see her try to open locked bathroom doors when someone is clearly showering. \n\nAnyways today I got out of the shower and heard her bedroom door slam, which meant she was coming to the bathroom and definitely wasn't knocking. Anyways I actually forgot to lock the door and thought on the spot \"I bet if I stand here nude when she opens the door she'll NEVER not knock again.\" Anyways I just remained standing naked and she opens the door, her jaw drops and she slams the door. \n\nAfter I got out I saw she was waiting in the hallway. She says \"You didn't lock the fucking door. I literally saw your penis dude,  not cool.\" And I said \"maybe you should start knocking,\" and she says \"how about you lock the door? You made no effort to cover your penis when I opened the door. You're lucky I'm not reporting you for sexual harassment.\"\n\nAm I really the asshole here?",

      "description": "I have a (formerly) close good friend that I have loaned a lot of money to, thousands of dollars in the past six months.  They were down on their luck and needed some help getting bills in order so I started helping him out.  When I first started sending it to him, he would say \"I'll go pick it up and then I will call you\" or \"Thank you, I'll give you a call later tonight\" and never did.  In fact, he would pick it up and then I wouldn't hear from him for days.  A few times, he would say that he needed it for an opportunity to turn a profit and I would get it back the same night, again, not hearing from him for days afterwards, or make other promises to me that he didn't keep. I started to get upset about him not ever doing these things and started to feel like he was taking advantage of me and not being honest about what the money was for, so I started making accusations.  This would make him angry and say that I don't trust him, he's tired of explaining himself, and I'm trying to control him by telling him what to do.  I tried to explain that it's not about telling him what to do, it's about doing a favor for me when I do favors for him.  Or, that it's only respectful to let someone know they won't be getting their money back if you say you will and it falls through.   Well, this eventually escalated until last week when I gave him $500 for a new apartment, he said he would video chat with me that night so I could see it, and he swore it was the last time.  Then, I didn't hear from him for two days, (with him saying an additional two more times \"I will call you\") when he needed money again to help his daughter.  When I got mad about it not being the last time, he accused me of trying to put myself over his kids and we got in an argument, where he said some mean things to me but promised I would get it back the next day.  I got really pissed, but sent him the money anyway, telling him he needed to make it up to me because that wasn't right.  I gave him until 6 pm, then texted him pissed off that he didn't get it back and didn't tell me.  I was just heading in to work so when he called me, I couldn't answer.  He accused me of never giving him a chance and that he had done nothing wrong.  I was so angry that I started sending him texts telling him exactly how I felt, to which he replied to stop my drama, grow up, stop blowing up his phone, or he would never talk to me again. I did keep texting and he stopped responding.  I then found out the next day that he has blocked my phone number and blocked me on facebook messenger.  Am I the asshole for wanting to feel appreciated or am I being controlling?",

      "description": "First of all, no, this is not a friends with benefits or hook-up situation. I have been in a committed relationship with my boyfriend for two years, and we recently moved in together. We’ve always been pro-choice but have agreed that if I ever got pregnant, we’d keep it.\n\n\n\nI guess some things are easier said than done because when I found out I was pregnant a month ago, I immediately knew I wanted an abortion. I scheduled one for the next day and just got it over with without telling my boyfriend. I didn’t feel like dealing with telling him because I knew he’d be upset and try to make me keep the baby. It’s not a good time for us to have a baby, as we are both in college and would most likely both have to drop out. I also know that if he’d known, he would have felt extremely guilty about it (he had a very religious upbringing). Anyway, I don’t think he should have any say in the matter because it’s not him who’d have to carry and give birth to the baby. All he did was donate the sperm.\n\n\n\nI planned on just not telling him and putting this behind us, but unfortunately he saw some texts from my sister about it. He freaked out at me, yelling about how I murdered our baby and didn’t tell him (all the stuff about murder surprised me, but he did have a very religious upbringing). I calmly told him that this was my decision and I had no obligation to tell him. He said he had father’s rights and again said I was a murderer before storming out. He’s been staying with his brother for the past two days, and we haven’t communicated since then except when he asked when I’d be at work so he could pick up his stuff.\n\n\n\nI know reading this post probably makes me sound extremely cold, but I do love my boyfriend. I just think what I did and keeping it from was ultimately in both of our best interest. This clearly was not the right time to have a baby, and I didn’t want to make him carry the burden of knowing I’d had an abortion. We are both 22 if that matters.",

      "description": "Background: I am 15 years old. I am professionally diagnosed with Asperger's, Depression, and Anxiety. My mother and father are divorced, and live in separate states. \n\nI recently made the decision to cut contact with my mother. I moved in with my father a little more than a year ago today to get away from her and my stepdad's abuse (You can read about it in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b5t75t/comment/ejg1d43)\n\nTo sum it up, and add some stuff on that I didn't include in the above linked post (It talked more about my stepdad than my mom)...\n\nShe's an alcoholic, and in my opinion, a very toxic person. She's manipulated people around me (teachers, counselors, etc) to try and put me in my place. Straight up lied to them about me to get them upset with me. Whenever I would try to sit down and talk out our problems, she'd use me as a scapegoat. She showed obvious favoritism to my two little siblings, sometimes to the point where she'd let me go hungry at night just because she didn't want to risk waking them up to make me dinner (and wouldnt let me cook for myself for the same reason, either). She's called me nasty things and put me down for things I couldn't control (Such as issues I have with my autism). I'm firm about my choice to cut contact with her, but my dad doesn't agree with it. He says that she's still my mother, and she has it rough right now. She does...She just had surgery to remove almost her whole reproductive system for stage zero cervical cancer.  And she does have to deal with my stepdad. I doubt my choice every minute, even if sometimes I do feel strongly about it...It's time to finally get answers. Am I the asshole for completely severing contact with her? Should I at least try to comfort her about her recent surgery and other things she's going through?",

      "title": "AITA for arguing with my mother over college?",
      "description": " \n\nI (16M) am in high school and planning on where to go for college. My parents and I have differerent political opinions: they are both right-wing while I am moderate left. I listen and am receptive to my parent's opinions, and they listen back to a very short extent. Usually, my mother conveys that I am not experienced in the world and therefore do not have much of a base to stand on (not exact words). She also cuts me off most of the time. I get the feeling that they would rather me be right-wing, but I digress.\n\nAfter school, my mother began discussing an article we read on taking down a statue at Yale University.  The author disagreed with it, describing it as censorship. My mother wholeheartedly agreed, while I found myself at odds with some of what was said in the passage. Today, she mentioned in the car that she would never send me to Yale as a result. I started questioning this, asking if she would not send me to any college that this kind of occurrence happened to, and if this would be widened to any liberal-leaning university. She responded by saying that I could apply to any college I wanted to, but she would not pay for a college that \"this liberal stuff\" happened to, and I would have to earn everything myself. (I don’t have much money, and I believe most US colleges are at least partially liberal.)\n\nI began to object at this point, starting a number of my sentences with \"Are you kidding me?\" and following up to most by saying \"So you're not going to send me to any college you find an objection to?\" and \"That is really, really stupid.\" (by objection, I mean political disagreement.) I assured her she could have any opinion she wanted, but would not let it impact me. Now, she went on to tell me she had a right to voice her own opinion, and believed this extended to her payment, meaning she would refuse to give money to any institution that she disagreed with. I began to get visibly angry, telling her \"Are you fucking kidding me?\" and \" I'm going to apply to Yale\" and \"I'm not going to let you fuck over my life\" (I don't remember what the exact words were.) She began laughing as she asserted her position, saying she didn't want me to be brainwashed at a college like this. (She made one or two references to George Orwell's *1984.)* I (semi-angrily) told her my position again, and said I needed to go to the local library to work on my schoolwork.\n\nIn the house, my mother attempted to continue the argument. As the situation escalated, he called up my father at work, and explained to him that I was \"cursing at her and calling her stupid\". I didn't hear what my father was saying, but based on the garbled voice on the other end that I could hear, he was still calm. My mother also said that \"this is what happens when you cut off the oxygen supply\" (college tuition.) When she hung up, we continued semi-arguing, and finally she screamed the same thing at the top of her lungs.After that, I left.\n\nAITA?",

      "title": "AITA for staying with my dad?",
      "description": "Some context: I’m a junior in high school [16M]. My parents just got divorced about a month ago, Nothing too juicy, just they couldn’t work things out anymore. They sold the house I grew up in and moved into two separate apartments. My mom is planning on buying a house but can’t as of now because of complications with our old house selling. The two apartments are across the road from each other. \n\nComplete sidenote: The family from the TLC show OutDaughtered bought our house. We have some weird contractual stuff going on, but I think they are going to close on the house. Not exactly relevant to this story, just thought it was strange.\n\nMy brother is a senior and lives with my dad because he can’t stand to talk to my mother anymore, and their constant fighting was one of the reasons my parents ultimately divorced. It was awful. Losing sleep to the sound of yelling and whatnot. The bad blood practically stained the walls. I live with my mom but I go and see my dad daily, because they are right next to each other.\n\nFast forward to today, where this story takes place. I was spending time at a girl friends house  when my mom called and told me to come home. Being the teenage boy I am, I waited a minute or two to actually leave, since she wouldn’t be able to tell exactly how long it would take me to get home. I get home, my mom takes the keys to my car because I came home past a curfew, which by the way, I didn’t know existed. I guess it was some unspoken rule. Sure, 10:30 on a wednesday is late, but it was one strike and I was out. I’ve come home late before, and she didn’t seem happy, but she seemed to be enforcing a rule before telling me it even was one.\n\nNow, I fully acknowledge that it is her car and she is free to take it at any time. With that being said, I still don’t believe it was fair. I packed my backpack and told her I was going to get the mail. I walked out past my PO box and out the gate, past the road and into my dads house. (She knows I’m here and knows I’m safe, etc.) I left because I knew if I stayed I would’ve said something I shouldn’t have. Something my brother would say to her. My dad is cool with me staying, but he hasn’t said anything to me about my decision to stay the night. (My parents still talk about everything together.)\n\nObviously, it’s not the smartest thing to do, but I’m not mentally in the correct place to make the best choices. However, I think I am old enough and should have the freedom to live with whoever I like, since there is no court mandated living conditions. I have too much weighing on me right now with school, relationships, mental health, existential shit, etc. to have to put more straws on my proverbial camel’s back. I just want to be left alone, and my dad’s doing a pretty good job at understanding that. Sorry if my story is jumbled or too convoluted, I’m in a lot of stress and I can’t put my ideas together very properly at the moment.\n\nTL;DR: My mom took my car away for a reason I don’t believe was justified, so I responded by staying with my dad instead.\n\nAITA?\n\nWIBTA if I continued to stay with my dad? \n",

      "description": "I belong to one of those wedding groups where they criticize camo wedding dresses and neon yellow bridesmaid dresses and whatnot. They post screenshots of crazy wedding related things. There was a post about someone with two kids who started a go fund me to raise $300 for a venue deposit and they’d pay the rest of the venue cost with their tax return. \n\nSo that’s already problematic. Considering a deposit of that size the venue itself and everything will probably cost $1500+. Generally everyone was saying “if they don’t even have $300 to their name why is their primary focus on a wedding”\n\nEspecially with two kids. One trip to urgent care or needing new brakes on your car will completely dry that money up. Tons of people were saying that. But when I repeated that exact thing and said if I had less than 3 grand in my savings I’d panic and never consider spending that much on a wedding someone said I was an ass.\n\nWhy me being singled out idk. I’m not blind to poverty and struggles. I see a lot of my friends struggle to get by. I safely have a couple grand in my bank account. So YES. I would be panicking if I didn’t have that money. My total bills a month come to about $1300. With enough left to comfortably have enough gas money and can go shopping and enjoy any play money. I wasn’t “flexing” as they called it. I live modestly and within the means of my salary. I only bought a new car because I could.\n\nSo yes, I’m fully aware people live paycheck to paycheck. But being called an asshole and ignorant because i said $300 is not a good safety net to be spending all foreseeable money  on a wedding reception that isn’t mandatory and crowd funding for it doesn’t seem responsible.\n\nPeople deserve to have nice things. You shouldnt shame poor people for wanting and having nice things. \n\nSo am I the asshole for literally just saying I’d panic if I didn’t have 3 grand let alone $300. I guess I’m looking for people’s opinions on financial stuff. I feel like it’s taboo anymore to acknowledge you “do okay” finances wise. More and More I see people just down others throats. Same girl told another commenter her life must be “charming” because she agreed having $300  to your name isn’t a lot and a full blown wedding shouldn’t be a focus. \n\nI don’t really care that much I get some people have other opinions but I’ve increasingly see people be “shamed” (rolls eyes at that term) for being lower to average middle class and just doing “okay”",

Before she was living in a shared house and once they found someone to rent her room she came to live with me.  \n\nIt really didn’t take long before things went south.  She’s pretty messy, she picks fights over dumb stuff like tv, she’s been smoking inside when I’m not around even though she agreed to go outside to smoke.  She’s also gotten really controlling about what we do in our free time.  All she wants to do is sit around here and if I go out without her she’ll get mad.  Lately she’s also been saying she wants to quit her job and find something else which is a huge red flag for me.  \n\nIt’s just not working out.   I know we’ll probably break up when I tell her I want to leave, but if this is what living with her is like it’s probably for the best.   I wouldn’t just let her go homeless, I’d give her time to find another house share, but part of me feels guilty.  She can’t move back to where she was before so she’ll have to live with new people.

      "description": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nNew Years Eve 2018, my friend from school hosted a party in his summer house to celebrate the upcoming new year. I was told it was supposed to be a get-together sort of thing between our friend group, but it turned out not to be.\n\nThere were around 100 people invited to a small house that was being heated by 3-4 radiators that didn’t really do much. This happened in Scandinavia (it was around -6 F), it was really fucking cold. The party went as it should, kinda. I got absolutely hammered because I was preparing to talk my crush (Let's call her QT).\n\nI go upstairs with her (win amirite). Be me, about to shoot my shot, just to have my ex's (plural) show up to shame and laugh at both me and QT. I told the host to kick them out but he was too fucked to comprehend how mad I was. I lost QT, and I found out 20 min later she went to the sauna to fuck my best friend. Ouch. Best friend was also sorta taken,so his 'gf' and I were both fuming.\n\nAt this point, the party was ruined for me. I was cold, hurt, pissed and just overall done. I went to dance and wait for the countdown. As the countdown happened, I see QT and best friend french next to me. I go upstairs to drink and I see a person I don't know (Let's call her Stupid Cow).\n\nStupid Cow is contemplative drunk and is talking about her problems for about 20 min as I'm trying to insinuate I give negative fucks right now. Two of my friends (Friend A and B) come in the room and kick Stupid Cow out because they don't like her. Me and the two friends go to the bed and start talking about how big of a disaster the party is for about 2-3 hours until I get tired and try to sleep.\n\nI'm trying to sleep but the 2 friends are drunk and won’t shut the fuck up. At this point everyone else has left. That is, everyone but our friend group (including best friend and his 'gf'), Stupid Cow who wasn't supposed to stay the night, my two other friends, and of course me. I get totally fed up and take the radiator downstairs and sleep on the couch doused in semen and barf. I see other friend (Friend C) crying and freezing so I invite her to the couch where we warm up pillows on the radiator to keep warm for the next 5 hours.\n\nNow, the burglary. At some point we hear a noise in the next room, and we were frightened. Normally, I would go see what the noise was but not that day. I was drunk, freezing, hurt, pissed, and resting my ass on cum. As was Friend C. We had a conversation that went down like this.\n\n\"Yo, someone is out there, did you remember to lock the door?\"\n\n\\-Fuck it, I couldn't be fucked right now. I honestly hope this place gets robbed.\n\nWe leave in the morning and find out some money, drinks and a rug were stolen. We also assume the thief took the house key. AITA for letting this happen?\n\nTLDR; Shit party--&gt; friend fucks my crush--&gt; freezing my dick off--&gt; sleep in cum and barf--&gt; Let the house get robbed even though I could've easily stopped it.",

      "description": "This happened about 7 years ago, but my friends recently bought it up and were having a laugh about it, so I'm wondering what your take on the situation is, since I felt like an asshole back then and I'm unsure about it now. \n\nBackground: this girl, let's call her Sofia, was throwing a quinceanera (is it \"quinceanera party\"? I'm not sure what to call it exactly), and she had a crush on me. I wasn't interested in her for whatever reason, but we were friends. \n\nTo the party: my friends and I attended, and we were just hanging out when some of Sofia's friends approached me and told me that I needed to go dance with Sofia. I didn't want to do this for a few reasons: 1) I don't really like to dance, 2) I wasn't interested in Sofia and didn't want to lead her to thinking I was, and 3) it just seemed like an all-around awkward situation. I only told Sofia's friends the first reason, however. They called me an asshole and walked away.\n\nLater, her friends approached me again and told me that Sofia was really upset that I refused to dance with her on such a special day, and that I should just dance with her to make her feel better. I said no again, this time because it seemed like it would've really magnified the awkwardness of the situation if I danced with her when she already knew I didn't want to.    \nAt that point, her friends asked me to leave, which I did. I was later told that Sofia cried in the bathroom for some time because of this, which made me feel absolutely terrible. Sofia also didn't talk to me much after that night, although we were never really close to begin with. \n\nWas I the asshole?",

      "title": "AITA For ruining my mom's relationship with her boyfriend?",
      "description": "This happened a while ago when I was about 13, and it still bothers me to this day. I have a tendency to overly blame myself for things, so I really don't know if I am really the one to blame. I'm just not sure if holding all of this guilt is worth it. This is my first Reddit post, so I deeply apologize if it's too long or I break a rule. Also, I am female, which will be relevant later. Well, here goes nothing.\n\nMy mom's ex-boyfriend is Indian, and follows a lot of traditional Hindu values. I did not know exactly what they were at the time (and I'm definitely not an expert on them now), so I treated him like I would treat anyone else. He didn't seem to have a problem with it until my mom and I went over to his house. He lives in a rural area, and we were told that he had a lot of animals. I am a big animal lover, so I was really excited to see them. When we got there, all I saw at first was his house. No animals, but a pretty nice house (except there was a back room where the floor was being remodeled, but it was nice overall.) I asked him where the animals were, and we went outside to see them in cramped cages in the backyard. For example, there was a rabbit with a cage that was barely larger than herself, with some spoiled bedding and old salad. The rabbit wasn't in too bad condition, but she definitely wasn't happy at all. The other animals were in about the same conditions, and I learned later that they didn't get any veterinary care.\n\nMy mom's ex had a daughter that was about my age at the time, probably a bit younger. She seemed to love the animals, but when I asked her about maybe giving them a bit more care in terms of health, she got really defensive. So I dropped the topic and didn't talk about it much.\n\nMy mom's ex also had two dogs, and neither of them were allowed in the house. The only thing he gave them was water and dog food, and only one bowl of each per day. The second time we came over, one of the dogs disappeared into the woods, and he wasn't found again. My mom and I convinced her ex to let in the other dog (I forgot his name) to the crappy back room, which is connected to the backyard. We slept over his house that night, and all I could hear was the dog's sad howling echoing throughout the house until I went over to the backroom with my blanket and pillow and slept on the dirty floor with the dog. Thankfully, the dog stopped howling after that and cuddled with me. I love that dog.\n\nThe next day, my mom and her ex found me sleeping on the floor with his dog and he got extremely angry. He yelled at me and called me an idiot, saying that I could get a disease from the dog or something. I said nothing for the first minute of his yelling, but then I just couldn't take it anymore and started to talk back. I told him that maybe if he had taken his dog to the vet for once, maybe I wouldn't be at risk for some disease (I was fine afterwards anyway). This made him so mad that he threatened to beat me, but then my mom showed up and calmed us down. I had gotten to the point where I was crying, so I just ran back to the room i was supposed to sleep in. On the way home, my mom lectured me about respecting my elders.\n\nA week or two later, my mom and I were invited to his family reunion. This is where it all goes downhill. I had really bad anxiety and depression, and I had begged my mom to not make me go, but she made me go anyway. I was also pretty awkward, and I believe my awkwardness was mistaken for disrespect to his family. I tried not to talk to anyone or make eye contact, but when I had to, at least half of what I said was \"uh,\" \"um,\" or just hesitation. I tried my best to be polite, but since I didn't know very much about their culture, I wasn't entirely sure how to. My mom's ex's family made an Indian dinner, but I tried to politely refuse it because I really do not like Indian food, or spicy food in general. They kept on insisting that I should eat it, but when I finally caved and tried a bite, I'm sure the look on my face gave away that I did not enjoy it, and they seemed upset about it. I still feel pretty guilty about that.\n\nThe next day, (we spent the night there), I overheard my mom talking to her ex outside. He was telling my mom that I was being rude and that I should be punished. My mom tried to tell him that I didn't mean any harm, but he just assumed that I did. I walked away after hearing all of it, and I didn't really talk much until we left and drove home. It was a long drive, maybe 3 to 5 hours (I don't remember exactly how long it was.) It was also late at night, so I felt very drowsy. I wanted to sleep on the way home, so I just curled up in the backseat. I couldn't sleep because it was cold, and my window was open, so I closed it. Then, my window was open again, and I closed it again without giving it much thought. My mom's ex exploded. He yelled at me for closing the window, because he was trying to drive without falling asleep, so he wanted it to be colder. Then he went on an extremely long rant about how inconsiderate and disrespectful I am, saying that I shouldn't talk to adults like they are equals. He used his daughter as an example, and told her to speak her mind. She didn't say anything, and he said that's how it's supposed to be, because adults are talking. He called me a lot of bad names and cursed at me, and he even blamed my mom for not raising me right. I ended up crying myself to sleep as he ranted about how terrible I was, mostly to my mom after the example with his daughter. When we got home, my mom took her ex's advice and scolded me for being so stupid. A few days later, he broke up with her because of my ignorance. She said it wasn't my fault, but i knew it was.\n\nThat's the end of my story. Am I the asshole, or is it my mom's ex?\n\nP.S. My mom's ex is NOT my father and we are not related at all.\n\nTL;DR I was being socially awkward and made my mom's ex so angry that he broke up with my mom.",

      "description": "It's my boyfriend and It's birthday this week and my sister got us a deal for a really nice, expensive restaurant in town. It's somewhere we've both really wanted to try but never got round to doing so we've been excited about it all month. On the day our table was booked we got ready and dressed up in the morning to go out and then sat around the flat for a while killing time. All of a sudden my boyfriend becomes, quite spontaneously, really anal about tidying the flat. He never usually does much of the housework so it was strange to, all of a sudden, see him darting around with a bin bag and polishing rag. He started clearing out cupboards etc. and asking me to look through things so we could throw some stuff out before we left. I, half-heartedly, started to help then asked why it was necessary for us to be doing this right this minute, an hour or so just before we're due to go out. He became really grumpy and passive aggressive about it all and made little comments about how certain shelves were needing dusted and how the little bin in the bathroom needed emptying and how he supposed he would just have to get it himself. Neither of us are particularly on the ball with housework (we both work 13 hour shifts and are rarely at home). I pointed out he had just as much a responsibility to clean this stuff as me and, again, asked why it was necessary to be doing it right now. He, then, made a comment about how he was feeling pressured to get everything finished that he'd started cause we were supposed to leave soon. I said, again, that there was no need for him to have even started all this right now and he was the only one putting pressure on himself. At this point I was feeling really irritated and let down as I had been really excited about going out to dinner and now it felt like it had been ruined. So, of course, we finally got out and I just wasn't really into it. He was trying to make conversation but kept dropping in little comments about how quiet I was and that I was being moody. Afterwards he said I'd ruined the whole meal for him and I told him he'd done the same for me by making such a, pointlessly, big deal about cleaning before we went out. He said I was being immature and now neither of us are talking to each other. So, AITA for being so annoyed about the whole thing?",

      "description": "Didn't really know how to title this cuz it's kinda a long story.\n\nI made the classic mistake of asking out my best friend. I think it's important to note that our friendship long pre-dated any romantic feelings I had for her. Anyway, I was pretty confident she was into me too, and this is coming from someone that doesn't exactly have an abundance of confidence when it comes to the opposite sex. Turns out I was wrong, and we had a long conversation about the situation. One of the things she said to me was that since I'm her best friend, she could never do anything that could risk that falling apart (like being in a romantic relationship with me). We talked it out, decided we were cool, she gave me a hug, said to text her tomorrow, and I went on my way. It hurt of course, but I was fully prepared to move on, and just be her friend again, because like I said before, our friendship came long before I had feelings for her, and I truly valued that friendship for what it was, not just as a means to dating her. This will be important soon. \n\nSo the next day I went to text her and found that she decided to lose my number and block me on social media. I went to her dorm to see wtf was up, and she basically shut the door in my face. As little sense as it made to me, I knew at that point I had to respect that she needed space (even though she never said that to me, she didn't say anything) and so I stopped trying to contact her. The thing is that this hurt a lot more than her not wanting to go out with me. She was my best friend. And over all the years of our relationship, I was always there for her. She needed help with homework, I was there. She was having a mental breakdown because of stress, I listened to her vent on the phone till she felt better. The point is I was always there for her, and I felt really hurt and betrayed that she could just throw that all away without so much as an explanation for why she didn't want me in her life anymore. I'd like to take a moment here to point out that this is not some incel/nice guy complex going on. I understood and accepted that she didn't share the same feelings as me, and I could never force her to feel that way about me. I wasn't her friend, and I wasn't doing all those things to support her with hopes of her returning the favor in some romantic way. I know she doesn't owe me a relationship because I was nice to her. Like I said before, our friendship long pre-dated any of this mess, and I valued that friendship for what it was. \n\nWith that out of the way, all this happened about a year ago, and I hadn't seen her or said a word to her since. Until today. I was walking out of class with another friend of mine (who is also friends with her) and we ran into her. They started talking a little, she saw the brace on my ankle and asked if I was okay, and we kinda just pretended that nothing ever happened for about 30 secs and then went our separate ways. I've since accepted that our friendship is over, and I'm not really mad at her anymore. But seeing her again today for the first time in over a year got me thinking about it again. So Reddit, my question is, AITA for feeling hurt that my best friend at least owes me some kind of explanation for cutting me out of her life? Also, for any women out there, please help me understand wtf is going in her mind right now, because clearly I can't read her mind, and I'd just like to understand how this happened.",

      "description": "Working on mobile, blablabla\n\nI was working for a grocer, large chain which supports health, global social initiatives, so on. I worked as a part time employee while I was in between jobs, but I had wanted the job for years. I thought maybe I could stick around and move up in the company. I have pretty extensive knowledge and skill working with food and do consider myself a diligent employee. \n\nAt first everything seemed to be going well. I was learning quickly, picking up shifts when requested, and within a few months I was tasked with opening the department alone which was normally a management duty. I happily expected and thought everything was going well. I got along with all staff, including the manager. After a few months I started to notice a change.\n\nThe manager would get angry. Throwing utensils, punching paper towel dispensers, and just spoke rudely and shortly with myself and a few others. When he was being friendly to me, it was through him speaking poorly of others in the store or department. Or making inappropriate comments about the female staff of the store. This was the beginning of my frustration, but I disregarded and kept doing my best as I wanted to move forward in the company. I wanted to become full time and hoped to get myself into a different department. I always asked for feedback on my performance and how I could improve. I had all intentions on staying around and moving on. \n\nAs time went on, the managers attitude became more and more aggressive. The bad moods lasted longer, the insults were stronger, and it was just not a comfortable environment. I became close with other employees of the department who were also noticing the behavior. We all knew how we would talk about others and it was no surprise to hear what was said until one day a full time position opened, and I was excited. I thought I was doing fine, I was not receiving any negative feedback and was constantly working extra shifts and taking on more responsibility, all given to me by the manager in question. \n\nWhen I expressed excitement for the position to my coworkers I was told I'm not getting the job. They were not putting me down as a joke, they were informing me of what the manager said when I wasnt around. That I was too slow, that I would never get a full time position from him, that if I tried to change departments then he would make my life hell, and ended the rant by calling me a \"piece of shit faggot\". \n\nI was livid, confused, shocked and disappointed. I took my concerns to a floor manager who essentially said this was speculation, he said she said type stuff. My intention was not to have him fired, but to move to another department where I could get proper feedback and opportunity. But because this was supposedly speculation, they had no reason to move me. I then took this to the highest manager of the store. I expressed that I'm not doing this to cause trouble, I just want a fair opportunity. I laid it all on the line, said everything I heard from others and witnesses myself. She asked for me to write it all out and I did. What I didnt know is that she was opening an investigation as it was corporate policy. \n\nOther team members were called in for interviews, and about two weeks later the manager was escorted from the building. \n\nI worked at the store for about 6 months, he was there for 6 years in a management role. I dont know how long he had been treating people this way but I didnt feel right at the time. I felt bad for getting the man fired. He had kids and a mortgage as many middle aged men do, I never wanted to be responsible for adding that stress to a person's life, even if he wasnt quite fair to me. \n\nAdditionally, after the investigation, all of the employees who came forward on this behavior were fired for very small reasons. I resigned about a month later as the environment from management was cold. They didn't want to fire the guy either, but the policy of investigation caused him to be let go. The highest managers of the store were crying over losing this employee, almost as if his behavior should have been disregarded? And I was given a cold shoulder from most other employees of the store, as many were not aware of this behavior. \n\nAm I the asshole here? The way I was treated after the fact makes me feel like I am. But at the same time, that behavior to be allowed in such a store, such an environment, is just appalling. \n\nWhat do you think, reddit?",

      "description": "I tried being nice and helping him though some shit but honestly he treated me like shit so I was done. But he invited me over and just played video games all night and didn’t let me play and ignored my advances on him, he cried saying his ex didn’t tell him happy birthday yet totally ignored my message, he insulted my friend in front of all his friends, he would get blackout drunk a few times a month, he would regularly ignore my messages, I was the last one to be invited to his New Years party, he would point out how oily I was and how much dandruff I have (I have complained to him about these issues I had), he wouldn’t wanna cuddle, and he always complained that I never showed him my true feelings yet he literally didn’t show me emotions. I guess I freaked him out when I tried to get too close so I detached. I didn’t invite him to go to places with me, he didn’t meet my family, he didn’t meet my friends really, I never said I love you and I never intentionally left shit at his place. I tried really hard to not come on strong once he told me I went too fast too quick... i invited him on my vacation because I had planned it already and was going alone and I sent him nudes on the trip and he just said “your booty white” and ignored the message, and then later on I came home at like five am and he fucked me and went to sleep and didn’t even say thanks for my present, ever. \n\n\nI said: \nSo I’m unsure of how you felt pressured. \n\nI didn’t wanna Make you feel like shit so I hid my feels. My friends wouldn’t treat me this shitty ever. \nVeronica would never invite me over and get blackout and then play games all night or only invite me to an event she planned after I asked her about it. or be rude about my other friend in front of people I hardly know. And Honestly no one in my life who I know would ignore my birthday wish (I wanted to be the first so I told you on the eve and you ignored that text so I gave you space because you wanted to not be that emotionally involved) then come to me drunk and upset about someone else not telling them happy birthday. Like honestly what the fuck? Who the fuck does that. And then to be like oh this girl who I used to date is one of those people, but she’s too cool now for me and living in LA....? (So you probably would drop everything to be with her if you had the chance to... that’s greaaaaaat.... that’s why you’ve been wanting me to take it slow... slow enough to not be alone till she’s available?) Like honestly I feel bad for you and wanted to do what I could to make you happy but try and treat people who try to show they care about you right and don’t be a dick to them. It’s fucking depressing... I always was optimistic but you didn’t seem to appreciate that at the time. I don’t even think you really appreciate it now. You say you do but your actions don’t. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said: But one that I remember early on is you getting upset with me while you were in Hawaii for not really taking it that serious when you asked if I wanted to come join you (I literally asked if he wanted to go.... he said he couldn’t affford it and I said ok, i just thought it would be a fun thing but I understand... no pressure cause I know this is new, I’m just going alone so thought I’d ask). I made a joke about your tan line like the girl from the suntan bottle because I did not think I was insulting you but kinda being cute everyone has a tanline on their butt (I literally sent him a nude and he said “lol”) and you took great offense yo that and then when oh got back it was like super early and I did not think not freaking out you were back would be that big of a deal because we were going to hang out normal people times soon (he hardly talked to me, fucked me, went to sleep- I was gone for two weeks prior). I said I wanted you to tell me if I was doing things like that because I felt at that point I did not know what I was doing sometimes but maybe you were just more sensitive than I realized.\n\nThen blackout drunk thing was bad (but more for me I just shouldnt be doing that stuff) but as you know people on drugs are not themselves and are very unaware of what they were doing then you played it cool at the time only to leave in the morning and the plan was to just necer talk to me or see me again ignore my calls (I answered his calls... ) and texts forcing me to go and try to get an explanation that could have been a little sign I cared ya know if you just ghosted me and I didn’t give a shit why would I go to your place I would have just been like cool now I don’t have to deal with it \nI am not an alcoholic but I do have issues sometimes with taking my drinking too far and I guess my actions during those times are going to be put under a microscope the most instead of how I am sober. That is fine I was shitty to you those times I got drunk and I am sorry but as someone who said they have dealt with drug issues in the past maybe you could have talked to me about it and how the actual drinking was bothering you and how I acted during states of drunkenness were not okay and I would have listened not just ditch me and make me have to go to your place for you to finally tell me. \n\nSorry for being shitty I get the picture and I apologize. If you still just want to keep being mad and bring stuff up some more that is fine as well if it helps you out. And you can believe whatever you want to believe about me and my appreciation or feelings for you back then I know how I felt and that is fine again whatever helps you feel better. If you want to keep writing this stiff out I suggest doing it on a piece of paper or journal or something cuz me just responding and trying to make you not blame yourself is obviously riling you up and I am not responding anymore.\n\nSorry for everything you are a way better person than me so just take some comfort in the fact you don’t have to put up with my shit anymore.  Feel better, goodbye",

      "description": "first off, this is a throwaway due to some of my family and friends knowing my real user.\n\nalright so before christmas, my family usually does a big get-together while everyone is still off work/school/home from uni etc... otherwise we never get to see eachother. so, my cousin, he's 16 and he's huge. not fat or anything like that, he's really tall and very strong and prone to terrible tantrums so a lot of us are kind of on edge about saying or doing the wrong thing that'd set him off.\n\nanyways, he goes through these phases of latching onto different people, and recently he's latched onto my little sister. so during the get-together they were in her room playing video games. now, something that evening had already put him in a bit of a mood. for as long as i can remember, we've had to go out of our way to cater to him, not to his needs, but to what he wants, otherwise he kicks off. so anyways, he asks me if he can play red dead redemption 2, i tell him no because he's not 18 yet, this pisses him off and he runs to tell his mum. his mum pulls me aside and asks me to let him play because its just a game, i tell her i know that its just a game but the last game i let him play, he completely erased all my progress and i didn't want to risk it with this game. everyone's shocked because i said no to him.\n\nmy sister eventually lets him play one of her games, and while their playing, my sister asks him how schools going because he starts college soon and he tells her its fine, and he's been texting loads of girls from school. my sister is concerned because there was an instance where he was excluded for a few days because of complaints that he harasses girls in the year below him. his parents use his autism as an excuse, and while i know that he obviously cant function like other kids his age, making up excuses for him teaches him nothing so he just carries on doing it.\n\nbut anywho, my sister asks to see a text or two and then that was it. he just completely lost it. smashed one of our controllers and starts throwing stuff around the room. the mood is fucked, everyone leaves early, our annual get-together completely ruined. last year was a special one, too. one of my cousins had a baby and she brought him over for me to meet for the first time, my older brother was going to announce his engagement and my family met my girlfriend for the first time since i came out to them, and all of it was ruined over something so silly.\n\nwell, fast forward to christmas day, i wake up to my sister crying her eyes out next door because he had sent her a text saying that he hates her and that she's a cunt and she ruined christmas. i tell her to just ignore it and to tell our mum if he carries on. and boy did he carry on. over the next few days she got texts from him saying that he hopes she gets stabbed and dies, that he hates her and doesnt ever want to talk to her, that he's going to come over and beat her up and calls her a n***er. eventually she blocks him and we go on with our lives.\n\nwell, recently we got a call saying that he'd been arrested for domestic violence against his mum and that he's now living with a foster family and that he wants to see me, my mum, brother and nan. my brother was ruled out immediately as he's in america, my mum said no because of the texts, so me and my nan were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and maybe try to get an apology. onto yesterday, he sends my sister an onslaught of horrible messages on fb, some really disgusting and violent stuff and i got so angry i called him and told him i wont be meeting him until he feels like he can start being nice to my sister again and stop sending her vile messages. he kicks off over the phone, says he hates me because im not letting him get his own way. i tell him he cant always get his own way and if he's gonna be like that then i dont want to see him, and then i hung up.\n\napart from my mum, sister, a cousin and an uncle, everyone now seems to think im being selfish and unreasonable.\n\nso please, am i the asshole??",

      "description": "I recently had a one night stand with this girl and I was wondering if I was asshole in this situation.\n\nShe started off by giving me a blow job (with condom on), I think she just meant it as foreplay rather me ejaculating. But after 15 minutes I did. Afterwards she asked me to give her oral in return, I said I can’t because I have no protection. She said it unfair because I had an orgasm and she didn’t. I offered to do hand stuff to her or if she was willing to wait 30minutes we can have sex. She got angry with me and started calling me derogatory terms and threated to tell all her friends that I am pussy and is bad at bed \\[we didn’t have sex\\]. I felt a little uncomfortable and left. \n\nI know I was selfish in not reciprocating oral sex, but I personally feel that her reaction was a bit too much.",

      "description": "I'm trying to keep this short. I have this weird relationship with my ex where I  sleep over at her place quite frequently. She knows me better than anyone and we consider each other friends. She's the most important person in my life, as she has helped me heal from my mental illness, get me off drugs and graduate and get a job. She has done a lot for me, although at times I feel she can be bit manipulative. After we broke up I went back to her for support as my life started to spiral out of control.\n\nLately I have been not wanting to sleep at my ex's place, I've felt I need my own space and I'm trying to date and meet other people.  She texted me in the afternoon she wanted my help with something and said she wished I would come over. I didn't reply. Then she calls me and asks, I don't want to tell where I am and I answer I'm not sure if I want to come over. I'm working late and going to the gym, and she tries to call me again. I feel like I need my own space so instead of answering the call I'll reply that I would drop over to help. I felt like I didn't want to stay the night, although I didn't say this. So I'm going to the gym and waiting the bus, this takes a couple of hours and at this point it is around 18:00. She texts me if I need a lift. I don't reply, as I'm already on my way to the bus stop. Then she calls, and I tell that I'm coming.\n\nWhen I arrive I start to feel bad, I feel like I want to go home, so I'm thinking of helping her and taking a bus home. When I come in she's sitting there and telling me she wants my help with setting up a camera. I get frustrated because I feel she could have done this by herself, and I tell her this. She then says that we can do it together. She offers me food, I decline. We take care of the camera thing and I start to contemplate on leaving. She comes to me and says:\n\n\"Do you want me to take you home so that you don't feel obligated to be here and stay over?\n\nI took a shower though and I would really not like to get ill as the weekend is coming\"\n\nAs she's offering me this, I'm feeling anxious and want to go home:\n\n\"I'd like you to take me home, please\"\n\nThen she gets really upset and mad, and we walk to her car. I feel like shit and super guilty.\n\nWe don't speak a word the whole way and she drops me off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel that I'm guilt tripped, I'm trying to remind her and she didn't need to offer me a lift.\n\nAm the asshole?",

      "description": "Alright first! My grammar is crap if I mess up please excuse it. Second this was a long time ago and now a days I wouldn't do this and honestly I wouldn't give a crap about the situation as a hole. \n\nAlright to start i used to babysit for my dad's girlfriend she had three kids I'm only going to focus on one at the moment Kathy is what I'll call be calling her. It started with me essentially doing the usual I would wait for them to come home from school feed them and let them do whatever. (keeping them from trying to kill each other) at som point we were outside in the back yard she had applied gotten a lot of cards from someone at her school, about 20 or so Yu-Gi-Oh cards.\n\n She was showing them off to her brothers simply enough I didn't mind or care about it that much until she pulled out a lighter and started burning the damn things. If anyone here collects card like I did I'm sure you may have the same pain I did. I asked Kathy. \n\nMe:\"Kathy! What are you doing? Didn't you say[guys name I can't remember] gave them to you?\" \n\nKathy:\"yah\" *is picking up another and is  burning the corners*\n\nMe:\"then why are you burning it?\"\n\nKathy: \"it's mine I can do what I want with it\" \n\nI don't stop her after that, she burns the corners of some and burning a couple completely. Then picks up and goes back inside her brothers in toe. \n\n(Also if your going to yell at me for letting her play with a lighter she was twelve and had a screaming temper tantrum when I tried to stop her from taking her blankets and sheets outside after it had rained outside at one point, her mom didn't give one, and I didn't feel like fighting with her that day) \n\nAnyways I go back in and continued through the day mostly forgetting about it. A few days later she was in the kitchen table and had the Yu-Gi-Oh cards and some other random playing cards out playing out again to put it simple she was flinging them around the kitchen playing some game, I asked her to clean up her stuff so I could sweep and mop. She hardly torches a thing and runs off. *Sigh*\n\nAnyways I cleaned up the kitchen and have all the cards that were all over the kitchen in a stack on the table. Im frustrated with the lack of care with Kathy not giving a crap about something that was given to her. I'm ashamed to say I pocketed them. It's as simple as that. In my head at the time she didn't deserve them she wanted to destroy and ruin something that was a \"gift\"(started thinking maybe she stole them) What i think was the saddest part is that she never asked about them after...like at all. I expected her to ask if anyone had seen them but no, nothing it was as if they never existed after I took them. Am I the asshole?\n",

      "description": "Context: I work in the print section of an office supply store. I don’t know the actual floor super well, but usually I can get by. Most of my workday is spent printing or taking orders. My boss is known for being really weird with female employees, but especially me because I’m the youngest on staff. \n\n\nSo today I was coming back from a 15 minute break, and a woman asked me where something was, and I wasn’t sure. So I used my radio and ask if anybody knows where it is. So at first, I am ignored. Then my coworker who is also in the print shop gets the attention of our boss. Conversation is as follows:\n\nBoss: Have you taken her to the aisle to look? \nMe: No? I wasn’t sure if we even sold it so heading to a random aisle didn’t seem worthwhile. \nBoss: Did you look? \nMe: ...no? \n\nMy boss then gets up with an exaggerated sigh, comes over and tells me and the woman to follow him to aisle 13. That would be fine, but he INSISTED I take his arm like I was his prom date as we headed over. Now - he’s been flirtatious with me before and I’ve made it clear I don’t like it, as he’s older than my father is and his youngest child is the same age as me, but he insists anyway. Not wanting to be impolite and make the situation tense, I try and joke it off. \n\nMe: Sorry, heh, I don’t think my boyfriend would be okay with this...\nBoss, while still insisting: I’m not trying to be your BOYFRIEND, I just don’t want you to get LOST, little lady. \n\nI continue to not take it and he eventually gives up with a big upset huff, and he leads me and the woman to the aisle. I then have to ask for help again because I know nothing about what she’s asking for, and ask over the headset. Again, I’m ignored until two of my print shop coworkers get the attention of an OFF DUTY MANAGER who then comes to help me. \n\nAMITA? Should I have just taken his arm? ",

      "description": "I've been with my boyfriend for over a year now and I've known him for 4 1/2 years-- I used to really not be the jealous type but I've been struggling with it ever since we hit a rough patch a few months ago where he was having jealousy issues. We've since moved on from that, but for some reason that all triggered something in me and I know find myself quietly worrying to myself about if he'd prefer someone that's asian over me (I'm white).\n\nThough I have these feeling I recognize that he isn't doing anything to make me worry and that it's my mind playing tricks on me and tend to not be accusative towards him with these feelings, instead I tell him when I'm feeling jealous and why so he reassures me that it's just in my head. I'm seeing a therapist and have been diagnosed with anxiety so I'm working on it.\n\nBUT around a week ago I saw a message on his phone lock screen from a foreign friend that said \"well at least you know you love her\" and I was immediately panicking. He was already asleep and I didn't want to wake him up to ask about it, so I tried to put it out of my mind and watch a documentary or two. By the time I decided I wanted to go to bed all of the what ifs were still plaguing my mind so I unlocked his phone to look at the conversation (the first time I've ever done something like this). He told her that he's been having issues where his mind wanders and will absentmindedly think of other girls from time to time and that once or twice he though of someone else while we were having sex. I immediately started crying and he woke up, I told him what I did and what I read. He explained to me that it's not conscious when it happens and he thinks that it's just a \"guy thing\" and hates that it's been happening and said he wasn't upset I snooped because he too would've been anxious about the message that was on him lockscreen. I then pressed about him thinking of someone else while we were having sex and he said that it was the same girl he messaged about this issue! He told me thought of her came and left quickly and that not focusing on me had made him go a bit flaccid. \n\nNow I feel rather insecure and have been concerned since. Today he was in the shower and I was just in the bathroom talking to him when the same friend messaged him and something in my stomach turned and I immediately looked at the conversation. I know it was wrong of me and that I shouldn't have done it and he asked me if I opened the conversation since the notification from her was gone and I told him yes, that I briefly looked but then put it away because I knew it was wrong. He told me it was okay and he truly wasn't mad but reminded me that doing things like that isn't okay. I feel terrible and I'm afraid that he's secretly mad at me even though anger wasn't something he expressed, it was comfort and reassurance instead. As far as these actions go am I the asshole here? I feel like he should be way more harsh on me than he is being :/",

      "description": "I’m 16 and about two months away from getting my license. I’ve never been a really eager driver, so the concept of having my own car is exciting but also nowhere near at the front of my mind. My mom, however, has been telling me for the last two weeks that I need to bring up the concept of me getting a car to my dad. They both have talked about it in first of me before this— they want to get me a Jeep, they asked me what color I want, etc...\nAnd that’s awesome! It was exciting to have parents so eager to talk about this stuff, and I absolutely recognized my privilege.\nThat is, until I finally brought it up at dinner tonight.\nI asked my dad a hesitant question: “Hey dad, I know the dates a little far off, but I was wondering when it gets closer if we could talk about getting a car?”\nMy dad stops before giving a short, almost incredulous chuckle— “Why do you assume you’re getting a car?”\nI was taken aback by this. I followed up with “If I need to buy my own car, that’s fine— just let me know, so that I can start planning on how to save up.” (I’m currently not working; I’m a full time AP/DE student who hardly has time to sleep, let alone work; I’ve been planning on getting a job literally the day summer break starts so I can start accruing an income, per my parents complaints and my desire to be more independent). \nMy mom (who, mind you, TOLD ME to ask in the first place) says matter-of-factly, “Why didn’t you just assume you’d be paying for it in the first place?”\nI was, again, taken aback— all previous conversations had been 100% about them buying me a car— even when I objected! However, I’m not going to turn my nose up at a generous offer, because I feel that would be ungrateful.\nSo I kind of laugh like “Sorry for asking— forget it” and my mom storms off dramatically, saying she “Can’t even have a conversation with me”— I’m then told it was a “bad look on me” to have ‘assumed’ I was getting a car by my dad. \nHere’s the thing— I hardly even WANT a car. I NEED a car. I wait for upwards of over an hour every day after school for one of my family members to come pick me up (and it’s treated like a chore and a bother— “Alright, who’s turn is it to pick up OP?” “Not me, you do it!”), and I can’t walk because we live over 3 miles of dense hilly roads away from my house with no sidewalks (and I’m not in that school’s “zone”, so busing is not an option”). \nI don’t even get why I was baited into asking if I was gonna get painted like the asshole for even having asked.",

      "description": "Title sounds pretty bad but hear me out.  I’ve been dating this girl for about a month now. I like her a lot and the relationship is actually pretty good. We relax together, introduced each other to our respective favourite video games and as such spend a lot of time playing them with each other. Things have been good so far but for the past week or so her behaviour has been very up and down. She has very intense mood swings,  and I mean really intense. One moment everything is fine and then one little thing such as her burger has onions on it sends her crashing down. \n\nI have depression and anxiety myself, so I get it. Sometimes it’s the straw that broke the camels back, but every little straw breaks the poor camels back here. It’s getting very tough to always be the loving supportive boyfriend when she knows she has these struggles and refuses to try new medication or resume her old cycle of meds because “it’s like chemical castration” according to her. I get that a healthy sex drive is important but when you have depression so bad getting your order at a restaurant wrong ruins your mood for the whole day, sometimes sacrifices have to be made. \n\nI really like this girl but it’s getting very hard to balance my own mental health with hers. I’m scared to bring these concerns up with her for fear that she’ll just go straight to the worst case scenario and do something drastic. I’m just not sure she’s the right one for me and I’m genuinely wondering if I would be the asshole if I broke up with her or if the way I feel is justified. I’d even take a middle ground solution because I do like her but her refusal to get the help she clearly (and self admittedly,) needs makes me hesitant to continue the relationship well.  So WIBTA?

      "description": "This is a clusterfuck of a story, prepare. Throwaway because my friends know my main. \n\nSo I'm a 20y/o female with three brothers (all older) and live together with my mom and youngest brother. The main character in this post is my 32 yo brother, let’s call him Arlo. His life is really fucked up. His relationship fell apart, he doesn't see his kid often, doesn't have a job (or a degree), hangs out with the wrong types of people, parties a lot, ends up wasting what little money he has, gets into trouble, etc. The point is, it sucks. \n\nWe're family, in my culture that means that when we need each other, we all help. \n\nArlo would give me some pocket money when I was younger and even bought me a nice phone together with his gf. During his relationship he was at his best. Life was good and he would visit a lot with his family. \n\nThe relationship fell apart because of reasons and everything went downhill. She got the house, so Arlo had to move out. He would lend money from my mom (€1000+), brother, his friends and me (accumulated to €1000+) to buy food, furniture for his new home, and to just get by . **He never bought furniture or payed rent.** He lost his home. Myself, I got into debts because I trusted him one too many times.\n\nNow finally the situation: He lives with us now and almost never pays ANYTHING, but does go out to his ‘friends’ and parties a lot. Last Thursday his phone died and he was bored. The next day he asked for the password to my tablet so he could have something to do, now this tablet I got to use for school and don’t even lend to my MOM. I said no, **big mistake.** \n\nHe yelled and swore at me, threatening to break it if I didn’t unlock it. *I lost my shit.* I screamed “Break it, see what I’m gonna do.” **He broke it**. I called the cops as he was threatening to hurt me. Cops came, told him to leave and consoled me, told me to press charges against him for damages of property if he didn’t replace the tablet within two weeks. Mom kicked him out. After three days my mom told me that he called saying hadn’t eaten since that day and was sleeping in his friend’s car. \n\nI had a long talk with my mom and basically said “It’s your house and you are entitled to bring in anyone you want, but I can’t live with him without rules.” My mom called him and told him he could sleep home again but to not interact with me at all. My mom and him will talk tonight about him needing to fic his life or she will kick him out for good. He has 8 days left to replace the tablet and after that I’m pressing charges. \n\nNow my mom and I are close, so WIBTA if I convinced her to kick him out if he doesn’t replace my property or attempts to get his life together within these 8 days, even if that means he will not have any means to buy food or a place to stay? I fucking hate him, but I still feel bad as he is family and has no support system except my mom and me, as my other brothers hate his guts and completely REFUSE to help him anymore.",

      "description": "Throwaway because I'm unsure if they browse reddit or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my roommates (I have two) used to never be around last semester. However, he now brings his girlfriend over every single day, and she spends the night every single night. I used to be okay with it, but they've slowly ate away at my nerves. I'll list some of the things that they do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor clarification, the bad roommate is BR, the good roommate is GR, and my roommate's girlfriend is RG\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirstly, and most annoyingly, they have sex while me and GR are still in the room. Generally in the early morning while they think we're still asleep. This would be fine if we were actually asleep, but we're not. They're rather noisy and it's painfully obvious while they're doing this. My desk is also situated under their bed, so they think they can get away with doing it while I'm the only one in the room. News flash, the bed rocks back and forth pretty noticeably. This really wouldn't be an issue if they didn't do it while we were in the room. I've asked several times for them to let us know before they do it so we can leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, when they do wait for us to leave the room to do their thing, they lock the door without telling us. I've been locked out for hours while they fuck around in the room with my keys, wallet, and phone on my desk. I knock, but they don't get up to answer. This wouldn't be an issue if they waited until I went out to my classes or to get food, but they literally lock the door when I get up to use the bathroom or something where I don't have my ID and keys with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThirdly, when they decide NOT to lock the door, they don't text us and tell us to knock before coming in. I've walked in on them so many times, I've lost count. I don't think I should be familiar with what they look like naked, but I am, because they have no courtesy. They used to text us, but they just stopped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFIFTHLY, they are ALWAYS wasted. They both have SEVERE drinking issues and all of the above just gets ten-times worse when they're drinking. They've both vomited on the floor of our room and refuse to clean it up. They're also just slobs in general, as I found out recently. I went and did a deep-clean of the room because my allergies were acting up and I found a bin of cleaning supplies that BR hasn't touched since the beginning of the year. Well, I move the bin to clean behind it and I find two dead spiders, three dead cockroaches, and WHITE MOLD caking the underside of the bin and behind it. Needless to say, I sprayed the hell out of it with the bleach from his bin. It was absolutely FOUL. RG also leaves out food she brings over and fills mine and GR's fridge shelves with her food that she leaves there to rot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI brought this up with our floor administrator, and he said that I should be more courteous of them because it is their space, too. Now I'm conflicted, because the FA is pretty chill. Am I the asshole here?",

He only saw my sister and I around birthdays and Christmas and I eventually stopped seeing him for years.\n\nWhen my sister got married last year she invited my dad because she still keeps in touch with him. I was planning to ignore him but his mrs cornered me and my fiance making small talk and eventually inviting themselves to our town to catch up.\n\nWe have all now met up for 2 fairly awkward meals. Now that I'm preparing for my own wedding I feel like I ought to involve them to some degree. Like not inviting them to any part of my wedding is an obvious snub.\n\nIf we hadn't met recently he wouldn't even know I was getting married. I don't think I'll invite him to the main day but I'm thinking evening just out of politeness. Am I an arsehole if I just snub him and don't bother inviting him at all?",

My family lives an hour away from where I go to school and have been pressuring me to move back home after graduation. My relationships with some of them aren't bad but they aren't good either. The best relationship is with my mother who would give me her last dime if I needed it.  My sister and father on the other hand are much different. They are essentially the same person in that they want to dictate everything, be in control, and they are never wrong. I'm definitely the black sheep of the family and when I do go home I feel like a visitor instead of a family member.  Not because of how they treat me I just have different interests and passions than the three of them. I have mentioned this to my mother and it broke her heart so I haven't mentioned it again. However with graduation looming they keep asking when I'm moving back home but I'd honestly rather get a job and stay here. \n\nTL:DR I'm the black sheep in my family and don't want to move back home with some family members I don't have the best relationships with.\nWIBTA if I told them I don't want to come home?",

      "description": "Okay, so this is a bit of a read and I'm on mobile so, sorry in advance for shitty formatting. \n\nI would like to start this whole wall of post out by saying I love my brother to death, I really do. In fact, what's so frustrating is our family loves him more than he loves himself it seems like.  But anyways, let's get on with the story. \n\nMy brother is 21 years old,  I'm 18 years old. He's has been moving between my grandparents house and my parents house for the last 4 years. And for about the past year my parents have been making me pay rent to sleep in my room. Which isnt a problem, but since hes moved back in I've been coming home every day and  sleeping in the floor, and not being able to play my xbox when I want to is very frustrating when he doesn't help me pay anything at all.  Today were gonna talk about the most recent move back- in. Here's how yesterday went.\n\nI was coming home from working my 8th 12 hour shift in a row and I was really tired. (he called into work for the 4th time since starting his job 1 month ago.)  As soon as I walked into the house the conversation went like this. \n\nBrother-\"hey wanna go with me to trade my car?\"\n\nMe-\"Not really, I'm super tired\"\n\nImmediately the conversation went downhill and got physical. This is what followed. \n\nBrother-\"See this is exactly what I'm talking about you never want to do anything with me\"\n\nMe-\"i just got done working 12 hours dude I'm tired and I want to eat something\"\n\nAt this point hes started doing off on a rant about how \"you're gonna die alone because all you care about is yourself.\"  \n\nI don't really know what to think because he's right, I really dont care about cars or learning about them or going to the car meets like he always begs me to go do with him, but like I'm always so tired and the car meets are kind of of long drive away and they end later than I'd like to be out. I usually don't take days off from work either. (6:30/6:30)\n\nBack to the story he started pushing me and not letting me open the fridge door or the pantry. So, I decided I would just go to my girlfriends house and cook some food with her. \n\nI went upstairs to MY room to grab my new chessboard and he stood in the way of the steps and wouldn't move. So we got into a shoving match on the stairs. I ended up just jumping over the railing of the stairs and running outside. I got in my car and he gets on the fucking hood of my car, and that's it. He just sits there and has the dumbest smile on his face. I have a video too of him on the car and me yelling at him to get off. \n\nWell long story short my mom called me asking what happened between us and now they're throwing him out again. \n\nHe has no problem sleeping in a car but I dont want him to do that, this is like the 50th time something like this has happened and he always gets thrown out and ends up coming back because I keep feeling bad like I'm a dick for not being the best brother I can be. \n\nI've given him everything, my room, my bed, \nSO.MUCH.MONEY, and he just does stuff like this and idk I just feel like the asshole for throwing my brother out onto the streets.  What do you guys think?\n\n\n",

      "description": "Context-\nThis all happened from last summer over a couple of months, but its something that seems to be reintroducing itself into my life.\n\nLast june, I (at the time a 16 y/o trans male) had taken a break from my boyfriend (at the time 18 y/o cis male) . The relationship wasn't bad, but being young we decided to take some time apart to explore more. We had been dating since early highschool, so around 13, and neither of us wanted to miss out on the sluttiness of our teen years.\nI never really got a chance to meet anyone, but I did enjoy the freedom of flirting with people and so I downloaded grindr, which I know isn't right for someone of that age but everyone else I knew was on it and I thought it might be a laugh. Plus I was very honest about my age to anyone I spoke to. \nI instantly met one guy (late 30s-early 40s)who very quickly offered me money for sex.\nI'm not a rich person, I go to art college, and only because its free at my age but I still have to put a lot of money into supplies, and I live with my family, though we're always having a lot of money issues, mostly due to debt. At first I thought it would be some money to spend on myself, I dont often have money to throw around so I considered it, but told him I'd think about it.\nHe kept sending me messages like 'but I want to see you now!' and I'll pay more to see you tonight' an  being overall very demanding to see me, as well as asking for pictures, which I sent, despite it being as late as 1am, and me having college in the morning. I hate people talking to me like that, and can't stand being pressured into doing things because I tend to make stupid decisions when I am, which I did, and I said I would meet him but only if he picked up condoms on the way.\nI didn't give him my address but told him to meet me close by and it took him over an hour to get here because he lived that far away from me.\nHe had a pretty expensive looking car, and when he arrived, I took half the money upfront (£30) and we did what we did in his car. \nThe sex itself was really painful, forgive the detail but as a trans guy, I was used to anal sex with my now ex bf, but we had normal sex as he hadn't brought any lube and I wasnt about to tear something for him. I told him I wasn't comfortable and it was quite painful and id be happy to give the money back or give him a blowjob instead, but he demanded either sex or anal and being pinned down in someone's car doesn't leave for an easy exit. In the end, I didn't orgasm but he did, not that I was expecting an amazing time in some guys car. \nHe paid the last £20 and offered me a cigarette and a lift home. We spoke about religion (he was muslim and I'm religious too) and how our families not accepting him being gay and me being trans. it was the middle of the night and freezing even in summer and I stated very explicitly that I wanted to leave but he insisted on talking and then giving me a lift home and not letting me go until I said yes. I still wasnt willing to give him my address and instead got dropped off early, claiming to live across a field that he couldn't drive over, and I walked the rest of the way. \nThe money was pretty good and from there we started meeting more, and over the course of a couple of weeks, i had saved up about £400 which helped out with bills and things back home, under the guise that I had just been working more hours at my part time job.\nThings slowly started to get more and more uncomfortable with him, if we were having sex and I asked him to give me a moment or to change position because something was hurting, he would totally ignore me and even once when I downright told him to stop, he continued. \nI stopped seeing him for a while after that as the summer holidays came around and I started to work more for my actual job, and I was at the point where money didn't seem like a good trade for our nightly activities. He was starting to scare me, it's not easy to sneak out at midnight and meet a guy for carpark sex as a teenager. I sent him a text saying I probably wouldn't see him for a while, blaming it on work and college making me work late hours. \nThe messages he sent back were pretty violent, calling me a whore and a bitch, threatening me, claiming he knew where I lived and so I started to ignore him. \neventually i noticed that I hadn't had a period. I worried more and more until I bought a pregnancy test which came up positive. I hadn't spoken to the guy in about 2 weeks, my mother would have killed me if she found out I'd had sex for money and gotten pregnant and the idea of being pregnant just seemed to crush my identity as a trans person and I didn't want to deal with the emotional damage that would bring.\nI didn't tell anyone except my ex at the time, who welcomed the news with open arms. He said that it was my choice whether to have the child, but either way he'd support me and help wherever needed, even if I decided to keep the dad out of the picture.\n\nBy this time, the guy I had paid had calmed down, and tried apologising, quickly going back to his usual messages begging to see me. I needed time to figure out what to do, so I never once replied, nor told him what was happening.\n\nIm a smoker and I drink a lot and my friends always share weed, and I had planned on cutting all of that out, but honestly I found myself having a cigarette every 20 minutes and sleeping barely an hour every night, so I'd gone up to over 40 a day. I never had the choice as to whether I would keep the baby as at 4 weeks I had a miscarriage. Not many people know about this even now, my family doesn't know, the guy doesn't know, even my doctor doesn't know we cause I refused to go in case they told my mother.\n\nRight now, I'm trying to make things work again with my ex. We'd gotten a lot closer after the whole thing, and even thought more about starting our own family once I was out of college and we had a more stable looking situation, but im still upset over what happened, and part of me feels like shit for leaving this guy in the dark about everything that happened. \nAm I the asshole here?

Ive told my sister this but she keeps telling me to butt out but I know this guy is sort of like a wannabe gangster type (but also like a wannabe intellectual as well, very weird combo but its true).\n\nSo i told him directly to stop messaging my sister, hes too old and too freaky for me. After trying and failing to buck me down (getting in my face and asking me to repeat myself) he then tries to say im \"sexually gatekeeping\" my sister and that hes gonna tell other people that im weird/possibly incestuous.\n\nHonestly it got loud but no violence and we got separated by the AP. Both got an ISS for making threats. My sister is angry at me. AITA?",

Asses and nudes of people are easy to come by. So if this is how it’s gonna be, I’m no longer going to give gifts on Vday. I’ll just send you a dick pic.”\n\nDid not go over well, so am I the asshole or what? I know that it’s like a general rule of thumb that men gift flowers/chocolates etc on Valentine’s Day and to be honest I love doing that. But I never receive anything from my SO and it’s not about spending money, it could be anything just the thought is enough. Something that shows they care is all.

      "description": "Context: So... I have pretty high social anxiety. (I haven't been diagnosed but I've had quite a few panic attacks in my day) And I had this friend that we met through a mutual friend. We were fine until he started to snap at me for certain opinons I had that differed from his (like favourite bands). A lot of times I'd say something in a group chat, people would agree and he would litteraly only snap at me. Now to his defense he has a lot of mental health issues that I don't even begin to know the extent of but sometimes I feel he uses this as an excuse to be an ass when he doesn't like what what I say. After that, he stopped talking to me. COMPLETELY. He never texted in the group chat, only privately to our mutual friend. We have two classes together so he'd follow me around because we were friends but he never spoke. Sat next to me in class, said nothing. Sat next to me in lunch, said nothing. This literally made me have a couple attacks because I felt like I was making an embarrassment of myself. It was like trying to talk to a brick wall. I'd say something, and he'd just nod or ignore me. And yet he'd talk to other people, and participate in class. He said he was going through some shit, and I offered to help but he said he was fine. So after all that, I just broke it off for my own mental health reasons. Am I in the wrong? I know he has issues but a lot of it seemed targeted towards me and I couldn't handle it.",

      "description": "To give you some background, I am 17 and I live with my Mum. My older brother is 19 and lives in my Dad's apartment (Dad not currently in town.) Because of unpaid rent, my brother will get evicted and have to find somewhere to live.  He could call our Dad and find another place, but I doubt he will be much help. So my mother feels bad and wants him to live with us. I would honestly not mind it, but I despise how my brother acts.\n\nHe used to have a medical condition and I used to sometimes look after him. He treated me with belittlement and entitlement ever since. He always thought I was inferior to him and owed him something. I could've ignored him instead of spending hours every day tending to his needs. But after all I did for him for years, he was never grateful or thankful for anything I did. I only did it because I truly cared for him.\n\nMy brother is also a slob and a high school dropout. He acts like a king and expects to be treated as such. He gets me in trouble because he always takes things personally, especially jokes. Because of his condition, he got a free pass for every thing he did. He is spoiled and a Daddy's boy as well. My brother is just a useless prick with no job or direction in life. Last time I saw him months ago, he almost started a physical fight with me. I can tell that he hates me and does not care.\n\nAnd now I am supposed to welcome him with open arms into my house and once again have to put with his shit. Fuck that. My home is where I am comfortable and in peace, I will not have that taken away. But my Mum probably thinks I am heartless because I don't want anything to do with him. But she has also not seen what I have seen.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not helping him out? I know that he is my brother and all, but I just can't do it.",

Her parents give her money every couple of months to help her cover  odds and ends (food,books etc). We’re both 18 year old full time uni students and live at home. Her parents pay for her entire tuition as well. Anyway, turns out she spent her entire $1300 allowance in less than one month on just food and clothes, which really rubbed me the wrong way. This is quite a big deal too because her parents aren’t insanely rich, about middle class same as mine. \n\nShe hasn’t worked a day in her life and constantly complains about how her parents don’t let her have any independence, yet she is not only happy to take their money but spend it excessively. It’s just frustrating because I have friends who work full time and still can’t afford to go to university. \n\nBut I feel conflicted because it is TECHNICALLY her money and she can spend it how she wants. But in general her belligerence towards money matters and not understanding how lucky she is to not have to stress about money whatsoever is frustrating to me and a couple of other friends.  \n\nSo I’m just wondering WIBTA if I call her out on her spoiled/entitled attitude or would it be justified?",

      "description": "First Reddit post! I love reading AITA, and this is something that's been preying on my mind so let's do it. I'll TL;DR at the end.\n\nMy husband's work team had a social meal out a couple of months ago for everyone to bring their partners. I dont eat animal products so was a bit nervous about the potential of being \"that person\" at the table, so I phoned ahead and restaurant reassured me that they make vegan versions of lots of their menu items and just to choose on the night. Good stuff!\n\nSo I rock up and time comes to order, I ask the waiter what he would reccomend that they can easily make vegan and he gushes about this new menu item they've just added that's a vegan special, squash cabbage wraps with mixed mushrooms. I'm not a fussy eater but I'm not keen on sweet food so said I'd rather have pasta (it was an Italian restaurant) and he said they couldn't do any pasta for me, I asked what other than that meal they could do and he said, well, nothing. So, again not wanting to be that person I kept my disappointment to myself and ordered it.\n\nIt arrives and it's really, really bad. I mean objectively bad, not just \"not to my taste\". The wraps were like boiled mushy baby food and SO sweet, and the mushrooms were incredibly salty. I tried my best to just get it down but I clearly wasn't going to be able to come close to finishing it, I couldn't even stand the smell of it (overboiled cabbage mm). So I flagged a waiter and handed him the plate saying \"sorry, i cant eat this\". I expected him to ask what was wrong or similar but he just apologised profusely, took it away and mysteriously magicked up the pasta I'd been told I couldn't have before 😕\n\nHe comes back a few minutes later to ask how I'm enjoying my pasta, which is fine, no complaints. Thinking I might be helpful, since the first waiter had said that it was a new menu item I asked this guy if the chef would like my feedback. He said absolutely. Despite it having been awful I was polite and said I thought the mushrooms were too salty and the wraps were mushy. He came back later in the meal to tell me that the chef had said thank you for the feedback.\n\nThis was a couple of months ago now, but my husband tells me that his boss still brings what I did up as an anecdote, saying she was so embarrassed that she wanted to die. My husband is pretty laid back but he does worry a lot about how he's perceived at work and he's said he agrees that I embarrassed him. I think he will probably think twice about inviting me out to another work event, which sucks.\n\nTL;DR: I got forced into ordering gross food at a restaurant and my husband thinks I embarrassed him by (politely) telling the restaurant it was gross.\n\nAITA? Is my husband's boss? Writing this has made me hungry 🤤",

      "description": "Long time lurker, first time poster. Here’s my obligatory apology for any mistakes I may make, mobile formatting, etc. \n\nFor context, my mother and I have always had a rocky relationship. She was a single mother with a traumatic past of her own, who became a mother by surprise and (in my opinion) has had the best of intentions the entire time, just hasn’t quiteeeeee figured out how to properly be a parent.  There’s a history of emotional abuse in our family, and I’ve definitely abused emotionally by her for a while. \n\nWe are completely opposite in many ways (for those of your Astrology nerds, she is a full fledged Leo &amp; I am a Sun Gem, Moon Taurus—trust me, explains a lot, but I digress). She’s not very compassionate, not very physical, and definitely does her best to never feel any emotion, ever. I am an anxious, quiet, hugger. This has always caused a rift between us and I don’t feel like I’ve got a support system in my own home. Ever since I wanted to start growing up a bit as I entered my teens, I’ve been met with pushback of epic proportions. Which brings me to my problem. \n\nAbout a year ago, I decided to take a semester off to fix my mental health and transfer out of a far away college to move back home. Our relationship had been very calm and pleasant while I was away, but we really had to do some reworking when I got home. I started back up in school last August, and have been consecutively enrolled with a 4.0 for the past two semesters. I have worked my butt off, and my only stipulation on coming home (which she was all for) was a bit more independence. We squabbled over a lot, had a few blow out fights, and they were all based on our little household power struggle—and one squabble in particular has escalated, quite a bit. \n\nOne day last semester, after never having done so since high school (some 3+ years ago), she came into my room and woke me up a few minutes before my alarm went off. She had confused her times (she HAS to know exactly when I wake up, have class, have breaks, leave class, etc which is a separate problem) and thought I was gonna be late. I politely said thank you, told her that I always set multiple alarms, and that she didn’t have to worry. I’ve only ever overslept once while being in college, and it was a total fluke. The next day, she does the same thing. Once again, I respond with a polite yet a bit more stern “thank you, but this is unnecessary,” and begrudgingly wake up. This seems small, right? \n\nFor the last 2 months of my previous semester, she decided she “didn’t believe me,” and was going to take it upon herself to wake me. This would be sort of alright if she had ever remembered what time I get up for class. I have this down to a science, have told her the times I need to be up multiple times. and written them down on more than one occasion, but she’d still wake me up about ~10ish minutes before necessary. When I ask her to stop doing so, she throws a fit. She says I’m being rude, she’s just trying to help, I don’t appreciate her, etc. The last time she did it before this morning, she had come in, woke me, and when I asked why, she responded, “I know it annoys you, hehehe” and walked out. So she’s OBVIOUSLY listening to my grievances, and choosing to act otherwise. \n\nFinally, today it came to a head as she woke me AGAIN, and I blew my top. I am so tired of being woken up annoyed. As a hard working college student, I cherish my sleep quite a bit. This is not an isolated incident, and I don’t feel as though what I’m asking for is unnecessary. It just starts my day off so poorly, and I’ve tried to politely fix the problem for a while now, to no avail. After I yelled at her, she called me some choice names and told me how I “ruined her morning,” but I think she’s ruined mine first, plenty of times. \n\nAITA for being really bothered by this?",

To understand the situation im in/was in i have to tell u the backstory\nWe've been together 5 years ago. We broke up but i missed her so i told her that but she blocked me (helping me getting over that). Then i think 1 year after that we starting texting and testing out Beeing friends. That didnt work out bc in her head she always thought i still loved her ( i think i kinda did too). So she behaved like shit and we stopped beeing friends but this time because i didnt want to be friends with her anymore. After that i havent heard anything from her for 1.5 years. \n\nThat was the backstory in short. Now we are in contact. I told my gf she texted me. The thing is i always kinda liked her because shes just a nice person. And automatically im comparing. Even though im very happy with my gf there are things that have been just way better with my ex. For example the sex was amazing back then. Today its ok. mainly bc my gf today isnt open as much as my ex.\nYesterday we've been playing \"ark\" together and chatting of course. And we talked about alot of stuff back then\nFor example we've been classmates before er got together and didnt really liked each other.\n\nEven do im pretty sure she is over me and im happy with my girlfriend and it would never happen that i cheat or something i feel bad somehow because i was talking to her so much",

      "description": "My wife is 37 weeks pregnant, we are the first of our family generation to have kids so it's been a big deal and everyone is super excited.\n\nMy mother doesn't have a lot of money and she has started making comments about \"getting the baby's room ready\".  I asked her to elaborate and she says \"For my GRANDSON to sleep over OF COURSE!\".\n\nShe lives over 2 hours away, has 2 very large dogs she cannot control, and has an.....\"agriculture\" business in her basement that smells the entire house.\n\nI told her \"Save your money because that's not going to happen\".  She thinks I'm joking at first but when she sees I'm serious she start freaking out.\n\nFrom her perspective, she has waited 30 years for a grandchild and since my sister can't have kids she fuels all of her excitement into us.  She has a fear of driving so her visits to us will be limited in the first place.  She is taking her excitement over the top. Her friends threw her a grandma shower for fucks sake.\n\nI told her that I will not be driving 5-10 hours per weekend so he can sleep over in a place where there are untrained massive dogs(they are sweeties but i don't want to take the chance with a 250lb st Bernard and a 150lb Newfoundland that like to jump), and an offensive smell that permeates the house.\n\nShe responds saying she has thought of all that and will be taking the train, segregating the dogs, and installing a massive air purifier in the room.  I still tell her no with the logic of \"I don't want my child being 2.5 hours away from me, I'm not comfortable with taking a baby on a train, we are trying to avoid formula, and even with the dogs being in another room and an air purifier where he would sleep I am not comfortable with the arrangement.  I told her we can visit once in a while, but not until he's a little bit older and it's unlikely we will be sleeping over(her home smells, is small and very uncomfortable).\n\nMy mother cries like she has just lost a child.  I call my sister and ask her for help(she lives a lot closer and has a much closer relationship), and she thinks I am being unreasonable.  Apparently, my mother has already gotten the room ready and has been saving up for this huge air purifier/ozone generator thing and talked through it with my sister because she knows I'm a hard-ass.",

      "description": "I’m a college work study student at a school library. \n\nI usually don’t work Sundays, but when I do it’s with the same girl, and she’s always late. One time she came in late, clocked in, and left for more than an hour. Today she’s 3 hours late as I type this, and honestly I don’t think she’s coming in at all. On Tuesdays she has a shift after mine, and she’s always late so then that makes me late for my class because I can’t leave until she arrives. I don’t know if she’s like this with other student employees, but I assume yes because there’s no reason for her to have beef with me since we literally are just coworkers and we do not interact whatsoever besides saying the typical “hi” and “have a good day.” What sucks is that my supervisor has no knowledge of any of this, so this girl just keeps clocking in and leaving, and coming in late all the time. I’m just really heated from this right now because I wanted to offer my shift up for trade because I got sick yesterday, but I knew no one would take my shift since most people are on spring break. Now I’m actually sick with a cough and a cold yet I still came to work. \n\nIt’s just so unfair to me and other fellow student employees who are actually punctual, and abide by standard work rules. I mean, none of us actually want to work, but we do because we’re low-income and need the money. But then there’s people like this girl who pulls all these shenanigans and don’t face any consequences. \n\nSo, AITA if I tell my supervisor about all of this?",

      "description": "41, M, San Jose, CA\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I loaned an old lawn mower of mine to my neighbor. It was an old Snapper riding lawn mower. He was supposed to have used it for one time, but it started raining while he was mowing and he stowed it in his shed to keep it from being rained on. \n\nAbout two months goes by and I hadn’t said anything about it, because we work different hours so he’s not home when I’m there and it’s just an old mower I had. Well, then his son and my daughter (they are 17 &amp; 16 respectfully) were caught (by him) having sex in his sons bedroom. They’ve been friends as long as we’ve been neighbors, which is about 10 years. This leads mike (my neighbor) coming to MY house and demanding that I reprimand my daughter for “being a whore in his house.”\n\nI was astounded. First of all, his soon was taking place in the act as much as she was. She later admitted to me that she wasn’t forced and they had intercourse several times before. I would also like to add that Mike and I hadn’t ever had a cross word up until now, even though he’s a very religious person and sometimes I purposely ignored him when he would bust my balls about alcohol consumption or marijuana use.  \n\nAnyways, I ended up threatening to call the cops if he didn’t leave and he eventually did. \n\nA few days go by and I think maybe things cooled off, so I message mike and ask him for my mower back. He responded and told me to fuck off, that he didn’t have my mower. It was a lie because it’s been in his shed all summer. \n\nRealizing I have no claim to the mower (no service records or proof of ownership) I made a plan to regain the mower myself. I would wait until mike went to work one day and break into his shed and get my mower back. \n\nI took some bolt cutters and cut the lock off of the shed (it was Chain locked.) \n\nI recorded the entire thing on my cell phone from start to finish to prove that I was just getting **my** property. He comes home on lunch during this and ends up calling the police on me.  I managed to get the mower back to my property but he caught me in the act. The police arrested me for criminal trespassing and breaking and entering. \n\nAm I the asshole here? Seriously, I just wanted my mower back since he couldn’t accept that his child was just as involved in my daughters act as he was. He also called my child a whore to my face. I was just going to let him have it until he acted like a complete jackass. \n\nI’ve contacted a lawyer and we have subpoenaed the mower manufacturer as I bought it brand new, and the plan is to now try and charge him with theft of my mower ",

      "description": "Ok so this might sound a bit petty, but hear me out. \n\nSince middle school, I had a close group of friends that I would always hang around and play sports such as basketball with. We were all very close throughout middle school and were basically as close as a group could get.\n\nNow fast forward to high school, where we eventually got distanced a bit due to the classes we took as well as other influences. We would still talk to one another, but not as much as we did back in grade school. However, we partook in a rec basketball league together (likely due to tradition).\n\nHowever,  after the league was over, the distance between us basically widened as they would ghost me on several occasions (mainly hanging out and eating). One particular tipping point was when “we” created a volleyball team (for our school tournament, only for me to get kicked out due to “the team” wanting some other friend that they met that year. It bothered me a bit, but I just stopped thinking about it for a while. \n\nNow fast forward to today, I heard that they made a basketball team for the student faculty game that will occur later this year, only for them to once again not invite me. Mind you, I’m not super unathletic and even on par with some of the players on that team, so their ghosting is likely not due to me being bad.\n\nI know this is not the deepest of the conflicts, but “losing” these friends have kind of upset me.  AITA for being upset that my so called friends keep on ghosting me?",

      "description": "My parents have a large house in a private gated neighborhood. The driveway has two entrances but we exclusively use one of the entrances because it is easier to enter and exit. It’s basically muscle memory at this point when we back up because we are the last house on the cul-de-sac and no one ever is there at that driveway point.    \n\nWe come back from a long two week trip on NYE around 10pm and see a car completely blocking that one entrance we use. It was a black car and there isn’t a light post near that side and it was difficult to see and we nearly hit it. We had to use the other entrance to get in which isn’t a huge deal. My dad was still upset and we called our neighborhood 911 line (actual police, not security) and they came and were very pleasant with us saying even though we have two entrances it is still illegal to block a driveway. The deputy said he tried knocking on some doors and no one knew whose car it was so he had to get it towed. \n\nI felt a little bad because it was probably some kid who was at a party (we live in a snobby rich neighborhood) but I mainly felt bad for the cop having to deal with this on NYE but we had friends coming over and they too use that entrance. \n\nIf we hit that car it would’ve been our fault probably so better to be safe than sorry even though it probably would have been moved the next day and we weren’t technically blocked from leaving our house. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

(I don't know what is going on exactly). I also know that the others in the group are aware of it but nobody is aware that I know. \n\nFor a little context, my ex and I dated for about 4.5 years. The split was okay and please believe me when I say that I wouldn't mind if one of my friends was to date her or whatever. The issue I have is that I know my ex and the guy are hiding this from me and lying to me. I think that they should have at least asked me if I would have been cool with it but they didn't. So I already have a quarrel with my ex and this friend but I can't help but feel pissed that none of the others had told me or at least told my ex that they should tell me. It seems like a game they're all playing behind my back. On the other hand, I understand that my other friends might not feel like it's their place to tell me. But I think I'm justified in being annoyed with them if they're endorsing what my ex and friend are doing.\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "description": "AITA? I just started my first ever job recently. Its a job serving ice cream and dessert foods in a fairly busy store in the city, so theres usually a lot to do e.g. taking orders, prepping food, ice cream, smoothies, taking online orders from deliveroo etc. So last week I was only on my second shift, and it was pretty clear I didn't properly know the ropes of working there yet. I probably had about 6 hours worth of experience overall. It was fine when me and the manager were both working, one of us could take orders and another could prep foods and anything I wasn't sure how to do I could ask him, or he would do it for me.\n\nSo it was going fine until he decided to take his half an hour break and said if I needed anything he'd be in the back, after which I very quickly got behind on taking and making orders when a large group came in, until I had a large queue. To make things worse, because I didn't have much experience with how online orders worked and because I had been so busy trying to manage the customers, 3 delivery drivers turned up at once all asking for their orders, which I hadn't made yet, and because I hadn't got used to the systems I didn't know what order to give them. the situation just got worse until I had to go to the back of store and tell the manager I felt I was out of my depth needed help, to which he got very angry and continuously told me he didn't get paid for his breaks so there is no way he's coming out to help me and that its not that hard, I went back to the front and just tried to deal with customers and leave the delivery drivers waiting to be dealt with later, but they were getting very agitated so i panicked and went to ask him again and again until he came off his break to help me make some orders. After we dealt with all the customers he was clearly pretty furious for having to come off his break and went away to finish it. and after that he would constantly snap at me for doing things wrong and show me how to do things as if they were the most simple things in the world, and i was an idiot for not knowing right away (tbf they were pretty simple, but it was my first time doing them and i was just asking bc i didn't know)\n\nAnyway, Ive just been wondering whether I should have basically been a better worker, been more on top of things and tried to deal with them myself, rather than making him come off his break and work when he's not being paid, (it was probably ten mins work tops). Am I the asshole for being, admittedly, not the most proficient worker after 7 hours work and asking him to deal with my problems, or could he have maybe been a little more understanding in helping out, and taken his break after. thanks",

      "description": "Last night I was in a messenger call with my girlfriend and her male friend whilst they played Fortnite. After a while they started posting embarrassing photos of each other in the chat and he posted a screen recording of a snap she sent him of her singing and generally acting silly.\n\nMy problem with this is that whenever we talk on snapchat she hardly shows her face or very rarely does anything \"silly\" for me. I've brought this up with her before in the past and she said \"Yeah but I don't care if he sees me looking like that.\" \n\nI'm not really bothered about her sending videos of her singing and whatnot to me but I do feel a bit left out when the messages she sends me are just photos of her room/surroundings rather than a bit of her face. \n\nSo, AITA for getting annoyed and leaving the call early, only saying \"right, see you in a bit I'm going bed\" before I left?",

It's a cute and sweet dog, I just don't like it.\n\nEvery once in a while I do walk or feed it when necessary but to be honest I don't think that's my responsibility. To be fair they never expect me to do those things either. \n\nThe thing I don't like about dogs is that they need attention. They come up to you and give you love but when you don't give it back they get sad. I don't like that commitment and I feel like it was forced on me. Now that wouldn't be such a problem if I could just tell the dog to leave me alone when it comes to me but every time I do that they get mad and treat me like I'm an asshole. \n\nBecause of that I try to explain (in all fairness maybe a bit too rude) why I don't like dogs. And every time that ends in a big arguement with me being the bad guy. \n\nAITA?",

      "description": "My friend is visiting from out of state today. She is staying in my apartment with her niece, friend and boyfriend. We had plans for today but they were going to go without me because I had something come up and I couldn't go. That was totally fine, and I was okay with that.\n\nMy friend then decided that she was going to cancel some of her morning plans and wait for me instead, because I was able to go along with them if they were leaving later. I told her several times that I was okay either way and that was totally her choice and she didn't have to wait but she chose to anyway. \n\nShe didn't want to bring her large purse with her because that shit gets heavy and I totally get that. I also carry a super heavy purse around and it kills my shoulder sometimes but I have a bunch of stuff that I like/need to have with me when I go out so I suffer through it.\n\nMy friend asked me if I could put a bag of cough drops in my purse for her and I said sure. She then asked if she could put her portable phone charger and I said no, that's too heavy and my purse is already heavy enough. She argued that it's already heavy so what's the difference? I said that every little thing really does add up. I told her that she could bring her purse if she really needs something like that. She said no, but continued to argue with me about it and then put her portable charger in my purse, picked it up and said \"see? It's really no different.\" I said if it's not too heavy, in her opinion, then she could just take her purse and she's being a hypocrite at this point.\n\nShe guilt tripped me by saying that she \"rearranged her entire day for me\" but I can't do this thing for her. I told her that was her choice. \n\nIs this the most ridiculous argument ever? You bet. It's not a big deal, but I immediately thought of this subreddit because I'm left genuinely wondering if I was the asshole here?\n\nGive it to me straight guys. Should I have just sucked it up because my purse is already heavy? Or was I in the right to tell her no, I didn't want her heavy item to add to the weight of my purse?",

      "description": "Okay, so I, a 13-year-old, work small jobs for money. Rake some leaves for a neighbour for 5 dollars, mow the lawn for another 5. Really simple jobs that give me some money to buy what I want. So we were at the mall, and I wander off with 10 dollars and went to Subway. I buy a simple Meatball Marinara for 6.00, and some chips for a dollar. With 3 dollars left, I decided to save them and go to find my mom who is sitting in the playground area with my brother sitting right next to her. I promptly sat myself next to her, and began to eat my food. My brother started whining about how he was hungry, so I instinctively went and handed him my bag of chips. But; this didn't satisfy him. He started CRYING about how he wanted a sandwich.\n\nNow; my brother REFUSES to eat any sandwich other than the Turkey Italiano Melt(T.I.M), which is 6.75. I only had 3 dollars. \n\nNow, the wining PISSED my mom off. (Keep in mind this is my biological mom, who I see a few times a year. I have a way better stepmom)  She DEMANDED I buy him a sandwich. I explain he only eats the T.I.M, and I didn't have the money for it. Angrily she hands me about 5 dollars, and I take my brother to buy it. I'm staying at her house for the weekend (right now im in the closet because its the only place I can get away from both of them. Its a small house, and me and my brother share a room here.) and shes actually pissed at me for not being able to buy my brother a sandwich even though it was my own money I earned??? AITA???",

I don't want to actually confront this person and say that these things annoy me because it's just a part of who they are and who am I to try and change them.

We had a rant, all was good, we went our separate ways. \n\nToday, I met up with my other friend and he was really grumpy. For context, I was complaining about him being really controlling and not listening to my input in things. Nothing really serious or mean about him. He's making a point about not being a controlling person and kind of just being a dick in general in all the ways I'd complained about. Like going out of his way to make sure I knew that I was wrong about all the things I said without making it obvious.

Sometime over the past few years, I somehow stopped being the person. Probably a part of my growing up process. Now. Some of my friends when they vent to me, I tend to get the response \"well, that's just pessimistic\" \n\nHere's an example, messaging back and forth with a friend: \n\nHER: I don't even like the club (the place where our SO's work) anymore.\nMe: The club always sucked. Some people are just crumby and there will always be crumby people at other clubs and restaurants.\nHER: I used to like it. Always felt welcomed, Everybody was nice...now it just stresses me out, can't even drive there anymore. \nME: Yeah, eventually a lot of places end up growing into something else. But even if there aren't other female distractions, there's always some kind of unnecessary drama associated with work. They'll always be shitty chefs, immature/entitled coworkers, and sensitive mentalities. And our SO's come home and they're stressed from work or they spend what little time they have with their coworkers at the bar. It's a perpetual cycle. \nHER: (INSERTS GIF of\" \"THAT NEWS IS VERY DEPRESSING\")\nME: (INSERTS GIF of a shrug) ...sure is\nHER: Pessimistic much?\nME: Nah. I accept it for what it is. I make my choices accordingly.\nHER: Well, I'm refusing to accept it. Ignorance is bliss lol.\nME: To each their own.\n\nTLDR: Am I the asshole for because it diesn't make me sad, I just see the reality for what it is?

We barely fight, as we don’t have many issues.\n\nRecently my boyfriend has been muttering stuff in his sleep, at first I ignored it but as of now it’s impossible. He talks so frequently in his sleep I commonly will sleep downstairs as I can’t stand it. He speaks about another woman named Laurel and says phrases such as..\n\n“Laurel we can finally plan our honeymoon.”\n\n“I love the smell of your hair today Laurel.”\n\n“Come here baby girl.”\n\nIt’s been pretty gut wrenching to hear him talk about her so often, sometimes up to 2-3 times a week. He doesn’t even call me baby girl, that’s why I added the last one.

To sour things just a little more, she recently made me feel very miserable by repeatingly insisting on discussing a very traumatic ordeal that happened to me years ago when we were all hanging out, even though I made clear I didn't want and hated to talk about it. This happened weeks ago, but I'm still suffering for having to go over those horrible memories all over again.\n\nWill I be the asshole if I confront my friend about this issue and tell him I don't want to hang out with the group anymore if she's around?

      "description": "I have a sister who lives in Louisiana and she’s married and has 3 kids, and every year for whatever holiday I always sleep on the couch and they take my room. I have switched rooms 3 times, but no matter where I go I always have to give mine up. Now a bit of a back story.\n\nWhen it was just her and her husband before they had kids I had to give up my room because it was “the bigger room” seeing as my other sister had the smaller room in the house and then there’s my parents room. Fine, just fine, I sleep on the couch.\n\nNow fast forward a few years they have 2 kids, my sister and I switch rooms and I now have the tiny room. Holidays come around and again I have to give up my room but the reason this time is “I have the bigger bed” okay I can do that, I sleep on the couch. \n\nFast forward a few more years I now live in my parents garage. I stay there because we moved my grandpa down here from Pennsylvania and I wasn’t going to make him stay out there(I’m not an animal) so I give him my old room. He passes away so now we have a spare bedroom because I choose to stay in the garage. Holidays come around and, you guessed it, I have to give up my room. This time it’s because I have a couch out there too for a couple of the kids to sleep on (there are 3 now). \n\nHere is what starts to REALLY bother me, I’m the ONLY one who has to work during these holidays. My entire family gets off so they stay up, hang out, go do stuff, whatever. So not only can I not go to bed due to the fact that they’re all in the living room where I’m sleeping but their kids get up at like 6-7am so I’m up that early too now. Some days when I get home from working a double shift or whatever I just want to lay down and go to sleep and when I ask them if I can go to bed they say no and it’s not fair that they want to watch a movie or I just got home I can stay up a big longer, knowing full well I have to work again the next day. \n\nAITA for just wanting one holiday where I don’t have to give up my room?

      "title": "AITA for opening the discussion on restarting an old relationship, while we both have new relationships?",
      "description": "Maybe this is a bit of a cliché topic, but it is one I have been struggling with for a long time. I can’t seem to find a way to deal with this, so I have discussed it with my good friends. However, they all have very different opinions. I’m very interested what you guys, outsiders in the matter, think about this, and very much appreciate you taking the time to read this and tell me your thoughts. Let me try and explain the situation. \n\nTL;DR: this has become quite a long writing. If you want to skip the backstory: the current issue starts at “The current problem”. \n\nAbout six years ago, when I was 18, I met this guy I found to be amazing. The feeling was mutual, we went on to see each other and eventually wanted to get into a relationship. Now of course I was, and still am young, but in my romantic pursuits up to this point I’d always been uncomfortable with the concept of monogamy. \n\nI shared this hesitation with the guy, we had a long talk about it and decided we would try for monogamy anyway. He didn’t want to have an open relationship, and I was feeling way more for him than I had at that point felt for anyone else. We agreed upon monogamy and started our relationship. We had regular talks about whether we were both still happy with the relationship and with the monogamy part of it. \n\nIt was a great, I did love this guy dearly and we were quite happy together. There were some troubles, most notably the depression both of us struggle with, but it didn’t take away from the love and affection. The only problem was my continued uneasiness around monogamy. It was manageable for a year or two, but then it really started to get in the way. During the next year we talked about it often, and eventually he reluctantly agreed to let me see another person if someone came around. \n\nAs you can imagine I felt shit about myself trying to convince him to give me the (sexual) freedom I so craved. I was pushing his limits, and it was clear that he’d rather not. I very much tried to push away this need of mine, but in the end it just was there and it felt so unauthentic when I tried to hide it from him or myself.\n\nAnyway, he agreed to it and for a year or so things were absolutely great. Still the two of us. Until, on some faithful day, another guy came around. I fancied him, and over a long course ended up being together. My boyfriend struggled so hard with it. It was horrible to see him suffer so much over this ‘egocentric’ pursuit of mine. I really, really wanted it to work but it was just so hard on him. He kept on asking for more time to get his mind around it, but never managed to get there. This went on for another year (we’re at a total of 4.5 years now), after which there was so much tension and unfortunately also some resentment from both sides.\n\nAt the end of it, he developed some romantic feelings for a female friend he had had for years before. I was happy about this, hoping he would now feel himself how beautiful it could be to share your love with more than one partner. However, this girl also was monogamous. The struggle with him accepting my other partner continued. In the end, we agreed it would be better to split up, and have him be with this other girl. This was very painful on the both of us, because we did still have a lot of love and affection for each other. We didn’t want it to be over. Honestly the sole thing that split us up was my desire for polygamy and his for monogamy. It felt like an ‘outside factor’, something that had next to nothing to do with our feelings for each other. Our love hadn’t dwindled. \n\nHe went on to be with his new girl. I went on to be with mine, but we didn’t make the year mark. After that I had a bit of a slut phase and then met this other guy, who is now my boyfriend. We have an open relationship, and both see other people as well. \n\n**The current problem**: I have felt, and still feel this huge amount of love for my former boyfriend. This greatly interferes with my ability to commit to my new boyfriend, however much I feel like I should want that. I just fucking can’t do it. I just keep on thinking that my former boyfriend is the one I should be with. That he should be my partner, my buddy, and that I want nothing more that to walk by his side. I feel as if my grieving the past relationship has barely even started, and that half of the time I’m still in denial phase.\n\nI still have some contact with the former boyfriend, we sometimes call, and we see each other once every three months or so. When we meet we just talk and talk about anything, and the topic of how we’re coping with our relationship always comes up. The difficult thing is that he describes the same feelings I have: struggling to let go, really missing me, trying to make it work with the new girl but not really managing to get a similar feeling of love or belonging as the two of us shared.\n\nFor some reason we have never talked about actually trying again together. I really feel like we should have this talk. Yes, I hope that we could, and that everything would work out, but I also feel like hearing him say he chooses not to try again and continue to build a relationship with his new girlfriend would help me accepting that it really is over. \n\nThe foremost reason keeping me from initiating this conversation is that I feel really fucking bad for his new girlfriend. Even though she knows he is struggling with letting go of our old relationship and this is hindering his commitment towards her, they are building something together based on the fact that this relationship is over. I do not want to stab her in the back. I do not want to confuse him even further, and I don’t want to disturb his getting over me. I truly don’t. I don’t know how to go about opening the discussion about restarting our relationship without ‘going behind her back’. Theoretically I could try and get her contact, introduce myself and my problem, but I don’t think that will ease her mind and I feel like I should just talk to my ex as it is about him and he knows about all the history and the gravity of the matter. \n\nMy moral compass is telling me to stay out of their business and do my own coping by myself. However I have tried this for a year and a half, seemingly without any success at all. I’m seeing my ex the 18th of January, and I really don’t know what to do. I’m not proud to say that I spend a lot of time and energy trying to figure it out, and that’s it’s starting to take on an almost obsessive quantity lately. It really is driving me mad. I’m open to doing monogamy again, if he wants this, but now I’m mostly confused and don’t know for certain if I want a monogamous or polygamous relationship. \n\nAs you might have noticed, I’ve not gone into how my current boyfriend is feeling. At the beginning of our relationship I mentioned this unsolved business. We have been communicating very openly throughout our relationship and he knows exactly how I feel. Of course he is hurt by my feelings for the ex, but he is very supportive of me doing whatever I think is necessary to deal with it any way or another. If anyone would like more information on this, I’m glad to provide it.\n\nWould I be the asshole for discussing restarting our old relationship, on the expense of his new girlfriend?",

But now that it’s over, I’m reconsidering if I am actually rightfully irritated about this. \n\nI got on a FaceTime call with one of my best friends today, just chatting about things going on at school, nothing too serious but it certainly wasn’t a dead conversation. Eventually, I had to eat dinner, and I asked her if I should hang up and call back later. She said not to hang up and to just stay on. I went to eat dinner, and came back maybe ten or fifteen minutes later. When I said hi, I quickly found out she was on the phone with her other friend (she was FaceTiming me through her laptop, so I could actually see her on the phone). At first it was kind of fine. I was thinking that this was weird, especially since I’m not friends at all with the friend was was calling. After a couple minutes, my friend just completely ignores me, as she’s in a conversation with her other friend. At this point, I’m not really sure what to do. I’m feeling very out of place and awkward... I am a very shy and not very social person. And also annoyed. If she wanted to call her other friend, couldn’t she have just texted me “got to go” or something similar while I was gone? She wasn’t making any attempts to include me or anything... I sort of felt invisible and at the same time, a burden. So I just hung up without saying anything. \n\nAm I the asshole? And another note, this all happened just a bit ago, and she hasn’t texted me or anything yet.",

      "title": "AITA for calling out my friend for making zero effort to introduce his girlfriend of 9 months to any of his friends?",
      "description": "Throwaway account for anonymity. I'll also refer to my friend as \"Jake\" for simplicity. \n\nBackstory: Jake and I have known each other since high school, and we're both in our mid-20s now. There's about 4 or 5 of us from high school that still hangout together regularly as we all still live in the same area.\n\nJake began dating his current girlfriend about nine months ago. That's an estimate, because none of us were actually told that he had a girlfriend for at least the first two or three months. When we found out, we all took a little bit offense (What? You've been dating someone this whole time? Why wouldn't you tell us that?), but it was nothing major. Over the next few months, we all continued to hangout as usual, but no effort was ever made by Jake to introduce the two parties.\n\nEventually, about a month ago, a few of us started commenting on the fact that we've never met her, and essentially told Jake that we felt it was weird that he doesn't ever invite her to our get-togethers or invite us to theirs. At this point, it became a little more offense, because he'd say things like, \"She's not going to want to get drunk with four guys and listen to Weezer all night\" (a regular activity of ours), to which we collectively responded, \"So...we could just *not* do that.\" It was like he was implying that a group of adults is incapable of going out to dinner, or going bowling, or going to the movies, or doing anything other than \"guy stuff\" basically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for the past few weeks, each Friday I've messaged the group something along the lines of \"drinks tonight?\", and when he says that he's busy, I respond immediately with \"dude just invite her\" and tonight he finally got upset. He said this situation is \"a 2 out of 10 and is being blown up to be an 8 out of 10.\" I told him I disagree, because I think that a significant other becoming close, or at least FAMILIAR, with the people close to you is important. If I was dating someone for a year and they made no effort to meet my friends, and my friends made no effort to meet her, I'd be really upset. Am I wrong for pressing him on the subject? It feels like he doesn't consider us to be an important enough part of his life to make our existence known to the person he's dating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole? I completely understand that some people prefer a more private personal life than others, and by no means do I expect him to bring his girlfriend along to each and every one of our hangouts, nor do I expect to be invited to each and every one of theirs. I also understand that some people are just naturally more shy, so I do wonder if I'm overstepping by pressing the issue. But ultimately, I feel like enough time has passed that if he truly considered us to be close friends, he'd have made an effort to introduce the parties.",

      "title": "AITA For asking neighbours to turn down music at 3 AM?",
      "description": "This is a tame one in comparison to others but my wife and I had an argument with our neighbours over music last night.  We are a youngish couple with no kids and they are late 30's-40's with a kid at university and another in secondary school so it seems weird we'd be the ones to complain...\n\nWe understand that last night was new years but our neighbours tend to blast music nearly once a month until very early hours.  We've never said a word about it. \n\nWe also have a small dog that can be a bit yappy. When we first moved in we tried everything to train her to not bark but we both work and while we were at work we discovered she was still barking when are neighbours yelled over our fence at us one day. We had a long conversation and she claimed lots of stuff from having young kids to having a daughter on her deathbed. I thought she was honest and we got our dog a small collar the vibrates when she barks. She still occasionally does and when we take it off when we're home she can have a bark but we try to control it.\n\nNow my wife went over at about 1:30 and asked them to turn it down slightly as we could literally here every lyric to every song. They agreed to turn it down and seemed to for 10 minutes before jacking it back up.  My wife asked me to go over at 3 to ask again as she was getting very upset.  I tried to avoid it as I knew they would then kick off about the dog but she insisted.\n\nWhen I knocked the first words out of my neighbours mouth was \"Ya but we have to listen to your fuckin' dog at 8:30 every morning.\" At that point I said, \" I knew you'd argue that, there's no point I'm going home.\" And then she kicked off and started calling me an ass for asking them to turn down the music on new years. At this point I started telling back... Not great diffusion tactics I know. This kicked off a thing where all they're drunk friends came out to say it was new years and she had had a shit year and they needed this night and on and on. Then I got water works that her dad had cancer then five minutes later it changed to her best friend had cancer, then it was both had cancer and they just needed this party... Then her husband came out said he was turning it up louder and to fuck off while smelling of alcohol heavily.\n\nMy wife came out and we tried several times to say fine were not getting anywhere we'll leave you to it before hearing more about our dog and how we stomp around which they've never told us before. We said as we've told them before we can keep the dog inside and then she says \" No that's mean to the dog it's not her fault.\" In the end we finally calmed it down and went back in where they proceeded to play music louder until 5 in the morning.\n\nI feel like an ass for even knocking on their door and we know the dog can be troublesome. We have tried to be considerate and do things to help but it seems to be the go to if there is ever a dispute.  We've been on friendly terms but as soon as we said something they acted like we the biggest asshole neighbours in the world.. AITA?\n\nTL:DR Asked our neighbours to turn down music at 3 AM and then got shouted at because our dog barks at 8:30 AM when we go to work. Ended up in a shouting match for a few minutes before going back to our houses where music went on until 5 AM.",

I've worked in the food service industry myself for 3 years, and I know that quite often, tips are the main source of income for workers.

      "description": "We have a family friend who used to be our neighbor back when I was a kid in the 90's. Both my parents and I have kept in touch with him over the years and he's paid a handful of visits since we've moved to a different state. Over the past few years, the guy has become a rude and condescending jerk. My parents always reluctantly agree to his requests to visit and they blame me for being too nice to him and making him feel welcome. His tone is brash and he always tries to demean anyone and everyone he converses with. He has visited us every year for the past 3 years and I have become more and more intolerant of his antics. This year was the final straw for me. He visited us this past weekend and I went out of my way to entertain him everyday. My wife and I invited him and my parents over for dinner one night and we planned to play ping pong most of the night since he is an avid player. The guy was in a nasty mood that night. I caught him making a  condescending remark to my wife during dinner and he later belittled me for saying ping pong \"paddle\" instead of \"racquet\". We finally decided to start playing after dinner and I let he and my dad play first. My dad has a harmless habit of saying \"ready\" before he serves. Well apparently this was irritating the guy. So my dad says it again on the 5th point and the guy snaps and says, \"quit asking if I'm ready, I will kick your ass.\" This got my blood to start boiling a bit but I didn't say anything. Once it got back to my dad's serve, my dad said \"ready\" once again out of sheer habit and the guy full on shouted at my dad in a very nasty, aggressive, and disrespectful manner. I fucking lost it. I stared him down and said,\"HEY, WTF is your problem. KNOCK IT OFF.\" I gave him a look as if I was ready to beat his ass and he cowered and said he was just joking with a bitterly disgusting facial expression. We didn't speak to one another for the rest of the night and I didn't bother to see him on his last day here. I'm relieved that I don't have to put up with him any longer as I have no desire to ever be around him again. Am I the asshole for being intensely stern with a family friend that is 30+ years older than me?",

      "title": "AITA for thinking my [17M] girlfriend [17F] cheated on me when she stayed up for the whole night drinking with one of my guy friends [16M]",
      "description": "I'm relatively new to reddit so just bare that in mind as this is literally my first post and this seems like the perfect sub-reddit for this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for a bit of context this happened just under a year ago now and at this point I don't like bringing it up anymore because I feel guilty for making 'accusations' I guess you could say and I can tell it makes my girlfriend uncomfortable whenever I have tried to have a conversation about it in the past. Anyhow, here we go:\n\nMy girlfriend's parents no longer live together and for the weekend she was staying at her dads house. Her dad had gone out of town for maybe 3-4 days over the weekend so she had the house all to herself for the time being. I stayed the night at her dad's with just me and her after her dad had left which involved our regular activities of spending time together as a young and in love couple. After spending the night I had work to go to in the early afternoon which I was kinda bummed out about but I enjoyed my work anyway (worked in a rugby orientated pub/bar with great people).\n\nThat same morning my friend, lets call him \\[Fred\\], came over before I had left for work as he lived maybe 10 doors down and him and my girlfriend had agreed they were going to spend some time in the free house mostly smoking up (my whole friendship group consists of massively avid stoners) which I saw absolutely no problem with of course. Bare in mind Fred is known to be a massive fuckboy who has fucked multiple girls while on drunken fuelled benders which also plays a role in my thought process of the whole situation.\n\nNow for the rest of the story, please just remember that I was not present for any of it and was at work which I went straight home from at about 1am.\n\nMy girlfriend invited one of her closest friends over as well so it was three of them there at her house (two girls and one boy). I don't know what they all got up to together in detail whatsoever but they had run out of weed at some point and so instead they started playing drinking games to pass the time and stay entertained I suppose. \n\nIt had started to get later and later until it was probably about 2/3am and they had all been drinking consistently throughout the time that's passed. (My girlfriend is a heavy weight when it comes to drinking, so is Fred but I cannot say the same for my girlfriend's friend).\n\nIt had reached a point where my girlfriend's friend decided to hit the sack (respectable choice in my opinion) and call it a night; surprisingly, my girlfriend and Fred decided to stay up drinking for longer, rather than my girlfriend telling Fred it would be a good idea to go home  seeing as it's getting so late and he lives so close and her figuring that it could look really suspicious from MY perspective.\n\nThey continued to stay up the rest the night not getting a wink of sleep between the two of them and were clearly entertaining each other enough to decide it was worth it to stay up rather than get some sleep for whatever reason.\n\nAt some point Fred and my girlfriend's friend did leave and my girlfriend told me about her crazy night. Straight away I was completely uncomfortable with the situation and I explained this to her whereby she responded with claims of 'lack of trust' and 'jealousy' of Fred and that I'm crazy for even thinking something could've happened between them ass they 'couldn't be more than just friends in any world and timeline'. \n\nFor me it's weighed over my head for the longest time and I would be lying if I said I haven't cried over it because in my head there's almost no alternative other than that she cheated on me even though I genuinely have masses of trust for her but it's purely the situation of staying up for the WHOLE night (which I can confirm she has NEVER done with me, be it with drink involved or not) and that large amount of alcohol were involved which can easily make you chose to do things which you come to later regret.\n\nAnytime I bring it up my girlfriend it ends in tears and she hates it because she thinks it's because I don't trust her and it's certainly fractured my friendship with Fred to the point where I can barely even talk to him anymore because of the idea of him fucking my girlfriend.\n\nMy girlfriend and Fred were very close after the fact until he moved further away from her house and now they're a lot more distant I think in part because of the distance and because of the clear discomfort I feel about their, I guess 'too close for comfort' friendship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've tried my best to include all the most important information but some bits have been left out as they are minor details which shouldn't largely affect judgement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend and my friend stayed up until maybe 7am or so playing drinking games in a free house where anything could've happened and it's not as if she would admit she cheated on me with him as it would mess up a lot in my friendship group as well as my life.\n\n So reddit what do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Basically, I work for a very large company in a call centre type situation. \n\nI am one of the agents here who knows the most and I have a natural knack for training, so I have been previously given the task of training up new starters to the role.\n\nRecently I was approached by the OPS manager and asked if I would be willing to switch over to a night shift for this month to train the new members of staff starting next month.\n\nI was told that I would only have to come in to cover the days that the night team leader wasn't on site, so I agreed because it would be great for a resume as well as net me a large bonus end of month and put me forward for any roles that might open up in senior management.\n\nThe ops manager was happy and told me I would have to liaise with the night team leader to make a plan.\n\nI went to meet the guy and it was 100% clear he didn't know what he was doing. He told me that on the days he was in he would struggle to get any training done because he was \"extremely busy.\" I later found out he goes into a conference room and naps all night.\n\nWhatever, I agreed to this so I'm going to do the best I can. I met the staff being trained and quickly realised they had no idea what was going on. No one even knew the name of the department, the type of role, or even what their day to day responsibilities were. I worked really hard to get them up to speed, all the while working off my own training materials wirtten by me and a curriculum I built since the night TL didn't have anything prepared.\n\nEven so, I realised very quick I could not get all the people trained up to be ready to go live within the timeframe they wanted on my own. I made sure the night TL knew that and he never really seemed to bothered. But for me, I needed to do a good job at this since, it wasn't my normal job and I needed to make a good impression for the ops managers.\n\nOver the course of a few days I emailed him several times with the curriculum I built, the training materials I wrote and everything he needed to train the new guys, but after a few pleasantries he stopped responding to emails.\n\nI eventually had enough and sat the ops manager down and told them what a piss poor job he was doing and made sure they were aware I wouldn't be able to train these staff completely on my own.\n\nThey agreed and said that they would build the training around my curriculum and build an expectation from him to actually train.\n\nAfter all that, I found out that he's now really mad at me for going behind his back instead of speaking to him.\n\nIs it right I don't really care? The guy could have fucking replied to my emails and actually gave a shit about training. If your performance is going to reflect poorly on me even if you're a manger I don't give a fuck. I'm going to do whatever I need to to make sure anything I put my name on is done to my standards.",

I would then tell them the name of the artist once I knew for sure that I was going with them, but there was one guy I texted and he said he had work that day, and when I texted him again on Thursday to see if he wanted to go, he didn't respond. So when Friday came around, I told him about the artist I was seeing since I would post the pics on social media. No one knew how I got those tickets except the person I went with. He then calls me asking if I have another ticket, which I don't, and he just hangs up. I saw him again today and he got really annoyed at me. I guess I may have been so wrapped up in keeping everything under wraps, but he didn't really respond to me, and said he had work. So, am I the asshole? I feel kind of bad.\n\nTldr; I offered to take someone to an exclusive art show, they said they had work, and I went without them and now they aren't talking to me. ",

      "description": "So a little info: I’m 17 years old, going to be 18 in a couple months. I work part time at a grocery store, and I have 4 siblings. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to do stuff with my dad? He texted me earlier saying he is going to bring me hunting in the morning (sometimes I go on my own if I want to) and I told him that I have work at 12 and he said that if I don’t go he’s taking my truck, phone, and everything else away. \n\nI’m working an 8.5 hour shift tomorrow and I really don’t want to be tired for work and I would rather not wake up at 5 am just to go sit in a blind for a couple hours. I like to go hunting sometimes when I want to do it, but it just aggravates me he treats me like I’m 7 and not 17.\n\n He’s already told me as soon as I’m 18 I’m packing my shit and getting out and that he’s not going to help me, which I don’t understand why. I’m his oldest living son and he has this idea that if he’s mean I’ll be tougher or something. Another time not to long ago my distant cousin was having a wedding out of state and he wanted us to go. I told him I had work the day after and he said that I’m just going to have to quit because we are spending the weekend there. Well my mom had to step in and tell him it was bullshit that he was going to make me quit because of that and so we just headed back early the next morning. \n\nThe whole “you’re going to do this because I want you to” thing has happened all my life and now I absolutely hate seeing family, I hate sports, and I am starting to hate hunting. He’s working backwards against himself and making me hate stuff by trying to force me to like it. So am I the asshole for all of this?",

      "description": " \n\nApologies for the terrible formatting and grammar as this is my first post.\n\nSome background:\n\nI met a girl through a friend and arranged to meet her at said friends party (in September), one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. We had a date the next day so from then we were dating, the date went alright and we kept talking from then through to my birthday with a fair few arguments dotted through the time.\n\nJust over a week before my birthday (in November) we had a huge argument about her going to stay at an ex-boyfriends house for a week, later on in the month and me not being comfortable with that a few days after said argument she tried to break things off with me but I said to give it a few days before you decide to make it final then (I found this out the other day) she apparently flirted with, sexted and arranged to sleep with another friend of hers I'll call Steve, he apparently canceled on this I don't know the reasons why. (I'm assuming this is why she tried to break things off with me), A few days before my birthday she changed her mind about wanting to break things off so we fixed things and she came down early for my birthday and things went well.\n\nShe went to see her ex for a week later in November and she let him go through her phone which caused more arguments as I again wasn't comfortable with that as he went through our conversations and others apparently and she refuses to even let me look at her screen when she's on it never mind go through it as its private as it should be.\n\nwe repaired things again and things were going well until December when we argued again because we had arranged a date for after Christmas and I suggested that because of how much we tended to argue I doubted that we would make it to the date, so she ended up breaking things off with me.\n\nwe sorted things at new years but after sorting things everything seemed to lead to an argument with her, she told me she was planning to see her friend Steve for a reschedule of November which she told me was initially to go to the cinema and she was just going to see him and was very firm on that fact, a few days ago i found out about her sexting steve etc from another friend, this caused a huge argument between us, she said that because we weren't actually in a relationship and she never went through with fucking him she didn't cheat and that she chose me over him.\n\nyet she only came to see me and repaired things because he canceled on her, she claimed she loved me at new years which is why she wanted to sort things, during the argument she claimed she hated me and wants nothing to do with me anymore, shes blocked me so I can no longer speak to her.\n\nshe removed the block yesterday as I wanted to talk again to try getting her side of things without me arguing back and she said she doesn't want to try anymore repeatedly regardless of what I tried to say so I told her to \"fuck off and be with Steve\", she continued arguing afterward claiming that me being this way is what made her not want to try anymore. \n\nlater she was telling the friend that told me about Steve that she still loves me and still wants to try, she'll just give it time. \n\nAITA for giving up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Little bit of backstory here, my boyfriend and I (let's call him Adam) have been together for a little over 3 years, own a home together, and are happy in our relationship. My parents and I had a rocky relationship while I was growing up, but I thought we were overcoming that. I've brought home some real assholes in the past and my mom let me know that, but she's never said a bad thing about Adam. \n\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Adam and I went to my parents house. We had dinner and were sitting around having a couple drinks, so I invited my best friend and her boyfriend over. (She's been my best friend since we were 10, were now 22. Her and my mom are also close) We're having some drinks and we start talking about mine and Adam's work Christmas parties. He just started at his current job this fall, but  his co-workers are awesome and he got on with them right away. He works at a small store with only about 10 other employees so the Christmas party was really small but tons of fun. Ive worked at my job for 2 years now, but the company I work for is huge compared to his. The Christmas party is always very formal and pretty dry. Adam made a joke about how how much of an asshole the owner of the company I work for is (he's not wrong either) and my dad comes flying around the corner yelling at my boyfriend. Telling him to shut up, calling him a prick, saying he needs to work harder because I earn more money, telling him he shouldn't say shit about my boss because he'd never hire someone like Adam, just going on and on. I cut him off, saying is this really necessary and he stormed upstairs. My dad is an old rancher, through and through. Stoic until the day he dies. I've never seen him act like that, not even close. My best friend and her boyfriend sat their mortified, and my mom wouldn't stand up for either of us. I needed to get out for a minute so I asked Adam to stay with Megan's (best friend) boyfriend while we went outside for a minute. We went to sit in my car and talk about what the hell we just witnessed. A few minutes later, my mom decides to come out and check on us. She starts by apologizing for my dad, and then starts going off about how lazy Adam is, and just attacking him in general. We argued for around 20 minutes until she just sighed and said something like \"whatever, if you're happy, you're happy. This is between you and your father now.\" (This wasn't a civil argument either) \n\nI went inside a few minutes later, said goodbye to Megan and her boyfriend, and told Adam we should go downstairs and go to bed. I started crying and telling him all the things my mom said about him and us. My mom has a history of doing things like this to me. She'll bottle up emotions, twist stories in her favor, and make up lies to suit her. Then she'll attack me with this twisted story she's cooked up. But I guess this one's been 3 years in the making. \n\nMy dad came downstairs with tears in his eyes, wanting to talk to me. I've only ever seen him cry 2 other times (when his mother passed, and when his best friend passed). I agreed to come and talk. He apologized for how he acted, and said that he needs to learn to accept that things change. He said he has a hard time accepting that I earn more than Adam, and although he works he feels he doesn't work hard enough. I said our jobs are challenging in their owns ways, and living in the small town we live in, we have to take what we can get. My dad said he try his best to accept everything we talked about, and try to change his old cowboy ways. He just asked that we would stay for Christmas. I begrudgingly accepted, only for him. I told my boyfriend and he was okay with it, we both agreed to act like nothing happened the next day. \n\nAnd that's exactly what we did. We got up and opened presents, like nothing happened. We ate Christmas dinner, like nothing happened. We left for home, and said our goodbyes like nothing happened. \n\nThey made no attempt to apologize to Adam, or even to make an apology to both of us. Im not even sure they said goodbye directly to him when he left. My mom seems has no intention of changing her ways, or apologizing to either of us. \n\nAITA for wanting them to come to me to fix this? Should I be trying to contact them and sort this out? We haven't spoken since Christmas day.",

      "description": "Ok, so I’ll provide some background. My team went for a debate tournament. Every debate was judged by an adjudicator. After that, we had to mark the judges based on how well they explained their decision. Based on the scores, the teams and the judges could progress to subsequent rounds. One of the debates was on a topic relating to the Supreme Court (whether or not it should be comprised of political leaders instead of judges when deciding on particularly sensitive issues.) Now, everyone in my team was a law student. We didn’t rely too heavily on legal jargon, but explained the constitutional  jurisprudence behind the judicial system, and how it’s undermined if filled with political appointments. (I’m not American, our Supreme Court justices aren’t appointed by politicians, so don’t get confused). We explained the working of the Supreme Court and how it establishes commissions and committees to investigate and prepare reports on many issues rather than relying on their own knowledge (to show that they weren’t oblivious to the problems faced by the common people, as claimed by the other side.) Anyway, our team lost it and the adjudicator said it was because we used specialised knowledge which wasn’t available to the other team. Now, this didn’t seem fair to me because I don’t see how it’s wrong to use knowledge about the Supreme Court in a debate about the Supreme Court. Nothing else could be more relevant. So I gave the judge a low score and made my teammates do the same. ",

This has nothing to do with his appearance, I don’t care what he looks like.\nThis has everything to do with concern over his health, his self esteem &amp; the bearing this has on our relationship.\n\nMy S.O is obese &amp; has been since I met him a few years ago. However in that space of time he has also expressed that he wishes to lose weight &amp; generally improve his health &amp; wellbeing. This has also been reiterated to him by his doctor for a long time now. He quit smoking cold turkey (one year strong now!) &amp; I’m so immensely proud of him but his weight seems to be a persistent issue he’s unable to address.\n\nI moved in last year &amp; I’ve been doing what I feel is my best to support him without dictating his lifestyle. We’ve started cooking healthy meals together at home which has been great but I think he struggles with his portion-control as well as lots of junky snacking between meals. Initially he got off on a great start &amp; got into an exercise routine &amp; saw some progress. He’s maybe fluctuated up &amp; down several kgs over the last year or so, it pains me with cynicism to say it but this is really only scratching the surface of how much he needs to lose to reach a healthy weight/BMI.\n\nI love being with him but there’s things were restricted from doing because he can’t manage. He gets tired very quickly, hot &amp; sweaty very quickly, which then prompts social anxiety so there are outings we have to leave early from or things we miss out altogether. His snoring is absolutely unbearable, we can’t sleep in the same bed together, I find this particularly upsetting. There is a lack of confidence I know he sees in himself, it breaks my heart.\n\nFor the last several months he continues to communicate his weight loss goals but backs it up with no action. This is causing fights out of frustration, mainly on my part because I feel as though he’s not putting in effort or taking his health seriously. I’m struggling to balance being a supportive observer or calling him out. Is it even my place to do this? Do I have any right in critiquing him for this? I have a genuine fear that one day I’ll lose him to a heart attack. I just don’t know how to navigate this.

Our relationship was rought at the beginning, not going to lie, i did speak to some girls at the early stage of our relationship. But it wasnt anything like flirting, mostly in friendly matter. Eventually I let them know that i have a gf, and most of them stopped speaking to me.\n\nShe knows that most of the girls were only speaking to me because they had some interest on me. And she asked me to stop replying them and I did. I basically stopped meeting all my friends that were girls and keep in contact with some of the close one.\n\nThis month, someone pranked me that she was pregnant by me (a bad joke from someone) and another girl commented that my girlfriends shoes were fake. I showed both of my text to my girlfriend, for me both texts were funny. But she didnt feel the same way, she said that my friend is criticizing her by accusing her of using fake shoes. Honestly i was like \"wtf\" at the moment that i got that text but i didnt find it like a big deal because they are just shoes. It wasnt a nice comment someone could say about someones else shoes but i didnt find it as a reason to feel hurt.\n\nNow at 6 months, she is demanding me to show her my phone. So she makes sure i am not speaking or flirting to anyone. Also, she is asking to eliminate all the girls in my contacts who i dont consider them as a friend. I told her \"no\" and that i feel she is invading my privacy and i never asked her to do those kind of things. I continued by saying that relationship is built on trust and not invading their partners privacy.\n\nAfter that she started to cry saying that i was pushing her away, tell me reddit, Am I being an asshole?\n ",

      "description": "So I had a group of friends since highschool. I’m currently 23 years old and some of them I’ve known for years. To tell you the truth, it got to the point every time I would hang out with them it was draining. Some of them do drugs, still partying and I just feel I’m on a whole new level in life. I’ve been traveling a lot and honestly I feel I have nothing in common with them anymore, and a lot of them I stopped talking to out of the blue. I’ll say why at the end of this.\n\nHere’s the thing. I’ve been realizing a lot lately and on top of that finding out who I want to be and who I want to be in my life. I don’t believe any of them were ever my real friends. The last time I seen 2 out of the group, it was literally 2 days ago and I told them I was planning on moving to New York. Instead of being happy for me, they were bringing me down. One of them even said ‘that’s dumb because if I move there how am I gonna know where everything is or how it works’ keep in mind I’ve already been there and EVERYONE has that issue when they move somewhere totally new which I told him and it seemed like he kept just trying to knock me down. At some point each of the friends I knew since high school have knocked me down majority of my life and I can’t name 5 positive things any of them have said EVER when I had good news.\nI was sick of it and the people I knew.\n\nSo I went home, went on social media and blocked all of them including their numbers so they never have to reach me again. I hope they never see me again. But am I the asshole considering I knew them for so long even though I feel I’ve moved on and don’t appreciate shitty comments from so called friends?",

We are both very busy with work (\\[friend\\] is particularly busy/stressed right now), and talked for the first time in about a month.  A few days before this first talk in awhile, my depression/anxiety peaked a bit and, well, title.  Note that I wasn't able to follow through, got immediate support from the hotline (which is an incredible service that I almost can't believe exists), and didn't get/need medical attention as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I told \\[friend\\] about this, \\[friend\\] breaks down crying and is clearly super upset.  \\[friend\\] proceeds to stay up late talking to me about how I'm doing, starts messaging me every day to check on me, and is just generally great.  I feel particularly bad because my schedule is whacked right now, and I frequently have unable to reply to these late-night messages cause I'm asleep or too tired to respond adequately (in latter cases, I try to send a brief response).  These things together have really put lots of undue stress on \\[friend\\], who's had a stressful/emotionally difficult couple of years anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn retrospect, I hope I'd be as good of a person as \\[friend\\] if I was told something like this, but it really seems like a dick move on my part to put this much emotional pressure on someone who's already super stressed anyway.  I feel particularly selfish since I'm not sure how much this (very good) emotional support is actually helpful; my depression/anxiety seems to stem from me feeling like I am falling behind, am an idiot, can't produce good work, etc...  I don't really know why I told \\[friend\\]; I guess I was still in some amount of shock and was just being super selfish.  As an aside, I haven't talked to anyone else (except my mom, who I tell everything and I figured should really know), and am currently looking for a counselor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short; I am clearly an a-hole for letting myself get to this point, but now feel particularly like a dick for causing additional stress to \\[friend\\] despite (not really) needing to.",

The problem is my mom, who is in her mid sixties, keeps trying to convince us its a bad idea but mostly because she just doesn't want us to move. \n\nPros of moving: sell our house for a decent profit, cost of living is cheaper in Texas, we can buy land in Texas and build a home, no income tax (yes I know property taxes are higher but land/house value will be about $100k less then the home we have now), my husband is from Texas so there is family and friends, I can keep my job and it would be a good career move, we will be able to save for retirement and rainy days\n\nCons of moving to Texas: we have to leave Colorado and my mom says we are leaving her alone and she is very upset\n\nOther thoughts: it is so expensive to live in Colorado and getting more expensive, even though I recently got a raise I'm not sure we could ever move out of our starter home to another home in Colorado as prices are rising quickly, I asked my mom to move to Texas when she retires (which will be soon) and she refuses\n\nI feel bad but I think this is the best decision for our family as we will be able to save for rainy days but also retirement, right now we are really not able to do that.

      "description": "His aunt and siblings all hate me - somewhat irrationally but I understand I’m dating him, not his family.  The problem arises when they constantly bash me in texts and encourage him to leave me.  For example, if they ask SO what he’s doing, and he says doing something with me, they make vomiting emojis and say shit like “bring her over, just bring your guns too”.   When he defended me they told him I was trash and stopped talking to him for a month.\n\nMost recently, his aunt kicked him out of the house because he let me park up the street from her house.  Of course now she’s mellowed out and recently told him that she still loves him and that “his family will still be there once he gets rid of his gf”.\n\nI don’t know why this infuriates me so much.  Maybe because when his aunt kicked him out I ended up paying for his new apartment.  Or that I’ve given him close to 9k to dig him out of debt for his business.  Or that I’m the only person who’s stuck by him through a ton of financial and personal issues.  Or that a lot of the issues we have are due to his personality, not just me.  But it was just a huge kick in the balls when SO just responded with “OK love you too” to his aunt.\n\nI got upset and SO told me I was overreacting and “making him pay” for something that wasn’t his fault.  When i tried bringing up that I wished he had not responded or said something to his aunt about her comment he gave me the “it wouldn’t have mattered” “i just want my 250 bucks back in rent from her (for early eviction)” “why does it matter what they say”.\n\nWe got into a fight and I left super depressed.  Now I guess I’m the asshole for ruining his day and not being supportive after a long day of fixing mechanical issues on his work truck.  So I was just wondering, AITA for expecting some kind of defense from my SO when his family talks crap?  I guess I can see his point where his family just flips a shit when he defends me but he could also just not respond?  I don’t know what’s normal anymore.",

      "description": "This has been bugging me for awhile and I want to know peoples opinions on it. I’m currently in a long distance relationship. I see my gf about every six weeks give or take. When we see each other it’s usually by way of me flying out to see her and staying in her dorm room. \n\nAfter not seeing each other for over a month my gf and I like to have sex like the normal college students we are. Obviously she has a roommate but this roommate (who we’ll call T) goes home every other weekend and it usually lines up perfectly so there was never any conflict because she was gone.\n\nA couple months ago I booked the flight like normal about a month in advance. My gf asked what weekend T was going to be gone so we could line it up and I booked it that date. Come to find out a week before that T mixed up the dates and thought I was coming the week before. So now she’s going to be there the weekend I’m there. No biggie. My gf politely asked if she wouldn’t mind staying with a friend for the couple nights I’m there. T initially agreed but in the week leading up she started being super passive aggressive towards my gf. My gf shrugged it off tho.\n\nThe first day I’m there my gf and I are in the middle of our business when T walks into the room without knocking. We barely are able to cover ourselves as she walks in grabs something and walks out without acknowledging our existence. My gf texted her asking if she could knock next time so no one has to see anyone naked ya know?\n\nHer response was along the lines of “it’s my room and I shouldn’t have to knock to enter my own room. I’m doing you a favor by not sleeping there. I’ll come in when I want” \n\nI honestly don’t understand this mindset. For 1 if she wanted to stay in the room that bad she could have. We obviously could have all shared the room since I’d be in the same bed as my gf. And it’s not like we sprung it on her we gave her a months notice. If we knew she’d be this upset about it we wouldn’t have asked. And I don’t understand how walking in on us having sex is good for anyone? A simple knock and no one is scarred. \n\nWe asked my gf’s sister and she said she would’ve done the same thing and that were messed up for even suggesting it.\n\nSo AITA?",

      "description": "So a couple of days ago, one of the staff at a UX program I had graduated from reached out to me about a internship at this company because they thought I was a good fit for it. She gave me the email address of a person that could refer me for the position and deadline to send in the resume and cover letter. Now I am a bit of a night owl and my sleeping schedule is the complete opposite of a normal person. I send in my resume and cover letter, which I admittedly did rush through, on 12 am of the day it’s due and then I went to bed 4 hours after that.\n\nI wake up the next evening with an email from the referrer and they said that there are a few minor typos in my cover letter and a few edits that should be done to be resume before they would submit it in. They outline and circle everything on the documents I sent them that I should change and told me to get the edits done before 9 am on the 27th. They also mentioned in the same email that I should resubmit with edits because I would be a strong candidate for the job.\n\nSo then on the 26th at around 9 pm, I crank up my music and I get to work redoing my entire resume and cover letter. I even asked my friend to do some proofreading on my cover letter. After I was completely satisfied with how both of my resume and cover letter looked, I sent them to the referrer at 12 am on the 27th and go to sleep at around 4 am. \n\nThe next day, I check my email at around 6 pm while eating dinner and discover that the referrer had sent me an email at 9:27 am about how I had not capitalized the S in street on the address part of my cover letter. They asked me if I could correct it ASAP as it was on the top of my cover letter and that would be the first a recruiter would read. I go to my computer and did the revision and sent it to her at 7 pm after I had finished my dinner.\n\nThe next morning, I wake up early to help my parents with an errand and I get back an email from the referrer saying that because I had handed in my resume and cover letter late that she could not submit in my application with the rest of the candidates. So now the question becomes am I the asshole for being upset that they didn’t submit in my resume? And also WIBTA if I brought up how my application was not submitted to the staff at my UX program who had told me about the opportunity in the first place?\n\n",

      "description": "I'm Indian, and my parents are the stereotypical Asian parents: never satisfied with anything I do, restrictive, controlling, etc. However, if I need anything, reasonably speaking, they'll try to get it for me.\n\nThis all came to a head a year and a half ago, when I was choosing where to go to college. I was picking between my local university, which is top 20 for my major (aero), and UC Berkeley for mechanical. I wanted to go to my local school, as I plan to go to law school anyway and this is just a backup. Tensions were running high, and the weekend before May 1st (the acceptance deadline) they pretty much interrogated me and tried to mentally beat me down for 4-5 hours a night, trying to get me to change my mind. I wasn't in the best place mentally at the time, so I was upfront on the first day that I wasn't feeling great, thought I might be depressed and wanted to see a doctor. They laughed at me and said that was an obvious lie, then proceeded with the questions. \n\nI have never been hurt mentally more than I was that weekend. The aftermath was horrible too - neither of them spoke to me for two weeks. It was only after I booked an appointment at the doctor and received a diagnosis of moderately severe depression that they started talking to me again.\n\nSince then, I've been doing well here - I'm part of student government, I've had numerous event ideas that I'm working on for students here and I'm learning a lot - but like I mentioned before, it's never enough. I dread breaks or having to deal with them, because I just don't like them anymore. Traveling is awful since I can't just ignore them like I do at home. \n\nI understand their concerns over my decision at the time - I was young (just 16) and it was a good chance - and I understand that they have done a lot for me. I also know that now that I'm 18, I may be allowed more freedom. However, I think they crossed a few lines with their response. I'd like to also make clear that they pay almost nothing for my schooling ($2000/year) and it'll be $0 for the next two years if things go to plan. My scholarships and my other endeavors have done that much. Despite this, they're essentially forcing me to stay in my major, which holds barely any interest for me anymore.\n\nWhen I get to law school, I plan to keep my visits to holidays only. I can't help but feel like I'm a dick, but to be frank I can't let go of what happened and I just do not like them anymore - I may go so far as to say that I don't feel any attachment anymore, but I would need to think about that more. I just want to finally feel like I'm doing something for myself, something that I want to do.",

This hasn't happened. \n\nIt's now clear she's ignoring me, the \"won't even open your message while I'm constantly online on Facebook,\" no responses on SMS and so really the only option for me is to take it to court. \n\nEven though it's an unloseable case for me, it's still time and effort, with no guarantee of seeing the money if she's too poor to even pay back the abysmal rate we agreed on.\n\nI found her mom on Facebook, and have drafted what I was planning on sending to her: \n\n\"Hey. You may not know me and I'm still unsure as to whether it's inappropriate for me to send this message, but your daughter [L] borrowed $1500 off me to buy that dog she now has. There was a clear agreement in writing as to what has to be paid back and when and she is not paying it back. I send messages, both on Facebook and SMS and she ignores them - I think that's a clear sign that someone's dodging their obligations. The next step is to sue for it, which in this case for me is unloseable, but I'm just wondering whether or not to avoid the legal fees she'd be forced to pay you could either tell her to finalise it, or you could pay me it directly and then take it up with her. Apologies if this is out of line, but $1500 isn't something you forget about, and really this is for her benefit and not my own. \"\n\nIs this entirely appropriate, or is this going too far?",

      "description": "Hey, AITA. I recently got called an asshole and I'm wondering if it's true.\n\nMy boyfriend and I (together a year) like to play games online together, a lot of times MMOs. One of his friends, we'll call them Alex, tags along with us. Usually invited, sometimes not, but my boyfriend doesn't care if they tag along across games.\n\nNow, I don't like Alex a bunch - I think they're a little dense and slightly annoying, but I treat them with respect and I'm as nice to them as I would be with a stranger. However, apparently they complained to my boyfriend that I only talk to them or play with them when he's there and that I am bitchy and he should tell me to be nice to his friends.\n\nI haven't been mean to Alex that I know of! I play with them, help them in game, tell them gear they need when I'm asked, protect them from monsters they don't know how to fight... maybe I'm a little condescending in my head, but I've never been a jerk to Alex because I care about my boyfriend and this is his best friend's spouse. \n\nWhen my boyfriend logs off, I tell Alex goodnight shortly after so I can go spend real life time with him. Alex's spouse (my boyfriend's bestie) also sent me a text asking why their partner isn't good enough for me.\n\nI feel like I'm taking crazy pills, am I really being an asshole here? I'm a private person and keep most people at arms length. I can count my friends on one hand, the rest are aquaintencis that I'm cordial to when we see each other - I'm friendly and joke with them like normal, I just don't get personal and close with them.\n\nFor the record, my boyfriend told them not to call me bitchy, because he's always there when we play and I'm pretty nice to Alex, and that I'm like that with basically everyone. Polite but distant. \n\nI'm a bit anxious and annoyed now though, my boyfriend has been best friends with these people for over a decade and I don't want to cause a rift between them. I'm happy he's sticking up for me, but am I the asshole here? \n\ntl;dr play game boyfriend friend, boyfriend friend mad",

      "description": "Alright so a bit of backstory. My fiance and I went through some rough patches a little while ago, and my frustration levels were high. He has this problem with not thinking about how another person could interpret his words, so sometimes he'll say something REALLY offensive and genuinely not mean it that way. I've learned to let a lot of it go, and to try and see what he really meant instead of just jumping to the \"he's an asshole\" conclusion, but there are a few things he's said that have stuck in my mind, and make me angry just to think about. \n\nThe biggest one is when he said \"It's just human nature to cheat!\" while we were arguing about why he wouldn't take a job that kept him out of the house. He went on to tell me that he didn't trust \"human nature\" and thought I would sleep with our mutual roommate (also male) if we were left alone for too long. That one really burns me up. Not only is it SUPER fucking rude and insulting, it's super hypocritical! Our roommate would leave his then-girlfriend at our apartment while I also went to work, leaving my fiance and the girlfriend alone for up to 10 hours a day. He also has cheated on his previous girlfriends, but he was 15 and we're all terrible people at 15. I've never cheated on anyone, and have done nothing to warrant that level of disrespect, but he said it anyway and never really apologized for it. \n\nIDK am I an asshole for holding onto this for months on end? It feels like I'm doing the \"don't you remember when you made me feel bad on December 19th, 2013 at 6:38pm??\" thing that bitter housewives do when their marriage is failing.",

      "description": "Hoo boy, I don’t really know where to start with my history with this chick. I guess I’ll just contextualize the story by saying we’ve dated on and off a couple times for the past year.\n\nA couple months ago me and my ex broke it off for the second time. It seemed pretty final, it took a lot of time and energy but I finally got over her, just in time for her to come crawling back saying she missed me.\n\n I gave her the benefit of the doubt and we met up so I could hear her out, I asked her what she wanted to come of this relationship and she refused to tell me. Whenever we talked she would avoid the touchy subject of our whole relationship being in this limbo without any real goal.\n\n I got sick of it so I told her flat out that she needed to make up her mind, she then said, and I quote “I’m running away from this conversation” and got in her car and left, she obviously meant this to be a joke but I wasn’t having it.\n\n The next day she came over to my house and I pleaded with her to tell me what was going on with her and she still refused to tell me anything in the slightest. I decided I’m sick of this ‘getting together, fooling around and breaking up’ routine and I told her we’re done. She didn’t take it well at all and she left without even saying goodbye. \n\nNow bear in mind that we’re both teenagers so she could just be insane and irrational but I’m worried I messed up somewhere or if there was a better way to go about this. Am I the asshole?",

We're also saving a deposit for a house so at the moment, a ring and a wedding isn't an expense we need.\n\nHowever, her family, my friend and our friends keep pressuring me into doing so.  Saying that it's perfect time to do so, it would be so romantic etc.\n\nAside from the saving for a house , in my opinion, people who propose on Xmas or a birthday just couldn't be bothered to get a proper gift and thought....\"ah, I'll just propose\".  \n\nThere are 363 other days you could propose, don't do it on a day that's already taken! Imagine if your birthday was December 25th and for your entire life so far people have doubled up your gift saying it was a joint birthday and Xmas present.....and then your S/O proposed on that day too. That would suck balls.\n\n\n\n\n",

I'm not judging her promiscuity, but her disregard for others' health and her own. She's confessed plenty of times that she's gone through hook ups regardless of whether the person has protection or not, has bragged about the amount of people she's gotten with to the point she doesn't remember the exact number, which includes homeless and explicitly sexually active individuals in our city. She's complained about countless ailments and discharges from both orifices, and other areas, and even through all this, she refuses to do anything about it. I'm considering just removing her from my life completely because I feel like I'm an accomplice for not stopping her from potentially spreading diseases.

She knows that I'm against it and we agreed that when she would smoke with her friends, she would tell me beforehand. About a month ago she did it but only told me a week later. \n\n- when I said that she has to choose between me and weed she said that she chooses me and swore to NEVER smoke weed again. Yesterday she went on a trip with her friends for a few days and today whe messaged me that she plans on smoking. I remined her that she swore on not smoking ever again and she said that its not such a big deal and that she will smoke it.\n\nAm I the one overreacting?

They usually borrow around 250-375$ give or take. And sometimes even up to 750$ which is a lot of money. It gets pays back in the end of the month, usually everything, but not always. \nThey pick me up from work at night when I’m don. But every month I pay them some money for the diesel and all. Not always as much as it cost, and sometimes more. \n\nBut lately when I try to say no when they want to borrow money they started threatening me with stuff that I have to move out, or that I have to find my self a new way to get home from work. And I’m honestly getting sick and tired of it. \nSo I’ve called her out on it twice now, and said that I’m sick and tired of her empty and emotionally based threats. Now she is calling me out for being arrogant and out of line, I should respect her more and be grateful for being able to live home for free. But I get no respect back, or at least it feels that way. It doesn’t even feel like I get taken seriously when I mention it.\nBut what I tho is that I bring home a lot of food and meat from work for free. And supplying them that way, so I feel like I’m helping at home, not by paying rent but in other ways? There life’s would never go around if they hadn’t borrow money from me every mont. \nI should also mention that she threatens me to pay rent, but out of despite of her behaviour and attitude I’d rather move out but pay them money for living home. \n\nAm I the asshole? Am I in the wrong and out of line? \nSorry for the bad spelling, I’m dyslexic. Just putting it out there ",

He began using Meth and Heroin for 3 years because the pills just weren't enough anymore.\n\nMy dad went to visit his mom in 2015 to rekindle their relationship, but he was so high he missed his flight. So his mom bought another ticked that same day, and when he arrived he was, and these are my grandmothers words, \" High as a fuckin kite, and drooling on himself like a retarded child\". So my grandmother stuck his ass back on a plane home. We then receive a call from her saying she never wants to see us again and has taken us out of the Will ( she is a multi millionaire and I will not disclose anymore information to keep her privacy) and does not want anything to do with a drug addict son.\n\nEnd of the year 2016 my dad got clean. He reached out to his ill mother and decided to move in with her to help her. They some how rekindled their relationship and things were looking good for them. My father had one last spinal surgery to under go ( he was told they finally figured out a way to relieve his pain) and he was nervous, because he knew pain medication will be involved. Unfortunately, June 17th of 2017, my dad passed away from an accidental narcotic over dose. They pumped him full of drugs, wrote him prescriptions, and sent him on his marry way. Turns out the prescription mixed with the surgery medication, caused his organs to fail, ultimately killing him.\n\nI see my grandmother for the first time since 2010 on June 20th, 2017 to talk about a service for my father. She was heart broken. Out of no where my dads sister mentions how she is glad he stopped Meth and Heroin... My grandmother never knew about that part and decided to not give him a service.\n\nLately I have been thinking of reaching out. My father was broken when his mother cut him out of her life. He was in so much pain because of that. But he sucked up his pride and tried to get her back, and he did. I don't want bad blood between my dads family and us, it is not what he wanted. He only ever wanted everyone to love as hard as they can. I want  to do that for him, but my mom and sister are not a fan of this idea. They do not understand why, and think I am choosing his family over my own.\n\nAm I the ass hole here? I know she fucked over my dad and our entire family, but my dad found forgiveness in his heart, so why can't I?\n\nTLDR: grandma cut out dad and entire family for his drug addiction, then my dad and grandma mad up, then my dad died, she found out more details of his drug addiction and decided to not do a funeral or service for him. I want to now reach out after almost 3 years",

      "description": "I (16M) was dating a girl (16F) for a long while (about a year and a half) when she started to get into BTS, and it took over her life. She only talked about BTS anymore, she only posted and followed people on twitter that also liked BTS, it was all she would listen to, she spent all of her money on their merch, and stopped talking to all of her friends that weren't into BTS aside from me. At first I supported her new interest, but after a while it got overbearing to the point that I couldn't handle it anymore.\n\nShe would try to force me to get into BTS all the time, claiming that \"anyone who comes in contact with these boys falls in love\". Whenever she would, I would try to tell her about the toxicity of the k-pop industry and fandom, but she wouldn't listen, claiming that the artists were just dedicated and some fans just loved them a little bit too much. (For context, one of the artists broke a leg and still went on to concert, and she claimed it was dedication and he wasn't forced to do it. She also claimed that the fans that tracked the band to an airport and threw themselves on them was \"a bit much, but it wasn't that bad\")\n\nAfter I while I just got fed up with it, and broke up with her. She wasn't the person I fell in love with, she had completely changed. Rather than the deep discussions about life and the universe and politics, she just wanted to talk about whatever Yoongi or Jaehyun did that day.\n\nShe thinks I'm the one in the wrong because I'm not supporting her, but that's not it at all, I don't think. I broke up with her not because she has an interest I don't have, but because she's a wholly different person and was the kind of person that would be incredibly angry if one of the members so much as took a concert off because he was sick, and I didn't need that in my life. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Im 6'8. Very tall by most people standards. I get a lot of looks in public, the occasional joke. Some more enthusiastic strangers will call me big guy.\n\nBut I have never been asked to be ridden around (by a stranger) before until this weekend.\n\nI went to the zoo with my visting cousin and her husband, plus my sister and my friend. Thought it was kinda lame but whatever we did it on the spur of the moment.\n\nWhile we're walking from exhibit to exhibit a small asian girl keeps following me at the heels, closely followed by her family. I saw what looked like a dad with another girl on his shoulders pushing a stroller with another baby, an older woman holding an asian boy, another middle aged asian couple, then two old asian men and a granny. Plus some kiddos running around like the one following me. So a big family that would laugh and giggle every time they looked at me and i looked at them.\n\nA little more background, we are all in Texas and I was wearing cowboy boots and a hat (you dont have to say it i know i look good). \n\nI believe they thought i was like a tourist sighting, like a giant cowboy in texas. I dont mind that at all really. Im not self conscious.\n\nHowever it got weird when one of the asian women approaches me and says \"You hold her on your shoulder\". While smiling and pointing at the kid.\n\nShe wanted me to do what the dad was doing with the other kid so the little girl could see into the gorilla pit while also getting to ride me.\n\nThe girl was very young and had a binkie so i thought she also had diapers and i didnt want diaper neck or someone on my head. Plus id need to take off my hat and carry it around and it was just a hassle.\n\nSo I say \"Oh no thanks.\"\n\n\"You pick her up so she can see.\n\n\"Oh no thanks.\"\n\n\"No you pick her up its ok.\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\nI dont think she understands english very well so I start shaking my head from side to side and start saying \"No\" forcefully.\n\nThe little kid starts pouting and crying and the asian family start giving me mean looks. Then the grandma pulls a zoo worker aside and points to me, at which point i assume they realize that im not a zoo attraction for tourists. But it was just awkward and my sister just said i should carry around this kid on my neck.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "I have a PhD in Philosophy, and my little brother Liam (19) is trying to read Nietzsche for the first time, never having taken a Philosophy class. He picked \"Beyond Good and Evil,\" which I would probably not have recommended for a first-time reader, but he seems to be enjoying it. However, whenever Liam talks about something that he's read, it's clear that he is wildly misunderstanding the text. Since he doesn't have any kind of context (of Platonism, Schopenhauer, or earlier Nietzsche), this is extremely understandable. However, it's frustrating to listen to, and HE seems to be frustrated by the ideas that \"just don't make sense.\"\nSo far, I've been taking the approach of \"yep, yep, that's an interesting interpretation. Many Nietzsche scholars are more inclined to understand [idea] as [more legitimate interpretation].\" Liam doesn't disagree, but he also doesn't really seem interested in my help. Part of me feels like I should just let it go and let him do things his own way, but part of me is concerned that I would be doing him a disservice by shutting up. If he tries to read other philosophers who are engaging with Nietzschean ideas (and that's a lot of 20th century philosophers), he will be very handicapped by his misunderstandings of BGE. \n\nAITA for continuing to (gently) correct him, even though he does not seem interested in my help?",

      "title": "AITA for leaving my ex-friend without telling him why?",
      "description": " I know the title makes me sound like a jerk but hear me out (also I do think I was being kind of a jerk). Around the seventh grade I met this kid in my History class. We talked and at first I thought he was a pretty cool dude to hang out with. He was nice to me, never really made fun of me unlike almost everyone else at my school. So the year goes on and I'm sitting with this kid every single day. We talked about normal idiotic seventh grader stuff and had a bunch of fun. But over time, I started to realize that this kid was not what I thought him to be at first. I started to realize that he was kind of a jerk. And I also realized that he was slowly  ruining my friendships with the very few friends I had. Of course, it took me about a year and a half to finally realize this. He would always act like it was the biggest deal ever when I left him for another class I had to go to and did not spend an extra thirty seconds to talk to him. And then when I came back to him at lunch, he would proceed to get mad at me for leaving him, and then make fun of me and humiliate me the entire lunch. Rinse and repeat. For the next one and a half years. I felt trapped in a never ending cycle that I was now too scared to try to get out of. Anytime I was talking with someone else, he would walk up to me, trying to hold back his anger and act normal (because there was someone else there too) and tell me nicely \"Hey, lets go to lunch\" (or something along those lines) which was code for, \"Get away from him and come sit with me, idiot.\" So my life sucked and I was feeling pretty depressed because of it (or because it was middle school, I couldn't tell). Anyways, that was my life for the entire seventh grade and half of eighth grade. I should also mention that during that time I was sitting with him at lunch, I sat with no one else. There was no one else at our table. Just me and him and it sucked. Finally, I managed to leave him. For once, I didn't sit at that table and I sat with people I actually enjoyed being with. And then I continued doing that and I felt happy again. But the reason I think I was being kind of an asshole was because I never confronted him about it. I was basically too scared to talk to him face to face and say that I hated everything that he did to me and to never talk to me again. But he never did talk to me again so I'm pretty happy. But the fact that he might do this to another person and make them have to go through the same feelings that I'd been feeling is always on my conscience and personally I think it makes me an AH too. But I still want to ask this here too for confirmation/relief I guess.\n\ntl;dr: \"Friend\" makes me feel like shit for one and half years straight and isolates me from everyone else. I finally left but I'm too scared to tell him why I left and the fact that he could now do this to someone else is always on my conscience. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Obligatory throwaway account for obvious reasons\n\nSo this happend a little while back, my best friend let's just call him A was in a successful relationship (or so i thought at the time) with this girl we'll just call J why is this important? Well because we're highschoolers and unfortunately with the hookup culture in full swing real relationships that last more than a month are rare to find.\n\nNow to flesh out the back story a little more i did not know J personally but she seemed cool from what i had heard about her through A ofcourse. Now this is where the story starts; one boring summer day A tells me that J and him had exchanged passwords of their snaps mainly for pictures but she could log into his account from time to time, i did not think much of this as she didn't log in till a few days later.\n\nSo J logs into A's account and i catch on pretty quick that the person talking is J and she gives me her snap and asks me to add her which i was not expecting but i wasn't gonna say no to her face as it wasn't something inappropriate, and we actually had quite a bit in common (which i found out later on that day just casually texting her)\n\nFast forward a few days and she proposed to me in a very roundabout non-confrontational way.......that escalated quickly? Well yes, yes it did even for me as i thought she's out of my league you know straight A student, state level tennis and swimming player and also very attractive the whole package and she never hit on me either. At first i thought it was a prank or a fad or something and we didn't talk the next few days and she says she'll break things off with A and i well didn't want that to happen but i can't make her decisions for her.\n\nSo getting to the point she didn't break things off i talked to A a few days after her birthday and i can't see my best friend in such distraught and i be very upfront and honest with him as even though J is a good girl, she wasn't the best gf atleast to A cuz she didn't love A as much as A loved her to summarise it.\n\nFast forward a few months A has cut both me and J out of his life and our social circles overlap very heavily so i know for a fact he hasn't moved on and he passively hates me even though i let J know that A was my priority if i had to pick one but i didn't exactly want to cut either out of my life and while i did tease A a little when me and J started talking it was just funny banter and it was way before she proposed.\n\nEven i can see i wasn't a very good friend in this situation but i tried my best to do damage control and not take a side, still i have tried to reconcile with A and start off our friendship fresh also no i am not dating J nor do i plan to. But A has tried to block me off J's socials and he has often back bitched me, J doesn't like A at all anymore and A doesn't like me at all anymore while I'm trying to figure where this shit hit the fan.\n\nSo reddit AITA here some say i am some say I'm not but i just didn't want to have to pick a side but i subconsciously ended up picking one, also excuse my english as it isn't my first language and i tried to articulate my rant as best as i could.",

      "description": "Around 5 days ago we discovered that a cat with her litter had moved in to our garage. Unfortunately she decided that one of the four kitten was to weak and didn’t give her enough milk to stay alive, so we took her inside our house and have been feeding, cleaning etc. She is gaining weight everyday and doing really well, especially because my three younger sisters take really good care. Next week my parents and my sisters will be going on vacation and I’ve decided to stay at home for the two weeks to work and to party. The problem is that if we keep the kitten, I would have to feed her every 6 hours and couldn’t really go out in the evening or work for a whole day. We could give her to a pet shop so she could be adopted and I wouldn’t have to take her of her. I would really like to keep her but I’m not sure if I am able to care for her on my own for two weeks. Also I don’t want that my sisters think that I’m just to lazy after they put so much effort into it. I’m really not sure what to do now.",

      "description": " \n\nI  live in an apartment off campus at a university. I was assigned a  random roommate for my 2-bedroom place 7 months ago, and am halfway  through the lease. I was randomly assigned a roommate, whom I contacted  about 2 weeks prior to moving in. When I texted him the conversation was  seemingly good, and he informed me he was an \"aspie\". I was totally  cool/down with this, in fact I was kind of stoked about it. I once saw a  doc on a surfer with Aspergers and he was cool as shit.\n\nAnyways,  the first few weeks were cool. I definitely thought he was a little off  but I expected that. We still found countless topics to speak on. As a  roommate though, he seemed to be very neurotic about a few things. First  off, he was intent on dividing the entire space and creating some  ground rules. But his ground rules were strange and always changing. For  instance, he was very intent on splitting up kitchen counter space. But  I had no items on the counter at all and figured we could use the  countless cupboards. I said whatever, just like I kept saying, but shit  has gotten weird.\n\nHe has apparently had  terrible experiences with his family in the past, but he told me his  parents and sister blame their divorce on him. He talked of  physical/verbal/emotional abuse, the 1st of which he is suing his  parents for. Briefly put, his parents no longer speak to him and his  sister refuses to speak with him expect in therapy. They don't totally  believe he has Asperger's too. They sent him to psychiatric camps. He is  suing them for that too. He is poor because they won't supply him with  money due to his drug habit. reminded me of a kid I knew a few years  back who passed since.\n\nHe makes my place  smell weird because he is always burning strange things like herbs and  Myrrh on the stove. He kept a few bananas on \"his\" side of the kitchen  with psilocybin spores in them, cut open to allow sunlight and air in.  They made the apartment reek after two weeks, when I asked him to remove  them (which he did reluctantly). He did something similar with a  pumpkin in the oven shortly after. He keeps jars and bottles of  unidentifiable fermented liquids throughout his side of the kitchen.  They smell so weird. He often burns nuts and cooks weird things like  yogurt. He straight up left yogurt out and continued to eat it for a  couple weeks. He is always smoking the strangest smelling things.  Somethings I'll admit aren't terrible, like \"Godu kola,\" but some of it  is strange shit that he cooked. My best friend recently walked in to our  apt to him boiling his shirt on his frying pan.\n\nThe  past couple months I haven't been getting along with him and he also  tries to give me life advice and tell me how to be. I tried to get him  to physically strike me because he is always telling me he could beat me  up. Then I can get He's 95 lbs, 6'8. I'm 210, 6'3. I didn't plan on  hurting him, in fact I was gonna call the cops, to basically receive a  permission to exit my lease. No avail. 2 days ago I stopped talking to  him.\n\nHere's why I might be the A. I  texted him 2 days ago and said horribly mean things. I said everything I  felt, telling him his family rightfully hates him and that he'll never  be anything and basically there's a reason nobody likes him. I call him  crazy a lot too, and I even taunted him a few times by singing when he's  trying to lecture me about how I need to change or how he demands my  father's phone number to lecture my father. I have no respect for him  and I show it. I tell him to shut the fuck up whenever he starts saying whining at me. I texted him, \"I hate you\" along with various other hateful things. I am doing these things because through his behavior and actions he has been a horrible roommate, and also speaks condescendingly to me with no reason. He is also insane.\n\nWhatsup reddit, AITA?",

Discussed this with other anons who think im terrible, others who think im doing the right thing.\n\nMy brother in law was killed in November in a mugging. Just suckerpunched and stomped to death before getting his shit stolen. He had almost no money to his name.\n\nMy BIL was a heroin addict. He was strung out on my wedding. He missed birthdays, he disappeared for days on end. He even stole several guns from my safe to pawn for money to buy drugs.\n\nAt our families pleading he went to rehab, and was supposedly clean since may all the way until his death. My wife and her family were devastated at his death, but took comfort in the fact that he beat his addiction and was himself again when he died, after decades of being a slave to needles.\n\nShe frequently posts stuff on our social media about how her brother was a hero who overcame so much adversity and finally beat the devil on his back. How he finally found peace.\n\nThe only issue is that he wasnt clean. He relapsed and was using at least a week and a half before his murder. He called me, jonesing, begging for money to buy heroin. I refused him. I didnt tell my wife because i didnt want to upset her, then a few days later he was dead.\n\nI haven't told anyone. Im letting them keep the image they have but im also denying them the truth. Im also not telling anyone because if they catch the guy who killed my BIL i dont want them to use that against the prosecution. \"Oh he was a drug addict maybe he provoked it\", stuff like that.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "So Im 30 years old and I have been renting a house for 6 years with my wife and we have 3 kids, a 2 and 3 year old and 1 month old. I’m a self employed fabricator/welder and work about 6 days a week, all day long. I also am a professional handy man and do all sorts of skilled labor. I have a registered business and leave cards at places all around town. I get a lot of work no problem. My wife has been on disability so I have been working more than usual to make up for lost $. I’m very busy, I have a calendar packed with jobs- people calling me constantly wanting custom metal work done and such. Often times I commute far away to warehouses and spend all day and night fabricating wheelchair ramps and railings etc- point is, I’m very busy and get very little family time let alone personal time right now.\n\n\nMy wife is a trooper, she is up all night with the newborn breastfeeding and healing from a c section, and then chases after 2 toddlers who don’t nap from about 6am til 8pm- being stressed with little down/personal time has caused us to have some very stressful times in our marriage. Just to give an idea how fast paced our lives are at this moment.\n\n\nAnyways, our neighbor is a single woman in her late 40’s and early on she has kind of inserted herself in our lives, she got our cell phone numbers and came to hold our babies when they were born stuff like that- she also always calls/texts me for anything and everything that goes wrong w her house. I honestly have never really minded helping but it’s been 6 years and now she has moved out, lives 20 miles away and rents the property out to tenants. I guess she views me as her own personal handy man because she calls me over to hang TVs, install ceiling fans, fix leaky faucets, etc and my wife always teases me that she thinks I’m her husband and needs to get her own. \n\n\n\nSo last week she asked me to come fix her water heater. Given how busy I was i decided it was time for her to start paying for services that I charge everybody else for- but I gave her a great deal and charged her only $60 to change the thermal coupler which is what usually is wrong with water heaters that keep going out. Replacing the water heater, even under warranty would cost her hundreds maybe even a thousand more and told her that would be the next step. A few days pass and she texts me that the flame is out. I am so busy but I go over and relight it. Then it goes out again and again, and again, so the last (4th) time in about a week, she just texts me out of nowhere that it’s out again and that she is 30 minutes away heading over and to wait for her to let me in to relight it to which I reply “No, I’m working.” She then sends a very long text basically saying that she talked to some friend of hers who said I conned her out of $60 because the water heater needed to be replaced and I basically wasted her time and $ replacing the coupler and that she was disappointed in me for lying to her I guess. I replied back verbatim: “You can call any professional technician and they will suggest replacing the thermal coupler first because that is what usually causes this problem, they also would have charged you per visit to relight it for you, I’ve been working on these for years and know what I’m doing. If you feel otherwise I have no problem refunding you the $, but do not ask me for help again, it’s been a headache and my time is very valuable.” \nShe replies with: “You are a very disrespectful kid, I really hope you’re a better parent than that to your children, I hope they learn respect and how to be good people but with you as their parent I don’t see that happening you have a very long way, I really didn’t expect you to respond this way and no, they wouldn’t have charged me that much, and you’re a neighbor and that’s what neighbors do, they help! I was just trying to give you jobs so you can earn $ but I won’t be doing that anymore- no response is needed!” \n\nNow, I’m really upset at her attacking my parenting because I love my kids with all my heart and I spend every moment I can with them and always teach them to respect, love and help others but I feel there is a difference being taken for granted and kindness being mistaken for weakness. I think it was super shitty for her to bring my kids into this. \n\nI don’t think I’m wrong though, and don’t want to dignify her with a response so I didn’t reply but I’m wondering if I should have handled this differently? I don’t think it’s normal for somebody to feel entitled to a neighbor’s skilled labor for free because they’re a neighbor- obviously I don’t mind doing favors for people at all but damn, she calls me for everything. How should I handle it when I inevitably run into her again? \n\ntl;dr Single neighbor feels entitled to my skilled labor at moments notice all the time, finally asked for money and she accuses me of conning her, offered it back and told her not to ask me for help again and she got very upset and attacked my parenting.",

      "description": "  \n\n\\*\\*Sorry for how long this ended up being. I appreciate anyone who gets through the whole thing. \\*\\*\n\nSeveral years ago, I moved from OR to FL to take care of my father. He was a recent widow and fell into a deep depression that he would not acknowledge. His home could have easily been on Hoarders and he drank himself to sleep every night. I didn’t want to lose another parent, so I dropped everything and came to live with him. After three years he was back on his feet and was healthy again. He still drank too much, but he was more like himself and the house was back to normal. I had met my husband to-be and wanted to start our lives together. Neither of us wanted to settle down in FL so my husband and I moved to GA to be close to all our east coast family. \n\nOne year later, my dad lost his job of 24 years. That sent him back down the bottle and he went from being a functioning alcoholic to a nonfunctioning one. He blew through his savings and started pulling out his retirement funds. He peed in bottles instead of paying the water bill and flushing the toilet. A homeless man moved in with him and slept in a nest on the living room floor. There was no way to get to the second floor as every room and the stairway was filled with garbage. There was a “deer trail” between the chest-high garbage to get from the front door to the kitchen but that was the only place you could see the (filthy) floor. Oh, and did I mention the cat pee and poop scattered like little presents everywhere? Oh, and the flee, rat, and roach infestation? Sorry, it’s all coming back as I type this. They say you need to let people hit rock bottom, but I couldn’t see my dad going any lower. He’s since admitted he knows was killing himself. \n\nI didn’t want to move back with dad. Instead, I asked him to come to GA and move in with me and my husband.  He tried to say no, and that he was going to fix up the house to sell for a lot of money, but I knew that was just a dream. Eventually I cleaned out his house (it took four dumpsters and two full weeks of digging through rat poop infested garbage) and moved him in with me. I’ve spent the last couple of years getting him back to health (again). That was his only job, just focus on getting better. He hasn’t had a drink for over 12-months, he went to therapy, and has taken care of various other issues with his health. I’m proud of him. But now that he is healthy again, I want more and need to know if I’m being the asshole.\n\nAITA #1) When I met my husband in FL he lived 2 hours away. He moved in with me and my dad for a month or two, so he could check out the area for his own place closer to me.  My dad and my then-boyfriend got along so well that my husband never moved out. He lived with me and my dad for well over a year. Dad said he didn’t expect my husband to pay rent since it didn’t cost dad anything extra to have him there. I wouldn’t have that and insisted that my husband paid a fair share of rent to my dad. My husband agreed, and I collected the money each month and gave it to my dad. \n\nNow that my dad is healthy again, I would like him to pay rent towards the house we all live in. He thinks this is unfair since he is just using the spare room and the shed for his tools that he uses to help around the house. For example, over the last two years he’s been trying to finish painting the windowsills…. They are still not done. I’d be willing to trade his handywork for rent if he did enough work to make himself a partner in this house. But he says he shouldn’t have to pay for a house he has no equity in and that he only wants to do the projects he likes, when he feels like it. He says it is wrong for us to expect him to take care of my home and anything he does is a gift. I asked him to live here, so AITA for asking him to contribute now that he’s healthy again? \n\nAITA #2) My dad’s sister roped him into a real-estate deal that has cost my father over 80k to date. He’s spent almost all his retirement though, so he can no longer afford to pay the mortgage. He’s looking into taking a loan to cover the mortgage and to fix up the dilapidated house on the property. I’ve been in several arguments with him, begging for control to take over the sale of the property. He wants to sell it eventually but is letting my aunt try to manage the sale. I sold his home in FL for him and he was thrilled with the result ($20k more than his realtor said was possible). His sister hasn’t been able to get the property listed in over a year. As his final retirement funds drain away, I am freaking out that I will be financially and physically responsible for my father for the rest of his life. I could help by getting that other property sold and getting his investment back to him. He says he knows I can help but wants me to stay out of it. But I can’t let it go. It’s like watching an incredibly slow car accident and I want to jump in and save the people in the car. Thanksgiving turned into a screaming match over this and he said I need to mind my own business. His monetary choices affect me too, but it is his money, so maybe I’m the asshole for butting in?",

      "description": "I'll just cut to the chase here.  So my friend group and I are all going to an aircraft mechanic school and all of us except one live together.  One of them (let's call him E) thinks he's funny.  He constantly makes jokes about my weight or my looks or the fact that I'm \"smart\"(I know, stupid). I've made a point to tell him multiple times to stop doing this and he just tells me to chill out and he was just joking.  Fine.  However, today we were working in the shop and when I messed up one of my projects he told me that i should drop out and change my career.  I'd understand if i was constantly failing at everything we do but I'm a straight A student and almost always get an A on my shop projects, in fact I'm doing better than he is.  E said that i would never succeed in this job and if i continued in this field I'd end up begging on a street corner.  He did not say this like a joke, in fact his tone sounded like he was trying to do his best to insult me.  So I blew up on him and told him that if I end up homeless he'll probably be in a situation far worse, and to fuck off.  He didn't like that and got pissy for the rest of the day, and my friends are telling me I'm an asshole.\n\nSo I'm going to reddit for judgement now, AITA?",

      "description": "Hello all, so with Christmas fast approaching I’m expecting the usual round of well meaning parents to buy their kids a pet as a Christmas gift. A little background on me, I’m an animal lover and I own several exotic pets. I wouldn’t call myself an expert but I have a decent amount of experience with the animals I own. \n\nEvery Christmas I get always end up with people asking me advice on how to take care of various pets that they wanna get for their kids, and it pretty much always ends with them listening to half of what I say and then cheating out in important areas. Then in a months time I get asked if I wanna buy the pet that their kid has now lost interest in. \n\nThis year I want to nip it in the butt and basically make an admittedly ranty Facebook post about why you shouldn’t do this and how I’m not gonna swoop in and buy the neglected animal they paid too much money for at petsmart.  I wouldn’t name names or anything but I’m worried about this coming across as asshole-ish to people. Most of them are coworkers I just happen to have or friends of my parents. Thanks in advance. ",

      "description": "Me and my other half were watching Masterchef the other day and there was a lady with religious headwear on (apparently it was religious although this was never mentioned.) GF asked me what the lady was cooking and I said 'I think she has chosen the pork'. Cue other half calling me 'insensitive as she's clearly a Muslim and would never do that'. I said all I saw was a woman with a scarf around her head, her religious leaning didn't come in to it because I genuinely do not care enough about religion to analyse a person's dress  to try and figure out if they follow a particular faith in order to have a conversation. I was then branded as ignorant.\n\nBefore I am accused of being ignorant, let me just tell you where I stand. If religion makes an individual happy, without infringing on another person's life, I have no qualms whatsoever and all the best to them! Great. But it is not for me at all. And due to the lack of common ground, it's easier if I keep out of the whole discussion of religion.\n\nI guess the crux of this is, should the default stance be constant awareness of every religions aspects and sensitivities? Even though I personally do not enter into it? I can't say this enough, I have no disrespect whatsoever but I don't think choosing to stay out of it is ignorant.\n\nIf I decided to join a group or follow a lifestyle that had specific requirements, I would never expect non stakeholders to consider the choices I have made. It's nothing to do with them so I feel it should be the same way in reverse.\n\nAlso, wouldn't a person have to learn a whole lot about the various religious groups in order to stay un-ignorant equally of all religions? Why am I obliged? That's a lot of responsibility.",

Even when we were not together she would look at my instagram, see who liked my pictures, see who followed me, see who i followed etc.. i always felt watched and judged all the time. So that’s mostly the reason we broke up, it was a good breakup though, no fight, we left as friends and we haven’t spoke much after that. Now though, 2 months later, i’m still feeling like she is constantly watching my instagram, even though i have no idea if she does or doesn’t. But it just makes me feel bad, and i’m thinking about blocking her on all social media.

      "description": "I'm 21 year old gal and play video games with voice chat, I'm in related discord servers etc etc. I'm also blessed/cursed with a voice that can easily be mistaken for a young boy and joke when asked the Professor Oak. I come clean to newer people if asked but never mention it unless related. I've considered myself a tomboy and I've been told based off text- only conversations that it is hard to tell I'm a girl based off language alone.\n\nThis recently caused a scuffle. \"Derek\" is a regular in an older and bigger server and apparently has never known I'm a woman. He started talking about his recently failed attempt to ask a date that could have dipped into /r/niceguys territory and asking what he did wrong. Derek didn't like the advice he got and then went off to declare girls are bad and disloyal blah blah the works.\n\nSomeone mentions me to get my attention and input. Looking at his past messages I say his attitude is why he's rejected. He asks why a kid should be in this conversation and I explain I'm a woman and that's why my perspective might be useful.\n\nSomehow he turns this into a problem that I'm a bad and weird person for hiding the fact I'm a woman and trying to trick people into being \"just friends\"??? (I never deny being a girl!) I exited out and didn't think much of it.\n\nIn the time I'm gone, others joined in and more people who didn't know I'm a woman apparently agree with Derek that me not telling everyone I'm a girl is weird since having a girl present \"changes\" the atmosphere and people should be aware of it. I say it's bull.\n\nI talked to IRL girl friends if they ever felt they needed to say they're a girl to their own communities and many say yes, under the context that they wouldn't be respected otherwise. I'm confused on what this means.\n\nI don't think it's wrong to leave the fact I'm a woman out of my online identity. AITA?",

      "description": "Here’s a little background: we’ve been doing long distance since I met him on vacation in Europe (I’m in the US) a few months ago. Since meeting, we both have already taken turns visiting each other— I came to him around the holidays, he came after the new year— and everything was great. We made tons of amazing memories, and I was very happy.\n\nThe day that he left, we found out that his grandma was in the hospital. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it but he said no and that he wanted to enjoy his last hours with me before he left. And they were wonderful— peaceful moments, with him saying that his biggest takeaway from the trip was that he loved me more than he had thought possible. Needless to say, I swooned.\n\nAfter he landed, he texted me saying that his grandma had passed while he was on the plane. He expressed frustration that despite trying to turn his life around (he’d had some interesting decisions in his life) and after taking an amazing and much needed vacation to visit me, it felt like this was a huge slap in the face. I told him to please message me or call me if there was anything I could do for him, and he said he was going to spend the rest of the day with his family so don’t expect too much from him. I told him of course, and we exchanged I love yous.\n\nAnd then I didn’t hear from him for over a week.\n\nI would message him from time to time with some things I thought were interesting or funny, and call him once every day or two to check to see if he would respond. He didn’t check any of my messages, didn’t answer any of my calls, and according to Facebook messenger (our main mode of communication) wasn’t active for about a week, and after that it registered activity a few times but he never bothered to open my messages to him. I checked in with a couple of his friends and they said they hadn’t heard from him, either. I even emailed him pleading with him to at least let me know if he’s safe.\n\nEventually, I got fed up with it. I was upset and I felt abandoned. I understand that losing a family member is hard and traumatic— I’ve lost two grandparents; one to cancer and one to prolonged health issues— but I was sick and tired of not being able to even know if he’s safe. In my mind, it didn’t make any sense: he had told me before that he would never disappear on me for an extended period of time, and ignoring people you love who are trying to confirm your safety just doesn’t make any sense to me.\n\nI don’t understand how someone who loves me could decide it’s okay to not check in over the course of a week and a half, especially when it only takes thirty seconds to open up your phone and text, “Hey, I need some space, please stop calling for a bit”. In a relationship, I feel like I should be entitled to at least that much.\n\nSo I broke up with him. Except, of course, he hadn’t responded to me at all so I sent it by text (and email, just in case).\n\nAnyway, I’ve been feeling guilty because I know it’s a stressful situation for him— he wasn’t able to be at his grandma’s side, and I know he was frustrated about it— and I don’t want to make it worse, but at the same time I don’t want to tolerate being ignored for almost two weeks by someone who says they love me. So the million dollar question is: am I the asshole?",

My husband notifies his parents of this and they decide to come anyway, because they don’t think their hotel is refundable or reschedulable. Again, I’m fine with this, because I’ll just sit it out, right? By Wednesday (1/23), I’m so sick that I’m at my doc and getting diagnosed with raging bronchitis, and overnight it becomes so bad that I nearly go to urgent care due to my inability to breathe but thankfully was able to reach my doc to have more meds called in. Still, the parents are coming. Cool. Cool cool cool cool.\n\nFurther context:\nI generally *tolerate* my MIL and my FIL is mostly silent most of the time, so, again, tolerating him is mostly doable. However, it truly is just tolerating them, because of the treatment of my husband his entire life (verbal and physical abuse til adulthood, verbal and emotional abuse continues, also she’s a narcissist who throws tantrums the likes of which I’ve never even seen toddlers throw). We lived with them briefly til just after the holidays 2017-2018, because of a “final straw” incident where the lives of all the animals in the house were put at risk due to her behavior, physical violence was threatened toward us, all of which spiraled into the single worst tantrum I’ve ever seen her throw, which was compounded by my BIL &amp; his fiancé getting involved in the argument, calling both of us all manner of names. We moved as quickly as we had enough money and did not speak to my BIL &amp; fiancé til thanksgiving 2018, though my husband began speaking to his mom (and occasionally his dad) maybe 6-8wks after we gtfo. Both brothers moved to the same area of town and we literally had no clue we were living so close til this past weekend.\n\nNote:\nSkip to Sunday if you’d like the majority of the action/issue.\n\nThe situation:\nWhen they arrived Friday evening (1/25), we were told the BIL wanted to go to a particular plant based restaurant that, to me, seemed unnecessarily bougie, not to mention a good drive from the house (35min, lots of tolls). My MIL brought a bunch of food she’d made us, and while I’m helping her put it away, I tell her there’s a tea house in town I think she might enjoy (she *loves* tea), and that they have more kinds of tea than I’ve ever seen a single store/cafe carry, all of which she can also buy. She excitedly says she’d love to check it out, and I mention maybe we can do it tomorrow or Sunday if I’m feeling a little better. She enthusiastically agrees. The BIL was late arriving to our house, where we were meeting, which is common. We all had pleasant convo while waiting for him, and because I was still sick, plus I had no interest in paying stupid prices for a veggie burger, I sat this one out. BIL’s fiancé didn’t come coz she was tired. Husband comes home late that night and says he hopes I can come tomorrow. I tell him I’ll see, but it’s tough for me to *want* to spend time with people who’ve treated him so poorly, and he asks me to just tough it out. \n\nSaturday (1/26), I woke up feeling somewhat alive, but still very hacky, sore throat, tired body, but I thought I could at least make it for a couple small things with them, so we took them to our fave local Chinese restaurant, then we went to a couple Goodwills nearby, where we found some items for my husband’s grandma, and other items, too. I needed to go to Walgreens for further meds and a photo pickup, and the in-laws were to follow, as they needed something. My BIL &amp; fiancé did not come on this outing, as he was working and she had a food tasting class (even though this visit has been on the schedule for like 6wks). They randomly disappear on the way to Walgreens and we’re left sitting there texting MIL to figure out wtf is going on and where we’re going. \nNote: I am a person who does *not* do well without plans when there’s a group of people involved. So this sudden divergence from the plan *slightly* stresses me out, plus I’m overdue for my inhaler and having trouble breathing, so I snapped at my husband about their inability to maintain a simple plan and then not pickup the phone when he calls to see what’s up, forcing us to do everything via text (which she needlessly interjects unrelated memes into, thus taking her longer to reply). My husband agrees we should go ahead and go home so I can take meds. I *did* apologize for snapping at him once I got the meds and was less stressed about the state of my breathing. By the time we got home, though, I was honestly exhausted by the small outings and was again stressed about the possibility of being expected to do more that night. \n\nAn hour or so later, we get a text that they’re at a local cafe that has vegan pies. I had *repeatedly* offered (both in person and via text) to cook a large family meal for *all* of us this particular evening, in an effort to not have to go out, but the MIL and BIL never gave me an answer on this, so hearing that they were just randomly out getting pie was surprising. Still, vegan pies!?!? I was excited and it is *very* close, so we went. There was a single vegan thing on the menu, and it wasn’t pie. So we’re sitting in this crazy busy restaurant, 5 of us (because fiancé is tired from her food tasting class and didn’t come), taking up a table so my BIL can eat the veggie burger and my FIL can eat a BLT while the rest of us sip piss poor tea (a sin in Texas). The whole time we’re there, the BIL is talking about what to do that night. He starts suggesting various bars, including a piano bar, all of which vary from 15min away to back downtown again like last night (35min plus tolls). My in-laws don’t drink at all, I drink rarely (but even now can’t due to antibiotics), and same for my husband. But the BIL keeps pushing things that are primarily booze focused. I’m starting to feel like even though he has repeatedly asked us what we all should do that he actually has all the things planned and is just trying to steer the convo to his end goal/destination/plan. I say I’m pretty tired, but maybe if we all round up back at our house, we can ask my roommate where we should go, as he goes out regularly and would surely have the best recommendations. Finally, my BIL concedes we should come back to our house. Unfortunately my roommate had gone out unexpectedly, so we couldn’t ask him where to go, plus, it had started raining a good amount. After showing him to the alcohol hutch and inviting him to partake as he wished, my BIL agreed we could and should stay in and play a game here. I convinced my in-laws to play Cards Against Humanity, which was crazy and insane but actually fun (seriously, these two senior aged conservatives played some *savage* combos!). I made some oven baked from the freezer vegan snacks for everyone a few hours later and we kept playing til about midnight or so, when I was so tired and hacky that I had to excuse myself to sleep. My in-laws were understanding and thanked me for hosting even though I was sick. It really *did* turn out to be a pleasant evening, which was surprising but welcome. My BIL stayed til almost 4a because he’d had *so much* to drink and needed to sober up, but he was able to sort of reconnect with my husband for the first time in a while. Cool.\n\nSunday (1/27), my husband gets a text inviting us to brunch at a local well known small chain diner. This is the *only* thing we’re told we’re doing, so I choose to go, thinking we’ll come back here after and then regroup for any additional activities OR that my husband will ride with my BIL (whose fiancé is again not there but no reason given this time) if they choose to leave from there. It’s worth mentioning that we share a vehicle, so we *had* to drive there together. During brunch, my BIL says, ‘Let’s go to Mt. Insertaname after this!’ He’s mentioned it a couple times already over the weekend, and even though I’ve lived here nearly a year, I’d never been. The Mount is a well known scenic overlook for several areas of the city and very touristy (not that the in-laws are new to the city, they’ve been here *many* times). I agree to this **one** thing while we’re eating, because I feel a little better (but nowhere near normal, still very hacky, sore throat but not as bad, and my breathing is still fucked), plus there’s a Trader Joe’s on the way home and I wanted to get a couple staples while near, since I don’t get out there much. So we pay and head out front to regroup after everyone uses the restroom, as my BIL mentions he doesn’t know if Mt. Insertaname has restrooms. We’re just about to go to our respective vehicles when my BIL mentions that he’s riding with my in-laws but he’ll just ride back with us later today. No asking, just telling us that’s what he’ll do. I go along with it, because he really *is* shockingly close to us. So we’re off on our *one* outing that I’ve agreed to. \n\nNow, my BIL is *well aware* of my existing physical issues (total hip replacement, multiple surgeries on both hips, chronic pain that’s so bad I’m medicated",

How can you be made when you OWE ME!\n\nWe forgot about it and then 2018 Comic-Con happens and I buy the tickets for us again and he said he’ll pay me back right away.

      "description": "Search up my post history, I don't care. I'm at the end of my rope, she's at the end of her's and I can't do this anymore.\n\nA week ago, my daughter (who lives with me - she is turning 30 soon) and I got into an argument regarding custody over her 3 year old son. We'll call my daughter Annie and her son Tommy. I have custody of Tommy because, at the time of his birth, Annie was on drugs. She's been sober and living with me for 2 years now. At this point, I still do not trust Annie with caring for Tommy full time/by herself considering she doesn't have enough patience/responsibility to care for a 3 year old, especially one that has a severe illness (cystic fibrosis). She still barely understands his illness (Annie asked me the other day why can't they just give him new lungs so that she doesn't have to do all of the work that goes into his care when she gets custody) and has refused to take over or even learn how to deal with all the insurance and hospital jazz.\n\nGoing back to the fight, Annie was pissed off because she thought she wanted the keys to my car. She said she had to go somewhere, but didn't specify where. I (nicely) asked here where and if she needed gas money and she just flipped out of nowhere. She threw one of Tommy's toys at the TV, cracked it, and then went on a rant about how I don't trust her and that she's a grown woman who can do whatever she wants. Mind you, almost a year ago, she crashed my car and blamed me for allowing her to use it. She also brought up how she doesn't get to be a mother to her son and blames me for them not having a good relationship.\n\nI admit, I've got my own quirks that make me hard to deal with. I recognize that I have been a too overbearing and that I need to let her heal at her own pace, but I feel that I need to draw the line somewhere. I also said something I really regret: \"Maybe you should think about caring for your kid like I have to prove to me that you're an adult.\" That's when she got pissed and almost attacked me before she walked out.\n\nShe was gone for 12 hours, despite knowing of a doctor's visit for Tommy I wanted her to be there for and knowing that she had to show up for work after the appointment. She comes back drunk as hell and smelling of weed. My one stipulation for her other than having a job is no drug use, legal or illegal - my daughter is very much a go big or go home type, and even though I recognize not all drug use is bad, I need her to focus on Tommy.\n\nI told her she could come in and pack her bags. I also told her that I could take her to a shelter but she told me to fuck off and left back out; I have no clue where she is now. AITA?",

      "description": "I'm a college student, nineteen years old when this happened. One day on campus, while waiting for my next class to start, a guy walks up to me. He asks if I know where the professors' offices are located for this building. I do, but it's hard to explain how to find them (there's a small staircase that's easy to miss and leads down to the basement where they're located) so I tell him that I'll just walk him over there. It's maybe a two minute walk maximum, and we make small talk about our majors.\n\nI lead him down the stairs to the basement and he thanks me. Thinking I've done my job, I turn around to go back upstairs. But then he says \"Hey, I have to be honest with you. I think you're incredibly beautiful and I asked for your help because I wanted to talk to you.\"\n\nI was kind of weirded out. I don't know if he meant he made up the story about needing help just to talk to me, or if he needed help but picked me to ask because he thought I was pretty. I've literally never had a guy come onto me like this, and I don't find myself to be 'incredibly beautiful' so I'm awkwardly like \"oh my god, ha ha, thanks.\" I start walking towards the stairs again. Then he's like, \"I have to ask, do you have a boyfriend?\"\n\nAt this point I'm genuinely confused. Maybe it's because I lack experience with guys and this is more normal than I think, but to be asked that after a bit of small talk and nothing else seemed weird. He never even asked for my name. Under other circumstances I may have been flattered, he seemed like an interesting guy, but the way he went about this so suddenly is what made me uncomfortable. So, I have to admit, I lied to him. I tell him I have a girlfriend. He takes it well and tells me she's very lucky to have me. I awkwardly thank him again, hoping we're truly done now.\n\nThen he asks me for my number. This is where I think I become the asshole. I felt weird being asked out by a stranger in a secluded basement, especially when I just told him I'm seeing someone. I'm like, \"Well I'm not going to date you...\" He says it's fine, that he just wants it 'in case he ever needs help again.' I relent, wanting to just call this exchange done. I gave him my number. When I turn around he tells me, \"bye, beautiful.\" I ended up going to a different area of campus to wait at.\n\nIt's been over a month, and I've never gotten a text from him. It's fine, I don't really want to talk to him again, but I'm worried I was an asshole and he just accepted my number because he didn't want to tell me he no longer wanted it.\n\nWhen I tell people this story, there's two main reactions. The first being that, yeah, I might have been rude, but that this dude was creepy and didn't need to push so hard to get my number. The second being that I should have just directly told him no or given him my number without telling him that I wouldn't date him. Some people also think that me lying about having a girlfriend wasn't necessary, but I did it specifically so that he wouldn't ask me out, not thinking he would ask for my number afterwards. So... was I an asshole for no reason to a normal dude that just found me attractive?",

      "description": "Pretty long story, TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nAlright, so a bit of backstory before we get to the main event. My friend group consists of about 10 guys, about 5 of us (including me) regularly get together to play D&amp;D every week. One of these friends (we'll call him Bryan) is married and his wife (we'll call her Lexy) would usually tag along and sometimes make a character and join. There was no beef between anyone, including the wife, until recently.\n\nAnyways, Bryan and Lexy have had a pretty rocky marriage: got married right out of high school before he joined the military for a bit (about 2 years before being dropped for medical reasons), their families absolutely hate each other and they have been jumping from living in one families house to the other for about a year now due to financial instability. All of this has had a noticeable effect on their relationship in public, regularly getting in petty fights during hangouts and such, and divorce is brought up on the regular. However they always end up simmering out and getting all lovey-dovey for a day or two before the fighting starts up again.\n\nOne day during pretty high tension between them where divorce was brought up again, Lexy suggests that they have an open relationship to see if they will actually be happier apart, the only established rules are that it lasts for 1 month, they have to live separate during it, and they cannot try to make relations with any friends/family.\n\nNo one else besides Bryan and Lexy knew they where doing this, the rest of this shitstorm I only have from what the people involved say happened, but I've been shown text messages from what happened so i'm pretty sure who to believe in this.\n\nSo, before Lexy got together with Bryan, she was actually dating another person in the friend group (We'll call him Zan). The first day that they got separated for their open relationship, Lexy texts Zan and asks him if he wants to get high with her and Bryan (who's of course no there now). Zan, not knowing about the whole separation thing, agrees and heads over. While there he wonders where Bryan is but Lexy assures him he's out getting food, and that they should just go ahead and start smoking. After a few minutes and the weed kicks in, Lexy starts making moves on Zan. Zan is apparently coherent enough to try and avoid provocative questions and such (though he admits he was really struggling with keeping himself in check after getting high and having a drink). This whole time however, Lexy was also sending messages to Bryan, telling him that she was busy and hanging out with someone, leading him into asking questions about whom it was, which she would reply with very vague answers. After about 30 minutes of this Bryan freaked out and went over to where Lexy was. Anyways, Bryan gets their and thankfully the situation de-escalates once he sees that Zan is the one there, though Bryan is not convinced that Zan kept his dick in his pants. After that the event becomes the talk of the rest of the friend group, whom the majority place Lexy in the wrong and we don't want her to come to hangouts anymore. Surprisingly Bryan is in defense of his wife despite seeing all of the text messages just like I have. The group ends up kinda exiling him for a while.\n\nAfter a few months, everyone kinda cools down and we have a group chat with Bryan since he's wanting to start D&amp;D again, and Lexy gives us this whole thing about how she's sorry and how she wants everything to go back to normal since we are the only friends she has. We do allow Bryan to start joining games again, but the majority of the group is still against Lexy (she's actually banned completely from 2 of the houses we play at) and doesn't want to be around her. Fast forward to a week ago, we plan on doing D&amp;D and the location is my house, and Bryan ends up contacting me asking if Lexy could come over. At this point I have come to the conclusion that I don't have any personal beef with Lexy, so I tell him that as long as everyone else joining doesn't care than I'm fine with it. Now, the majority of the other players are not cool with Lexy joining, so I tell Bryan that I don't have any problems with Lexy, but I can't have her over since the others are not ok with her still.\n\nWe start gathering and getting ready to play, Bryan arrives, and he brought Lexy. Now everyone else is getting all upset with me because I asked them if it was ok for her to come and they said no, so now I had to go confront both Bryan and his wife outside my house and ask Lexy to leave. During the confrontation, I tell them the same thing: I'm cool with her but I'm not going to put everyone else's enjoyment on the line if they are not ok with her. She starts freaking out and getting mad and Bryan is just trying to talk me into changing everyone's mind. I stand firm and he ends up taking her home.\n\nNow the next day comes around, Bryan messages me that he might not be able to make it to any games for a while since Lexy had overdosed on her antidepressants and cut her arms up with a razor blade and is currently in the hospital. Now i'm just here feeling like shit wondering if I fucked up and it's my fault that she did all this shit.\n\nTL;DR: Friends wife nearly had an affair with another person in the friend group, they want everything to go back to normal, I'm cool with her but I didn't allow her to join a hangout since everyone else isn't ok with her yet, she OD's on meds and is in the hospital. I'm not sure if it's my fault or not.\n",

      "description": "Me and a friend of mine who's still in the closet (he came out to a few of his close friends very recently, he hasn't told his parents yet) were hanging out the other day. At a point in the conversation I mentioned to him that my parents would probably flip out and disown me if I was gay and came out to them.\n\nHe said that it's fucked up that they would do that. I agreed before saying that it's not their fault and it can't be help. I explained that my parents are from China and only moved here shortly before I was born, and back there homosexuality was still considered a mental illness up until around 10 years ago. Put most people in their environment and culture and it can't be helped that they would turn out to be homophobes.\n\nJust to be clear I am not one bit defending homophobia itself, I think that it's definitely bad and will eventually be eradicated from the world as society progressed. However I do believe that there has to be a process for this and in our day and age we can't expect everyone everywhere to be so open-minded. The older generations as well as other cultures are from different times/worlds and it's not entirely their fault for believing what they believe. I believe that just because people such as my parents are homophobic doesn't mean they are shitty people. After all it's not like my parents would randomly walk up to gay people and tell them to fuck off or activity spread hate speech on the internet. They keep their homophobia to themselves and aren't bringing harm to anyone. I said that it's not right for them to be homophobic, but it's not wrong either.\n\nMy friend seemed a tiny bit upset by this and didn't say much, we then changed the topic and didn't mention this again. Looking back, I understand that I really have no idea what he's going through with his parents right now and I now realize that as a straight dude I probably was out of my place talking about something that doesn't affect me personally. So was I being insensitive by defending my homophobic parents in front of my friend? Should I apologise to him?",

That too and just the types of guys she went for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso it tells me there is a lot she is likely lying about too, if she lied about this. I don’t think Europe is the first place she slept around. I didn’t tell her this but it’s on my mind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t know it feels like for me, that she was someone that had her fun and now doesn’t want to do much now that she is in a relationship. I before just thought she was a reserved person but now it’s more like is she just reserved with me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting to break up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "Hey, this post is gonna be a long one and I apologise for the fact that I'm terrible at explaining the things but here I go.\n\nOk, for some background, I'm 15 years old, homeschooled, raised in a devout Catholic family with 3 brothers, a sister, and my Mom and Dad.  My life is basically just doing school work, farting around on my phone, and sleeping in my room, coming out my room to eat, take a bath, get a snack, or use my laptop which is kept in dinning room at all times to monitor me (my parents don't monitor my phone as well), and then going back to my room.  Weekends are basically the same thing as weekdays cause often I don't get my all my work done during the week because I wasted too much time on my phone or sleeping.  Not like if I actually got all my work done I'd have anything fun to do though.  When I actually get to doing my work, I get consistent A grades and I'm probably gonna get a good scholarship for collage.  My social skills are ridiculously bad, I get really anxious just passing by random people in Walmart and it's even worse on the rare chance I'm with people my age.  In addition, I worry a lot about whether or not my family views me as an asshole because often act like a jerk and cynical.\n\nSo basically, I'm a lazy loser, and my parents know it.  My dad often tells me that at my current rate I'm going to get nowhere in life and that I need to be more productive.  I love him and want to make happy but the problem is he not only expects good grades, but also that I spend all my free time learning about coding, auto mechanics, and guns.  And on top of that, pretty much any form of entertainment (movies, tv, surfing the web) he belittles me for doing and my Mother got him to straight up ban and destroy my video games.  \n\nNow I am more than happy to learn productive things, I know they are important and all, but I'd like to also be able to play some Minecraft, Mario, TF2, and TES from time to time.  But my dad considers games to be for total losers and my mom thinks they are nothing more than addictive trash that will destroy my mind.\n\nSo this post won't be too, too long, I'll try to make this as short as possible: my parents got us a Wii years ago and heavily restricted the play time we got on it (like 45 minutes a week for each person).  Everything was going fine until my older brother bought a GameCube through our grandparents without asking mom and dad.  My mom got really mad at him and said that he was a gaming addict.  She got REALLY mad at him when she found out he had a copy of Simpsons: Hit and Run (she really hates the Simpsons) and snapped the disk right in front of him.  About two months later, she called everyone to the living room to talk about our \"gaming addiction\" where she put all of our games into a box and pulled them out one by one to show dad how \"terrible\" they were.  The games we had were some LEGO games (LOTR, The Complete Saga, etc), some Star Wars games, LOTR: The Two Towers, some Mario games, a Madden game, and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.  She looked at the back covers of every single game and ranted about how she never would approved of any of these games (We are allowed to watch LOTR and Star Wars and she bought most of Mario games for me BTW).  The worst part was when she pulled out Wind Waker and called it \"satanic\" because it has the phrase \"An evil wind is rising\" on the back cover.  She put it all in a Kentwood water box labeled \"Wii stuff\" and put the box in our utility room.  Despite this, my dad allowed me to play Minecraft on my PC because I agreed to do a course on coding websites, but my Mom got him to ban it as well because one my brothers, who is autistic, threw a fit after Mom told us to stop playing and help fold the clothes.  Me, being worried that she would throw our games away, asked her if was planning on it. She said *NO*.  Next Wednesday, we went look in the \"Wii stuff\" box to find all our games gone.  We asked her what happened and she told us she had thrown them away last Friday, the day she told me she wouldn't throw them away.  Now the fact she had destroyed OUR games, OUR stuff, was one thing, but the fact she lied to my damn face was another thing.  For the next 2-3 years, I built up a massive collection of games on Steam, going through my grandpa to buy them during sales.  (What's odd is that my parents told him to stop buying us games back when we had the Wii but it seems he doesn't care tbh).  In order to play them I would wait until they left the house or play them at night and often I'd lie to them to cover my ass so they wouldn't find out.  But of course, my parents found out and forced me to let them change my computer's password so I couldn't log in at night.  I got around this by dividing the hard drive into 2 partitions and installing a different operating system on one of them.  But this week, my mom found out about it and like a jackass I tried to lie my way out but it didn't work and now she keeps it in her room at night.  \n\nSo if my life wasn't pathetic enough, it gets worse.  My dad started to have really bad digestive problems, and his doctor thinks he might have pankrotic cancer, and if if he does, he is pretty much dead.  He is gonna have a test next Monday to see whether or not he does.  My mom chewed me out this morning because she thinks I care more about video games than my dad, which really hurts because I don't.  I love my dad.  He works super hard to provide for us and I've been making an effort to spend more time with him.  If I had to give up gaming forever in order to keep him alive for just a day longer, I would in a heartbeat.\n\nMy mom also told me something that made my heart sink even more: she kept the fact I was gaming behind everyone's backs a secret from dad because he told her that any kid of his that played video games would not receive financial support for collage, and I presume he would also kick anyone who played games out of the house as well when they became 18.\n\nI know that it was wrong for me to lie and play games behind their back and that they love me and want what is best for me but I feel that their position on gaming is ridiculous, and my dad expecting me to not only never play any games but to also have my own fucking internet coding business at the age of 15 is even more ridiculous.\n\nTL;DR, because I'm homeschooled and stay at home all the time, I have social anxiety and self-worth issues, and my parent's view of me being a disappointing loser addict because I like video games and don't have a website coding business even though I'm 15 really makes me resent them.\n",

      "description": "For backstory. We have a small group of maiming friends. We aren’t streamers or anything or really that good, but we all get together for a couple hours most nights after all our kids and wives are in bed. We are all in our 30s except one single guy. We have all been playing games together for about 2-3 years on Xboxone. \n\nThis happened yesterday. A friend that has been VERY active in our circle of games made an announcement in the group chat last night that he was quitting video games. He does have life stuff going on, but his explanation was “I could be more productive”. Most of us that know him on a more personal level, know his wife is pregnant and she is unstable at best when off her medication. Something she can’t take during the pregnancy. So we assume that something happened to force this. That stems from the fact that just two days ago he was talking about the latest games and some stuff we were going to do in them. \n\nAll of a sudden he is done? I was irritated that we got little explanation. Even one of the guys who he is very good friends with didn’t know this was happening. This guy is going to be staying with him over the summer even. What bothers me the most is one of the games he and his sister host a dedicated server, so we are all just “out”. \nAfter making his announcement, he left the group chat and won’t respond to anyone. I think we all deserve a little more than just “FU..Peace”. I know it isn’t about me and I don’t know what the real thing is here, but if he was forced to quit by an outside pressure, he will inevitably become resentful of that source. You can’t just cut out 20-30% of your lifestyle and just be ok right? Ultimately, it seems he doesn’t care about his friends enough to even give them a legitimate explanation. To me, that’s crap and I won’t be welcoming when he relapses back to gaming. He has done something similar before and I felt the same way then. It feels like a sympathy / appreciation grab. If that’s the case it’s even worse. ",

I was getting overwhelmed with the vast amount of credit cards available so I thought to ask another human. This is where it gets interesting. Earlier my mom told me to wish my brother and his terrible wife a happy Thanksgiving, as you do. I sent his wife a happy Thanksgiving message first and she replies angrily that I am three days late. Fair enough, I then follow up and ask what bank she has an account with? Her reply was that she does not give out her financial information to people who message her once a year. I was then told to post here by my brother. \n\nFor some backstory, the last time we were all together, I was fat shamed by this woman the entire weekend. I remember her calling me fat over ten times clearly, the rest was a blur. This was just one instance. This woman has verbally assaulted me almost every time we are all together.

      "description": "I (20f) decided to take a week long trip to Los Angeles. I used to live there for about a year and half and hadn’t been there for about 6 months. So I thought why not go for a visit while I still had the time (I start school in the spring)\n\nI wanted to drive down there (17 hours) only for the fact that I wanted to retrieve the rest of my belongings that have been siting at a relatives house. Otherwise I would have been happy to flown. My car is still in great condition (2013 Toyota Camry 78,000 miles) so I was very confident in my car being able to take me there and back without any problems. I had saved up over a grand for the trip that was entirely funded by me and I had already payed my Airbnb ahead of time. So yes I had money for the trip not anything crazy but it was a fair amount for only a weeks long trip.\n\nTwo days before I go I visit my moms house (I live with my father who is currently stationed in Afghanistan) and she is telling me how “stupid” I am for going on this trip alone and driving there alone. Thinking she was just being bitter I shrug off everything she has said and I go anyways.\n\nI go have the time of my life, come back even brought a friend up to stay for a couple days and she leaves. Everything is good I am in one piece my car is fine and I have all my stuff.\n\nI go back to visit my mom today and it’s been about 5 days since I’ve been back. And she’s still bitter about the trip. But on top of her being angry I find out my brother was angry, my aunt and grandma( the relatives that I had my stuff stashed away at) , my father (who called my mother), my other aunt and uncle whom I’m close with. Everyone is calling me stupid for going on this trip and I don’t know why. I’ve been called an asshole and insensitive to their feeling.\n\nI’m not a bad kid, yes I smoke weed and drink occasionally at parties. But I’ve never been in trouble with the law, I always pay my bills, I made sure my cat was being well taken care of while I was gone, and it’s not like a left out of the blue. I had told everyone of my upcoming trip months prior and they had said nothing to me.\n\nSo am I missing something? Did I do something wrong?",

My roommate was a girl that I had been friends with since first grade. And for this year at chior camp, she did the following:\nJabbed me, made fun of me in front of my friends, lied to me that my friends didn't like me, got\n made at me when I learned she lied about that, forced me to get changed for bed in the lobby because some girl was in our room, and scolded me for liking a singer she also liked\n\nSo here's one last bit of background info: at chior camp we hold a play at the end of the week. In one of the songs, we end it by everyone rushing towards the center of the stage. Since I'm short and a bit of an attention seeker, I always rushed to the very front of the stage. No one complained, so I thought nothing of it. Until I did get a complaint, from no one other that my roommate.\nR-roomate\nMe-me\n\nR- why do you always have to be in the center of the stage for that one? \nMe- because I'm short, and no one would be able to see me\nR- yeah, but someone else might want to be in the center. Ever think of that?\nMe- they'll just have to get there first. We're doing the number again, so I'll let them do it then\n\nWe do the dance number and everything goes fine until it's the end of the song and everyone rushes to the center\nR rushes passed me at full speed, and because of this, she either tripped over her shoelaces, or she slipped, or knowing her she might of tripped on purpose. Whatever the reason, she tripped, and I got to the very center again. After this, she. Was. Pissed. She told the teacher that I tripped her because I want to be the center of attention. After this the counseloers confronted me, and gave my solo in a song to my roommate. I was having none of this, and so I ran out the building. I hid behind a bush because I knew I was in trouble after that. After about five minutes a counselor found me and asked me why I made a scene, and so I told her everything. She asked me what I wanted to do about it, and I said that I wanted her out of my room, my solo they gave her, and the solo she had (which was right after mine, so that's why that string was so easy to pull) \nIn the end they they gave me everything I asked for, and she hasn't spoken me since.\n\nI'm starting to wonder if I'm the asshole. I know she was being kind of rude to me over chior camp week, but I want my friend back and she won't talk to me. I wonder if I went too far.",

I had plans to visit some of my family in a city not so far from Jay, and invited her to come spend a few days with me. I've never been to this city before and was really looking forward to exploring it with her once my family obligations were over. This morning, we're walking around downtown and I'm suggesting different activities and places to see to Jay, and she's not really responsive. It's like talking to a wall. So finally I asked her straight up if she wants to do anything besides walk around. She turns to me and says that she only came to the city to see me, and only budgeted a specific amount of money for this trip so she doesn't feel the need to do anything except spend time with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I know that she's in a tight financial situation. I've known this for a while. I guess I just assumed that if she was able to buy a plane ticket to see me she would also have some spending money for the weekend. I'm pretty bummed now that I won't have the opportunity to see and do any of the things I had wanted to, and she's here with me for another 2 days and then we both go back to our respective cities.",

It was really hard but I coped the best I could.

I didn’t have much money for all the therapies to help him, I had hardly any help from family and life became unbearable to the point I wanted to end my life. I went to a doctor and told them About how I felt. I spoke with therapists and decided that I could no longer take care of him. I felt and still feel very guilty for giving him up but I just couldn’t do it anymore. \n\nAbout 7 months after giving him up I fell pregnant again. I did think about an abortion but I couldn’t go through with it. I had my baby and she’s 18 months old now and so far healthy. \n\nMy family and friends have criticised me for giving up my sick child.

      "description": "So I've known this university acquaintance for 2.5 years, and we'll just name him *Kane* for simplicity. Kane was invited to my discord server that has 100+ people at the beginning of this year by a friend and at the beginning it was fine, no problems with Kane. Into second half of 2018 and that's when things start to go down hill without any realisation. Kane is developing a relationship with someone and so am I. Kane's relationship goes off well and now he's trying to help me with mine, but the thing is I never asked for his help and asked him to not tell the person I'm developing a relationship with anything about me, because I wanted things to unfold naturally. The next thing he does on that same day is tell that person a bunch of things about me that I wanted to tell them myself. So at this point I'm finding Kane very invasive of my personal life and annoying, but decided not to ban or kick him due to my personal gripe with him.\n\nKane has admitted hes doesn't have good social skills, he wasn't a very popular person in his schooling years according to him. But now he's a very out-going person, to the point where server members feel like that's he's being too invasive of their personal life and becomes annoying for them. He's always making jokes in the server, but most of the time they're in bad taste or they're and uncomfortable sexual jokes, we don't mind people making jokes in the server, but Kane's are just poor taste and don't fit with the context of a conversation.\n\nNow over a month ago (almost 2 months now) Kane has broke up with their same partner about 3 times (according to Kane's words), and the partner said that Kane is a \"Fucking waste of time\" and \"Fucking worthless piece of shit\". From there, Kane went into a state of depression and server members and I tried helping him get through it, cheering him up if we could. But in the server he continued to kill the mood, bringing negative vibes into chat while we're playing games and having fun. Now he claimed he has gotten over the relationship, but continues to say that \"This server is my lifeline\" or \"I don't what I would do without being in this server\".\n\nAll of this has been continuing to build up for the past month, 4 out the 5 admins (including me) and both moderators are getting sick of his jokes and constant invasion of him trying to get into our personal lives. Other server members don't like Kane because of what he has said in regards to how he would treat animals in certain scenarios. Members have their own DnD groups and he's always trying to join every single one possible. Now not everyone in the server dislikes Kane, some people do like him and have made friends with him, which I don't find to be a bad thing. Kane tries to be a out going person, trying to make friends with absolutely everyone, but he just becomes extremely invasive of everyone. We've made a secret chat to avoid him and just have fun playing games, chatting without him interfering. Because of his distasteful jokes, I changed his nickname to Super Ultimate Walking Cringe and told him I'll change it back when he stops his distasteful jokes, but he never stopped and the name kept. Then he asks me to change his name back because it's bringing him down and makes him feel bad, but I said no. So he create an invite in a different server, left the server and rejoined through the invite he basically sent himself to reset his name.\n\nI want to ban him for the discomfort he causes for us and server members, plus the other admins said I should be the one to ban him because I know him the most because we go to the same university course. I really do want to ban him because of how annoying I find him and still annoyed about how he tries to force himself into my life and interfered in potential relationships. The only reason I haven't banned him is because he hasn't broke any of the server rules and I feel that would be very petty of me to do so just because I find him annoying.    \n\n  ",

      "description": "  Throwaway because my husband uses Reddit and I don't want him seeing this. \n\n\n  I'm gay and have known my husband for 4 years, been married for 8 months. I'm also a nurse. On my way home I was feeling adventurous so I decided to pop in at my in-laws' to say hello. My sister-in-law and her husband was also there. They invited me in, we were talking and somehow avoided any conflict (they loathe me and think I turned their son gay, but I tolerated it because I don't have any family of my own).\n\n\n  The topic of mass shootings and the Orlando shooting came up and I said it's a pity I couldn't donate blood considering I was in the area and have blood type O-, meaning anyone can receive blood from me. I don't know what went through her head but my SIL said it's for the best and that you never know what's in my blood. I informed her I've been tested multiple times and STDs don't appear out of thin air to which she replied \"You probably have AIDS but you don't know it\". \n\n\n  When she said that I completely let go and laid into her about everything including how she's in denial about her brother's sexuality, how she sleeps around more than I ever did, and how if she wasn't a high school dropout maybe she'd know then how STDs spread. This led to a HUGE fight between her and her husband and I while her parents just sat there watching. I got up to leave and said I want nothing to do with them and that I was surprised my husband even talks to them at all. \n\n\n And worst part is after I told my husband about this he still chose to defend them. I'm beyond mad at this point, I told him they literally don't acknowledge he's married and yet he still wants to have a relationship with them. To which he said it's none of my business and that I'm an asshole for getting between his family and him. I snapped and told him to grow a backbone. I'm staying at a friend's for the night because I can't deal with this bullshit all at once.",

She has put up with my whining, brought everything Ive needed to me as I have been bedridden, and overall been amazing. I told her she didnt need to, and that she would certainly get sick, but she selflessly took care of me anyway. \n\nSo now my flu is tapering off, and she is beginning to show symptoms. She knows this, and even brought up how shes coughing like I was leading up to the main part of the illness. \n\nSide note: my girlfriend has sort of an issue with alcohol. Its litterally the only negative aspect about her, and I am not fully control of my alcohol use either. But i certainly wouldnt get drunk if I knew I was coming down with the flu.\n\nWell, last night my girlfriend texts me she went our with coworkers and its \"turning into a thing.\" Code for shes getting drunk. I bluntly tell her I think its incredibly foolish to do so when your coming down with a flu. She says I'm a bummer, and the text message responses twindle as she continues partying.\n\nFlash forward to today. She is incredibly sick. Smacked with a flu and a massive hangover, shes having an incredibly bad time. I helped her at first, but over the day Ive grown resentful. How hard is it to not drink? Shes had a hangover, shes had the flu, why in gods name would she want to combine them?\n\nSo I claimed I was called in for a shift. I'm really at the library, working on school assignments and making this post. I feel bad, and she took such good care of me, but i felt as though i was being very terse and passive agressive with her today (despite her illness). Am I the asshole?",

It started when the deliveryman committed a mistake delivering his plate at wrong address, so he complained to her and she said she'll send a courtesy in the next order, and in the next order she sent a beer as said. Ok. \nIn the third order, she sent a beer again and asked by message if the food was good and this stuff, and I found it strange, but I think I was just being boring. \nToday my boyfriend said he ordered again yesterday, and something strange happened: she sent a popsicle and asked the deliveryman to say to him which he's a special client and she don't want to lose him. And worse: she did it several times and I didn't know until today. \nGeez, I didn't know what to think, she clearly wanted to catch he's attention and I don't know if I ask to him to tell he have a girlfriend and stop to send messages and beers and popsicles with whatever is the pretention. \nI'm wrong being jealous in this case?

      "description": "So my (22F) roommate (21F) has a kitten that is super energetic, friendly, cute, etc. I have two older cats (1-2 and 2-3 yo).\n\nI want her to take her cat back to her mom's house (she lived there before moving in). This is because she is never home and therefore the cat gets put in her room for days at a time without any major interaction. Additionally, her food and water are kept in the kitchen.\n\nThis all started because when she moved in, we just kinda let the cats mingle. However, her cat, because it is a kitten, wanted to rough house with my cats and mine HATED it. So now, they just fight constantly. I told her that I didn't want to be responsible if her cat got hurt so if she isn't home to supervise her cat, it needs to go in the bedroom. I also agreed that if I wasn't home, my cats would be in my room so that we aren't discriminating.\n\nWell fast forward to now, she doesn't put her cat up, so when I come home I do. I don't want to take care of her cat, supervise it's play with my cats, or generally do anything with it because it has too much energy imo.\n\nI have gone a full week without seeing my roommate which would be fine, even ideal, but she has a cat that I frankly feel is being neglected.\n\nI tried nicely discussing it with her, but she kept leaving her cat out. So recently discussed it again and she just gave me a lot of grief for being concerned about her cat. Idk man.\n\nTldr; roommate seems to be too busy to care for her cat properly, AITA for trying to convince her to give it to her mom?",

      "description": "First reddit post, so sorry in advance for any formatting gore/lack of clarity/inappropriate post length.\n\nI'm a senior in high school, and college application season is well underway. I was recently told that a friend, we'll call her K, decided when applying to a highly regarded public university system to write essays for a random subset of the prompts provided by the application, instead of choosing the ones she could most adequately address. This was unthinkable to someone like me who, like many students in our affluent community, have spent the past four years under pressure to do all we can to get into a top university. It was tantamount to self-sabotage, but I was more amused than angry.\n\nEventually I message K on an online group chat asking if she actually rng'ed her essays. She says yes, because \"that's the way I like to live my life.\" To my surprise, another friend I'll call M admits (or brags, depending on how you interpret it) that he did something similar for the same app.\n\nI reply, mostly in jest, that the two friends \"fucking disgust me,\" but I don't follow up with anything that would suggest I was joking. M responds by saying that it saves time to just pick at random, while K follows up by telling me that I'm entitled to my opinion but that she doesn't really care.\n\nIt's their perceived indifference that sets me off.\n\nThe ensuing argument is basically a revolving door of M continuing to rationalize their behavior (\"I'm basically guaranteed to get in anyways so it's fine!\"), to me civilly but forcefully explaining why I thought they were severely hurting their chances to save 10 minutes, to K telling me that I need to chill. I conclude by angrily telling them that I intended to work my ass off, and that if they wanted to skimp on something so important, it's their funeral.\n\nI think K and M are setting an unfortunate precedent of behavior by being what I think is irresponsible, and that by hurting their applications they are effectively short-selling themselves (both are talented, qualified applicants). But on the flipside, I understand that I'm not responsible for telling other people how to apply to college, that the standards I'm held to don't necessarily apply to others, and that I may be perpetuating the culture that created these standards for me in the first place.\n\nI was definitely the aggressor during this whole thing, but am I the asshole?",

      "description": "About 10 years ago I dated a friend of mine and it was a long distance thing, but got along great. She visited, it didn't work out for various reasons. One of which was that I found out she was sleeping around and had lied about quitting several things she said she had and it just broke all trust. I don't think she even knows I know, since I never felt the need to bring it up again.\n\n \n\nWe reconnected years later and talked things out as far as our feelings about the actual breakup.  Rebuilt the friendship and became good friends again. After a series of pretty shitty events on her end and a metric ton of loneliness on my end, we became closer, talking every day for hours on end and both realized we had become best friends again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe tried putting the relationship back together but it's still a long distance thing, and a few weeks ago she admitted she was feeling so lonely that she wanted to consider an open relationship. I advised I'm not OK with this, and gave her an out. We could end it on a good note, still best friends and she can date and have someone since I can't be around all the time. She agreed, changed her FB status (Normally this wouldn't even matter but I see it as a clear line, clear acceptance of the situation.) and we were good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe still texts me every day, just invited me to Vegas for a weekend because she \"wants her best friend\" with her, still vents to me about things going on...I had advised I'd be MIA this weekend because I had plans, and mid-D&amp;D game she texts me \"I love you\" out of the blue, which we hadn't said to each other since she opted to end it so she could find someone. She got upset because I didn't comment on it today and I told her I was just confused because she made this choice and has since pretended like it didn't happen. This feels like a game and I'd rather not play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting clear lines on what we are and not returning the \"I love you\"? I still care for her but I feel like the open relationship thing was so she could go have fun or later on down the line tell me she hooked up with someone without it being considered cheating. (She also kind of has a history of cheating when things aren't going great in a relationship which is a hell of an elephant in the room when discussing this stuff.)",

I know not great, but it’s a personal record for me!) I was exhausted, but was still feeling motivated to do some weight training afterwards. \n\nI go to the gym every Monday-Friday and arrive at 5:30am to start my workout. It is always the same people at that hour, as we are all on a schedule to workout, shower, and go to work. \n\nThis particular morning, I noticed a new face at the gym. He was a younger guy, around my age, mid 20’s. I sat on the bench to begin doing some bench presses but was also catching my breath quick and changing my playlist on my phone, so I sat for maybe 1-2 minutes before starting to lift. This guy comes up to me and stands directly in front of me. I take out my headphones and he asks “you gonna lift or no? I’m waiting to use this bench”... I reply back “yes, just catching my breath”... feeling rushed, I begin doing my bench presses. This guy does not leave. Continues to stand next to me impatiently waiting for me to finish on the bench. I cut my lifting short, wipe down the bench and the bar, and he didn’t say “thanks, sorry to rush you... “ or anything of that sort. Just stared me up and down trying to rush me. \n\nThis event has bothered me the entire week, and I am wondering if I am the asshole for taking a minute or two on the bench before I started lifting. \n\n",

      "description": "Going to try writing my first post as objectively as possible.Please bear with me.\n\nSome back story: My brother is in his last year of University and has vehemently wanted to own a car for reasons that are pretty legit but I may not agree with. Some of the bigger reasons are how public transports are wasting his time(takes about an hour-ish), he can drive grab (a taxi service) to earn and pay for the car as well. Why I don't agree is because I've always felt that having a car is a luxury and where I'm from, public transport is convenient and ALOT cheaper compared to owning a car so it really is a debt to have before you even start a real job. And lots of working adults at my age can't even afford one. So letting him know my stance and advise was against his, i still trusted him enough to loan him money for a second hand car. (he wanted a first hand car initially) \n\nAlso.. a very crucial point in this AITA post. I've always felt like my mum dotes on him more than me. If i hadn't stepped in to loan him the money, she would have \"loaned\" him the money a 100% and she would not have expected him to pay her back. At the same time she would always be seeking help from me for her financial issue that she never fully shows me full disclosure about. \n\nI don't have anything to gain by loaning my brother the money except the satisfaction of knowing he has to pay the money which in itself is a lesson worth learning isn't it? And also helping my mum to ease whatever financial issue that she seems to have or not have? or i guess some people just likes to scream poor. \n\nHe has failed to pay me twice and i've told him that 3rd strike he's out cause he clearly can't afford a car. \n\nAnd today I happened to see a text from him on my mum's phone asking her to transfer money to him so he could pay me. I felt betrayed and upset that they were doing this behind my back. ( I already found out that she pays gas for him without letting me know).\n\nSo i confronted him with that text and told him i was disappointed in him and i could not longer loan him the money.\n\nHe replied me that exams were around the corner, he had some taxes to pay and there were big holidays during the month so he couldn't earn enough for the month's payment. And he apologized for not telling me because he was afraid I would be angry. ):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was upset about the betrayal by both but hearing his apology made me wonder AITA if i were to stop loaning him the money?",

I gave him a hit on top of the head (what i thought was proportional for him hitting a small dog, honestly not that hard) not on the face, and he immediately complained about how I hit him to hard and how it sucks to live here.

      "title": "AITA, I want my best friend of nine years to move out December 1st to DC or California",
      "description": "I am having some moral quandaries about this and decided to turn to reddit to let you judge my feelings. \n\nMy best friend of nine years (met In high school) has recently moved across the country to the east coast. She had a job lined up in DC, but wanted to visit me for \"ten days maximum\" before going down to DC. Within those 10 days, she found out the alleged job was a scam, and was rejected from the apartment she applied for. And so, she stayed (she moved in the weekend of July 4th). My SO and I told her to look for a job around here since so many places were looking for people to fill positions--we live near a university and the downtown area of a major metropolitan area. She has a bachelors in Sociology and work experience, but no work experience after college.\n\nShe doesn't have a car or anything like that, and also cant ride a bike, so she was hoping for  position where she could WFH.\n\nShe applies  to a local bank and has an Interview, but doesnt get the job. \n\nI recommended her for nine positions at my current employer where she could work from home and the pay was 45K/year minimum, and I put in a good word with the managers only to find out that she hadn't applied. I go home that night and tell her to apply and remind her every day for two weeks. Finally, she goes and applies three weeks after my initial recommendation... and gets angry that the positions are filled. She does not apologize to me even though it damaged my reputation that I worked hard to build. \n\nDuring this entire time, I do not see her do applications and ask her about them but I am given the typical \"in the works\" response, and that I am not respecting her privacy. I back off. She watches Netflix and hulu and complains about everything. But I dont see applications. I give her the benefit of the doubt. I do not watch her 24/7.\n\nSO and I sit her down in September after the reputation incident, and explain that we are not made of money, and that expenses are piling up--it costs $700-$1000 a month for her to stay with us with most of that being food. Food expenses with just my SO and I were about $300/month and with her they have spiked to $700/month, and our electricity bill has doubled as well as our water/utility bills. Not to mention additional expenses if we go out for takeout, want to see a movie, or do typical couple things that she invites herself to. \n\nI tell her that to afford her I have been working OT and 50+ hour weeks. That my SO drained his bank account feeding her. That if she makes me choose between my mortgage and her friendship I will choose my mortgage. \n\nI also offer to help with her resume and her cover letter. I am rejected because \"she is a writer and if she can't write a cover letter she isn't worth her salt.\" \n\n\nI send her jobs to apply to. Nothing. Literally just Netflix all day except when she does dishes, sweeps, or helps with our Foster dogs (Great Pyrenees). She does help walk, pick up after them, brush and feed them when  I am not home. They are usually pretty mellow, though, and I would do it, but she does beat me  to the punch. \n\nFinally told her that I can't afford for her to live here anymore because it will bankrupt me at this rate, and that if she doesnt have a serious interview pr an offer by December 1st, we will buy her a greyhound ticket to California or DC, where she has family (her choice). She seems to have no intention of moving out. \n\nTL;DR: my best friend has been living with me for six months without contributing or offering to contribute to living expenses or rent, and has not seriously applied to jobs in this time. AITA for wanting her to move out, and buying her a greyhound ticket to get to her family in DC or California as she has nowhere to stay in our local area? I feel very bad for her, especially since she is a friend and despite this, I would like to stay friends. \n\nThanks. I was told this was the right place for this.\n",

He's been pondering whether we should stay together or so for a week. It really destroyed me because I loved him so much. \n\nNow at that time I had a friend to which I used to talk as distraction or I vented to him. He was really nice until one day he started to be really sloppy and inconsiderate. Saying I should stop crying all the time (that was after a day or so). I left. \n\nLater my boyfriend made up his mind and we broke up. I was really relieved. \n\nBut, here's the twist: My boyfriend and I shared another friend. And she told me that my ex and my other friend were together. And that my ex didn't even love me and developed a crush on him, my friend also had a crush on him and they basically started dating while I was officially still together with my boyfriend. (The doubt phase). Not only didn't they tell me, my ex's excuse was basically a lie.\nAITA, or is this just unreasonable hate.",

      "title": "AITA if I don't want to engage with my roommate who annoys me to no end?",
      "description": "I would call myself a closeted asshole, but I try really hard to not hurt other people.\n\nBasically, I have two roommates. We all share one dorm room. Roommate 1, A is a really good friend of mine. Roommate 2, B and I aren't as good of friends, but we have been pretty civil towards each other and have never lashed out at one another.\n\nRoommate B has always gotten on my nerves. We really don't mash, and I would never want to live with her again. She's extremely loud, spends a lot of time complaining and asking me stupid questions; such as \"Do you think I should buy a blue bracelet or a red one?\", she's spineless, and she creates drama out of thin air.\n\nThere has never been hostility between roommate B and I, basically because when she's being annoying I will tell her she's being annoying and move on with my life. The other night, when I was trying to sleep, she came into our room and started making a ton of noise, slamming cabinets, and she set the microwave off once. I was pretty annoyed as I had just fallen asleep and she woke me up. She set off the microwave a second time, and I got up and said \"Do you think you could be more considerate? I'm trying to sleep.\" She said \"sorry! I'll stop!\", immediately shut the light off and went straight to bed.\n\n1. which is annoying because i wasn't asking her to go to sleep, i was asking her to not be noisy.\n2. also annoying because now anytime i'm in bed, even if i'm just sitting in bed watching something on my laptop she'll ask things like \"Can i keep doing my homework? Will it be too disruptive?\" and I say \"it's fine.\" \n\nThen the next day, she cornered me as I was washing my hands in the bathroom and apologized. I said \"it's fine.\" she said \"It's not...\". I was tired, had just gotten back from class at 9pm, and I said \"don't do it again, and we'll be fine.\" and walked out.\n\nNow, when I go into my room I just don't acknowledge her. A lot of the time, she's in my way standing around in front of my desk and I'll walk past her to get to what I need. I don't ask her to go get breakfast with me (never really did), I don't engage with her unless it's totally necessary. I wouldn't say I'm mean to her, I just don't engage with her beyond coexisting.\n\nAnyways, now she's on roommate A's ass, constantly asking why I hate her and what she can change about herself to make me not hate her. I feel bad because she's clearly insecure and needs validation from me for some fucking reason, but I'm not planning on giving it to her anytime soon. I just don't really want any part of her, and I don't want to be her friend.\n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "A little background...\n\nMy wife’s sister is a couple years younger than her. She was in college when my wife and I met, and since then, I’ve only known her as being obsessed with image: Physically, socially, what clothes she wears (brand, in style, etc...). If that’s your jam, ok. She ended up marrying a guy who has the same stigma with image. They refuse to shop at anything other than top “name brand” stores, will not wear logo or branded clothing (even to football games at their alma matter). Everything in their life revolves around their social and physical image. They both work in education, so they don’t make a ton of money, but they apply these rules to their entire family, including their two kids. (They bought $50 Jordan’s for their infant son, as an example).\n\nFrom the time, you can probably tell this annoys me, but it’s their life and their money, so they should do as they please. \n\nDue to this, they are awful to buy presents for. 95% of what you buy is returned, or embarrassingly mocked after they open it. It is so bad, my MiL just gives them her CC number and gives them an amount they can spend and let’s them buy it, then wraps it for them to open. \n\nAs we are preparing for Christmas, my wife asked her sister what her husband wants. (We all agreed to a $30 budget to spend on each other.) She told her that he wants an UA rain jacket. We looked everywhere and the cheapest we could find was north of $50, but found a very nice Columbia jacket that fits the price range. When presenting this to her, she responded with “Ummmm... we don’t wear Columbia. How about we all just bring cash and exchange money at Christmas, then we can buy what we want.”\n\nI won’t go into the amount of frustration I’m feeling, but I told my wife I’d rather just agree to not buy each other presents and use the money on the kids than deal with that shit. \n\nAm I the asshole??",

      "description": "I will try to keep this short...\n\nI work in a cubicle farm. My latest cube mate is this guy \"Dave\" who I just don't get along with at all. He's not a bad guy, we just have a lot of friction due to strict deadlines, not a lot of personal space and matching schedules. I am technically one level above him but I don't direct him to do stuff, but I still get the feeling he resents me for being female and making more money than he does. \n\nDave has season tickets to the Lakers and as far as I know he goes every home game. We work about a block away from Staples center and I know he usually just walks over after work. Yesterday he told me he couldn't use his tickets and asked if I'd like to take my boyfriend. I told him it was  very nice gesture and I'd have to see if it was a possibility. He printed off the tickets and set them on a shared desk space that sits between our two desks. \n\nSo the day clicked on and honestly I didn't even think about it again. Dave had to leave early so it was like 20 minutes after the start of the game and I realized the tickets were still sitting on our shared desk space. I tried to call Dave on his phone to check to see if the tickets were still for me and went strait to voice mail. I then called my boyfriend and it turned out he was right around the corner so he parked in Dave's spot and we walked over to Staples center and enjoyed about 3/4 of the game. I figured it was over and done with. \n\nWell I just got dragged into HR for \"stealing\" Dave's tickets. I explained to HR my side of the story and basically they said they had reviewed security footage and everything basically backs up my version of events and Dave didn't show up to pick up his tickets off the desk until the game had about 30 minutes left. As far as the company goes, I am going to get written up for letting my boyfriend park in Dave's spot but they aren't even recommending I pay him back. \n\nWell for the last two days Dave has basically been spasming with anger. He hasn't said anything directly to me but he's stomping around, playing games with the noise on on his phone, he's not doing work I need him to do. Obviously he's having some sort of tantrum because of the tickets. \n\nNo matter what else happens, am I the asshole for taking them? ",

      "description": "So this has been going on for a little bit, and I just wanted some other opinions.\n\nMy girlfriend (18f) is one of those Instagram/Snapchat people, she is always using it and showing me stuff on there, and that’s completely fine. She posts a fair amount has almost 2.5k followers, and now a lot of her posts are about her and I. Now myself (17m) just got Instagram about a year ago, and have only made two posts (both of which were before I met her) and I don’t plan on posting anymore. I don’t feel comfortable or agree with the mindset that I feel comes along with that type of social media. I’ve been pretty anxious and antisocial most of my life (some of that probably comes from me being homeschooled and restricted friend wise) and while most of that has passed, social media still gets me. I’m not sure why, but whenever I think about even commenting on something my anxiety goes through the roof, I feel like a child, and I start heavily overthinking. With all that I let my SO know that I won’t be posting stuff/commenting, so I won’t have stuff with her and I on my wall or whatever it’s called, she said it was fine but she just asked if I would like all of her posts. And I try to do that to the best of my ability, but at this point, I don’t even have notifications on for insta, and I never look at peoples stories, or posts, just strictly messaging, so I have missed liking some of her posts. \n\nNow to what happened, so last night my SO makes a post about how much she likes me, and I actually see this one. So I look at it and then look at the comments cause I saw a friend posted a comment (he was just making a joke saying “Yass queen you rock it” directed at me) so I decide it’d be alright if I respond to this comment with a joke, and I do. But then she ends up texting me almost immediately saying “you really comment on your friend's stuff but not mine” I didn’t think this was a big deal but I realized it’s honestly rude of me to do so I told her I wouldn’t comment on anything anymore. But that's apparently not okay either, seeing as she said “not to be a bitch but it really bothers me that I put effort into all these posts about you, and comment on anything your tagged in when you seem to completely ignore me, I want to show other people how much I love you but you don’t seem to want that” and I said “ I don’t I don’t care what other people think of the relationship between you and I, cause we are the only ones in it” we go back and forth for a little but it stayed pretty calm. But it ended with me saying, I understand that personally she likes going out and projecting our relationship, but I’m just not that person. I said, “I love you and appreciate you show care in that way, but I’m not going to put myself into something I’ve been rejecting for multiple reasons, which I think ultimately makes me feel very anxious and changes my mood for the day.” \n\nI honestly I feel bad that she doesn’t think I show enough appreciation (although she said just over social media) because I do love her and am super proud of her and what she does, but she feels like I may be embarrassed about her. But I still feel I owe it to myself to note undo the work I put in, to restrict myself of things I see as unhealthy/would deteriorate my mental well being. \n\n\nTldr:gf posts tons of stuff about our relationship on Instagram, I don’t like social media so I do not. I make my first comment in a while as a joke to a friend and she gets upset I will comment on their stuff, not hers. She says she feels I don’t show enough appreciation over social media, and thinks I may be embarrassed by her. Still, I don’t want to put myself into the social media mindset cause I heavily disagree with many of the ways it makes people think, while it personally makes me extremely anxious.",

      "description": "Usual disclaimers, really long, mobile formatting yadda yadda.\n\nSorry, there's more backstory to this than the title would suggest. \n\nMy wife and I have been married for 3+ years, together for 9.5. We 'officially' cohabitated about 6mo into our relationship when her lease came up. At that time, we made the choice to buy a new queen bed since my full size was too small and her bed was 15 years old and had some extra lumps. Fast forward 8 years, and we bought our first house... and immediately splurged for a nice king size bed which we have greatly enjoyed this last year. \n\nIn those intervening 8 years, we lived with my parents in an attached apartment to their farmhouse. It had a separate entrance, 4 rooms, and the only shared space was the kitchen (though we even had our own fridge). I'm an only child, and my family had some serious events go on when I was in my teens / early 20s before i met my now wife.  The apartment space was something my dad and i had renovated together (and by renovated i mean ripped down to bare studs and completely rebuilt) but it was still at my parents and that was a point of contention with my now in-laws.\n\nOne of the reasons we had chosen to move in together back into this space involved then girlfriend deciding to go to grad school. While I have a decent paying job, it wasn't, and isn't, enough to support 2 adults and meet all the financial needs of student loan payments, cars, etc on top of rent. My parents let us stay rent free, just happy to have us close by and helping out in other ways. \n\nFast forward, and my wife is out of school, we've saved up and paid for our own wedding, then save up to buy a house. My parents are super supportive of the house buying, but sad to see us go. Dad helps renovate the new house, refinishing floors, painting, doing custom woodwork etc.  We move in a bit peicemeal over a  few months, but are close enough (20min) that ee don't have to rent a moving truck etc.\n\nNow, I'm not debating that I'm an asshole for this next part... I totally own that i fucked up here. Due to work and some personal commitments, i drop the ball after we've gotten about half of our stuff out of the old apartment. My parents make comments once and a while, but NBD. Then time goes on and it's suddenly been a year since we lived there and our shit still sits in that space. For some reason, getting my wife to go help pack the rest up is impossible. I've been chipping away at the small stuff, but the bed is still there. One of the major reasons is that whilenour new master bedroom is huge, it stole that space from the second (guest) bedroom. We've measured, and while technically the queen bed would fit, it would touch 3 walls and be a bitch to put sheets on.\n\nNow we get to the meat of it. About a month ago my dad was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. He's started chemo and will likely be looking at a pretty significant surgery down the line if the chemo/radiation goes well.  My parents approached me about the apartment and specifically bed, as the space is better insulated (remember, major renovation) and had first floor connection to their kitchen. They ask if we would be willing to move the queen bed downstairs into the old living room so that dad isn't doing stairs etc.  I say I have to talk to my wife, but don't expect it to be an issue because it doesnt fit the space and we havent gotten it in the last year.\n\nNope. Big deal. Wife says have to have it as a guest bed. I've tried to get her to go with me to get it out the last two weekends, she has cone up with excuses not to. My parents want an answer.\n\nAs a point, as far as i know there are no weord feelings between my parents and wife. They've always been very supportive of her, and she has no issue when they come visit us.\n\nAITA for just wanting to give it to them since we lived there rent free for so long and Dad has done so much for us in the new house?\n\nWIBTA if i just do it since she won't help get it out even though I could get a friend to go with me to help?\n\n",

      "description": "I’m a 20 year old female and unfortunately have IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). It’s a chronic condition affecting the digestive system with no known cure. As a result, I often have painful cramps, diarrhoea, back pain, and a frequent need to pee. \n\nI understand how annoying it must be to go out with me. Planning trips around toilet stops is a necessary way of life for me, and I feel extremely anxious and guilty every time I go as everyone else has to wait. Sometimes I’m late to things because I’d suddenly urgently need the toilet at the last minute. I apologise profusely every time and always ask my friends to eat first/go ahead and do whatever our plans are first without waiting for me. \n\nHere’s what happened- Whenever we’re out, my parents get angry at me every time I tell them I need the toilet. They will shout at me, dismiss me, act annoyed, roll their eyes, etc. Most recently, they called me “selfish”.\n\nSelfish? Am I really selfish for something I cannot control? I was so upset that I ended crying in public as they simply ignored me. \n\nI hate this condition. I am in pain daily but never complain to those around me. I do not ask for sympathy from my parents and only wish that they wouldn’t get angry at me for something I cannot control. \n\nAm I the asshole for inconveniencing everyone who has wait for my toilet breaks? Perhaps they’re right, should I just stay at home and avoid going out with people?\n\nI’m sorry if I sound overly negative in this post. I just feel like my existence is a huge inconvenience to everyone. \n\n\nTL;DR: I have IBS, a chronic condition that causes painful cramps, diarrhoea, frequent urination, etc. Sick of my frequent toilet breaks whenever we’re out, my parents called me selfish.

      "description": "Background: i'm 20 and my brother 15 (since i dont know how it is around the globe, the legal age is 18 here). He have a need to prove himself to his friends, like a normal teenager but more extremely.  He doesn' tolerate anything he would see as \"less than the best in anything\" around his friends, going as far as stealing (even tho something as cheap as a chocolate bar) just to prove \"he can do whatever he wants and is the coolest for that\"\n\nWe were at the pool today where he and 2 other friends are trowing water at another friend. When the target (srry, dont know the word) tried to leave, they would pull him back on. Since he was laughing with them, i was only looking, but after a few minutes he started asking them to stop.\n\nEventually he managed to get out of the ppool but so did my brother and he started to grab the kid to push him back on (for a moment i thought they were fighting)\n\nafter a minute repeatedly asking him to stop the kid suddenly drops to the ground and with the cleanest sweep kick my brother falls too. He then mounts on the kid and gives him a neck armlock (again dont know the proprer term sry), and i rushed in to separate them.\n\nFeeling humiliated by a 13yo kid (it was a beautifull sweep), he tried to engage again so i pushed him away. He then comes 5cm from my face and asks \"what are you gonna do? You cant hit me you're 20\", so i push him back and tell him that he will not hit that kid while i'm there. He tries to engage again, i push him again and he come to my face again, now saying he will make him bleed cause he was only joking and the kid took too seriously. He lifts his arms like that bane pose and ask again what am i gonna do\n\nNow i'm a really peacefull guy, but in my mind i couldn't let a kid that wanted nothing but to get along get beaten up for something he repeatedly asked to stop (i've been trough that part) so i slap my brother in the face pretty hard, he goes to the corner (probably to cry) and aventually leaves\n\nI'm not used to fight (even with 1sec duration), even more with a 15yo kid, so AITA here?

      "description": "I've been dating this girl for just 6 months or so and I’m having a hard time accepting her career choice, she is a preschool teacher. I know preschool teachers are greatly undervalued, and I’m part of the problem in that respect as I feel like they’re glorified babysitters.\n\nBefore I get shredded by preschool teachers, allow me to clarify my stance. I think there are folks out there who really want to make a difference in the lives of young children and choose to do so by teaching preschool. I mean no disrespect to these folks. In fact, that’s honorable as hell. They WANT to do it, and they’re willing to despite the poor paycheck.\n\nHowever, that’s not my girlfriend. It was never a goal of hers to be a preschool teacher, she basically just fell into the job. She was looking for a job a few years back, before we were dating, and was referred by a friend. (Prior to that she worked as an office assistant at a dental office.) She doesn’t seem to be doing anything to advance herself in the field (how does one advance as a preschool teacher?), and although career complacency is not a deal breaker, it is something that bugs me.\n\nMore important than all of that, I’m worried about the potential future of our finances. We live in the SF Bay Area, where the low-income line is near $120k for a family for four (this is merely illustrative, we do not have kids now). I make okay money, not great, but we’d be above the line if we both made as much as I do. But my salary combined with a preschool teacher’s puts us nowhere near $120k. She’s 29 and has always lived with her parents, so I don’t believe she fully appreciates how difficult living on her own in this area will be with a $30k salary.\n\nI like this girl and haven’t mentioned any of this to her – yet. But I really want a career-oriented woman who will make at least or closer to what I make (dual income, 50/50 partners FTW). Am I an asshole?",

      "description": "Me and my friend where in his backyard when his dog walked up to him and sniffed him. The first thing he did was kick it! I got annoyed because the dog just wanted a pet. I started to tell him not to kick his dog and he told me he hates it so it’s fine and that it’s just a dog so who cares. He also told me that is how he punishes her. I tell him that’s not right. He said well there’s no way of teaching her. I asked what he meant and he said that she throws up in the house a lot( something a dog can literally not control ) and she rips things up a lot so I said train her. His answer was why I hate it anyways. So I told him that if he hates it he should give it away. He said fine the only people who like her is his sister and his mom. I said then I’ll find a place for it if there ok with it. His dad who also hates the dog and wish they did not have it got annoyed at me and told me to mind my own business. I know I could have been nicer but he kicked his dog and I see him do this all the time so I just got super annoyed. AITA for telling he that he should not have a dog? Should I have treated the situation better? Or was I right that he should not have a dog that he kicks just because “It’s a dog and it is stupid so it will not care”? I feel like I could of handled the situation better but I want to know what others think.",

      "description": "I was on a 14 hour flight recently sitting in coach. I am a tall guy and my legs are long and generally flying on airplanes is an overall extremely uncomfortable experience. I try to book seats with extra leg room on long flights to such as exit seats or front row seats but there were none available when I was booking the flight. I used to only book aisle seats so I could intermittently stretch my legs out into the row but have had my knee smashed into by a cart and no longer take that approach. I would have even considered splurging on business class for such a long flight but those were all booked too. \n\nI'm sitting in my window seat and around two hours into the flight, the lady in front of me reclines her seat back around half way. This made me moderately more uncomfortable but I was OK with this as she paid for her ticket too and should be able to recline if she wants to. About 10 minutes later, she reclines her seat all of the way back essentially pinning my legs underneath her to the point where it was impossible to move them without hitting the back of her seat. Reclining my own seat back would not give me extra leg room based on how these seats were designed. I first attempt to readjust and slip my leg underneath to the space beneath her seat but this plane's seat configuration was so cramped that I was unable to do that. Now, the readjusting of my legs to try and find a comfortable position was hitting the back of her chair. She turns around to me and says \"Can you stop that?\" and before I have a chance to answer lies back down, puts on her headphones and eyemask and turns around to go back to sleep. \n\nWell, I didn't stop trying to adjust my leg as I wasn't going to be able to tolerate being in significant pain and losing leg circulation for 12 hours. After a few more minutes of this, she gets up again, turns to me and says \"what are you doing? you need to stop kicking my chair\". I respond to her that the seat of her back is crushing my legs and I'm trying to adjust them into a comfortable position. She literally scoffs at me, then attempts to recline her back FURTHER despite it being at max recline, and goes back to sleep. \n\nThis significantly pissed me off so I began to move my leg more vigorously and this started to really rock the back of her chair. After about five minutes of this, she reclined her seat back up and went back to sleep. She did not recline it back for the rest of the flight. \n\nAITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Sure we had disagreements like any roommate would but it wasnt until he stopped talking to me and my other roommate that I called him out. My other roommate told me that his grandmother passed away and I figured hey this must be why he's been acting that way. I tried to Express my sympathy for him and his family when he dropped off his rent check to where he basically didnt acknowledge me so when he came back later I called him out and told him that just because your grandmother died doesnt give you the right to be a prick and treat us like shit when you do speak us.

We were not overly far apart (half a days drive) and for many years I’ve considered her my best friend. \n\nRecently, her marriage has totally fallen apart - her husband was always awful, she just finally got the courage to leave with her kids. It hasn’t been easy, and her ex is really going out of his way to be awful.\n\nI feel for her, and that’s why I’ve made myself available at all hours when she calls crying, needing to talk and vent, and helping her with her court documents and any way I can without being immediately there.\n\nThen I broke up with my boyfriend in December. The more and more I tried to reach out to her, the more she would avoid me. She would go days without looking at her Facebook messages. \n\nOn January 15 I messaged and said I needed a yes/no answer on something within a 24 hour period.\n\nShe didn’t even look at the message until I messaged on the 28th saying I was sorry to hear her cat died. (She posted it on her timeline; she didn’t message me). \n\nShe replied with a brief thanks. \n\nIn the mean time; she’s posted a bunch of posts about how wonderful her friends are, and how she really appreciated the trip to the movies/dinner/visit with wine.\n\nI messaged last Thursday because there was a small amount of fresh drama I had with my ex; and the reply I got was “K, you know I love you but I’ve got my own shit going on, and I haven’t got time to listen to your petty stuff.”\n\nOuch.\n\nI told her okay, sorry to bother. \n\nThe next morning I wrote that I was really hurt that after I have supported her, she couldn’t muster up enough support to send me back some messages. \n\n“Hey, I was really upset last night, and really needed the support of a friend. I really thought we were supposed to be there for each other. I think it’s time I removed myself from this friendship. I really hope things settle down for you. Good luck.”\n\nAITA? \n\nAITA for feeling like she “owed” me? (That’s not the right word, but like, feeling like she should have reciprocated?)\n\nI’m autistic so don’t hold back - nuance is completely lost on me. \n",

Over the span of the following weeks it was okay sometimes (we were able to go out together, he was kind of active) but it got super bad again and he was diagnosed with hernia. \n\nWe’re both students living by ourselves but because of this he stayed at his parents house for the week so they can take care of him.  Ever since he has this pain and specifically after the diagnosis I was trying to be as supportive, helpful and compassionate as I could and since this weekend it was his birthday I stayed at his parents place the whole weekend, running errands for him, comforting him about his “ruined birthday”, socialising with the family when he has to lay down and rest etc. Although I really needed the time this weekend to study.  I think that is normal girlfriend behaviour and a given so I don’t want it to sound like i need an award for this but I just want to clarify that I did my best. \n\nHowever, ever since this back pain he’s been in a constant bad mood; short tempered, easily annoyed, not really responsive, passive... At his birthday we had dinner with his extended family and it seemed like all social energy he was able to bring up went into this and whenever it wA just the two of us he was just complaining about how exhausted, stressed and annoyed he was. We have talked about all of this he apologises for this and says he loves and appreciates me but also says he can’t change his behaviour because of the pain and being unable to leave the house. \n\nI try not to get upset about his behaviour towards me but we’re only 1 month in and I already feel tAken for granted and is it really THAT hard to try and be nice at least a little bit Although you’re in pain? \n\nSo I guess my question is AITA for being annoyed by his mood and especially his “I can’t help it sorry love you” whilst continuing to be just not nice?\n\nAnd WIBTA if I just distanced myself a little bit for now (less visits and phone calls) since it just makes me sad and feel rejected and I need to study loads anyways?\n\nThanks!",

      "description": "For context, when my girlfriend of 3 months and I started dating she made it very clear to me and told me she wasn’t the kind of person to take nudes and send them to people (fear of them leaking). I’ve respected this boundary she set to this day and never so much as joked about her sending me a nude picture. \n\nAbout a week ago she went through my phone’s search history and discovered I watched porn, to my knowledge I thought she already knew I did since I made no effort to actually try and hide that fact. Since discovering this she has been mad at for it. \n\nI’m a horny dude, but I respect my girlfriend’s boundaries so I never ask her for nudes. Instead I watch porn to get the deed done when she’s not here. AITA?",

She says how she's 'too pretty for him' and she should leave him. She also lives in America (he lives in UK) and could easily cheat. What really gets me is that they've decided that they'll get married and have kids + she'll live in UK and he'll move in with her by the time he's 15-16. In addition to that they also sext on video chat ALOT, I don't think this is alright and I'm very cautious because I care about him alot.

      "description": "3rd aita post of the week sorry fellas, a lots been going on, and this subreddit really seems to help me..anyways, onto the story.\n\nso i live with my boyfriend, have been since may 2018. before i moved in, i started smoking juul (i know im so rad right?) anyway, i developed an addiction to nicotine, a severe addiction. i believe it was around october, we got into a huge fight about it, because he hates smoking/thinks its stupid, etc... i break down, and destroy both of the juules  that i had. \n\nwe move on, things get better... but i am having insane nicotine cravings. we were home alone one night, everyone went out, and i decide i want to have a glass of whiskey. i suggested to him that maybe i can truly kick this habit if i have one cigarette while i drink, i dont know why i suggested that, i literally just wanted nicotine in my body. so i smoke one outside with him, i hated it! i told him no more, and we agreed to keep them in my sock drawer until we could give them to someone...\n\nwellll... i had just one more, then another, and soon the whole pack was gone within a week, however, he had been COUNTING THEM i kid you not, this guy was counting them. when they were gone, we had a fight, blah blah blah, this same thing happened two or 3 more times in the past few months. \n\nhim and i just made up from a huge fight we had where we told each other we need to work on ourselves, and i personally have been, i have been making him lunch daily, doing laundry, cleaning, picking up after myself, being responsible, and taking more shifts at work, because i know these are all things he wants me to do and im happy to do it.\n\nhe asked me to stop smoking, even when i drink, i said ok, but i only stopped for about 2 days. \n\ni came home from work smelling like cigarettes tonight, because i had one in the parking lot when i left, he smelled it, i lied because i didnt want to fight because he will never understand, turns out he found one of my two stashes and saw that i had taken some... we havent talked all night, now he is asleep and is going to work in 2 hours...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni texted him so he could see it in the morning, i apologized, yet i let him know that its my body, my decisions and he doesnt understand addiction because he has never been addicted to anything other than dr. pepper and RDR2. but my point is, he doesnt get it, and the fact that he feels like he is allowed to make decisions for me, and say \"its my way or the highway\" that just feels so wrong of him, almost dictator-ish. keep in mind we were both supposed to work on ourselves, and he hasnt done anything different. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso AITA? i am going to show him the replies, and pray it saves our relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So when me and my boyfriend got together he had this friend, I’ll call her Stacy. He and Stacy have never met in person, they started talking through Instagram and had been FaceTiming and texting since I met him. \n\nFor him she’s just a cool person to talk to, but not someone he could see himself. When me and him got together he introduced us during one of their phone calls and me and her followed each other on insta. \n\nShe would respond to the insta stories I posted and one day said “you’re lucky y’all aren’t closer because that’s a threesome ready to happen.” \n\nNow me and my boyfriend are sexually open and we love to play. So of course I called her on her bluff. \n\nPush comes to shove she reroutes her travel plans to come see us before she is shipped off to the navy. \n\nAnyway she is going to be here the first week of April and recently I was telling my boyfriend how texting her is annoying and I often take hours to respond. He responded along the lines that he dodges her calls all the time and that we both can’t ignore her because then she’ll know we only want her around so we can have sex with her. Because he knows she has a crush on him and while he has told her (through texts that I’ve seen and on the phone) that this is sex and he doesn’t want to be with her, he’s worried about the feelings she may get for me since she never mentioned coming down to him besides telling him her flight times.\n\nBut my thoughts on that is, we didn’t help pay for her plane ticket, we’re not going to pay for her food or whatever attractions she wants to do in the city. Even though we’re going to hang out, we’re not dating her and she knows this. So why should I go out of my way to care about her feelings beyond making sure that she consents to everything and she feels comfortable.\n\nSo am I the asshole for not caring wanting to text her everyday?  Also am I an asshole for saying that whatever feelings she gains about us is her responsibility, especially when she doesn’t live in our state and is going away to the navy? ",

My immediate reaction was to take my back hat fast and tell her that was rude. She laughed it off and said she was just joking around but I was pretty ticked off for the rest of the date. Despite that I think we had good chemistry and I just got to annoyed and surprised at the moment by the sudden intrusion so I didn't react to well.

      "description": "Typing this on my phone, so I’m sorry about formatting. \n\nMy SO and I love each other very much and although it doesn’t bother me too much, have a sort of dynamic I wouldn’t mind changing. We don’t really joke and play around the way other couples do (giving each other the business every now and then, calling names and such). Something that goes along with that is how we speak to and treat each other. I’m very big on doing her favours and helping her out with things, but an even bigger thing for mutual respect. \n\nI mention that because as I tend to do most of the things she asks me for, it’s very hit or miss the other way around. She’ll deny me a favour much more often than I would her. It started to get to me one day. I asked her if she could find a movie for us to watch, and she said ‘pass’ \nOkay, maybe she just didn’t want to watch anything. Later on I asked if she could heat me up some soup (something I do regularly for her) and again, no. So I jokingly told her that I’d never do anything for her again. I thought it was obvious I was joking, I mean to NEVER do her another favour again, EVER? But she got upset. \n\nShe told me that that was manipulative and uncalled for. I explained to her that I was joking and that the reason I said it was that she gets mad when I deny her favours WAY to often for her to say no to me so often. That’s right, I didn’t mention before. On the off-chance I do say no to her, she gets upset and it’s as if it’s the norm for me to say no. \n\nFast forward and I’m playing a video game while talking to her. She’s on her phone doing something else. I begin to say something and she cuts me off, so I stop. A little while later, I begin to try again and she cuts me off again. Now I don’t know if it’s important to mention that she was making comments to herself, but she certainly thought it was. I stopped talking and didn’t continue. \nA while later, she said\n ‘Anyway, you were saying something?’\nTo which I replied ‘I was. Twice.’\nThen we got into a huge fight because I told her that if she’s going to cut me off, I’m going to stop talking. This is something I told her I disliked enough times before. But she said again that that was manipulative and abusive language. \n\nI was dumbfounded. If simply asking her not to speak over me doesn’t help, then how else could I get the point across?\n\nShe said that every time I say anything like the things I mentioned above, it’s manipulative and she actually started crying. \n\nI’m so lost. \n\nTl;dr: I told my SO that if she speaks over me, I would stop speaking entirely.\nAnd explained to her that she shouldn’t get mad if I deny her a favour is she does it to me as often as she does.

      "title": "AITA for repeatedly borrowing money from my mother?",
      "description": "First off, I know the title immediately makes it sound like I’m an asshole, but let me explain. The job I have now is terrible, and 99% of my money goes to bills. I am still living with my father and his wife because I have absolutely no money left over to be able to move out. (I pay a third of all the bills at my dad’s house, plus buy all the food and other necessities) am there have been a lot of unforeseen circumstances over the last couple of years. \n\nI only ask my mom for money if it is for something I need (food, clothes, gas, school), and I always pay her back. She came into a lot of money when my grandpa died, and I just don’t have anybody to help me other than her. Also, when I was little she took $1000 from me (Christmas money from my grandpa) and said she would pay me back but she never did. That is another story though. \n\nWhat makes me ask is that my brother started yelling at me the other day because he says I am always asking her for money and it needs to stop. I would 100% stop if I had any other choice, but I don’t feel like I do. He is also always asking her for money, except he never pays her back. I guess she told him how she had lent me some money to catch up on bills, and he got mad because she wouldn’t give him $5000 to buy a second car (she bought the one they have now, and he hasn’t even tried to pay her back). \n\nI have never asked my mom to borrow more money unless I have paid back what I already owed her, but my brother and sister have never paid her back for anything she has lent them. My mother actually has access to my bank account and has even put money in without me asking, just because she knows I’m struggling. I have tried to pay her back for the times she has done that, and she won’t accept it, and I’m wondering if that might be why they are mad? \n\nI just feel like she appreciates that I always pay her back, so she is willing to do more for me, whereas my siblings never pay her back so she has stopped lending them money. My siblings are 27 and 29, and I am still 19, so in a way I do feel like I need the help a little more than they do, especially since they both make more money than I do, and I am still in school. ",

      "description": "Back story: my ex and I broke up in December but since this is our last semester before we leave school for good there was no point in renting out a whole new place for three months. We began a weird relationship after the break up where we still have sex , help each other out and even got a puppy together. But all with the understanding that we’re single and can see other people. It’s strange we understand but it works fine for us.  Lately though he’s been telling me how he tells girls I’m just a friend living with him but doesn’t mention I sleep with him and have sex with him all the time. Normally I’d let this go but he also gone as far as sleeping with one of them and comes back and makes fun of her for her size and tried to make jokes about how she desperately wants more with him and her attempts to win him over all while he laughs about it and doesn’t understand why I get upset over that. I also talk to other males but I’m honest about my situation so that they don’t get into anything they don’t wish to and can walk away if my situation makes them uncomfortable . At times I feel like exposing him to these girls he leads and especially the ones he comes back and belittles behind their backs. Some of the things he’s said is “ this boulder keeps thinking if she offers me free stuff I’ll fuck her again” “her body is like the bottom of a snowman does she really think I’d want her that way”. It really bothers me and I’ve told him that when he puts woman down this way it makes me uncomfortable yet he still does it.Also I haven’t done it and I probably won’t because it’s not my business and not my life but I just wonder if I’d be the asshole if i did.",

We didnt rush there, took us 3 hours for what was an hour journey, we went to the park for a bit.\n\nA bit of information, Me and my brother are in our 20s and my mother is in her late 40s.\nWe came up with a plan when he was dying in hospital to get him to confess to the worst things that had happened to us in our lives.\n\nMy mother obviously grew up with him and couldnt tear herself away from him, Until today.\n\nWell we see him in bed in a deteriated state and headed inside to condemn of the nasty shit he done. I actually laughed at him as soon as we entered when he asked for us to come closer.\n\nI wont make this seem like an endless story so ill get to the point, Me , my brother and my Mother have all been beaten by him.\nI was once beaten to the point where the hospital had to put me into a critical state, and my mother broke many bones. My brother had the worst of it since he was raped by him and beaten all the time for \"bad behaviour\" and \"being a Devil worshipper\" - FYI we have many Relegious friends who are amazing, But my father was a fanatic.\n\nWe explained to him all he had done to us, the consequences, My brothers mental health is in ruins and got into heavy drugs, since recovering and has work. My mother is emotionally destroyed over everything and even said his death had finally lifted the veil. And I explained how it led to me have violent flashback, PTSD and among other things. All in front of the hospital staff , we wanted them to bear witness.\n\nAnd after he said nothing, we left him to die alone.\n\nAll we wanted was maybe some sort of apology, or something? But nothing.\n\nI feel guilty because the other people in our family and friends have said what we did was heartless, even though they dont know the full story. \n\nMy mother sort of came up with the idea and my brother and I followed suit. Now I dont know if what we did was right or wrong.\n\n",

      "description": "Quick backstory. I was 15 or 16 and this would be my first relationship ever. It was exciting, it was exhilarating, I’ve seldom talked to girls in my life before this and she would be the highlight of my day. It was such a new and wonderful feeling, talking to a girl who probably liked you back. She lived a few towns away and we met online through a group voice chat with friends and mutual friends. We added eachother afterwards and we talked online. I knew nothing about her but her name and voice and I presumed she probably looked good too. She was nice and she seemed interested talking to me. I had my profile picture as my face, so she knew how I looked.\n\nA month goes by and my dumb ass fell in ‘love’ so hard with a girl whose face I haven’t even seen yet. We talked everyday for that month. And we confess to each other. Another week goes with us still continuously talking and I muster the courage to ask her to see her face. \n\nWell... I don’t know how to put this. I feel bad just by saying this but, it wasn’t what I expected. At all. I forced myself to be really mesmerised and then, I slowly stopped talking over the course of 3 weeks. I’d talk less in a day, then I’d skip days altogether, then I’d not answer her calls. During this time, coincidentally, I was moving countries with my parents and so I used that as the excuse of not talking that much. And then afterwards, I blamed time zones (there’s a five hour difference where I’d be ahead)\n\nIn time it became obvious to her this wouldn’t be possible as we went from talking all day to just saying “hi’s” and “hey’s” every few weeks. We simply just stopped talking. And I’ve been filled with guilt ever since. I blame myself for not asking how she looked like sooner, but most importantly I feel like an ass for judging her by looks alone when I already liked her for her personality. And as a FYI, we haven’t caught up in 2 or 3 years, I don’t know how hard she took us not talking but her friends say she’s fine. I’m not sure if they’re telling the truth or just saying that. So reddit, was I the asshole? I’m prepared to be called one, as I’ve called myself an asshole for this ever since. ",

      "title": "WIBTA if I confronted a close friend about her unresponsiveness?",
      "description": "My friend(18f) and I(17f) have been very close for 4-5 years, both of us have, at times, been the other's only friend. I moved a few years back and we barely see eachother irl, so our main mode of communication is snapchat, texting, instagram, and phone calls. We share a lot of stuff, and over the past year or so we mostly interact through snapchat and instagram. On instagram it's mainly just sending memes, and on snapchat we occasionally have conversations, but mainly we send a few snapshots of our day, or the occasional rant about something.\n\nFor the past year, I've been extremely frustrated by two things she does. The first is: if I call unannounced, she only occasionally answers or gives some response (like \"oh I'm busy I can't talk) but if I text her beforehand asking if she's free/wants to talk, she almost never responds (meaning that most of the time I call \"unannounced\" cause I have no idea if she's free or has even seen my message)\n\nThe second is that: she will make and not follow through with, what are in my eyes, plans to talk. For example, last Sunday was one of the times she called me. While talking, she said \"hey, I'm going to be completely free on these three days, do you wanna talk?\" I said I'd be free and I'd love to talk. Fast forward to one of the days she said she'd be free, she hasn't said anything so I call her. She says she was talking to her mom and would call back later. I wait, she doesn't call back. It's been a few days and she hasn't even mentioned it. \n\nThings like this have happened multiple times, she'll tell me she's free on some date or time, I call, no response. I'm fine if she ends up being busy or even just doesn't feel like talking, I just really hate the lack of response. If she just texted me later in the day saying \"hey, I actually am doing something/just don't really want to talk\" I would have been fine with that. \n\nI don't think that there's any malicious intent on her end or that she's trying to distance herself from me, but sometimes I don't know. There has been tension in our relationship before, at least on my end, but we've never really had a fight about something big. I find this whole situation extremely frustrating and at this point I kind of just want to be like \"hey, this relationship isn't being really fulfilling for me and this is frustrating, is this some larger problem in our relationship, do you want me to do something different, or could you respond more\" \n\nI really don't want to seem entitled to her time, but from my perspective, if you're going to call someone a really close friend, sometimes that means making an effort to change something. I get that she shares a lot with me and I don't want to be ungrateful because I know that it could be I'm the person who she feels secure enough with to say stuff, but sometimes I feel like I've become the \"person who doesn't know her friends so she can talk about drama with no consequences.\" ",

He got sent to rehab when he was finished with high school, and has since become addicted to weed (you may think that’s not possible but he can’t go a single hour without being high now). My two brothers and I were lucky enough to have wealthy grandparents, so we have all of that money now, and he pissed his away on frivolous shit, and is now asking my parents for money. Whenever he gets asked any sort of question that makes him uncomfortable, he shuts down, plays the victim, and storms off. When this happens, he’ll yell, curse everyone out, all in all act like a huge baby. \n\nYesterday, my parents asked how he spent $200 on his grocery order, and he went ballistic. He said, “this is absurd I don’t need to answer to you. Fuck you, I hate you,” to my parents... but the thing is they have every right to know because they are paying for his goddamn groceries. I drove him to the train short after that, and I flipped on him and told him to grow up and learn to have an adult conversation, yelling and saying the world is against you when people disagree is extremely unhealthy. Well... he lost it. He said that he knows now that I’m one less person in the family he can trust, he punched my dashboard on my car, he literally tore his book apart with his teeth, and he threw it out the window. The way he looked at me, I thought he legitimately was going to punch me in the face. I was scared so I followed him out of the car when he stormed off and hugged him to calm him down, but I have legitimate disdain for him because of the way he has always treated my family. I don’t know what to do because he broke down and said he’s a burden on all of us, and I said that’s not true, but he knows he is sort of the black sheep. AITA for feeling this way about him? He’s my brother but he has made everyone’s lives hell because of how he treats us, and I don’t know how to handle his victim mentality anymore\n\nHe doesn’t have a job and his therapist, who told him to trip ayahuasca in Peru, tells him all the weed he smokes is therapeutic\n\nHe was diagnosed over 10 years ago with bipolar disorder among other things and has been taking medication for a long time\n\nSorry if this isn’t exactly a coherent paragraph, it was a rant because I’m still in shock about last night, I’ll answer questions in the comments ",

      "description": "I am pregnant and would like to announce it on April 1st, making the post look like my younger sister is playing a joke on me until the afternoon when I clear it up and say that I'm really pregnant  (and the April fool is tricking people into believing she 'hacked me). My younger sister loves this idea, thinks it's hilarious and helped with the wording to make it look as unlike me as possible (like, it will have hashtags which I never use, and I'll joke about naming the kid April). I like a good joke, and how often does big, good news come up so close to April?\n\nMy family all already know my situation so I won't be breaking any news to them, this will be a surprise for my friends. I was talking to my elder sister about the April fool plan. She didn't like the idea and was concerned I'd offend or upset other people who had difficulty conceiving or miscarriages. I had a knejerk reaction of, \"someone else's misfortune isn't my burden to bear and it's not like I'm pretending to be pregnant \" and she reluctantly agreed, but now I'm having second thoughts. Is it an arsehole move to announce a pregnancy when people might think I'm joking?\n\nTl;dr: I want to announce my very real pregnancy on April fools, making people think I'm joking for a few hours until I confirm it in the afternoon. Am I being an arsehole for not considering feelings of people who have had fertility problems?",

      "description": "Conflicted about this one, mostly because another mutual friend sees no issue and is happy to be reconnecting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had a friend who'd been close for years. They've got a tendency to go a bit quiet when stressed, but this most recent time it was massively abrupt. I was helping set them up with a new job after their old one fell through, then communication in every medium with me and all of our mutual friends just vanished, utterly. It took me a full month to reach anyone who could even let me know that my friend was still alive (I worried a lot about suicide), and even then all I was able to get was \"X is fine, just stressed and probably quiet\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been 18 months since then. Zero communication until I had an actual back and forth for a few days while on vacation (one that had been inspired by them). I have, over the course of the last year and a half, mostly just stopped trying to check in. It went from every other day (we used to speak daily) to once a week, to a couple of times a month, to once a month, to an occasional once-every-season \"just checking in\" message, which basically never see responses. I brought back gifts from my trip that I knew they'd like, mentioned to them, and got radio silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, a mutual friend of ours was able to establish some kind of contact, and is ecstatic about rekindling communication, and even delivered my gift for me. I still get precisely zero communication. Said mutual friend doesn't seem to think X is doing much better than before and is still extremely quiet, but is hoping to pull X into being more social. I find that I'm not tremendously enthused by this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt hurts deeply to get cut out so thoroughly from a close friend's life and even simple communication, and I find it hard to want to throw more energy and worry into what feels like a void. On the other hand, I know extremely well how difficult it is for someone who retreats into isolation when extremely stressed/depressed to reach out for even basic communications, and if it's been long enough that it would be awkward, it's that much harder. It would mean a lot to me to get some acknowledgement, though, but I suspect that's not going to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting some kind of reciprocation/apology/acknowledgement of the year+ of the silent treatment, or should I just be happy a friend in a rough situation might be coming back?",

      "description": "The backstory is kind of complicated but I'll try to simplify. Me and my ex were together 4 years and broke up for two, in which time he moved across the country to California for a job and ended up dating someone else for a year and a half. Some time in the middle of last year, he calls me and tells me he's coming back, his ex cheated on him and he realized what a mistake he made by leaving me and he wants to get back together.\n\nI was shocked because our break up was pretty dramatic and was really awful for me but I was so happy to have him back it's like I just blocked everything out about his ex and took him back, even though I knew he had just gotten out of a relationship. We start dating but both agreed to take it slow as we got back into the relationship. This went on for several months. Everything seemed good and fine except there were a few things that I got suspicious of. I heard him talking on the phone late one night to someone he said was his brother and that he needed to be picked up at the airport but it didn't seem right, but I was like okay go ahead. So then one day suddenly he hits me with the news that he was moving back to be with his ex. I kind of freaked out and grabbed his phone and saw where they had been talking almost since he had came back. So the whole time we were back together he had been trying to get back with his ex apparently even though we had been talking about the future and talking about moving in together.\n\nLiterally the night before this happened I slept over at his house and everything was fine, next day he ghosts me and has his relationship on Facebook set to being with her (he had her blocked earlier). Then I saw where she had posted photos of a specific event that I knew took place on one day during when we were together that she had flown in across the country to see him. I feel disgusting and used and the fact that he kept mentioning a future and how this time he was here to say is so hard to deal with. I know someone who knows the girl and is acquaintances with her and she said the girl said he told her that he was just going back to visit family while he was here and that they were just on a break (he doesn't even have family here anymore), so she had no idea he came back to be with his ex. \n\nI really want to tell the girl what he did and that he was still with me while he was trying to get back with her and how they had met up when we were still together and that he had moved here to get back together with me. I wrote down her number from his phone. I don't even know if I care if she believes me. I just want to do it.\n\nTldr; Ex moved back across the country to be with me, talking about staying for good, our future, moving in together, everything was great... Turns out he was talking to his ex and meeting up with her the whole time. I really want to tell her that we were still together that whole time. I also have tons of pictures and text messages as proof if she doesn't believe it. WIBTA to tell her?\n",

      "description": "Hi there, throwaway account for those who are wondering. My friends know of my account and I don't want them to know about this very personal issue of mine.\n\nAbout three years ago (February 2015), I received multiple calls from someone (who I was unaware) who claimed that they were my son. I, being a single widower, laughed this off and forgot about it until late last year. Last year, I received a call from a woman who I was in a relationship with back in the late 90's. I resisted calls from her and told her to leave me alone several times. She started harassing me on facebook and other social medias before I received a knock on my door in June. \n\nThis woman (I'll refer to her as A) came to my house and asked to come in. When I refused, she mentioned that it was important and that she would like to come in. We both sat down in my living room and she disclosed the details of her son (I'll refer to him as B) and brought up that he was my biological son of 19. She explained that he had tried to contact me after his distant dad died as she had told him the truth. This was a huge shock to me as I had not heard from her since 98' in no way, shape or form and so much had happened since then. We left eachother due to her issues (cheating, drugs and abortions) and I had no concept of having ever impregnating her. I asked her kindly to get out of my house. She refused, I called the police and she was forcibly removed over an hour later. Two weeks later, she comes to my house again with claims and a letter from B that I did not read. I still didn't belive A at all as I thought her claims were farcical and an attempt to abuse me and harass me. \n\nSince July, I have received countless texts, letters and requests from several of her family members, B's friends, A and B themselves (with changed names and photos). At my workplace in August, I was called to reception at the hotel I work for and there was B. I didn't know who he was at the time although he left some photos of himself and a letter from himself. He mentioned he had being trying to reach me for a few years now and started to get angry at me for my 'negligence' and unresponsiveness with their attempts to contact me. I was quite infuriated and I stormed off back to work. There was no need for security in this situation. \n\nI received a call from B that night and I talked to him to try and understand what him and others wanted from me. He asked why I had been unreachable and angry towards him when all he wanted was a 'Dad'. I talked to him, reasonably, and mentioned that I had no proof of him being my son, found their attempts to contact me far-fetched and a type of harrassment. All he asked for was a cup of coffee and lunch somewhere. \n\nBefore I get into the last part of this post, I should mention that I am in my 40's, single and without children. My wife died in a car accident back in 2009 and I live a quiet life. I haven't made any connections with any women or people since my wife's death as I don't wish to do so. I currently struggle with anxiety, panic attacks and chronic depression. I met B's mother, A, at a real estate convention in the mid-90's and I was with her for 4 years. We never had any real problems until  the last year of our relationships when I found out she had been cheating on me. I had also found her smoking amphetamines in my house and in social circles. I had been eyeing up one of my colleagues at work for a while and my mood and wellbeing was in a very low spot. I decided to leave A and ask out my colleague (who became my wife) in order to seek happiness and a better life. \n\nNot at any stage from A and I's relationship to 2017 had I received any news or information about B (or A for that matter) and I find B wanting to have a relationship with me, something I very much don't want and shouldn't have to deal with. He has lost his dad though and because of his distant mother just wants a father-like figure. I don't feel I should have to deal with this void as I am not even confirmed to be his dad and I don't know him at all. It shouldn't be my responsibility to take up a role for someone who could just be a regular kid that has nothing to do with me. \n\nI went and met B last week and was a turbulent and quite aggressive encounter. We met a cafe and had lunch. At the start, B and I had a genuinely pleasant conversation and discussed things like A and her life, him and his history (He has been to juvenile hall and has asperger syndrome and bi-polar disease). B then started asking things about my personal life, to which I answered truthfully and then... he started to accuse me of leaving his mom, making her drug-addled and etc. I refused these claims and started to become visibly upset. When I finally stood up for myself and told him to stop and told him he had been told lies, it calmed down. We finished lunch quietly. At the end, B asked for another meeting and my participation in a DNA test, I refused to both. He swore at me several times, threatened to hit me and I felt quite intimidated throughout the encounter. After this meeting, I have been racked with guilt and feel as though, if B is my son, then I have missed plenty of chances and experiences and, ultimately, messed him up. \n\nI am still receiving phone calls, texts and messages that range from neutral to abusive. I don't really know what to do here and like I have said before, I still feel guilty and responsible for some reason... I am also considering taking out a restraining order as this is starting to drain me.\n\nI just want to know if, from a neutral perspective, I am wrong or being an A-hole for not wanting anything to do with him or not wanting to know if he's my son or so on. I know it's too much for me and I am close to certain he is not my son.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I’m a girl and I work in a pretty laid back restaurant. The majority of our staff are also women. \n\nThe environment is generally pretty chill and we’ve all become decent friends. We’re all happy to help each other out by swapping shifts/covering them if anyone is ever sick or busy etc. \n\nGet ready for TMI. Personally, I don’t have much trouble when it comes to my period. I rarely get cramps, and when I do just taking a couple painkillers fixes it. I do get kinda crabby and emotional sometimes, but I try not to let it ruin my day/shifts. \n\nHowever, all the other girls I work with often take days off as a result of period pain. 3 times in the last month I’ve gone out of my way to swap and cover shifts to help out my coworkers who ‘can’t’ work as a result of period pain. It’s beginning to annoy me because they’re taking multiple shifts a week off for something that I barely consider painful. \n\nOf course I know that I can just decline to take/swap a shift, but last time I was approached by a girl to cover a shift, she called me a dickhead for not taking the shift even though I said I wasn’t busy (I didn’t have anything planned but I didn’t want to work another shift, especially for someone who I believe is overreacting to the amount of pain they’re experiencing) \n\nAITA in the situation? Particularly when I decline to take a shift that I would’ve taken if the person was genuinely ill? I just really don’t feel that period pain is a good enough reason to not work. ",

      "title": "AITA for asking my roommate if his gf could show up later in the week?",
      "description": "**Context:** My roommate and I live in a 2 bed, 1 bath apartment, split bills 50-50. *Every* weekend, my roommate and his girlfriend spent the whole weekend together (Friday noon - Monday morning) for the past two semesters, but because of work schedules, she’s at our place about 3 out of 4 times. They don't do much: make long dinners and lay around watching shows in his room, separated from mine by a wall that doesn't block much noise, but I don't mind since I'm usually not busy on the weekend anyway.\n\nHis gf goes to another university who's spring break is before ours. Her plans were to show up on Tuesday 3/5 and spend the week at our place. I was expecting the week to be tough for me; two exams in hard classes, two long reports to write, plus the usual homework, so I thought I didn't want to have her here for the \"whole\" week. It's obviously more than that since I'm a single guy; seeing their relationship every weekend is slightly irritating... but I don't really know how to put that into better words. I also never voiced that previous statement to either of them.\n\n**Event:** I asked my roommate Friday 3/1 if she could instead come Thursday, since my week would basically be done by then. He was surprised since I have never asked them to change their plans before, and I have never complained. He said it should be fine; I was relieved since I felt bad asking in the first place.\n\nLater, after a phone call, he came to me with a defeated look and asked if she could come Wednesday, because she was feet \"unwelcome\" after my request. I said if I could change my exam time, sure, but I can't. I then started feeling even more guilty, so I started texting his girlfriend myself. We usually get along well in person, but while texting she became short with me: “Why don't you just ask us to be quiet\", \"Sorry people need to eat and use the bathroom\", and \"If I'm such a bother then I just won't come at all\". She surprised me to say the least. I spoke to my roommate again and asked if she was blowing it up or if I was the bad guy. He was texting her at the same time as me, and basically told me the same thing about asking them being quiet. I could tell he was just trying to appease both of us, but I was firm about not having her here until my last exam was over. He said \"don't worry about it, she just won't come at all then.\" I apologized, left the room, and we haven't said a word to each other since.\n\nFYI They weren't planning on doing anything special, or they would have let me know and I would've been fine with it\n\nTL;DR My roommate and his girlfriend see each other every weekend, for the whole weekend, and most weekends it's at our place. I was expecting a hard week of class for the **whole week** they were planning to have her at our place. I asked if they could push her arrival to nearly the end of the week after never asking them to change their plans before for the past year, and they both pushed back at me.",

      "description": "Apparently everyone who knows me in real life thinks I overreacted. Looking for some outside opinions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo husband and I were over at his parents for Christmas. The day after Christmas he has a tradition of going for a morning hike with his childhood best friends and their respected SOs/wives. In the past, none of their SOs would go  but this year I went along with another woman. So it was us plus my husband and his 3 other friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the hike, they started making really crude/vulgar jokes about poop and pee and literally 3rd grade humor stuff. I was tired and sweaty and a bit nauseous and asked them to stop or else I was going to vomit. They did... for a while until they started up again when they thought I couldn't hear but I was only like 10 feet ahead of them. I kind of snapped and told them that they weren't funny and their jokes were lame and immature. They shut up after that but kept snickering, I'm assuming at me. It pissed me off more and I kind of stomped off ahead of them for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter like 30 min the other girl caught up to me and told me that I should calm down and that my eruption was really embarassing...for me. I don't think she was telling me this in good faith since she seemed fully on the boys' side, but I said fine and let it go. That night my husband and I fought because he told me I was out of line for calling him and his friends immature and pathetic and that if I didn't like their jokes I could've just walked on further ahead. I agree and disagree. Yes I could've put more distance between us BUT the whole point was for us to hike together. I don't think it's a huge ask for people to watch their language when others are around, especially if its making them uncomfortable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

      "description": "I come from a very typical Asian family. I have been going to college far away for the past few years and I chose to go far away to get away from my family’s toxic behavior. \n\nWhen I was very little, one of my sisters passed away and my family took it very hard. We never went to therapy for it, so I’m assuming that there’s still unresolved trauma there. There was now me, the youngest, and my sister who is 7 years older than me.  But I didn’t necessarily have a bad childhood. My parents gave me what I needed, even if they made me feel bad about it. “I waste so much money on you, yet you’re so ungrateful” or “I only use money on you, why do you need so much stuff, I don’t buy anything for myself anymore”. My mom even went so far to say that her friends are so much happier without kids and they have more money to spend. I actually didn’t realize how abusive these words were until just recently. \n\nWhen my sister graduated college, I was in my sophomore year. While we were at the commencement, we found out that we only had two tickets for me, my mom, and my dad. We called my sister about it and she said that she’d talk to someone about taking her name off the list or something so we wouldn’t have to wait. Well eventually we got in because a very generous person gave us one of his tickets and so we went in and she didn’t get called. So this led to my parents believing that she didn’t graduate, even though a few months later, she received her degree in the mail. They still don’t believe her to this day. \n\nMy sister got heavily involved in drugs after she graduated and moved back home. Cigarettes and heroin every single day. My mom wanted to send her to rehab but she refused and claimed that she wasn’t on anything. This led to fighting everyday. Through the stress of my junior and senior years of high school, I couldn’t take it and only applied to schools over a few hundred miles away, even though my parents wanted me to stay close. \n\nAfter I moved out, I gradually stopped the constant contact with my family. We now only call about 1-2 times per week. \n\nMy mom is very stubborn and manipulative, yet sensitive. If you even raise your voice at her, she’ll cry and claim that she’s going to die because of you. If something doesn’t go her way, she’ll just stop talking to you. She believes money is everything and will yell at you for spending your own money. \nMy sister has anger issues. Yells at everyone and everything, even my parents. Thinks she knows everything. Can be very condescending. I still don’t even know if she’s completely drug free or not. \nThe only person I can really rely on is my dad. I miss him everyday. He is my definite number one and sometimes the only reason I want to come home. \n\nI definitely have plans of staying where I am after I graduate college, but my family will not understand. I am grateful for everything they have done for me, but I just can’t stand having to be in the same room as all of them for even just a day. After all I’ve gone through, am I really the asshole for wanting to stay away?\n\nTLDR; I think being around my family is toxic for my mental and emotional wellbeing so I moved away for college and I plan on staying away after I graduate. Am I the asshole?",

      "description": "Let me begin with the I'm on mobile stuff and some preface: I'm 15, the sister in question ( now known as I) is 13. I have 3 other sisters: E, 11; D, 28; and T, 31. Me and I are not very close but me and E are. My parents are split up and have been since 2013. I never walks either dog, does chores, feeds the pets (2 dogs and a cat), does anything with our niece, steals constantly (money and material belongings), helps my mum with anything like laundry, tidying, cleaning, she regularly hits my dad, me and E, and is generally all around selfish. But I'm biased, she's my sister so this is why I'm posting on here.\n\nNow recently we have had some blows to our family. Almost 2 years ago, my mother was diagnosed with bowel cancer. At the time it was too late to be curable, she was given 5 years, longer with treatment, earlier this year she was given 12 months. Everyone is aware of this. T has a steroid condition and was told she could never have kids and this was true until a year ago she had a little girl. She is wonderful. However earlier this year just before my niece's christening it came out her boyfriend had been hitting her in anger. My mum's boyfriend who we are very close with was diagnosed with lymphoma but they fought it early enough for treatment. This year hasn't been fantastic.\n\nI is horrendous with money. She gets £10 a week (same as me, E gets £5) and its gone in seconds. She constantly loses her card and never past anything back. Christmas is difficult for her as she has to spend money on other people rather than herself. Me and E set up an arrangement. I saved up alot of money this year (£400+) and we went and spent a lot of money on Christmas presents for put family. E will pay me back her share and has a deadline of April (her birthday) which is easily doable - we checked. \n\nSide note: we invited her **every time** we went out and we told her what we were doing.\n\nI then asked me if I could put her name on the presents. She waited until after we had done our shopping and fair share of wrapping to ask. I told her how much it would be and I wanted at least £20 upfront. This would have been easy as she had £40 in her bank account due to our mum giving us a little extra and her not having access for a while after losing her card. She refused to believe it was that much, so i showed her the receipts and price breakdown of what we had bought. Then we had this conversation:\n\n&gt; I: alright but I'm not paying you £20 \n&gt; Me : then it's not happening\n&gt; I: why?\n&gt; Me: You waited until we were done wrapping to ask so you wouldn't be asked to do that. You already owe people in the family money. This is a money I have worked hard to save and I'm not losing it. \n&gt; I: I've said I'll pay you back. God.\n&gt; Me: You also said that to [I began listing various family members such as our parents, all three of our sisters, my grandmother, the list goes on]. I can't trust you with money.\n&gt; I: but you trust E\n&gt; Me: Yes, she paid me back last year and has always paid me back - you've never paid anyway back.\n&gt; I: Why should I have to go shopping when you already have?\n&gt; Me: Leave me alone I\n&gt; I: You're just a selfish fat bitch.\n&gt; I: Cow.\n\nI then left because I wasn't going to listen to the verbal abuse from her (this was pretty  tame for her she usually says much worse and hits me) and told E who wasn't surprised. My dad came and said we should do it to avoid the conflict but we stood our ground. I feel like I should cave to avoid the conflict and make what could be my last Christmas with my mum one without conflict. \n\nShe will almost definitely bring it up on Christmas to spite us and we get dirty looks for \"excluding\" her. She also does this wither birthday presents and I'm forced to cave or I lose my phone. Am I the asshole for not putting her name on the presents?\n\n",

      "description": "So I (22M), used to be an incel. Operate word: USED TO BE. \n\nI stopped a year ago. I no longer have a case of woman-hating disease. \n\nNow my sister (25M) is a staunch feminist so obviously, it was more horrifying to her when she found out I was an incel (I told her). However she also can't seem to take a joke.\n\nAnyway we were watching some shitty ass movie and there's a scene where out of nowhere this bitch of a character gets bitch slapped. In the context of this movie, i think she deserved it and the first thing I did was to laugh. My sister then said ''Of course you'd laugh, you were an incel and hated women. Don't laugh during scenes like this it's harmful as fuck''.\n\nLOL wutt?? So I just said back (with sarcasm):\n\n''Yeah, that's right. I was an incel. I've hated women and children. I've hated everything that walks or crawls at one time or another. And I'm here to hate you''.\n\nI was quoting the Unforgiven lol but clearly changed the lines to make into a joke. Then my sister said ''Don't be a fucking asshole and make jokes like that. It's harmful and you're disgusting''. Wtf why is my own sister still acting like this?? AITA?",

      "description": "Background: Boyfriend and I (25M,F) have been together for a decade +. Being kids at the time and complete idiots, we broke up about 3 years into the relationship. I was single for a few months and happened to grow close with a male friend of mine during this time. We got along absolutely great and, pretty soon ended up being more than friends. \n\nIt fizzled out because neither of us stepped up (again, complete idiots). Boyfriend and I started dating again, and developed a much healthier, adult relationship. I'm more than happy with how everything turned out, and the relationship couldn't be better. \n\nCue current situation. The other dude and I got back in touch recently (boyfriend knew). We met once since then, and he'd gotten me something he'd picked up because it reminded him of me. Obviously it was sentimental but it was also from something I'm really into and care about. Boyfriend, however, flipped his shit over my displaying it in my room. According to him, it's extremely disrespectful to him. Mind you it's pretty large, you can't not notice it if you're in my room.\n\nI honestly just thought the thing was really cool and it was something I'm really excited about owning. I had absolutely no intention of making him uncomfortable. He, however, says I was rubbing it in his face and there's no way he can be in my room with it right there. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?",

      "description": "Ok we have been friends for 6 years now. She had troubles getting pregnant and just had her first baby 1.5 years ago.. she just gave birth to the baby she got pregnant with when her first was 5 months well her baby now is prob about 3 or 4 months and shes pregnant again. She refuses to use birth control she SWEARS she didn't want to be pregnant but she told me the day she gave birth she was ready for another and I told her to just enjoy her two babies now and time will come when your more steady and have another when you have the means .. she didn't say anything then told me all about how her husband doesn't do anything for their kids now doesn't take care of them really at all so she's doing it alone she doesn't work he does but he works very little he's just a loser sorry just gonna say it.. well now she expected me to get excited when she told me about the 3rd and I didn't. I asked her why she didn't wait longer and she pretended it was a surprise baby but I know her it I HIGHLY doubt it. I told her she shouldn't want to live on medicaid and foodstamps and keep having babies to just take it slow their is no rush she is still in her mid 20's ... she told me that's what medicaid is for is to have insurance and \"my babies are smart I ain't gotta save for college\" well you have a 1 1/2 year old and 3 month old so .. your banking alot on scholarships.. I understand it wasn't my place to speak up and tell her but I've seen everyone around her have like 4+ babies get checks off them and that's how they live. I told her she should want more in life than the minimum and shouldn't accept less I was nice about it when I told her I wasn't being a bitch (atleast I don't think I was) and she flipped the fuck out on me and won't talk to me now.  I don't care that she's mad .. I think it's super fucked up to bring kids in the world you can't even pay for .. she just expects to live on state/govt aid her entire life .. before I told her anything she was captioned the photo on her snapchat to everyone \"headed to the wic office in the morning\" and I was just fucking appalled because this isn't the friend I knew now she just wants to crank out 100 damn kids she can't afford and then complain it's not enough .. again I know I should have kept my mouth shut but am I the asshole for speaking up and finally telling her what no one else obviously was?",

      "title": "AITA for demanding my ex pay owed money at a time where she needed it a lot more than me?",
      "description": "Long story. Strap in kids, there’ll be a TL;DR and cookies at the end of the post.\n\nBackstory: me and my ex were together nearly 10 years, I’m currently 25, she’s 24. It was a long distance relationship for ages, which culminated in me simply up and emigrating to be with her. She broke up with me 4 months after I did.\n\nCut to 2 months ago, she gets back in touch with me (at this point I’m back in the UK trying to build a life for myself, she’s still in Vietnam travelling and on/off working). Tells me she needs money, £400. Says it’s “just to tide me over until I get paid”. Fair enough. I hate lending money to people but we were together a long-ass time, and I still trusted her, so I sent her the money on the basis that she pay me back in a weeks time. If she didn’t pay me back in that time, we agreed that she would go to her parents, borrow the £400 from them, and use it to repay me.\n\nA week later I don’t have the money. Now atm I’m living with my parents, so I’m saving a fair amount of bank, but I am also looking to buy a property soon so I would eventually need the money back. I ask what’s happening. She apologised and swore that she would get me the money ‘soon’.\n\n2 weeks after she said that and nothing had changed, just me texting her for an update and constantly being told ‘soon’, when she finally tells me the truth. I thought she was waiting on a pay check from an employer. Nope. She lent a huge amount of money to a new boyfriend she met in Cambodia or somewhere like that, and he ran off with it. She was waiting for him to pay her back (of his own volition) so that she could give me my money back.\n\nWorse, a few days prior she had asked for my bank details. Ok, I thought, I trust her. She sent them to this Spanish boyfriend so he could pay me back himself. Obviously he didn’t because he’s a con artist and her money is gone. Now, if this money was because a cheating employer hadn’t paid her I would have been more forgiving, but she gave (she never said how much, so I imagine a lot) of money to a guy she’d known for a few months at most, and expected me to be sympathetic about it?\n\nIt had now gotten to be a month since I lent her the money ‘for one week’. I got insistent. She maintained that the Spanish guy would pay her back, and that she trusted him. I maintained that I didn’t care, and said if she didn’t pay me back I would go to her parents and ask them to pay me back (remember that the original agreement had her borrow money off them and use it to pay me? She did borrow it money from them, but kept it). Eventually she caved and sent me the money, but hasn’t spoken to me since.\n\nDuring the time I was getting more and more persistent about the money:\n\n• My mum could see that I had lent it her and I hadn’t got it back, since she’s able to control my back account. She was constantly on my back about it.\n\n• I was telling her she was naive to think she was getting the money back, and stupid to lend it in the first place. Pot calling the kettle black, maybe, but I’d known her for half my life. She knew this guy for months, at most.\n\n• Her family were... honestly I have no idea. Enabling her, mostly, and telling her she did nothing wrong.\n\n• The crux of it all was when I asked if she’d learned any lesson from this, she said if it happened again she’d give her money away again. Honestly, no idea how I put up with that for so long.\n\nSo, whew. What a ride, eh folks? Anyone needs any more info speak up but I think that’s a good jumping off point. AITA because I got mad and demanding, despite me not needing the money at that time? She really was very poor. But she also lied to me about the reason she had no money, and showed herself to be utterly delusional near the end.\n\nTLDR: me send ex money for one week. Month later, ex no pay me. She need more than me. Ex need money because ‘new me’ stole money off her. Ex waiting for ‘new me’ to pay her back. Me get demanding, say me go to ex’s parents for money. Ex send money then ghosts.

      "description": "Sorry for the bad english.\nIn gym class, we play a lot of basketball, and association football. In the last 4 years, i was always ordered to be a defender and if i asked them to \"allow\" Me to be a striker i was ignored/told that i was lame/not good enough, and my team mates never passed the ball to me.  Even if they did, they immediately asked me to pass it back. I was always picked last. (Wich is ok). Keep in mind that we only pay for \"fun\" And it has no stakes. Today was the last straw. We were playing football, and my team mate ordered me to be in the back ( he didn't say \"please\" He just ordered me like I was a fucking dog). I told him that i didn't want to and that I'm always the defender, but he didn't care. I didn't want to be in the back, so i was just standing there, but didn't anything. The teacher told me to be the defender as there were only one defender (he is also always a defender and I talked to him and he said that it makes him upset. He never does anything out of spite). Itold her that i'm always the defender, and that i wanted to be a striker, and asked her why doesn't she ask someone else. She ignored it.\n\nSo my plan is that from now on I will alway act like a striker, and never be in the back, even if my team mates order me to do so. And if they ask me ti oass to ball back, I'II either ignore them or throw/kick it out of the field. And if we lose and they blame me for it i'II tell them that it's their fault as well, becuse they could have been  defenders as well, if needed them so bad.\nAnd if they yell at me, I'II yell back.\n",

      "description": "So, in high school, I asked a girl to Homecoming. She said yes, and we went together with her friends/dates. However, all of us had a horrible experience mainly because I was interested in her romantically and she was interested in me solely as a friend. She became aware that I wanted more when I paid for her dinner that night. So, when it came to the dance, she kept running away from me with her friends and only danced with me once (in which she wouldn’t even look at me). Basically, you could say that I was ditched that night. After that, it became a bit awkward at school since before I would talk to her in the hallways and see her in my classes. We both kinda stopped talking to each other for awhile. I was kinda upset for a while, even months after the dance, since she just cut me off, ignored my texts, and ghosted me for months. I was so frustrated that I even went up to her at school one day and asked her why she did what she did (I was needy and inexperienced back then). She basically just told me that she wasn’t ready to date and insulted me by saying that I had a bad personality and was controlling. In return, I got mad at her and told her that she basically used me that night since she could have said no if she wasn’t interested in going in the first place, but said yes. After that heated conversation, we stopped talking for a couple more months until one day she saw me and said hi and I ignored her. Fast forward, her and I happened to go to the same college and still don’t talk or acknowledge each other. Currently, I kinda still have some lingering feelings, since she was my first love. But I’m just wondering AITA for still ignoring her/ not acknowledging her? I am kinda conflicted since she did insult me, ghost me, and break my heart; but I also feel like she didn’t mean to hurt me and that I should be the bigger person. ",

      "description": "We've been dating and living together for two years, both in our 20s. We exchanged our gifts last night and he gave me an expensive perfume. It wasn't my favorite smell but I didn't think it smelled awful either. I don't have any other perfumes so it's actually a very nice gesture. I know he spent a long time picking it out. I said thank you/showed my gratefulness last night. \n\nToday (Valentine's) I went to work and overheard three coworkers saying that my perfume smelled awful. This made me feel really bad and made me not want to ever wear it again. I don't want people I meet/network with to think I smell awful as a first impression. I told my boyfriend what happened and he got very upset with me, saying I shouldn't care about their opinions because if I like his gift I should just wear it. I feel really bad for asking him to return it. I just figure we could use the money if I'm not going to wear it. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "**This is a repost because I needed to add more info**\n\nMy grandad was in the hospital and a ton of family/friends had been in and out. My dad’s girlfriend was constantly there, even when my dad was at work or off doing something. I was there too. I’ll call her Betty. Betty had helped my grandad out a lot with grocery shopping and stuff. I think she really cared about him. \n\nSince she was always there and other people were in and out, I never got a chance to have alone time with my grandad while he was in the hospital. At this point, he couldn’t talk or move but he could still hear what we would say to him.  I wanted some time to tell him how much I love him and how much I’ll miss him, etc. I didn’t feel comfortable doing all of that with my dad’s girlfriend there. We have never been close even though she has been around for 4 or so years.\n\nI didn’t want to ask her to leave so I texted my dad and asked him to. He told her that I wanted some alone time with my grandad. He told her that she could stay (that’s all I know about their conversation over text). She confronted me about it and I told her I wanted some time to talk to my grandad and she said “Your dad said I could stay and I have the right to be here. I’m\nNot leaving.” I was annoyed and raised my voice a tad and said, “I would really like some space right now since my grandad is dying. I want to talk to him without anyone in here.” She refused to leave and just sat in the room with me not talking. So I waited it out until my dad got there (4-5 hours later). It felt like my dad or Betty didn’t trust me to take care of my grandad. I’m 20 and I could’ve taken care of him by myself. I had been there for a few days straight (sleeping there) and had watched the nurses and my dad take care of him. \n\nI spoke to him privately and told him I wanted some time with my grandad. I was crying because I didn’t think I was going to have any alone time with my grandad. I also wanted some time with my dad alone too with my sister (some family time). I didn’t want her to leave all together, just for an hour or 2 so we could have some time. I think he understood so he ended up asking her to leave. She left and she broke up with him the day of the funeral. She was mad that he asked her to leave. \n\nAITA? I think she was being inconsiderate. \n\n",

There's always drama, awkwardness with asking for money, property destruction in some cases. We've been on our own for 3 years now in our new home and our lives have been amazing compared to the tough years past.\n\nHer brother (who's been known to steal and do coke) asked to crash at our place for a week while he's in town. It's been 4 years since he was last with us, so maybe he's gotten better. My wife wants us to give him a chance.\n\nI got upset. Probably more than I should have. I insisted he find somewhere else to go. I just have a very bad feeling in my gut... and I can't let it go. My wife and I work such opposite schedules as well, and this weekend is the only one in 3 weeks that we have off together.\n\nSo my wife's mad at me, and I feel like an ass for denying him... AITA?",

Apparently it was a question that many people had gotten wrong. So, I got a 91%, but since my mom is really strict about grades, I had to do math problems for a while after. But, after showing him the question, he said that he couldn't read the answer. Maybe that would have been okay, but my answer's work also had the answer written right next to it, and he said he could read that fine. Math period ended and I left the class. The following day, I asked him whether or not I had to correct it. He said that it was highly improbable that he would have missed both the answer and the work of that problem. Also, my handwriting was a problem on 1 test only before, and he asked me and resolved the question. I feel like I'm sort of overreacting but I also want a 2nd opinion. ",

I have absolutely no problem with other people doing this for themselves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn to the actual story:\n\nA while back someone uploaded a picture of me after promising me they wouldn't (the reason I agreed, as stated above), and I confronted them. Argument ensued, and in the end it ended up being deleted (but is it ever really?) after a lot of bullshit thrown at me that \"it isn't a big deal\" and \"everyone does it\" and a non-apology.\n\nI ended up explaining my reasoning: It's not so much that people see it but that I do not wish to support businesses that thrive by selling user data.\n\nPerson below was a witness to these events.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little while later (few weeks, tops) I agreed to being in a photo because the person asking is someone I care about and I knew it would make them happy. Same condition: No uploading, no Facebook.\n\nThis was agreed to, but I just found out that while they have refrained from posting it to a status, they have been sending it around using Messenger, saying it is not the same as 'putting it on Facebook'.\n\nI get that this might not be the same thing from their POV, but to me it essentially is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth people in above stories were aware of my views on social media and photos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that this is seen as normal stuff, and I do understand that most people do this freely and make no problem of it.\n\nAnd yet, I can't shake feeling betrayed, even if it's something as stupidly meaningless as a photo, and even if they (thought they) were following our agreement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for getting upset about this?",

      "description": "My daughter is 9 and just started going to a new school in January because we moved. It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason.\n\nAnyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her “But you’re not Chinese. You shouldn’t lie.” My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class.\n\nI was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. \n\nA few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a “time out” for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. \n\nAt this point it was affecting my daughter’s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they’re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great.\n\nFlash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, “Well Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.”\n\nI was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me.\n\nI also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can’t help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn’t feel bad.\n\nAITA though? I feel so so horrible knowing that she cannot support her 4 kids anymore partially because of my complaint against her.\n\n\n",

      "description": "So to simplify a lot of back story, my SO has been going to this bar in our city for over a decade. I've been dating my SO about 2 years. We both know the owners and bartenders and regulars and were even at the house of one of the bartenders for superbowl Sunday. Everything has always been pretty good.\n\nToday we were day drinking at the bar with a bartender he has known for YEARS and I've known a while. She asked my SO to open the door to the bar as he was coming in from a smoke. He complied. Immediately, the couple that had been sitting next to us closed the door and started talking shit (we live in LA, it's like 60F, not that cold, and sunny, they said things like \"fuck this, Wtf, close the fucking door\") and my SO made a comment \"oh *bartender's name* asked us to open that\" when they closed the door. His intention was to let them know he'd been asked to prop open the front door. The bartender in question said we could open the other door that is farther down the bar if it's a problem. Then she went to the back. She didn't hear what these people had to say about us.\n\nThe guy next to me immediately started going off about how he offended \"these fucking bikers\" (we had riden our bicycles) and that it's time for them to go because us fucking bikers control everything. At this point my SO is protesting that we weren't trying to dictate the conditions of the bar, but were just listening to the bartender (our friend) who asked us to open the door. The guy next to me calls my SO a liar for dragging the bartender into it, and says it's past their curfew and it's time to go. My SO does egg him on because we both thought we were in the right and he was overreacting. (\"*bartender name* asked me to open the door but if it's SUCH a big deal then close it\") \n\nThe bartender had been in the back for most of the bantering and when she came out, it felt like she sided with this stranger. She did say she never wanted the door open and that the owner was in the bar and asked her to open the door, so she wasn't really responsible. \"shit rolls downhill\" was her exact quote. Our (I thought) friend was nearby and witnessed the whole thing and told off my SO after the stranger left for picking a fight with a guy bigger than him? (my SO is 5'x6' and 140lbs this stranger was like 6' and bulky). AITA for feeling like no one had our backs in that situation? The bartender has been my SO's friend for a decade and always sweet to me but her reaction was to say she didn't even want the door open and both parties \"are super nice guys\". Our bystander friend said my SO should never speak up for himself against a guy that can kick his ass in a bar setting. We're both fuming and I just want to know if we're in the wrong for this.",

      "description": "Hi there, I'm French so it might be a bit difficult to understand everything I say.\n\nSo, with just the title I bet you're thinking I'm an asshole but wait a bit please.\n\nMy girlfriend of 5 years and I broke two weeks ago. We were living in a city where she is currently studying at the uni and I was studying on my own for a competitive examination to work for my country customs.\n\nThere is various reasons for use to break up, mostly a lack of communication, not the same vision of what a relationship should be like and a lot of stress for a both of us. Anyway, the break up is fairly difficult for me and apparently not so much for her ( I wouldn't know she refuse to speak with me) so I drove six hours yesterday to our place to gather as much stuff as I can ( I left to my parents place three weeks ago when things got ugly) and had a conversation with her.\n\nSo I don't need to stay in this city, I can work at my parents home, and tbh I don't like the city anyway. She, on the other hand, has to stay because of her uni. She is obviously keeping the flat, but she is asking me to keep paying my share of the rent for the next three months, the time needed to break the lease. By the way, my name is not the lease because I'm not legally a student and got no job.\n\nSo here is my question, imta if I stop paying the rent ? I never wanted the break up and it came out of nowhere. She decided to completely cut me out of her life so I don't think it's fair from her to keep asking the rent money, if the situation was the other way I wouldn't ask her. We've bought together nearly everything we own like the fridge or the washing machine and I'm letting her keep everything without asking any money or anything and I think it's enough to not have to give her anything else.",

      "description": "TLDR: live-in girlfriend of almost two years ghosted me on my 40th birthday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story:\n\nI came home from work Thursday night ready to kick off a three day celebration of my 40th birthday (that Friday).  My GF, who is prone to up and downs, highs and lows, starts unloading a pile of worries and burdens on me the minute I walk in the door.  I immediately feel like she's raining on my birthday parade.  I tell her I don't have space to hold all this \"stuff\" for her right now and that I'm going to take a walk.\n\nI return from my walk with dinner and ready to give this another try to listen to her worries without letting it affect my mood.  She immediately starts in on me again when I get back.  \n\nI shut down.  Tell her I can't believe this is how she's kicking on my birthday weekend and that I'm going to bed.  She ends up sleeping on the couch.\n\nNext morning, she's gone before I get up.   I don't hear from her all day, even though we had plans to spend the day together getting lunch and seeing an exhibit at the museum I wanted to see.\n\nShe finally arrives home around 4 o'clock.  She chose to got to work for a bit, then do laundry at the laundromat rather than uphold our plans.  I drove by the laundromat twice and her car wasn't there, so she chose somewhere other than our usual spot to do laundry and not be found.  \n\nShe says sorry, but it feels clinical.  There's no remorse.\n\nWhile i believe couples will fight, I also think there are situations that no matter what little spats you're in, the bigger picture prevails.  This was one of those days.\n\nIt's Sunday and she still has yet to tell me Happy Birthday.\n\nTonight I'm going to ask her to move out.\n\nAITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "For starters I dont use reddit very much so I'm sorry if I'm a bit out of the loop on things. I also apologize because this story is LONG.\n\nBefore we begin this story, I'll tell you about the main people: \n\nMe- a 20 y/o guy who is basically the mediator between my grandmother and my mother since I'm the \"good kid\"\n\nOlder brother(OB for this story)- A 22 y/o redneck who is very bad with money and has just had a baby with his girlfriend\n\nMother(Mom)- A 38 y/o mom who had her kids taken away when we were young due to her drug abuse. She cleaned herself up and now lives with my great grandmother (Granny) taking care of her.\n\nGrandmother(Gma)-Gave up her future life to raise us kids when our mother was battling drug abuse. Some of the kids still live with her\n\n\nSo to start off with, I have many siblings (all half) but I'm only close with the 4 that are on my moms side. OB was living in a camper (which is like a mobile home but twice as small) behind Gma's house when he found out that his gf was pregnant with his kid. OB is shitty with money, he usually spends his paycheck the day he gets it and asks to borrow money afterwards. He would spend it on stuff like guns and things off FB and Craigslist that he would just sell in a week for less than he bought it. Before the baby was born, Mom and Granny (this is Gma's mom) decided to buy the baby about $1000 worth of baby stuff. They then offered for OB and his to stay at their house when the baby was born because the camper wasnt a suitable place to live period. The door was coming off, animals have died in there, it was just disgusting beyond repair. When the baby was born, mom started to obsess over the baby. She would hold it more than OB and his gf would and she would always call it \"HER grandbaby\".\n\n I already knew that OB and Mom living together would be a problem. See, OB is a big guy, about 6'2 and was husky, but it was completely muscle. He always threw a fit over everything, partially because he had ADD and ADHD but also because he was used to a lot of privellages from working for my grandfather. When he would throw a fit, he would yell and scream and get in your face and try to make you back down. We've dealt with this so much that we knew he'd calm down as long as you stood your ground and let him vent. He never hit any of us in those kinds of fits but he always looked like he was going to break you in half if you dared to smart off.\nMom, on the other hand, was different. She was like a manager 24/7. She is always super cool about a lot of stuff and is generally fun to be around as long as you respected the place and everyone in it. If you didnt, it was like a switch was flipped in her brain. The way she dealt with conflict was like \"Its my way or the highway, and if you didnt like it, you better square up. Because nobody is going disrespect me or Granny on Granny's own property\". She would look at you with a piercing look and refused to back down to anyone. She'd tell you in a very commanding voice, only raising it to express emphasis on words (ex. Don't you DARE talk to her like that in HER own home). And yeah, she doesnt back down from anyone. She'd tell someone off twice her size if she thought they were in the wrong without a second thought.\nNeedless to say, they were a bad match to live together.\n\nAnyway, this next part is the incident that tore our family apart. Keep in mind that I heard variations of this story from OB, Mom, and OB's gf, and pieced together what actually happened.\n\nOB had found a few chickens for sale on craigslist for about $40 and asked Granny and Mom if he could make a coop for them to lay eggs. Mom and Granny talked about it and decided against it, since they were buying dog food for his 3 dogs and didnt like that he beat the dogs. They made up some excuse to tell him \"no\" gently so he wouldn't throw a fit and cause problems. The excuse was \"I don't like chickens\" which was a poor excuse, but most people could tell that it meant no. He didnt. The next day he was getting supplies outside to start building a pen for the chickens when Granny saw what he was doing and asked him what was going on. She said something like \"I thought your mom said we didnt want chickens\". At this, he started throwing a fit.\nGranny has about 230 acres of land that is mostly woods, and OB was promised a part of the land. He was already starting to build his own house there and that's where he was going to put the chicken pen. The problem is that the deed to that land wont be his until he's 27. Granny and Mom said that he can build on it, but it was still their land until then.\nOB was throwing a fit, collecting things in the house because he \"was moving out. He was tired of all the bs and not being able to do what he wanted on HIS PROPERTY\". Ganny was trying to calm him down and reason with him (\"Where will you go? That house isnt even built yet, you should work on that first\", etc.) \nHe wasnt having it. Still collecting his and the babies stuff, he was saying things like \"that's my property and I cant do anything\" and \"Its just a couple of fucking chickens, what's the big deal\".\nAt this point Mom just got home from work. Her husband, who was there while all this happened, started trying to explain what was going on while OB was cramming stuff into his truck. When she got enough of an explanation, she went over to OB and tried to reason with him, not for his sake, but for the babies. Saying stuff like \"you've got nowhere to go, we have everything you need for that baby right here. I dont care if you go, but that baby needs to stay here.\"\nOB was already furious, there was no reasoning with him. He started to get in Moms face yelling about how \"ITS MY PROPERY, I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT\". Getting as close to mom as possible without touching her and staring down at her. Mom started to yell back at him saying \"This is GRANNYS property, not yours! Granny said she doesnt want chickens, and what SHE says Goes!\"\nThey keep arguing like this, as OB  takes a step forward and Mom takes one back. More arguing. OB: Another step forward trying to intimidate\nMom: Another step back still arguing\nAt this point Mom has her back against the front of her SUV, bending slightly backwards. OB is still as close as he can be, without touching her, in her face and yelling. Mom goes into \"Fight or flight\" mode, and she'll be damned if she runs from ANYBODY at her own house.\nShe punches him in the jaw and keeps hitting him over and over. I'm sure she got some good licks in, but OB is built like a bull. He grabs her by the neck and slams her against the car, not aggressively like he wants to hurt her (though I'm sure he probably wanted to) but to get her to stop hitting him. She screamed for him to let her go and he yelled that he would when she stopping hitting him. His girlfriend, who was outside with them the whole time, had to get inbetween them and break them apart. He started to walk towards the house, probably to get the rest of his stuff and leave, but Mom wasnt having it. She thought that he was going inside to beat up on granny or something. As he got to the front door, she ran infront of him and told him to leave the property and never come back.\nHe, with his gf and baby, left with whatever they had and went to Gma's house.\n\nNow Gma was the one who raised us kids when our mom left. That was our home. When OB moved out to the camper behind the house, we had enough room for each kid to have their own room. Right now, OB, his gf and the baby are sleeping in the living room.\n\nThe problem that this post is referring to, lies here.\n\nGma and Mom have been rivaling ever since Mom came to live and take care of Granny. Rumors, whispers, and gossip have been talked about each other for a few years now. When they're out in public together, they seem just fine. But when I go visit either one of them, it's nothing but gossip and spite. I'm the one who always meditates whatever's happening and have brought them together and talked things out multiple times.\n\nThink about that for a sec. A 20 y/o counseling his 38 y/o Mom and 57 y/o Grandmother.\n\nGma's problem is that she thinks Mom has been abusing painkillers and isnt in her right mind. She's watching as Mom has ruined her relationship with my sister (that's a different story) and now OB. She knows mom wont get herself help and she's scared Mom is gonna go down the same path as before. Shes also mad that Mom is continuously spreading lies about her to everyone and is making Gma look bad. But what Gma's most upset about is that Mom refuses to believe that both Mom and OB were in the wrong, and refuses to apologize. \nMom is mad at OB, obviously, but Mom is more mad with Gma.\nMom believes that OB is completely at fault here, and she has no blame. She believes that Gma is taking OB's side on the whole situation. Mom has made it a \"You're either with me or against me\" situation and refuses to listen to anyone about it.\n\n I've talked to both Gma and Mom separately and both of them have budged very little on anything. Gma would at least listen to what I had to say and acknowledge my take on everything. She wouldnt budge, but at least she would listen. Anytime I tried to give my point of view to Mom, she would get mad and talk over me and tell me that \"SHE wasnt in the wrong at all, and Fuck Gma and everyone else who helped OB. They can rot in hell\". I know she was just being emotional at the time, but that's what she said.\n\nI know that I should smooth everything out between Gma and Mom and hope that one day OB and Mom will forgive one another. I've done this multiple times and I'm honestly tired of it, I hate drama as it is. AITA for just leaving the situation alone?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "description": "Next year my younger brother will be taking an honors English class with the same teacher I had 2 years ago. The curriculum remains the same every year and every class reads the same books every year and they write the same essays every year. Knowing this I gave my brother all of my notes for the class to help him out. He knows how to annotate the books so it’s not like I’m robbing him of the opportunity to learn something new. When I took the class taking notes on the book was just tedious work that taught me nothing. I’m just saving him hours worth of time. Some girl in his grade has confronted me and told  me I’m giving my brother an unfair advantage against the other students. The teacher doesn’t curve tests so I don’t see how him doing well will affect her. Him doing well in one subject probably isn’t enough to disrupt the class rank. While it’s likely he’ll never have to take notes for the rest of the year, he’ll still have to study the ones I gave him and do extra work when it comes to projects. He’s my brother and I feel like if I can help him then I should.",

The record is we’ve had their package for 6 days and it was only that short because my wife caved and delivered it to them. \n\nIt’s happened about 10 times now.

      "description": "I couldn't really think of a better title than what it currently is, but it will make sense when i get into the story. So i'm a high school student in my senior year, I take the bus to school everyday, and won't turn 18 for another few months. So long as i pass my driver's test tomorrow, i will have my license. Even though i can't drive, i have a part time job as a fast food chain very close to my house. I got a job on my own accord because i wanted to save for a car for college.\n\nOn my way home from work today my dad was driving me and told me that him and my mom were going to buy my sister's car off of her. The car my sister has is actually their old car that they sold to her when she was in her senior year of highschool, at the time, she had no job, and didnt get one until after she graduated. She did buy the car off of them, but payments for it didnt start until months after she \"owned\" it. My sister has wanted to upgrade for awhile but the trade-in value is not what she wanted, so my parents decided to buy it and have another car. You see, my family is fairly well off, especially for the area we're in, so my mom has a very nice new car, and my dad has a truck for his work, so in general, they don't really need another car. When they told me they were going to buy my sister's car off of her I immediately thought they were going to then sell it to me, but i was wrong.\n\nMy dad basically laid 3 conditions for me using the car:\n1. I couldn't to drive to school instead of taking the bus. \n2. I'd pay for the gas i use (My dad is really observant and i wouldn't be surprised if he kept some sort of track of how much gas is in the car)\n3. I'd have to pay 50% of the insurance for the car\n\nI think with my hours i could afford it and still have spending and saving money, however, what annoys me, is that i have no doubt they aren't buying this car for more than 3k, and i already have over 1k saved up, so why couldn't they just up sell the car to me. Would it be an asshole move to basicly deal a car for profit between your two children? Yeah, but it's better than not having a car and paying a toll to use an EXTRA car.\n\nI'm really angry about this situation, but i know that there are kids who don't ever get a license before they're 18, don't have a car to use, and don't have the opportunities from my parents that I have. So am AITA for thinking they're being assholes?",

      "description": "Hello. My recent ex and I aren’t longer seeing each other due to many differences in opinion. I wasn't willing to change my perspective and neither was she, which accumulated at once I suppose.\n\nI was her supervisor’s boss in a medium technology firm for about a year, and we hit it off in a business trip. I knew she was part of my division, but I didn't take the effort to get to know her. Though, We only started dating a few months post trip since we were never in the same country. I left the company as per my arrangements and now am in a new city about an hour from hers. \n\nShe constantly complained about how I only spend weekends with her, didn't let her have a sugar daddy (I have expensive tuition), didn't like her drinking/taking E, or liking her scandalous photos. She didn't like how my interests were too mainstream and basic, and would always tell me that she didn't see us together since I wasn't her type.\n\nInitially, she was always telling me how we shouldn't be a couple, but I told her we should date a bit and see. Afterwards, when demands/requests/disagreements started, I didn't want to be together, and I told her, so she went to a club or something, and got mad when I was upset she was about to hook up with someone, since I pushed her.\n\nThen, and this is the worst, I told her I didn't like her public photo where she dressed in a very exposed and explicit manner (not simple bikini) and kissing her bisexual friend for pride (she is also bisexual). This happened before we were together, but I didn't know not liking something like this made me a homophobe. \n\nI read other posts before this, and I will say that I'm not perfect by any means. I have been cold a cold and manipulative person, heartless, you name it, but I didn't grow up with emotion so I never developed any. She has maybe too much, and relies on Tinder compliments instead of me since I don't give as much or validate her I think. \n\nAMTA for not reaching out to her after I argued with her for her behaviour? I told her multiple times about my concerns, but the last time I was a bit more rude and therefore labelled as having lack of style, cold, homophobe, etc. ",

      "description": "This one's a bit confusing, but I'll try my best to explain it all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's this guy who we'll call T. T and I have been really good friends for around 3 years now. Over those years we've had some complications, but we got over those and remained good friends. Here's where it gets slightly complicated - I was apparently his first 'really good friend', and that's fine by me. However, because of this he would get incredibly jealous of everyone I talked to. He wouldn't make it noticeable, but after I was done talking with that person he would pull me aside and tell me how he would appreciate it if I didn't. \n\nThis went on for a bit, until it got worse by me meeting a nice girl and going out with her a few times. T completely lost his shit. I got back from a nice date to find nothing but angry texts blowing up my phone. That should have been a major red flag for me, but I just saw it as him looking out for me. \n\nFast forward a few months, things didn't work out between me and the girl, and T and I are back to normal. Now comes more drama. I have the audacity to talk to a girl again, and T completely loses it once more. I try to explain to him that that girl is also one of my good friends, but he's not having it. The whole night my phone is blowing up again, and I decide to ignore him. The next day, I just act as if everything is normal, because I didn't want to put up with his shit. \n\nThat was around a year ago. Since then, it has gotten much worse. Just about everything I do results in me being yelled at by this guy, and he starts to enforce more and more rules, because apparently I broke his trust by talking to someone of the opposite sex. That all goes 'well' for a bit, until I manage to find love a second time under T's domain. This erupts into a full-blown rift. His crony friends are all taking his side, and everyone with common sense is taking mine. Somehow his friends win, and I'm left single and broken. \n\nStockholm syndrome gets to me, and I decide to give him one last chance. Fast forward to yesterday; we both were doing some volunteer work at the local zoo, and decided to talk a bit during the break. He began to get on the offense and bash me about talking to another friend of mine. I was completely fed up and cussed him out about how stupid his rules were, and how he shouldn't be such an untrustworthy little bitch. I then proceeded to get on my bike and immediately go home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a bit of extra background; I'm not trying to karma farm by asking if I'm an ass by putting another ass in their place. T was mostly a very nice guy, and we did have a lot of fun together. It was just those fights and rules that really set me off. Another thing, T was quite insecure and mentally unstable at times, and I'm questioning whether my cussing him out might have affected any of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?",

This is the second assigment and it is due tommorrow and is do’able in one day \n\n\nThe class consists of about 12 students and we are all some kind of friends, and i am the kind of the class nerd, (not that much) but about 10 of the 12 students are similar to me \n\n\nSo for the first assigment i was glad to give it to the students and all of them just copy pasted it exactly because at the begining of the class the Doctor clearly said that she is fine with the students “cheating” on their assigments, and when we submitted the first assigment everybody got above 9/10 \n\n\nNow here is the problem, A week after the first assigment there was a quiz, that was exactly the same assigment, the problem is that 2 students failed that easy quiz, the teacher knew they copied it from me and it made me feel stupid (for them) yet the teacher gave 0 fucks \n\n\nThe problem is that even those who didnt study at all passed becuase if you just bothered to read the assigment it would’ve been enough\n\n\nSo same senario is emerging here, second assigment and a second quiz similar to it,\n\nI was thinking not to share my answers, but I believe that these 2 students wont do it and lose 10% of the total wieght \n\nYet, i would share the question pages in the book (since I know some students didnt bother to buy the 30$ book) and be willing to help anyone who have a question just that I will not gove direct answers \n\nWIBTA if I didnt share the second assigment with everybody? \n\n* assigment = homework",

      "description": "Because this shits been eating me up\n\nSo my GF and I are best friends. We love each other, have fun, spend time together often and don’t tend to keep much from each other. I’ve been having difficulties with her depression though. Now, I damn well knew what I was signing up for because she basically told me she has depression and other problems that can eat at her. I have them too, but hers can be worse. She has PTSD, depression, anxiety and dysmorphia(undiagnosed) \n\nSo depression hasn’t been much of a problem, I can deal with days, weeks even of her being in an awful place. It’s almost nice because she trusts me during those times and seeks comfort from me... I wish I could make it all go away but the best I can do is just be there. \n\nMy biggest problem has been our sex life recently. The first year of the relationship we could’ve gone just about every single day having sex... I wasn’t expecting that to last to be honest but things have really flipped. Now we barely do so much as touch each other and it’s really because of her. I’m still extremely attracted to her but she says she’s just not sexually active right now because of how she views herself mixed with depression... I tried to understand for a while but when weeks turns to months you really start to doubt yourself. I don’t feel attractive anymore. She assured me it’s not my fault, and I’ve basically said all of this to her before and we’ve “gotten through it” but it just eats at me. \n\nI feel unwanted, ugly, fat and whatever the hell else my beautiful mind can come up with. I don’t think she’s cheating  mainly because she spends almost all of her free time with me and I truly do trust her... but I just can’t help but wonder if I’m being an asshole for expecting sex from her. I’m at the point where I’m shorter tempered with her, less interested in seeing her and just feel upset with her because of this. \n\nI don’t know what to really do... she says she wants to “respark” our love life and do something nice but It’s been a couple weeks since that was really spoken of. We’ve had sex maybe twice during this dry spell and it didn’t seem bad but now I just can’t help but feel like she just did it out of pity. \n\nHas anyone else had to deal with this? Am I an asshole for, despite knowing her mental problems, expecting a sex life? I’m at the point where I want to spend time with her but I don’t at the same time because I feel like I’m just making myself more upset. It’s not just the sex that’s upsetting, it’s the feeling of being unwanted. ",

      "description": "## WIBTA for not paying my abusive parents back money I owe them?\n\n📷\n\nI feel like I might be the asshole but genuinely want others opinions bc I'm struggling with this decision. On one hand I think you should always honor your word but on the other hand I really don't want to speak with my parents, and also am struggling with how much I owe them given how completely they failed me. I'm leaning towards paying but curious to see what others would do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents took out parent plus loans for my college. My name isn't on them but I agreed to pay them back. I've been unemployed due to mental illness (depression and ptsd) but have gotten back on my feet and just started working again. So I was thinking I would start making payments to them. It's 25k and the last time I spoke to my mom I think she said she paid $150 a month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe complicating issue is I am no contact with my parents since they're unstable. In the past they have refused to give me the loan number/info so I can only make payments through them (correct me if I'm wrong though). I really don't want to be in contact with them in any way so that's why this is giving me pause. Someone told me since my name isn't on the loans I won't be in trouble legally but idk if that's true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome context for when I say abusive: hit me in the face, back of the head, constant verbal abuse, allowed me to be around people who were known dangers to children unsupervised, where I was assaulted, told me I was making it up/crazy when I told, kicked me out when I came out to them (age 18), threatening to beat us and occasionally got into altercations with my siblings to the point where I had to physically remove my siblings to a safe locked room, etc etc. also chronic substance abuse/alcoholism which wasn't fun to deal with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTldr; I agreed to pay my parents back, but they also abused me my whole life, so can I call it even? Or should I pay them?",

      "description": "36M who recently proposed to my girlfriend (33F). We are in town for the holidays visiting her parents who have been very generous to let us stay in their vacation home an hour by car outside of town. There’s a train that goes into town but most days fiancé’s parents will drive us back and forth into town. Some nights her parents will stay in the vacation home with us, other nights they have their regular home in town so they’ll just drop us off at the vacation home at night, hang out for a bit before heading back into town, then come back out in the morning to drive us into town. \n\nAll has been generally fine, my fiancé’s parents are the absolute nicest people and we get along well. But being in my 30’s especially, I appreciate having a little independence. So rather than being driven around by my fiancé’s parents back and forth from the vacation home, I’ve suggested to my fiancé that we take the train to and from town which takes an extra hour maybe each way.\n\nThe other day as my fiancé and I were on our way back from town on the train, her parents called her and insisted on picking us up from the next train station to drive us back to the vacation home. I told my fiancé that I much rather just stay on the train and walk, I didn’t like sitting in the back of a car in general, and to let them know we’re ok staying on the train. But despite my fiancé’s efforts to tell them that we’re fine and already on a train, her parents persisted (almost getting angry at my fiancé at one point) so my fiancé gave up and told me we had to get off at the next station where her parents were waiting for us. I was annoyed and unsure how to approach the situation, so just sat silently on the car ride home. My fiancé tried explaining to her parents that they were being controlling and her parents cheerfully apologized, but I could see that they found it strange to be apologizing for what they felt was them just being accommodating.\n\nThen the next day, my fiancé had plans to hang out with her parents for the day so I went over to a cousin’s place in town to spend time with him and his family. Later that evening, my fiancé messaged me to let me know that her and her parents would be coming by at 9 pm to pick me up from my cousin’s to take us back to the vacation home. I asked if they could just drop her off at my cousin’s as we were having a nice time catching up, and her and I could find our own way home later. \n\nThat turned out to not be an option, and again my fiancé’s parents insisted on taking us back. I was again annoyed but conceded, and again expressed my annoyance by not saying a word on the ride home. Her parents tried to act as though nothing was wrong. When we got back to the vacation home they offered me food they had cooked but my annoyance at being treated like a child got the best of me and I just excused myself and went to bed early.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting a little flexibility with my time and my fiancé’s time when we’re on vacation? I understand that some parents will always see their kids as children no matter how old they are, but I felt especially annoyed when I was forced to cut short my time with my cousin who I only see once a year because it was apparently “bedtime.” On the other hand, I am so thankful to have in-laws who accept me as one of their own, as I’ve had ex-girlfriends whose parents didn’t like me for whatever reason and I’m thankful to be not dealing with trying to win approval. \n\nTL;DR: On holiday in my fiancé’s hometown. Fiancé’s parents are overly accommodating and can come off as controlling. On the other hand, fiancé’s parents are genuinely the nicest most generous people you’ll ever meet so I feel bad for coming off as being ungrateful for their hospitality. \n\n",

      "description": "So, I met my girlfriend a bout 16 months ago. When we first got together it was super casual, and I we were talking about having a threesome, but it never happened. After a few months we started getting more serious and she got upset when I brought up the threesome thing again. She said she didn't want to do it in Russia (where we lived) but said we could do it when we got to Cambodia. Now we're in Cambodia and she asked me what porn I watch while wanking and I said it is usually threesome stuff. She got really upset and I tried to avoid the conversation by suggesting we go to the gym.  \n\n\nShe explained the reasons she feels hurt about it and we've had the same conversation several times. She asked if having a threesome was more important than her and I said yes, after some thought. She's really upset and has every right to be. I also think I've been pretty up front about this during our whole relationship, so I'm not sure if I am the asshole. I love her a lot and want to experience new and exciting things with her, but this doesn't seem to be something she's willing to do.",

      "description": "Title doesn't quite describe the full story. So a bit of background. I'm 25 and gf is 30. Been together seven months. We've had our arguments but we've grown because of some of them and to me she is like no other.\n\n\nA week ago she left her wallet on a train, subsequently got it back later that night but cancelled all her cards in the interim. Today rolls round and the new ones haven't turned up, which is extremely frustrating for her obviously and most of us know what this is like I'm sure. Sunday night I hired a car for a few hours for valentines so I could take her to a quiet beach that evening and chill with a bit of food and wine. Something where she doesn't have to do anything except turn up - I had it all organised. I'm not sure whether she was clear that's what I wanted to do for her, just take care of her for the night but we talked about what I had in mind.\n\n\nShe mentions her cards haven't turned up and she'll see me next week, in what to me was a fairly conclusive tone. I said it sucks because I was really looking forward to it with her but maybe we can redo it when her cards turn up since that's stressing her. She asked me whether I'd really booked then felt a little bad when I said yeah (the car doesn't matter, it was only hired for a few hours and I didn't have to trade an organ for it exactly). I wanted to call her in the next day or two (we don't talk on the phone overly often, but on occasion) and she says I've bummed her out and we'll see. I say if this is about the car it's no biggie. She flies off the handle here, and calls me beyond clueless then tells me a normal partner would have said \"no babe, I want to see you. I'll look after you\".\n\n\nNow to me I felt it was pretty clear that I wanted to see her. Who doesn't want to see the person they love and adore? I could be wrong here though of course.

      "description": "Ok, for context. I’m a high school senior taking the IB diploma(essentially all advanced classes) and the IB coordinator hosts an annual sushi party for the IB DP seniors to celebrate being done with our big projects. I brought a cake to contribute since it’s very quick to make and I’ve been complimented on it before(there wasn’t an obligation to bring anything but I felt like I haven’t been particularly sociable with the other DP candidates before and I felt like an asshole for various accumulated slights in the past, but that’s another several stories). \n\nSo I arrive on time at 11:00 with the cake and everything goes smoothly until the scheduled time to leave(2:00), when things were still going strong and I’d lost track of time. At 2:16 my parent knocks on the door seeming concerned and frustrated, then returns to the car at my request. I know this was rude of me, especially once I checked my phone to find several text messages and a missed call from them. The host invites them in but they decline. I talk briefly with the host and estimate that finishing the current game and serving the cake would take about another 30 minutes. I get another text from my parent asking if I can get a ride home, and after I check I find nobody lives particularly close to me to drop me off. \n\nSo I take a piece of cake and leave the house only to find once outside my parent tells me I can stay. However I know they’ve already been waiting twenty minutes now and I don’t want to go back and cost everyone even more unnecessary time and effort than I already have, (not to mention solidifying how I’m certain I seem hopelessly wishy-washy to everyone already and wanted to at least actually commit to something), so I just ask to leave then and there.

      "description": "My boyfriend [M25] and I [F22] have been together for a little over a year now and he always tries to flake last minute when it has anything to do with hanging out with my family. I would let him know a couple days in advanced and he would agree to do so but when the day comes, he tries to find an excuse not to go. He does end up coming but he always dreads it but once he is there and we are there for a couple hours, when we leave, he’s like “oh that wasn’t too bad.” \n\nWe do come from different family backgrounds where I am pretty family oriented and close with my parents and extended family but he is not. My family really likes him and I tell him that all the time but he still dreads going. I just want to bring him to these things because it’s really important for me that my boyfriend wants to enjoy hanging out with my family as much as I  enjoy hanging out with his. ",

      "description": "It's gonna be a long one, but I really don't know how to feel about this and need some perspective. Tl;dr at the bottom.\n\n  \n\n\nSo a little introduction.\n\nI'm suffering from depression, and am taking medication for the past couple of months. I am dealing with the situation, and function better, but am not well yet. I'm 21.\n\n  \n\n\nThen there is my friend. Lets call her Debra. We met through our parents, and get along pretty well, but we don't see each other much. I did suspect for a while that she has a crush on me though. She's 18, and has never really had a boyfriend or any other romantic experience.\n\n  \n\n\nFast forward to new years eve. I had it planned pretty chill, with a couple of close frends, board games, burgers and not much else. Near midnight, three of us still decide to go to the city center and check out fireworks and couple of concerts that were going on. Anyway, on our way back we met a couple of people we knew, and among them was Debra. They were pretty tipsy, compared to us.\n\n  \n\n\nI stayed there and we got separated soon, as I was doing my best to catch up with my intoxication levels. After the concert has ended, we all kinda wanted to go home, and Debra had a pretty long way to go, so it was kinda decided by her friend, she's staying with me for the night, as it did get flirty between us. Which Debra and I didn't object to.\n\n  \n\n\n**Here comes the AITA part.**\n\n  \n\n\nWe get to my flat and I was a bit reluctant at first, as it didn't seem smart, even for a drunk me, and she was obviously nervous, but we ended up cuddling in my bed. I told her 'I can't promise much for tommorow, and it might get complicated, so I don't think it would be smart', but she was pretty entusiastic, even though nervous, and said we should continue. So we made out for a while, but nothing more. I made sure it didn't go too far and we were both ok with everything and it was consentual.\n\n  \n\n\nNext morning though, came the talk. I told her I am not capable of a relationship, and later also why, with my condition and everything. She was dissapointed but understood. We then talked a lot about my and her problems, unrelated to the incident, and it looks like it should be okay.\n\n  \n\n\nI still feel like an asshole tho.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n**Dillema**:\n\n  \n\n\nI've talked with my friends and most think I was kind of selfish, but ultimately NAH, and I'm overthinking this. We are both adults, were both drunk, we didn't even have sex. I didn't force or pressure her into anything, she wanted this and we talked later. That she is an adult, and my age and 'expirience' don't make me responsible for her actions.\n\n  \n\n\nPart of me still screams YTA. That I lead her on. That I used her, knew she was into me, and while I do like her, I knew nothing would follow. That I should've tell her that sooner or just not let her sleep in my bed. That I am using my depression as a 'get out of jail for free' card, and an exuse to do shitty things, even though I know better. I'm not sure, but that might have been her first kiss. And I would't want my first kiss to be like that. I feel like I lead her on, and then shattered the storytale she was living in.\n\n  \n\n\n**Tl;dr:**\n\nMet a friend for NYE that I knew is into me, flirted, and she spent the night. Didn't have sex, but did make out, which might have been the first time for her. Next day I told her I'm depressed and do not want any sort of a romantical relationship. She did. We talked and sorted it out but I think she is not as OK as she says.\n\nNow I feel like ansshole, but my friends say I'm not. Judge me.",

This means that she tends to sleep through my alarms. I usually avoid waking her up for at least a half-hour in the morning after I wake up. This is partially due to some past trauma with an ex, and partially due to her being very difficult to wake. Sometimes, I can pick her up and shake her, only for her eyes to roll back into her head as she turns limp in my arms and falls asleep! Some mornings, I just don't want to start the day off with that level of struggle.\n\nShe often complains that we wake up too late, but she won't set her own alarms to wake up to.\n\nI already know I should talk to her about it (and that not talking about it probably makes me the asshole,) but it's hard to find the words for it in the moment.\n\nSo.

      "description": "I’ve always had trouble making friends (long story short, childhood neglect and lack of proper socialization). I’ve improved a lot, but still struggle really connecting with people sometimes. I do have a few close friends, but unfortunately all but one have moved away for some fantastic career advancement opportunities. \n\nThe friend who stayed local (OG) made some new friends and we were having a hard time finding times to meet up because of her newly busy social schedule. She eventually started inviting me out to hang with this new group of friends. There’s 4 of them (plus OG) and they’re all very nice girls. \n\nIn the beginning I remember always being the last to know about things, and if we were trying to pick dates that worked for everyone, they would always pick dates that didn’t work for me if picking another date meant someone else couldn’t come.  I wrote it off as just being new and tried to go with the flow but I felt a bit rejected and unimportant. Whenever I went out to things, all was great.\n\nWell 3-4 years went by and I still felt like a last priority. I felt like other than perhaps one girl (D), I wasn’t really connecting with anyone individually despite having a great time whenever we all got together. I wasn’t upset with anyone over this or anything, sometimes you just don’t click. But it remained that I was always kind of invited as a tag a long and became painfully aware that the situation wasn’t changing as time went on. \n\nI started to realize that this maybe wasn’t the friend group for me if I constantly had these subtle unpleasant feelings of rejection.  I think I was putting far too much effort into and prioritizing people that weren’t doing the same. For instance, I’d always gotten everyone birthday gifts and/or helped plan birthday activities but one was never organized for me.\n\nThings actually started to improve a a little bit, with D in particular trying to ensure I was kept in the loop. But then one of the girls got engaged. As expected, everyone but me was asked to be a bridesmaid. Now I am super happy for her and would never expect to be chosen as a bridesmaid. But at the same time, it felt like an actual line had finally been drawn, and I had something tangible I could point to to confirm my feelings of being the “extra” friend in the group.\n\nSo while I have no hard feelings toward the bride to be, the selection was sort of the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. Whenever we were planning to get together, they would say how it would be a wonderful opportunity to discuss bridesmaid dresses, hair/makeup, etc. I understand the excitement, but I think I would feel super left out during those discussions being that I don’t have a bridesmaid dress and won’t be coordinating hair and makeup with them. \n\nSo I quietly stopped going to things. It was kind of upsetting at first, so I muted the chat group a few months ago, as whenever it popped up I got a little sad. \n\nI still see my OG friend and make a bit of an effort towards D. I just don’t want to go hang out with a tight knit group where I’m the only non-bridesmaid and the topic will inevitably come up and rub salt in the wounds. At the same time, I don’t want them to all secretly vow not to bring up the wedding planning in front of me. I understand that schedules don’t permit them to get together that often so of course they want to plan. I realize I’ve essentially made it an impossible situation to solve because of my “feelings”, and I’m okay with that. At this point, I just want to really focus on people who I feel value my company. The dynamic of this group just really didn’t provide for that. I still am super friendly to each of them if we ever run into each other, so I thought it was all okay, but maybe not.\n\nI’d heard talk that the bride-to-be was worried I was mad at her, but I always try to be friendly in the usual way if I run into her and through social media, etc. Later, OG even said the bride to be was considering making me MC. I think they realized the timing of my absence wasn’t a coincidence, so this was probably out of guilt, and unfortunately, I hate public speaking, but I did really appreciate the thought. But at this point (7-8 months later), I kind of felt like I had already resolved to move on. As I said, I think they’re all great individually, I just don’t feel I have a place in this right-knit group.\n\nAnyways, I missed in the group chat  that I had muted that they organized a get together and OG texted me to ask whether I was coming. She stated what the night would entail, and wedding-party related planning was on the agenda. I had been trying to keep my feelings quiet about the whole thing, because I didn’t want it to get back to the bride to be and upset her in any way but it seemed like that wasn’t working. So I told OG that I would pass this time because I think I would feel left out/out of place, but thanked her for taking the time check in and said we have to get together sometime soon.\n\nI haven’t heard back since. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

      "description": "Earlier in the week the mother of one of my son’s classmates came over to discuss a problem between our boys.  I guess my son has been telling her son that he stinks, is gross, and so on.  I told her I would talk to my son about it and we exchanged numbers in case there were any other problems.  \n\nI talked to my son and he didn’t deny it.  He says the boy does smell really bad and is assigned to sit next to him in one of their classes. I told him to just try to ignore it and just stay away from him otherwise.  \n\nLast night I got a call from the classmate’s mother saying that my son had picked on her’s again during lunch and that he was upset again.  I confronted my son about it and he said that her son has been purposely sitting across from him at lunch because he knows that it bothers my son.  \n\nI called the classmate’s mother back and told her what my son had said.  I told her that it’s not ok that my son was rude, but to be fair no one wants to smell bad hygiene while they’re trying to eat.  And also if her son was going to go out of his way to put himself in that position then maybe he should toughen up a bit. \n\nShe just hung up on me.  I don’t condone bullying and have talked to my son about it again, but at the same time I don’t feel my viewpoint on it is all that ridiculous. ",

It gets tiring and I want to curl up with a puzzle or Netflix and watch “Friends” not having to be “on” for people.\n\nNow I am visiting my parents (also sister and brother are also here) for Christmas. So far during the day my sister and mom and I like to go out and go shopping or visit my sisters dogs are staying in the same town but at a friends house(parents condo won’t allow big dogs), and I enjoyed that time. But after 6-8 hrs of being with them I want to hide in the guest room I’m staying in. I come out for dinner, and make a lovely conversation but then want to go right back. My mom gets REALLY offended by this. I hate making her upset but I want time by myself. It probably doesn’t help that I just spent a longer than usual run on tour constantly being around people, and interacting with them.\n\nFirst, am I the asshole? Or an asshole? It not like I don’t spend time with my parents, literally, like an entire work day with her and my sister is to be had everyday I’ve been here so far.

      "description": "TL;DR - I have about $50k in student loan debt after 3 degrees while my SO’s parents paid for his education 100%. He wants me to keep paying for it out of a separate checking account after we get married. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are looking to get engaged later this year. We’re trying to be responsible and have all of The Conversations you’re supposed to before you get married. We got to the finance part of that today. \n\nHe said unequivocally that all bills, utilities, and normal costs (groceries, car repairs, etc) should be paid from a joint checking account that we’ll open while engaged, but he’d consider keeping a separate account open for “spending money,” etc. I told him I wasn’t entirely comfortable with that - he’s extremely trustworthy, but that still feels secretive and too easy to make into a problem. He agreed that made sense so he wouldn’t but asked if I was keeping a separate account to keep paying for my student loans. I was shocked and a little hurt, to say the least. \n\nHe comes from an upper/upper middle class family who sent him to private school K-12 and paid for his college entirely. My parents are public school teachers so obviously they couldn’t do that for me, but I had a large part of undergrad covered with scholarships. I have two BAs and will finish grad school soon with a total debt of about $50k. Not great, but I know that’s still at or below average for our generation. \n\nHe said he’s uncomfortable paying for debt he didn’t accumulate and doesn’t want that “affecting credit scores and stuff.” (It’s worth noting his parents are pretty secretive about money, so his financial education is... lacking.) I can understand that in general, and it would be a different conversation if he’d had his own debt that he paid off solo. I also explained that I’m not expecting him to write a check from his own salary while I go blow my own pay on dumb stuff. I feel like I’m being held at arm’s length or looked down on because of a completely normal, if shitty, part of life that he was just lucky enough to avoid. \n\nAITA for looking at marriage this way - a total combination of everything, including all the baggage in all its forms? Does it matter that our situations are so disparate in this instance?\n\n\n",

      "description": "So a bit of context. I'm currently studying chemical engineering in the UK. For those of you who don't know, we're given loans by the government. This includes our tuition fees plus a maintenance fee that they give based on home financial situations. We don't see the tuition fee, it goes straight to the universities, however our maintenance fee is split into 3 drops throughout the year. Our last one for this year is due at the end of April.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the beginning of the year I became friends with a lad however as the years gone on we've basically stopped talking. He began the year saying he knew everything the lecturers were teaching as he'd done it the year before (apparently) and made out like the course was ridiculously easy. He failed miserably, surprisingly. I myself am struggling and I'm not bashing someone else for not being able to cope with the work but what I can't stand is that he made out like he was better than everyone else and to be honest, he made myself and a few other friends feel like maybe we weren't able to cope with the work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow he's decided that it's the lecturers fault (apparently their teaching is atrocious yet others are able to grasp it) and he'd like to change degrees for next year. Fair enough. Our course leader told him he'd have to attend classes and put in work otherwise not only would he not be able to carry on next year be he also won't receive his last payment from student finance. A few days ago I confronted him about it as he's still in our class Facebook group joining in discussions yet has turned up maybe 4-5 times max since January. He hasn't participated in any group work and has been one of the reasons why groups have been uneven. His response was that not only was it up to him when he turns up but also that he hadn't handed a form in to finalise his move to a different course, therefore his payment isn't cut off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy response was that it was people like him that were messing it up for the rest of us, to which he said he's still getting his money so he doesn't give a shit basically. I've got a few more friends that have decided to do the right thing and switched but aren't milking taxpayers money and are waiting till next year for their student finance to start again. As I didn't agree with it, I emailed our course leader about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis has just happened so I've not told anyone really and the two friends I have told agree with me however part of me still feels bad.

On top of that, it doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room for people who don't support these organizations, and makes people look bad if they choose not to donate on that basis.\n\nI pointed it out to some mutual friends who were also invited but they basically told me to shut up and just not go if I don't want to donate.

      "description": "Hi all. I live away from my family and see them roughly every couple of months. My grandfather used to be relatively well for someone of his age.   In the last couple of years hearing issues have started to set in; this makes having a conversation hard. He doesn’t always wear a hearing aid. A lot of conversations with him turn into a one way street.\n\nMy grandmother basically dumps him on the couch when she arrives at our place. No one else will actually stop to sit and chat with him except me. But the conversations lead nowhere. He means so well but he’s told me everything so many times. It’s very rarely offensive, just boring.\n\nHe’s had other health issues recently which aren’t immediately life threatening but they are a reminder of his mortality. I feel bad for resenting my grandfather for what is basically the expected result of old age. But I think my family doesn’t notice that he sits there, isolated and outside of the conversation, if no one else sits with him. So I pick up the burden of the conversation.\n\nSo AITA?",

He also snaps when you accidentally put too much force on certain areas of his body. By snapping I mean like a defense \"bite\" to know to back off. He's never landed a bite and dont think he intends to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it reasonable to ask a pet store for a grooming appointment?

I started rolling my eyes and preparing to leave; as i live with some of these guys and I do my best not to get political with them as i'm not going to win any 1 v 5 debates.\n\nThen a new guy to the group starts going on about how old people ruined everything and they shouldn't have a vote, and this pissed me off quite obviously as i'm close with my grandparents. I asked why he thought that and he said that they're going to die soon anyway so what does their opinion matter. I replied sarcastically that it was a good point and we should also take the vote away from the morbidly obese and even cancer patients as they probably wont be around as long either using his logic. I had no idea his brother had cancer and he got pretty pissed off and everyone said i went to far. I stated that what they hate about what i said is what disgusted me about what he originally said. Now this guys very heavy so it looks like i chose to mention obesity and cancer because they relate to him.\n\n   I see this guys quite a bit now as he's joined our society at uni, should i apologise to him or explain I had no idea about his brother.

He responded that it wouldn't be fair for them since me and (other roommate) have our own bathrooms and also reliable AC and heat (they have 2 AC units in their room and if it seems relevant at all for comfort/discomfort we live in florida and previous roommates have never complained about this) and still states he's fine splitting utilities down the middle though. \n\nOnly rented a handful of places before, so perhaps I'm the asshole here.

      "description": "So on Saturday a friend texted in our group chat  made for everyone in a specific class. We're a pretty small group, so the chat isn't particularly active outside of class days and is largely memes/teasing/asking about homework etc. The friend asked if anyone would be attending a month or two away upcoming event related to the class' subject, and nobody responded for a day. I don't know if this is common, but usually I have my group chats muted and this was no exception. I didn't see the text until a day later, by when the friend had also texted \"y'all fake\" since nobody had responded. I didn't register it as an important question (the next class is the day right after this) and responded with the Ariana Grande \"and what about it\" meme.  Once they responded a few hours later, I mentioned something else to the group (an idea) and didn't send an explicit no until about 5 min. later. I had already sent \"sorry :(\" but i understand if that wasn't clear. No one else had said a thing. \n\nThe person then complained that I had a phone so it shouldn't have been hard to just answer/ that they thought we were friends who could text. I apologized and explained that I had thought we had already talked about this, since an earlier in class conversation when I talked about not going. I also suggested that they text people individually because others probably have the chat muted like I do or thought it also wasn't addressing them. \n\nAt this point, I was getting a little embarrassed / conscientious of the fuss being made in front of the group and texted the person individually, saying I didn't realize the question was urgent/important to them, that again I wasn't going, and that I only wanted to encourage the best methods of actually reaching people. It gets a little interesting here.\n\nI failed to mention the -you have a phone- comment had actually been written/signed by this person's best friend. And this person's friend continued to text me on the original asker's phone when i texted them directly. Their friend said I had been rude and a smart ass (hence AITA). I said I didn't intend to be and intonation can be hard to interpret over text which may have caused problems. Their friend responded to me saying that i WAS rude, there was no interpreting of intonation, I carried it on unnecessarily, and just didn't answer the question when I could have, and that it's just annoying.\n\nAt this point I'm a little overwhelmed because I really didn't think there was much to be upset over at all. I just restated what I had said earlier, basically, about my answer to the question and how to get everyone else to respond. Their friend (at parts it's actually unclear who exactly is typing. based on history texting both, it's likely the question asker's friend wrote most if not all of the responses) said I missed the point.\n\nI apologized again and said I hadn't meant to be rude, not perfect, hope it's not a big deal, etc.\n\nTo this, I was told I'm coming off as self righteous, like i didnt do anything wrong (i didnt believe i did so 😬), and that it was more upsetting I didn't know how to apologize because it doesn't come off as authentic but defensive.(with an addendum-- this is OA's friend btw)\n\nI just apologized again, said I'd give space if necessary (have planned out to eat with a different lunch group a bit at least), and that I didn't have anything more to say, which ended it with an \"ok.\"\n\nIMO, the whole thing was a big reaction over a little question, especially considering the only other person who said anything in the GC was someone i specifically requested answer the question via individual text to try to defuse / bc I wasn't sure the person would do that themselves like i recommended.\n\nI was especially uncomfortable having the person's friend handle this for them. I really have no idea what the person themselves actually thinks and in general find it weird/not ok for someone to be handling a friend's business like that.\n\nBut, AITA? I really don't want this drama to be a thing next week.\n\nTL;DR: friend texts the group chat with non-urgent question, no one responds, friend calls everyone fake, still no one responds so I send a meme &amp; off-topic comment well before an actual response. friend's best friend texts me in place of them reprimanding my rudeness, doesn't believe apology.\n\n\n\n",

As I said, that isn’t true; I just wasn’t feeling it anymore.\n\nAITA for leaving my friend group? They’re all mad at me and I don’t know if abandoning them was the right decision.\n\nP.S., leaving them was not my first option- I thought we could all be friends even if we didn’t text very often or talk on PlayStation, but instead, only speak in person.

      "description": "Ok. Second time posting here dont feel like explaining background on me again. Ok so basically in Writing Class we have to write and stage a play to record and present to the class. This kid has a history of not doing his work and kept up that trend for this project as well. We ended up writing the script without him. This kid who btw was the star of the play decided he wasn't gonna be available until the Sunday  before it was due.\n\n We are kinda fine with it but are in more of a rush. So we plan it from 12 - 6. This 6 hours and he can come in at any time. He then decides he's gonna come at 2. Alright that's fine but its gonna put us back a bit. We waited an hour after he was supposed to show up until he finally said I cant make it today. Now everyone's pissed because we just wasted an hour trying to communicate with him. Then we have to have someone else play his part. Not gonna lie the way he acted like the schedule was based around him really pissed me off. I legit wanna beat this kid up for riding out on all my groups work without doing anything. AITA?\n\nBtw I'm on mobile\n\nEdit: I wrote this because people told me I was in the wrong.",

      "description": "Tldr at the bottom. \n\nMy ex and I started dating about a year ago. She broke up with me about six weeks ago after an argument we had. \n\nWe were best friends and she started living with me and working with me a couple weeks before we called it official. She had been accepted to med school a few days before she started work but decided to work for 6 months before heading 5 hours away to school. Coincidentally, my father passed three days after she moved in. There were numerous times during the ensuing months where I felt a tremendous amount of pressure in juggling my relationship and the needs of my family. She did not help. She would give me a hard time and not want to participate in family gatherings and often would request we make a weekend trip to her home about 5 hours away. To be clear, I was happy to oblige her, and looking back, I was somewhat blinded from family happenings because of my new relationship. \n\nThis put a lot of strain on the relationship, and when she moved out to go to school last June, I was somewhat relieved I could do some things with my family as we were recovering from the loss of my father. Fast forward to September. Things are going okay. She’s been very negative about the stresses of school and expects me to drop what I’m doing to talk things through with her very often. But it’s okay, I was happy to be supportive as I understood med school was stressful. Then, I was diagnosed with stage 2 testicular cancer. On a Wednesday, I was told that I’d have surgery on Friday. Of course I informed my then girlfriend and she seemed upset but somewhat passively. She had the following Monday and Tuesday off school. I somewhat expected her to come down and see me, even for just a day. But, she was in just her second month at school and so I let it slide that she had lots of studying to do and couldn’t make it. \n\nDoctors recommended I undergo three weeks of chemo in November. I had seen her in October when I went up to visit her hometown for a wedding. Prior to that, we hadn’t seen each other since early September. During chemo, I was spent. I felt horrible most days, and she didn’t seem to care. She continued to complain about how hard classes and exams were and wanted to FaceTime me frequently. All I wanted to do was put my face in a pillow and sleep. \n\nI had conversations prior to treatment with her about how I really needed her during chemo and was met with a sentiment of “yeah okay but you got to understand how difficult school is and this is my future.”\n\nShe did not come visit during chemo, and I’d argue that she put more stress on me by her constant negativity about school and tossed around the idea that I go visit her the week after my treatment was over. I told her I wasn’t feeling well enough to make the drive. \n\nI wanted to go see her in December, but I would always have to make sure it wasn’t too busy of a weekend for her with school. So I didn’t end up going. Over her Christmas break, we had a fight that was basically related to how I spend too much time with my family and school is hard and she needs someone who can really be there for her. I tried explaining that I was just getting my bearings back after treatment but she didn’t take too well to that. She broke it off via text after three years of friendship and ten months dating. \n\nAITA for not sympathizing with what she was going through in med school while going through my own problems? I’m really trying to see it from her side. \n\nTLDR; ex complained a lot about me spending time with family after fathers death, when we moved long distance, she didn’t visit/wasn’t very supportive during my cancer treatment. I was the bad guy for not understanding how difficult med school was. ",

      "description": "I was at the local gym and was really pumped to try a new workout routine I read about. It was about 5:45pm on a Tuesday, so the place was packed with after-work crowds getting in a workout before dinner. I was working on a quick circuit with a treadmill, some free weights, and a bench. I notice a pretty jacked dude getting setup for his bench presses, which is right next to my bench. Though he looked jacked, he definitely couldn't easily lift the weights he had and was really struggling, and making loud annoying breathing sounds. I HATE THAT, it immediately makes me want to make eye contact and scream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. dude loudly finishes his bench press set, after which he begins getting free weights for some squats, again right next to my area. Again, he picks up at least twenty pounds too much and begins to squat and almost fall over into me. I felt I had to constantly move my gear further away because of him. During his last set, I was finishing up some curls and heard that annoying loud breathing sound. I had enough, so I dropped my weights and walked up to him and looked him dead in his sweaty eyes and yelled \"SHUT UP AND SQUAT! He was so taken aback, he didn't know what to do...so he dropped his weights and proceeded to walk over to the security desk to report my lashing out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm banned from the gym, even though I was working out quietly like any normal human being.

      "title": "AITA for Wanting to Hangout With My Best Friend’s Ex Boyfriend?",
      "description": "Now before y’all jump to assumptions, I’m a lesbian. So I’m in no way trying to hook up with her ex.\n\nThis is my first year at my new highschool. Prior to dating, both of them were in my classes but we never really talked. My best friend (who I’ll call Amanda) complimented me a lot in the beginning of the year. I later found out that this was because she wanted to be my friend but had no idea how to approach me. Amanda is a huge gossiper. She’s the classic popular girl with a shit ton of friends, boyfriends, and followers. Personally, I don’t have that many friends. Not because I’m not a chill person, it’s just that I’m very selective about who I befriend. I know a lot of people and of course I’m all friendly with them, but I don’t actually consider them friends. Amanda considers EVERYONE friends. This leads to her getting hurt a lot and me having to console her during study hall. And trust me I have no problem with that. I’m the therapist for basically everyone I know. So I sit and listen and give her advice on how to deal with her problems. Honestly, that’s basically what our relationship is built on. Problem solving. \n\nNow her ex (who I’ll call Ryan), didn’t start talking to me until around September when he was integrated into our friend group. I first met Ryan in one of our shared classes: human history. Now I won’t lie. I know I’m pretty. A lot of my friends are good looking. The school I grew up going to was chuck full of gorgeous people. But Ryan was on a whole other level. I first thought that he was some big football jock douchebag who only motive was to fuck every hot girl he could get his hands on. So it was to my surprise when I later found out that he was a MASSIVE nerd. Like yeah he was a natural at all sports and built like a hollywood teen actor, but he also enjoyed video games, science fiction, philosophy, and other classic nerd things. We can go from wrestling each other in gym to debating the origin of the universe in five seconds flat. \n\nI never really got close to Amanda until December. Ryan joined our group in September so I’ve know him for longer. They started dating in the beginning of January and seemed to be doing well until the end of the month when Ryan broke it off. Amanda approached me about her relationship problems prior to this, and asked me to talk to him for her instead of actually communicating with her boyfriend. So I did. And I wish I hadn’t because Amanda really needs to learn that communication is the key to all relationships. More than half of her past breakups were caused by neither party verbally communicating. But anyway, I talked to Ryan and later that day he broke up with Amanda. Apparently he never liked her in the first place and was emotionally confused. He said that he just wasn’t really the dating type. \n\nAmanda was devastated and called me that night ranting about Ryan saying how much of a pretty boy asshole he was and how they never should’ve dated in the first place. Ryan was pretty unfazed by the whole thing the day after and still is a week later. We still constantly talk at school and through text with our friends and have been getting along fine despite me being best friends with his ex. Amanda, on the other hand, has been asking me to play little pranks on him to make his day a living hell to get revenge for her. Of course I haven’t done any of the things she’s asked, despite roughing him up a bit. But we always do that. We’re both wrestlers. He plays and I come from a famous wrestling family. So fighting is completely normal for us. Despite this, we’ve never really hung out outside of school since my schedule is completely crazy due to the farm where I work lying outside of state.\n\nEarlier today I got a text from him asking to hang out after I told him that my weekend off was coming up. He knows I’m a lesbian and we joke about it a lot so I know that there’s no hidden meaning behind it, but in light of recent events I don’t know if it would be the best call. But I got so excited that we were actually gonna be able to hangout in the first time in forever that I immediately said yes. I haven’t told Amanda and I don’t know if I even should as it may drive a rift between our relationship. Should I cancel our hangout? Should I hang out with him anyway because he’s my close friend? Am I an asshole for wanting to hangout with my best friend’s ex boyfriend?",

      "description": "Molly (21) and I (23) have never really gotten along, even as kids. As an adult, she's just kinda an entitled brat. Molly gets upset when the tiniest of things aren't exactly how she likes it. Like, she pitched such a fit about the tiniest of hard water spots on glasses at one point that my parents just switched to using plastic cups to avoid her rejecting 10 glasses before finding one she deemed acceptable. She is the type of person who has literally told me she is better than me because she doesn't curse. Not implied, no. She explicitly told me that she is a better person because I say \"fuck\". She has also said things like I don't deserve my (now-)husband, I don't deserve to be happy, etc. My husband and I also have established that when we have children, she will not be allowed alone with them due to her tendency to hit first and ask questions later with brother's kids. She has a wild temper and will fly off the handle rather easily. Generally, she is the type of person who, if she were a friend rather than my sister, I would have cut from my life completely.\n\nLeah (18) and I get along really well. I love to spend time with her, talk to her, etc. Our relationship is good and we have a lot of the same problems with Molly, only I don't bother hiding it from our parents at all anymore.\n\nNow our mother has gotten involved, saying it hurts Molly's feelings how I treat my sisters unequally. Examples of things our mother has a problem with:\n\n1) Leah was a bridesmaid in my wedding. Because of her comments about my relationship with my husband, I absolutely refused to have Molly in my bridal party.\n\n2) I promised Leah a few years ago that I'd buy her a tattoo for her 18th birthday. I was planning to get her a little $100-200 tattoo. Then just before her birthday, our Grandfather died. Leah and Grandfather were very close. Tattoo got put off for a bit, then I decided to call it both her birthday and Christmas, so she could get a more expensive memorial tattoo. So my husband and I paid $500 to get Leah this tattoo. Normally we wouldn't have gone with such an expensive gift, but I thought it would be a good way for her to cope, and it has been. (For reference, Christmas gift for Molly was worth about $50, which is the high end of what we do for gifts usually.)\n\n3) We received a $100 gift card to Total Wine as a wedding gift. I brought it up to sister joking about how I didn't know what to do with it because my husband and I don't really drink. Her suggestion was \"Give it to me.\" Apparently, when I laughed and said no because she was underage at the time and \"Nobody needs that much alcohol.\" This got twisted into Molly apparently thinking I said she isn't worth that much.\n\nOther than that, I just don't talk to Molly much. I avoid her because it often just starts an argument to talk to her. But I avoid most of my family because growing up with my parents wasn't easy and they are a real drain on my mental health.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole here?",

      "description": "A few months ago, when I started highschool I dated this girl (I'm gonna call her S) for a few months. In that time, I learned some very private information about her. Flash forward two months and I started getting close with a friend (she is A) and told her some of that information. After a while, S found out and I felt really bad. Just to be clear I accept full responsibility for talking about her private information to someone else, I was a huge dick and I realize that. At the same time, I look back at those texts from not too long ago ( about two weeks ago) and I feel like another person wrote them, not physically like I know I wrote them but it just doesn't sound like me and I respect S too much to do that.\n\nThen I hear from past friends of A that she manipulated them and ruined their relationships with other people. I start think about what happened right after the break up and I remember A being really close with me and being very touchy, nothing gross, just physical contact. At this point I feel like she manipulated me in some way. I start to look at her behaviors more and other things start showing up, like how she refused to take responsibility in any situation and other things like that.\n\nAfter a few days of looking at her behaviors, I decide to confront A about it, I get mad and say that our friendship is over bc I feel like she manipulated me. Later that day o found out that she cried during lunch. Now I feel like I'm scapegoating her but at the same time she could just be trying to manipulate me and make other people pity her so they'll side with her and I'll be alone.\n\nSorry if the whole story was a bit confusing, been lurking on Reddit for a while but haven't posted much. Some information I just wanted to make clear is that I will not disclose the information on S for obvious reasons and that I am 14 and a guy",

      "description": "In my school we were going to do a presentation about English grammar and it's meaning etc. They selected groups of two randomly so you could come with anyone in the class. I have very good grades in English but unfortunately i was selected to be with one of the worst students in the class (let's call him Chad). Chad didn't want to do any work and just played games during the lessons when we were supposed to be working. This was fine since i'm pretty bad at working in a group and i like to do my works solo. But when i got done with the entire presentation and started to memorize it Chad got up and started talking to the substitute teacher. I couldn't hear what he said to her but after he was done talking to her she said that she would talk to my real English teacher about my behaviour. I asked her what i had done wrong and she said this ''if all you want to do during the lesson is to watch videos and not help your group you can get out of my classroom''. I got so shocked by this i didn't even know what to say, i got angry and confused at the same time and when i tried to explain that i had actually been working this whole lesson she said ''prove it''. Then i proceeded to show her the edit history in the document. To my surprise Chad had edited my entire presentation and deleted all the previous saves in the document so it would seem like he had done all the work. By this time i knew the teacher wasn't going to believe me so i kept quiet the rest of the lesson and planned my revenge. I re did the whole presentation since he kicked me out of the old one and memorized it and everything. The next week came and we were preparing for the next period which were gonna be the presentation. Then Chad went to the bathroom and left his computer wide open for anyone to do something to his precious presentation that I wrote. I copy pasted a lot of fucked up porn into his document which the presentation text was in. I made it so all photos would appear when you press start on the powerpoint document but invisible if you didn't start it. So the next period came and it was Chads' turn to do his presentation. Right when he started the powerpoint all that could be seen was that porn i had put in, and when i say fucked up porn i really mean it. Everyone started laughing and the teacher's face was red as a tomato. He got suspended for a week and after that everyone judged him because of that incident. After all this i felt kind of bad and i think i went a little too overboard. So guys what do you think am i the asshole or was this justified?",

      "description": "This was a few years ago.\n\nI signed up to take an ethics class to satisfying an elective for my major, but this particular class was a requirement for students in the field it covered. I was one of a few students in the class without any sort of background info for that field, so I went into feeling unprepared (I should have signed up for a different class, I know). \n\nIn the second or third week of class we were assigned a group project. There were 2 other people in my group, and they both happened to be foreign students, but had been studying that field for the past couple of years. When we met up and talked about how we would divide the work, we agreed to do equal research, but the two of them would present more than I would to the class, and I would do final write up of the paper because I was more confident in my writing. We figured since they've been studying that field for longer they'd be able to answer questions better than I would, and that I should write the final version of the paper because they weren't confident in their written English skills. \n\nOutside of the project I was really struggling in my other classes/with mental health issues. The school counselor suggested I medically withdraw because of my mental health issues. While that was all happening I tried reaching out to my group to see how their research was coming along and what the plan would be for our presentation, but they didn't answer me or provide me with any of their own research or anything for our presentation ever.\n\nOut of spite I didn't tell them I was dropping. I figured if they didn't want to put in any effort for a project that mattered to them, why should I if I was just dropping the course anyway. I submitted paperwork to withdraw from school without telling them. The presentation still wasn't due for a couple of weeks at that point. After I submitted my withdrawal paperwork I didn't contact them again, or attend any more classes. They never contacted me until the morning the assignment was due. One of them sent me a text asking to email them both the paper so they could prepare for the presentation later that day. \n\nI told him was no problem, and emailed him a PDF I found online, where someone replaced every word in a 3 page report with the word chicken. There were graphs and foot notes and things so at first glance it looked real. \n\nWhen they got it they flipped out and blew up my phone. I told them that was the presentation I wanted to submit then ignored them. The professor sent me an email later telling me what an awful thing I had done and was going to fail me. I told her I'd already withdrawn, and that it wasn't only my responsibility to make sure that the assignment was completed. I pointed out that I hadn't been to any classes in over two weeks and that at no point had my group contributed any work anyway. \n\nI'm curious what my judgement is. ",

      "description": "Hear me out, the title seems like like I’m seeking validation but I’m really wondering if I’m being too sensitive or egotistical for ending things after I was criticized. Because constructive criticism can definitely be a good thing! \n\nI’ve [22, F] been texting this person [M, 24] on and off for a year. We met on Tinder in January 2017, and went on a first date. I was in a abusive and rocky on and off relationship at the time and ended up getting back together with my long term boyfriend. But throughout the year, there were periods where I was single and we’d talk again. \n\nNow it’s January 2018 and I’ve gotten myself out of my toxic relationship, for good. Boy asked me out on a second date. I said yes and it turns out to be a good time, lots of laughter. At the end, he kissed me. This is our first kiss. A few kisses in, he starts to slip some tongue in. Now, background info: I’ve been kissing for 8 years, have had 10+ kissing partners. I’m not a novice to kissing. However, no one I’ve been with has used tongue. They just weren’t interested in it and that’s fine with me. I just always assumed tongue wasn’t as common as it is in the movies. \n\n\nSo, I pause and I tell him “hey, just so you know,  I’m like a rookie at tongue kissing because I just haven’t done it previously.” He stops, laughs, and says “I could tell.” And when I immediately become embarrassed by his comment, he states “no, it’s okay. I sucked at kissing too at first.” \n\nMy self-esteem took a nosedive. I was too embarrassed and self conscious to kiss him again. I told him I was a bit offended and he just said he “didn’t mean it like that.” But the damage was done and I kinda just wanted to get out of there. \n\nAfter the night ended, I did text him that I was very embarrassed and self conscious by his comment.  But he didn’t really say much, just apologized. Now we’re still texting and he wants to go out again. I really did like him but now I’m not even interested in kissing him. I don’t feel hot or sexy anymore. I don’t know if I’m being too sensitive, because if I did suck at kissing, I guess someone should tell me. But after a year of talking and a lot of effort and time put into each other, I just don’t know if I want to go out again. \n\nSo, AITA? Am I being a baby for being so offended by his comment? Should I just take it as constructive criticism? ",

      "description": "I moved into a new apartment in August. It's a small building (only 8 units) and I'm on the ground floor. All the apartments are singles and I've only met two of the other tenants in the few months I've lived here. \n\nAbout a week into living here I woke up to the light sound of music. Initially I thought it was video game but I realized it was actually my upstairs neighbor practicing the flute. While not ideal, I pretty much let this go. For context, I live right next to a university that is very well known for their music program and I figured they were doing the best they could. They're probably living in a single so they don't annoy a roommate, they only play at reasonable times of the day, and it's pretty easy to drown out the sound if I need to. Still, not ideal, but also felt it was not worth causing an issue about.\n\nBut then, the coughing started. At the beginning of October, I started hearing my upstairs neighbor cough. My first thought was \"oh man that sucks, they're sick\" and I figured it would go away in a week or so. Well, it's been over 6 weeks and they have not stopped coughing. The walls are very thin and I've been woken up in the middle of the night on multiple occasions to the sound of coughing. Any time they are home there is intermittent coughing. Adding that on top of the flute playing, there's hardly ever not noise coming from upstairs. And it's starting to really, really tick me off to the point where I want to complain.\n\nBut, at the same time, I don't know what's going on. Like, you can't ask someone to just stop coughing. They could be sick or have allergies or something else out of their control. But where does the line between being understanding and my right to peace and quiet exist? Am I the asshole for being angry about this?",

      "description": "Me (25 M) and my family live in a fairly small town. It‘s one of those places where everyone knows everyone and word always spreads fast. Of course that can be annoying sometimes, but oh well.\nTwo years ago my little brother (16 M) came out as gay. Everyone in our family immediately accepted him, but of course that didn’t stop other people from gossiping and talking shit.\n\nI‘ve always been very close to my little brother. He used to get bullied in school for being „too feminine“ (it‘s better now, but some guys are still rude to him), so I always saw it as my responsibility to look out for him and keep him safe from those assholes. After coming out to us and his friends, his self-esteem has improved a lot  though and I‘m super proud of him!\n\nOne thing my brother loves is make-up. From what I can see he‘s pretty good with it too (we always joke about him becoming a Youtube MUA after he graduates) and even though I don’t know too much about this kinda stuff, it makes me happy that he‘s found a hobby.\n\nA few weeks ago, my brother was hanging out with friends and left the house with full make-up on (brows, eyeshadow, eyeliner, etc.). When he got back, he told me some guys he ran into were really rude to him and called him names. He was scared they would get violent so he just ran away. I comforted him and added that it might be a good idea to stop wearing make-up in public and just do it at home for now. He was pretty upset by that and accused me of victim blaming and trying to stop him from expressing himself. Before I could even say anything he left the room and now refuses to speak to me.\n\nI feel like my brother twisted my words here. He can do whatever he wants as long as he‘s happy and not inconveniencing someone else. The reason why I suggested it is because I‘m scared something might happen to him. I don’t want him to get assaulted or insulted by close-minded people when he‘s outside and I‘m not there to protect him.\nOn the other hand, maybe I went about it the wrong way and shouldn’t have said something like that at all, idk.\n\nSo, AITA for what I said?",

      "description": "First time posting, sorry for any formatting or grammar issues.\n\nBackstory:  I've grown up around smokers my entire life, my grandfather used to smoke a pack a day from youth until the age of 60.  My uncles, and aunts were also frequent smokers.  When my grandfather turned 70, he developed problems with his lungs, decayed his teeth and has gum disease.  My uncles also are starting to develop problems due to their habits and now are actively trying hard to quit.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPresent story:  I have been dating this guy for around 7-8 months, he knows about my family history and how much I don't want him to smoke due to the fact that I don't want him to develop any health issues in the future.  Every time we argue or talk about it, I always remind him that the main reason I wouldn't want him to continue smoking is because I've grown up around it and now know the serious consequences it brings.  I know that he is old enough to do whatever he wants, and we have compromised that he would stop smoking but would take up electronic cigarettes instead (which I think is better for you).  I've asked him to try and not blow the smoke in my direction due to the fact that I have never tried electronic cigs and it burns my throat.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue:  Recently he has been blaming me a lot for wanting him to stop, he says that smoking helps him calm down, and that since I had asked him to stop (and replace it with electronic instead) he has been overly stressed and unhappy (its even around 2 months since he stopped).  He says that I am too restrictive, that taking a smoke break helps him with his stress in school.  That everyone smokes nowadays and that its a social norm, that other guys significant others don't care about the smoking.  He brings it up frequently and I don't know if I am really being too restrictive asking him to stop?  I feel really bad due to the fact that I do want him to be happy, and I want him to do what makes him happy.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think I should do?  Am I being too unreasonable?  If I am how do you guys think I should fix this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short:  Am I The Asshole for asking my boyfriend to stop smoking.",

Since then everything was cool and i was happy for him. \n\nBut then during the week he repeatedly said that he never want to do this while pointing out VERY CLEARLY to other peaple that he was HIGH.

      "description": "Burner account for privacy.\n\nSam (not real name) has been my best friend since 3rd grade. We bonded over being semi-outcasts. We weren’t bullied, we were outsiders, introverted and liked nerdy things like anime. We’ve best friend and basically have hung out every day since middle school.\n\nWe ended up going to the same college. Sophomore year we got an off campus apartment together. In like November, Samuel came out as Samantha, and began transitioning. Of course, I supported her 100%. She’s been my best friend for years and I want her to do whatever she needs to be her most authentic self.\n\nThis year,  Sam was presenting as female full time. We kept hanging out all the time like we did before, and our friends started to jokingly refer to us as a couple. Sam starting dropping hints about us dating for real. I didn’t pick up the hints until *she* finally asked *me* out a in January. I said yes. I figured that we hang out all the time anyways, and I like Sam as a person a lot. Maybe there’s another layer of romance that hasn’t been uncovered, you know? I was willing to give it a chance.\n\nOn our first date, we went to a show on campus and then hit a few LGBT-friendly bars. At the bars we started being more physical and sexual, until we went back to our apartment and made out. As it was happening, I felt like, although it felt nice to touch and be touched, it wasn’t amazing, and I didn’t feel romantically connected.\n\nTo be honest, I think a major factor is the fact that Sam is trans. Even with hormones and makeup, she still has a male skeletal structure and masculine voice and and frankly, a penis. I don’t want to be bigoted, but all that makes me less sexually attracted to Sam. But I figured—hey, maybe it’s just because of society’s beauty standards etc. so I’m biased and should just give it a chance. We’re still dating and getting more and more sexual.\n\nThe more we date, the more I feel like I’m just not attracted to Sam romantically. I’m not enjoying being physical with her. And then I feel dishonest for pretending like I am because I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I’m so worried that if I’m honest about not being into her romantically it will crush her, which would crush me because to be honest, I love her more than anyone outside my family—but I’m pretty sure I just love her like a sister. But I also don’t want to live a lie and both of us deserve to be with a partner that we’re fully sexually satisfied with. And plus we live together, so this is gonna make things really uncomfortable and awkward. And how would we even go back to being just friends again? Could we even?\n\nAnyways, so basically, please let me know if I’m an asshole or not. And whatever I am, please give me some advice to resolve this as best as possible.",

      "description": "ok a bit of background: we are all highschoolers and both of these people are my best friends. the girl -lets call her sally- started liking the boy -lets call him Tim- about a month back. This was quite a big deal to Sally's friends and I started becoming the mediator between the two, Sally and Tim, most of the things told to me by Tim were told to Sally and vice versa if I saw the information to be beneficial to either person in the development of this relationship or they told me to tell the other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a week before said event that made me question if I was the asshole, I was calling Sally and somehow it was brought up that we, sally and I, should kiss. to which I replied, I would be willing to, but I wasn't going to push it- it was her decision. This made me feel like I was going behind Tim's back since he liked her, but at the time I knew nothing was really developing out of their crush situation and nothing had really progressed for a couple weeks. I talked to a different friend about it who assured me that it wasn't immoral so I proceeded not pushing it but being open to the possibility if Sally wanted to. I should also say that this kiss was intended to be nothing more than a kiss. I should also preface that I am female, so it was more of an experimentation thing than anything for Sally. At which point a date was scheduled for me to go over to Sally's house with the possibility on the table of us kissing still. AITA for this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring that week I went trick or treating with Tim and another friend. Were Tim and I essentially had a joke that went to far that ended up with me essentially touching his um...member? The intentions were not sexual, rather it was a sexual joke in nature that again, went to far. After this we talked about it and both agreed on the possibility of this event occurring again intentionally. As a friends with benefits sort of deal. AITA for this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis was about four days later days later. Tim, unknowing of Sally and I's situation, was getting antsy. He also canceled our arrangement. Tim and Sally crushes were fading-as most do- and Tim wanted to act fast, fearsome of losing his shot. Tim asked me what he should say and if he should ask Sally out. I told him he should probably wait, because I was worried that Sally and I's kiss would skew her answer in some way. He begrudgingly obliged, still wanting to know what the event specifically was, which I never told him. I also brought up this to Sally, to confirm that Tim should wait, and she agreed that it would probably be best to wait until after our kiss. About half a week goes by and our kiss in canceled due to other scheduling conflicts, I again bring up to Sally if now would be a good time for Tim to ask her out. Sally says no, and that I misunderstood her for that half week and she did not like Tim anymore. I then asked Sally if she wanted to tell him this or if she wanted me to. She wanted me to. I told Tim and he has not talked to me since. AITA for this? The last thing he texted me about was commenting on our previous fight we had over text that I instigated with the intention of a open dialogue of how I felt in our friendship and about how something he did hurt my feelings. This is a week later and no texts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, just tonight I was again on a call with Sally and she informed me she could be Bi and possibly wanted to date me. would I be the asshole if I said yes? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "So my dad has suffered with major depression and BPD for quite a while, and a few years ago he had a particularly bad episode. At the time I was 15, and he would often talk to me as a sort of 'therpist'. Around that time I started becoming more independent and isolated myself more from my family - a few years prior however, my dad and I were extremely close. I just took my growing independence as a normal feat of growing up. Anyways, so one day when I was 15 he was confiding in me about his depression, when suddenly he started confronting me about how I no longer spent time with him. Then he kinda got tearfully angry and told me that I'm the reason he is suicidal/I make him suicidal. This definitely bothered me at the time, but I was more resentful/angry than anything. I've remembered the incident quite clearly since then. \n\nFast forward to today, my 18th birthday, and I'm sitting down with my parents at the table (a very rare occassion) and we're just talking. I definitely  have alot of resentments towards my family and my upbringing (I come from a fairly dysfunctional family, and my upbringing has been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster) and towards both parents, but I was actually enjoying myself while we were talking. Recently I asked to get an appointment with a psychiatrist and begin therapy again, as I've been struggling with what I think is worsening depression over the last few months. So we talked a bit about that. We talked a bit about how dysfunctional the family is, and reminisced about the tumultuous up bringing - but in a good light. It was kind of nice,and I actually felt close to them for the first time in years (especially my dad).  I don't remember exactly what my dad said to me next (but I perceived it to be in an accusatory tone), so then I brought up the shitty thing he had said to me a few years prior - how he told me I make him suicidal.\n\nHe vehemently denied this at first, claiming that he must have been talking to my mom (as he accuses her of that quite often) or that I was just remembering incorrectly, because he would have remembered saying that. I was insistent until I noticed him growing upset as he began to acknowledge that it may be true, at which point I admitted that it may have been a misunderstanding (which it was definitely not). My mom made us hug and then he burst into tears, very obviously hurt, and started lamenting about what a shitty thing that was/how he's a bad person. Now I'm worried that he is suicidal again.\n\nThis then triggered me, and now I'm in bed succing on a cigarette and feeling like a total asshole for having brought that up. It is definitely something that has remained ingrained in my.mind, and I've told my mom about it, but never brought it up with my dad. So, AITA?",

      "description": "High school senior here. I've been friends with this guy since the eighth grade, and he's always been a little much to handle. He's the only student in the grade younger than me (he's 16, I'm 17) and I used to tell myself that his age was the reason for his attitude, but none of my other friends or people I know in general ever act this way. So, allow me to give a description of this guy, let's call him Jimmy.  \n\n\nJimmy is the type of guy that frequents /b/, worships Ben Shapiro, makes sexist, racist, makes transphobic/homophobic comments, and is generally a chore to be around. He's had real bad anger issues since I met him, and that alleviated somewhat in the 10th and 11th grades, but it's just come back harder. A few days ago someone made a joke at his expense that we all laughed at (something along the lines of \"everyone is allowed in my room except Jimmy) and he used this as an excuse to stand up, yell \"Well, that's a good enough excuse to leave, I'll see you all in Hell!\", walk out of the room, and slam the door. We're all used to him making scenes over small shit, so we all ignore it. Couple minutes later, he comes back in, sits down, and says \"whatever, fuck that c\\*nt\". No one but me and another friend seems to have heard this, and we look at each other like \"Did he just say that?\"  \n\n\nThe girl in question is one of my closest friends and very attractive. As such, pretty much ever since the 9th grade, Jimmy has made very gross and inappropriate comments about her body whenever she's not there. I won't go over them since they're honestly just super disgusting, but they're typical of what you'd expect from a right wing kid with little to no female friends.   \n\n\nOn top of stuff like this, the dude and I don't agree at all politically. He calls himself a libertarian but really that's just so people will think he has good social values, which he doesn't. He'll only call one of our trans friends \"he\" when he's around and deadnames him all the time, constantly makes fun of his childhood friend for being bisexual and having had sex with a guy in the past, and generally says some pretty questionable things about the nature of homosexual men. Though, lesbians are fine because \"it's hot\". He likes to make Jew jokes and has whispered the n word in my ear multiple times (I'm black) because he thinks it's funny. It is not.  \n\n\nLastly, dude lies through his teeth constantly. I used to be a compulsive liar myself back in elementary school, so I can get some of the reasons why, but the fact that he's so adamant about it all just really rubs me the wrong way. He'll lie to win arguments (which he just loves, by the way), lie to make himself seem like the victim, lie to make himself seem smarter than he actually is (which, to be fair, he is a pretty smart guy, just not THAT smart), and lie just to make his enemies seem worse than they actually are. I don't believe that a whole lot of people buy it, but none of us ever call him out on it because like I said before, he has really bad anger issues and will flip out if you contradict him. Speaking from firsthand experience here.   \n\n\nSo, I bet right now you're going \"of course you wouldn't be the asshole, the dude sounds like he sucks\", but here's the thing. As a result of this behavior, Jimmy has lost...pretty much all of the friends he once had. Our friend group now ostracizes him and talks shit about him behind his back, and none of us ever really talk to him unless we have to. I'd say that he pretty much only has two friends, one of which is basically like a Stockholm Syndrome type thing. The other day he opened up to me about feeling like everyone else in our friend circle are \"fake friends\" because they never invite him to parties or tell him what's going on with their lives, and he looked genuinely sad. I would feel guilty about just dropping him for my own sake, but at the same time, being around him is exhausting and stresses me the hell out.  \n\n\nI seriously don't know what to do in this situation. I'm having a party in my new house this coming Saturday and am leaning towards not inviting him since he always just seems to cause issues with all of my other friends. Would I be the asshole if I just stopped being his friend and opted to not invite him? Thanks for reading. ",

      "description": "Throughout my whole relationship with my wife, I've been stuck witnessing countless feuds between her and her dad. My wife's brother is also in the same toxic relationship with the dad. It has come to a point where both my wife and brother-in-law are fed up and have accepted the fact their dad will never change. In turn, both of them have started distancing themselves. It's unfortunate, because their mom is caught in the crossfire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith everything that's been done, I've never been keen of my wife's dad. But that has never stopped me from being the glue that has kept what's left of my wife and her father's relationship together... Up until my grandmother passed away. My grandmother had both her viewing and funeral all in one weekend. My wife's dad had plans to go on a fishing trip during that same time. I didn't expect my in-law's to attend the funeral, nor did I have any hard feelings that they couldn't go. My father-in-law knew I had a funeral, and yet still he asked if I can watch his dog that weekend while they were out. Which basically consists of me driving to their home each day, feeding the dog, and walking him. I agreed, but in hindsight I should've never done it. A dog should be the least of my worries during my grandma's passing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that point, I stopped putting in the effort to communicate/see my father-in-law, which in turn further drifted my wife and her dad. My wife's mom quickly began falling into a state of depression seeing her whole family fall apart. She started reaching out to other family members for support. These family members already knew the history of fights between my wife and her dad, as well how I felt regarding my grandma's death and the dog situation. Long story short, they're asking my wife and I to set aside our differences with my father-in-law for the sake of my mother-in-law's wellbeing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife is emotionally done with the fights and abusive behavior her dad has done to her for years. She has been on the verge of depression because of this as well. There's no way she is willing to go back and endure more of it. As for me, the dad has lost all my respect. Even with all that said, the rest of the family insists we suck it up. I'm at the point where I'm losing my patience with this whole family. My wife and I are more than willing to have a very close relationship with the mom and help her, but the dad is out of the question. In my mother-in-law's eyes, the only way to solve her issues is to see the whole family together again. The rest of the family won't confront the dad because they are terrified of his aggressive mentality, and he never owns up to his mistakes anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo guys, is my wife and I the asshole for not wanting to fix anything as my mother-in-law drifts into a further state of depression? She has been having suicidal thoughts, and would hate to be pointed fingers at for it.",

      "description": "Last week was my 30^(th) wedding anniversary.Today I turn 54 and is the first day of retirement for my wife and I.\n\nMy wife and I met when we were sixteen through friends and started dating shortly after. We were both complete virgins when we met so we learned and experienced everything together. We dated all throughout highschool, and long-distance through college (tough!), and ended up getting married at 23.\n\nWe have two sons and a daughter now, aged 27, 24 &amp; 22, respectively.\n\nWhen I was 27, I slept with another woman because I was curious, drunk &amp; very stupid.I don't remember many of the details, and they aren't important, but it was a woman that neither of us had ever met and I never heard from again. As far as I know, my wife has never found out about this or had any hesitation in trusting me ever.\n\nMy wife went to college but didn't end up pursing much of a career, opting to take care of the kids. It was tough for a while and we both were stressed and this was around the time of the affair (not making excuses for myself, just context to explain why I would be so fucking shortsighted and why I was drinking). But I eventually got a better job. We started budgeting and paid off our loans. From there money was never and issue again and we have been *happy* ever since.\n\nI have accepted the fact that I will never truly be happy again, if I want her to get the happiness she deserves. I don't want to pretend the guilt still eats my alive everyday. I still love my wife and she still loves me. We have had so many happy and amazing memories and still do everyday. Though, most usually come with a lingering feeling of guilt too.\n\nShe spent her whole life dedicated to me, to our children &amp; our family. Now that we have all the freedom we've been waiting for in our lives, I feel as if I have come to a crossroads and only have two options:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Continue living life as normal. Take trips with my wife. Play with my grandchildren. Give her the retirement and the end of life she deserves with her husband who she loves. I am not really happy and I may never be but I am also not in a bad place. I could take this level of pain for the rest of my life and I probably deserve that.\n2. Tell her. I don't know whether she would leave me now or forgive me. I think she deserves to know the truth, but I also think it could crush her at a time in her life where she is supposed to be the happiest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I need to know, am I the asshole for not telling my wife? and is it time to tell her now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DRI met my wife at 16. Married at 23. Cheated on her at 27 and never told her.Now we're 54 and life is perfect otherwise.**",

I genuinely feel like she's my soulmate - I've never met anyone who I've felt so connected to. But last week we had our first big fight.\n\nSince before we got married she's always said she doesn't want kids. I do, but not enough for it to have been a dealbreaker. Maybe that was shortsighted of me but I really do love this woman. I know she's been thinking about permenant sterilization. However in the last few months I've noticed her really take on a more maternal nature - she smiles and waves at babies in the street, and she'll be fawning over her little nieces and nephews. This is a recent development and I brought it up one night after her sister brought the new baby over for a visit. She says nothing has changed but I can see it. I told her she clearly likes kids and that she'd regret it if she did decide to be sterilized and would probably end up wanting a baby. She got very upset at this and told me I was being a condescending prick. I just don't want her to make a decision she regrets. She hasn't really spoken to me since and has seemed very distant.\n\nSo, AITA or is she overreacting?",

Some of them have brought up how I \"should get back in touch\" with my mom. Nothing urgent is going on, this has been happening the whole three years. Every time they bring it up, I tell them exactly why I stopped talking to her - emotional manipulation, triangulation, parentification, staying with boyfriends who put me in physical danger (and even hitting me herself on occasion), holding me hostage for a year. I recently found tons of evidence against her gaslighting and have started linking people to a Google doc where I pasted a good portion of it.  \n\n\nDuring the year I was stuck in her house, I would write Facebook statuses asking for help. I would openly and candidly talk about what was going on and question her motives. She had manipulated everyone else around me to think she was a great mother and I was simply refusing to work, so my only responses were to the effect of \"Don't air your dirty laundry\" and \"You're just ungrateful, get your shit together and get a job\". I don't get these responses now, but I still wonder if defending myself is warranted or if I should just let it be. Am I going too far?

      "description": "For background “Dan” and I met through a mutual friend about a month before we started seeing each other. Dan had expressed interest in me, but I clearly told him I wasn’t looking for anything serious and that I was also seeing someone else, to which he responded that he was okay with that for the time being. I had been non-exclusively seeing “Andrew” for almost two years at this point and though I didn’t plan on being exclusive with Andrew, I wasn’t ready to end things with him yet. \n\nOne night after hanging out with Andrew (which ended in a hookup), Dan invited me over. I agreed, and went to his house where he initiated a hookup. I told him that I had just seen Andrew before this and I felt like it would be disrespectful to Dan if I didn’t inform him of that. Dan told me that though he wasn’t happy about that, he still liked me and that he wanted to be exclusive with me if I was willing to end things with Andrew. I told him I wasn’t ready to be exclusive and that I needed time to end things with Andrew because we had been friends for so long.\n\nFlash forward a couple weeks later and Dan hasn’t talked to me other than to tell me to return his hat which he left in my car. I realize that I am ready to end things with Andrew for Dan if Dan is okay with that. After returning his hat, I give Dan an apology letter where I tell him that I’m sorry if I hurt his feelings and that if he is still interested in me, I will end things with Andrew. Dan tells me that he needs time to think about it.\n\nTwo weeks later I find out from a friend (who doesn’t know him personally) that he is telling people that I cheated on him. While I am sad to hear that he’s saying that about me, I ignore it because I still have feelings for him. That same day, I call him to ask if he has thought about my letter. He tells me that he has thought about it and he wants to pursue me. The next day I end things with Andrew. It takes a toll on me emotionally because I have been close with Andrew for so long, but I hold myself together because I am happy that I can start seeing Dan again. \n\nHowever, after 1 or 2 times of seeing each other, Dan starts to ignore me. I hear that he is still telling people (including my friends, who aren’t friends with him) that I cheated on him. In fact, I hear that I am a cheater from so many people that I ask his best friend, (who we are both friends with), to confirm this. His friend says that it’s true that Dan is saying these things but that he (the friend) knows it’s not true. When I try to confront him about it, he gets defensive and refuses to have a conversation with me. \n\n\nTL;DR: I am tired of hearing from people that I am a cheater because I had made it clear to Dan that we weren’t exclusive. I feel bad for being with two people in a short period of time, but I don’t feel like I was entirely in the wrong and it doesn’t warrant being labeled as a cheater if they were both aware of each other. \n\n",

I responded by saying I think people can choose to not stay no matter what it's a choice, some people have higher priorities. Then it escalated to a huge argument and I said she is harming our class atmosphere by verbally assulted half of our class.\n\nShe then said that people are calling her very mean things and that she doesn't care if people call he Hitler, Bitch or anything else(no one did).\nI then wrote to her privately that I'm sorry if she got offended but I still hold true to my statement. She told me she cried and that I should enjoy a peaceful life or In your case a cold sad life because you're a miserable person,and idont ever want to talk to you. \nSorry if this with bad grammar or something I'm writing in a hurry and on mobile.",

      "description": "So for some context, my uncle owns about 50ish prepaid phone stores. \n(This isn't really relevant, just giving a full picture)\nI needed a job, and I needed one fast. He offered me a job and I took it, no questions asked \n(Regretting that now) for starters, the job is a bit of an incontinent commute. About 35-45 minutes depending on traffic. Which may not sound like a lot, but on minimum wage that's murder on gas money. The working conditions are pretty decent, I work in the back mostly putting in orders, keeping track of shipments, handling email's, etc, etc. Here's the problem though. Since I'm technically not officially on payroll, so I don't get direct deposit. My paycheck has been late on more than one occasion, and as of today it's two weeks late because the stores accounts are negative. I'm on vacation right now, so I'm out of state. That being said, I'm owed two weeks worth of pay. I'm a broke 20 year old and can't put up with inconsistencies like that. So when I get back home, I'm thinking about just quitting right then and there and finding another job. It would be a lot easier if it weren't family, but here we are.\n\n\nTL;DR\nI took a job my uncle offered me out of desperation and have had my paycheck be late one too many times, but I'd feel like an asshole quitting a family job so abruptly",

Three and four respectively. I’m fresh out of high school and still deciding what I want to do with the rest of my life, but I work full time and help around the house as often as I can. I love my baby cousins but they are hard to deal with and are very unruly children, my mother also has trouble watching them because she has a bum leg and arthritis in most joints. So watching the children isn’t the easiest task for us, and most sundays after my grandmother takes the babies to church she brings them back home and drops them on me and my mother to watch even though we didn’t agree to it. Then she just goes to bed. Today I was fed up with it because my mother fell in the hall while trying to chase one of the kids and told my grandmother that what’s the point of bringing the kids here to grandmas if she’s not doing even going to watch them. She got extremely angry and said I was an ungrateful asshole and screamed at the kids to stop running around. So am I the asshole here?\n\nTLDR: grandmother brings children to house to visit, pawns them off on me and my mother while she naps instead.\n\n\n",

      "description": "Sorry for the format, I am using the mobile.\n\nSo a brief background. My gf (27) and I (28) have been together for 5 years and have talked about marriage more recently. Since than I've been thinking about getting a prenup as a precaution if there is ever a divorce. I don't think we will ever get a divorce but life happens and a statistics of 50% of marriages doesn't help at all.\n\nDuring a time together I managed to graduate college at 25 with 40k in student loans debt and a car payment. I paid it all off in 1.5 years by working 3 jobs, the first is my current employer, the 2nd was retail, and the 4th rideshare (uber &amp; lyft which I count as one). It was brutal and caused alot of arguments and tension with her and I to where we were a roller coaster and ended up breaking up for 3 months but ended up getting back together. I did try my best spend time with her and she understood why I was doing this but was putting me down constantly. I ignored the insults because I knew she was frustrated that we werent spending enough time together. I managed to pay off that debt but as well accumulate a good chunk of savings. I kept this routine for another 6 months to where I saved up enough to buy a home and invest in my retirement. While she really never cared about paying off her debt, which annoys me but I let it slide because we've argued before.\n\nI ended up quitting the retail job and still have the rideshare just for extra cash. I spent months trying to find the perfect home, by looking online and meeting with realtors, I tried getting her involved but after the first day of house hunting she said she doesn't like doing this. So I did this solo. I ended up purchasing a home with my name on the contract and mortgage. Everything is under my name from the mortgage to utilities while my gf buys half of the food. \n\nAfter discussing marriage I started thinking about all the hard work and sacrifices I made to get to where I'm at and what I accomplished. I started reading horror stories (I know bad idea) of how people lost everything in divorces and I fear that if we ended up divorced that all my hard work would be taken away. This morning we talked again a out marriage and she brought up divorce and the stats and situations on that. I brought up the prenup (as a hypothetical question) and she went ballistic and accused me of not trusting her which, is false I do trust her with anything (but I don't trust her with finances because she says she doesn't care, thank god I didn't tell her that). We haven't talked since this morning so I have to think AITA for wanting to protect my investments?",

      "description": " \n\nSoooo... First time on reddit...\n\nMy Father in Law, after moving to the UK, left some shite at our house with the instruction to \"Get rid of it.\"  \nThere's a painting with depicting two South African politicians, its satirical and what not.  \nHe had gotten the painting from the artist in lieu of rent... Ironically... I'm selling it back to him for exactly the same reason.\n\nI think its cursed.\n\nAnyway. in February. I put the painting up for auction as the artist is well known and there is a republican dude from Florida who is willing to pay $1500 for it.... I used the Art gallery to Auction it to handle the legal side and the shipping because they have insurance and then I don't have to deal with paperwork... I hate paperwork.\n\nThe artist was notified by the Art Gallery and he found my contact details and asked if he could buy the painting privately, as it is one of his first paintings and it holds sentimental value... I'm an artist myself and I know how hard it is to let go of your baby... so I agree and we both agree on ZAR 9000 (about $ 621,01)...  \nHe agreed, I sent him an invoice and... we agreed he would pay a week before the 25th and I would wrap and store the painting for him till he is back in the province and I can either deliver it or he collects it. I'm an artist myself... this is not abnormal.\n\nSo the agreed upon date of payment comes... my rent is due in a week and... HE ghosts me. I have to borrow money to pay my rent.  \nHe comes back like the 2nd of March saying his friend thinks that I'm asking too much and then asks for a cheaper price.  \nI unfortunately had a huge project and a crazy deadline and only responded a week later, I apologised and... I'm an artist too... I know how rough it is out here. tell him I agree to the price.  \nHe gh0sts me again...  \nSo... I sent him a message on all his platforms and an email and a text AND a whatsapp... that if he does not get back to me by the 18th of march, I am sending the painting back to Auction where I know my american client is just lusting for this artwork. $1500...  \nSame day he responds that he wants it and will pay Tuesday the 19th once his client pays him for a recent show and once again... I agree and tell him once his payment clears in my account (and after I move it to avoid a payment reversal) I will have the painting delivered...  \nTuesday came and went... wednesday was human rights day and Thursday he sends messages to apologise that his client is being stubborn... I say that I understand and hope it gets resolved soon.\n\nits Saturday... my whatsapp messages are unread...delivered, but unread... my calls to him are not going through...\n\nAm I being an asshole or should I sell his beloved painting to the racist republican for $1500.  \nI may be an artist but I need to feed my family and keep a roof over my head.\n\nHonestly, I want this cursed painting gone... I'm gonna burn sage now.\n\nPlease don't roast me too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

      "description": "I want to start this off saying I've had, and still don't, no problem with people whom I've done this with. Most were known to me for at least few weeks before we've done it, for obvious reasons. Didn't want any regret to turn into ruining of my life. But recently few of my friends have accused me of taking advantage of those girls and raping them when the subject was brought into the conversation. I feel like i should mention I'm a guy.\n\nIt was often that both of us were drunk, but there were occasions where I was 100% sober and they weren't and vice versa. As sex while drunk goes, sometimes it was too long with lots of painful jaws, uncomfortable, slow, messy and so on. But newer non consensual. None of them were to the point of passing out, not knowing whats happening or unable to communicate. If they were, nothing would happen. Some were pretty persistent and sometimes forceful, but it was easy to hold them till they would eventually tire themselves out. So nothing would really happen. \n\nOf course they got more relaxed while being drunk and wouldn't probably have it while sober or try the things they did in the bedroom. There is no denying that, alcohol does that. Want to mention i never pressured or encouraged them to drink more so that i could get laid. See no point in that. \n\nAs mentioned I've been labeled as rapist by those people and that is really disturbing to hear. To me this is not even close to that.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA (or worse) for having drunken sex?\n\nP.S messy grammar, sorry.",

      "title": "WIBTA if I stoped helping my friend apply for uni?",
      "description": "My best friend,Ellie, is applying to uni this year. I applied and started uni last year. We are also in the UK.\n\nLast year I applied when our school told me , and my year which included her, to apply and was helped by them. I attended uni open days with my family and applied to uni and student finance by myself. \n\nEllie refused the schools help last year. And has refused to go to them for help this year because they will just shout at her and not help her. I know they would help her and wont shout at her for needing help but they would kinda shout at her for other things like her bellow 50% attendance.\n\nNow ive been to uni open days and im going to look at accommodations with her. Ive also already helped her on how to apply for uni and ive answered her questions on how to apply for finance to the best of my ability. But i feel like these are things she should be doing herself, given how i was able to do them myself last year.\n\nI still helped her, but the turning point just happened, and it may seem small and trivia but for me its not, which is why im finally asking here.\n\nAfter asking me several question on student finance, some rather obvious ones, she got to the section where she needs to put down the contact info for 2 people that dont live with her.\n\nI know she has people to put down but shes just complained that she could only put one down and after 15 mins asked if she could put me or our other friend down instead. \n\nThis was kinda the line for me, idk why, but i said no. She needs to put her family down. I think shes settled on her grandad, but she also knows all my contact info so she could have just put me down and not told me which is something i wouldent put past her.\n\n\nSide notes-\n\nMost of the other things shes asked me can be easily googled too. Like last night she asked me what other accommodations are near me, this is something she could have easily googled but chose not to. Ive asked her a coupleof times before why she didnt just google them, and shes said variations of 'i just couldent be bothered'.\n\nAlso (i know im TA for this) but i dont think shes going to get into any the unis shes applied for and will enter through clearing due to how low her grades are, and she will ask for my help even though i wouldn't be able to help her. I also think that if she gets accepted to the uni i live by shes going to ask me questions about the uni that we both know i cant answer.\n\nThis has personally been a long time coming and I could easily write a 'wibta is i stoped being friends with her'. Also throw away because she knows my main.\n\nTL/DR\nMy friend is applying to uni. She keeps asking me questions about applying most of which can be answered by a quick google search or by asking teachers at school.\n\nWIBTA if i stoped helping her and just telling her to ask someone else or google the answer?",

      "title": "AITA For wanting a new sexual partner?",
      "description": "I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about a year (both women). She is my first GF and our relationship is incredible. Aside from a few small arguments we’ve had in the past our relationship has been pretty peaceful, except for the one we had a couple nights ago. We were laying in bed when she asked me what I thought about our sex life. She thinks that it’s perfect and with good reason; I always make sure she enjoys it. I’ve never had a hard time making her cum and she’s always very into it. At the beginning of our relationship I studied her body and tried new things in bed every time so that I could figure out what would immediately get her going and also find out the things she didn’t like so I could refrain from doing them. I feel like that’s the bare minimum a spouse should do because sex should be an experience that both people enjoy. \n\nHowever, when it’s her turn to return the favor she either (1) Falls Asleep, (2) Half-Asses the job, or (3) completely avoids it altogether. She has never made me cum once. Now, she has mentioned that I’m the first girl she has ever had sex with so she doesn’t really know what to do. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and just assumed she was nervous. After all, she’s the first girl I’ve ever had sex with too and I was nervous as hell our first night together. But the only way I got over that fear was by practicing. I’ve tried everything from guiding her through it to boosting her confidence. I even suggested she search up different ways to satisfy me so that she can find something she’s completely comfortable with. Each to no avail. She knows how badly I want it too and teases me about it often. She’ll say stuff like “Do _____ for me first and then I’ll make you cum.” I always fall for it and Every. Single. Time. There is some sort of excuse. \n\nEventually, the lack of intimacy on her end made me extremely self-conscious and I started wondering if maybe I just wasn’t attractive enough to her. We had just had sex right before she asked me the question and yet again it ended only when SHE was happy with it. So, when answering how I felt about our sex life I was completely honest and said that I was glad I was able to fulfill her needs but I often felt left out and self-conscious afterwards because she either never offers to return the favor or she does but then can’t quite finish the job. I was so angry that in the heat of the moment I suggested that maybe I should just find a new sexual partner. I made it clear that the person would only be there for my sexual needs and would in no way impose on our relationship. She, herself, has suggested something similar because she has been in a polyamorous relationship before. At first I said no but now I think that’s something I need at this point. She got very upset and said that what I said was hurtful and rude. I was only telling the truth. I know sex isn’t the only thing to seek in a relationship but it’s an important part of it. It’s unfair to me that only one of us is enjoying it. Should I have just kept my mouth shut???",

      "description": "I put a load of dirty work clothes I need for tomorrow in my apartment buildings empty washer at 5:15 pm tonight when I got home from work, and came back to move them over half an hour later. When I opened the dryer, I saw another person’s load of laundry and then noticed the other empty clothes basket, so I closed the door and let it be. \n\nI figured if I gave the other person some time they’d come get their laundry and open up the dryer. There’s only one washer and one dryer for our apartment building so I couldn’t just put my clothes in another machine. \n\nI gave it an hour and went back, but the clothes were still there, so I told myself I’d eat dinner and check again. At 8:20 I went back down to the laundry room and clothes were still there. I need my clothes for tomorrow and I go to bed early because I wake up early for work and didn’t want to stay up late waiting. Plus the dryer is notorious for not drying clothes fully. \n\nSo I put the other person’s clothes in their hamper as carefully as I could, making sure not to touch their delicates. I put my load in the dryer and am now waiting the hour it takes to dry. \n\nI’ve had to do this before when I was in college so I thought no big deal, but AITA? ",

      "description": "Some backstory: We are a group of university students at our final year, and we planned to have a graduation trip at the end of May.\n\nInitially this trip only involves 5 of us. Let's call my friends A, B, C and C's girlfriend, D. It all went well initially as we discussed the places to visit, accommodatios, flight departure and return date and time. Few days after, B decided to invite two of his girl friends,E and F, that A and I are not familiar with . At the beginning we are like \"sure, why not maybe it will be fun with more people\". But we were wrong, both E, F actually don't like out initial agreed return dates and wish to extend our trip from 5 days 4 nights to 8 days 7 nights. Mind that we are all student and most of us are tight in budget (well,  me in particular). \n\nSo, discussion was held to discuss the return date and time. After some argument, we finally settled for 8days 7 nights (yeah *sarcastic* ). \n\nFfw to the day we booked our flight tickets, it causes some scene since E don't want to pay for baggage check in for the departure flight, which made A and I very annoyed as we are not familiar with them in the first place and causes so much trouble. \n\nAnother than the baggage matter, there are still some other arguments, big and small, shits like that. Which all settled unhappily.( it is lengthy already so I'm not gonna explain in detail, please don't cast the \"alright then, keep ur secret \" meme on me, I'm tired :( )\n\n\nFfw to 2 days ago,  A called me and told me about our return date is changed by the airline company, making our trip become 9 days 8 nights and say this is our chance to cancel the flight and get a refund ( I don't know if it's true) . \n\nWe told B our intention to quit this trip and he say he is fine with it, but ignored our message since that day. AITA?\n\nSummary : Decided to ditch a trip after one of the member invite 2 other friend that causes so much troubles and argument in our group, AITA?",

      "description": "Please excuse spelling I'm on mobile. So first off I would like to let everyone know that I am in a theater  program and it was two days before the show starts (it starts on the 29th) and we had beed rehearsing since after lunch until 5:30. Some kids were whispering during the rehearsal and some others were on their phone backstage. I wasn't on my phone or talking unless I was telling someone else to be quiet.\n     Our theater teacher (who we will call R) was angry at people for not paying attention. R might have just been stressed, but so were we and being yelled at after finishing a two hour show rehearsal was not what we needed. My friend, who we will call J, was there too and after he had finished yelling at everyone I asked her, and I quote, \"does he always get like this before a show?\", and she called me an asshole. Please don't say anything mean about J because she is still my friend, and R was just stressed. So Reddit AITA?\n\nTLDR: My theater teacher yelled at us two days before a show and I asked my friend if he always gets like this before a show, and my friend called me an asshole.",

      "description": "I want to give you some background so you can get a sense of the relationship I have with my coworker, Mary.. we've gotten really close in the past 2 years and I've come to consider her a friend. When we first started talking she told me she has depression and suicidal tendencies.. I've tried to be there for her, tried to get her into yoga, tried to get her to cheer up and look on the bright side of things.\n\nWe mostly chat at work and I think she's a good person. Her Facebook persona though... She's always complaining and ranting, but I never go on Facebook so that has never been a big deal for me..\n\nWell, my dad got really sick this past May, he was told by the doctors that he wouldn't make it till November. He's doing fine now but I was freaking out, and when I told Mary about this, I was expecting for her to tell me that everything would be fine, some sort of advise on how to keep my cool, but instead she said something along the lines of \"that's rough\" and never again has asked me about how my dad is doing. I started cutting her off after that.. I wouldn't invite her over or decline her invitations, at work we started having arguments about videogames and movies and I didn't really care to tell her about important stuff because I felt she wouldn't be there for me.. \n\nLast weekend there was a petrol pipeline explosion in central Mexico (that's where we live in) and 114 people died while stealing the petrol.  I happened to open Facebook (which I very rarely do) and I saw my feed was full of her comments along the lines of \"they had it coming!\" \"I love happy endings!\" \"They deserved to die!\", I unfollowed her and thought to myself.. what the hell is wrong with Mary :s\n\nSo we didn't speak at all on Monday, and on Tuesday she asked me about my day and then soon after she started raging on how stupid the population is and how she drives so much better than the average driver and I had enough, so I told her to stop her Facebook rants and to stop ranting to everyone, because that just keeps spreading the hate and it's doing her more damage than anyone else.. she started crying and then a few minutes later she thanked me for telling her this, said I was such a good friend and.. I actually felt pretty bad for imposing my opinion on her and making her cry..\n\nWell.. yesterday I overheard my boss saying that she's getting fired (for using profanity on a corporate email)... I'm not sure she'd ever find out that I knew beforehand but I don't know if I should tell her or not.. I feel like she would go on a rant on FB and tell everyone I spilled the beans.. but on the other hand I feel like a terrible friend for not telling her..\n\nWhat do you think? WIBTA if I don't tell her?\n\n",

      "description": "I was diagnosed as an adult with autism spectrum disorder and schizoid personality. Schizoid personality basically means that I experience a restricted range of emotions and have what's known as a blunted affect, what emotions I do experience are to a much lesser extent than what is typical. Also, whatever part of the brain that makes social interactions a smooth and reflexive \"stimulus and response\" affair for most people seems to be nonfunctional in my particular brain.\n\nEvery one of my social interactions cause me to have to think about every response I make, nothing flows naturally. This is rather mentally taxing, with conversations being more like puzzles. But one benefit of never reacting to others based on my internal brainstate is that I can instead tailor my responses based on my understanding of the other person's internal brainstate. I can react to others based on what they need to hear rather than based on what I need to say, and I'm pretty well practiced at deciphering what people need to hear.\n\nI spent my formative years dealing with an abusive father, so my wellbeing was based on how he was feeling at any given time. I got really good at reading any subtle indicators that would clue me in to how he was feeling, including things as subtle as the sound of his footsteps. Because of this, I got quite good at reading people and their body language. I've also found that personality traits tend to cluster together in entire constellations of traits, and recognizing one can allow me to intuit the presence of the others, with a good degree of accuracy.\n\nMost people feel under-appreciated, and I've no shame about expressing appreciation so I do it all the time, even though I'm not really feeling it. Making myself the source of someone's validation and appreciation creates a dependency and keeps my interactions with that person positive and stress free. Many people are starved for it. \n\nI'm always outwardly positive, appreciative, and validating of other people around me because it's just as easy for me to be that way as it is for me to be any other way. In conversation with people I mirror their emotions about the things they care about. It's not real but it makes them feel good, and gives them a positive feeling about me. I know this is manipulative, but anything I do or say would be a show, I'm basically a tabula rasa. I don't feel badly about this but I'm curious about other people's perception of this when I lay it all out as honestly as I'm able.\n\nI think all animals are evolved to take maximum advantage of their environment which includes people, and our inherited social behaviors are how we evolve to take maximum advantage of the other people in our environment. With me I think there's just no layer of emotional programming obfuscating this fact. So AITA for faking my way through social encounters entirely based on the end result I prefer?",

After that he told me he promised me to never try again which made me happy for the moment.\n\nFFW Two weeks later he hasn't showed up to class  for a solid 3 months which had me worrying that he may have killed himself. I try to text and call him but to no avail. Next thing I know I get a call from him and he told me he tried to hang himself and his parents caught him in the act. He was then sent to some mental health camp thing for those 3 months. I was pissed but I didn't want to tell him because I feared it'd trigger him to want to do it again. So for the time he was back I pretended to be still into him despite me losing interest because I felt I was stabbed in the back. He didn't know til I told him 2 months later. He was devastated but he understood why.\n\nI left out some details and stuff because it was long ago so sorry if there's some confusing parts but ask questions \n\nAm I the asshole for leading him on?

      "description": "So let me just start by giving you guys a little background. I'm currently 20 years old and in my 3rd year of college. Growing up seemed pretty regular with the exception of a very emotional abusive father and stockholmed syndrome mother (Married 32 years). We weren't always really well off on money but my father's business slowly got better and during my years through highschool we lived pretty comfortable. They could definitely afford college for me but I really didn't want to go to school on their dime. Although this might seem or be really prideful. I have just recognized throughout life that the things I don't buy or earn , I don't appreciate. There is also an awesome feeling when completing something you did by yourself. It was the last semester of my senior year at highschool and after hearing another one of my parents fights (They got pretty bad/abusive) I tried to make it clear I wanted to pay for college on my own. When telling my mother (The one I feel more comfortable talking to) she told me \" Listen, don't fuck up the last 17 years I spent suffering for you\". I was really bothered but decided to take the money to appease everyone. Don't get me wrong I notice the sacrifice my parents made for me growing up but I don't believe that I should be forced to take \"gifts\". Fast forward a year , Im a freshman in college. I come home  and stay with my parents for the break. During which another arguement/fight happens between my mom and my dad and I happen to get caught in the middle of it. My dad depersonalizes pretty quick and will cut anyone who is in his sight down. He told me while hitting the top of his shoulders sarcastically with his hand \" I spend alot of money every year for you to go to school and it sits right on my fucking neck\".( My tuition isn't more than 5% of my parents income) \" I wish you'd had never come home\". This infuriates me because I didn't want his fucking money in the first place. Everything I have ever gotten from them has seems to come locked with a ball and chain. Now, present day I'm in my third year because I keep telling my self It wont matter as long as I graduate. I have this overwhelming dread that I'm not able to do things my way and that they will contribute my degree to themselves and that I wont feel as if I have earned my degree. There are multiple instances where I'm reminded by the both of them of the financial \"burden\" I seem to be and how ungrateful I am to ask if I can do it on my own. My siblings tell me that I'm spoiled and that I should count my blessings. They also tell me that I would never be able to do it. I do want to go to school and prosper in my respective field (nursing) but I wanted to do it on my own terms. ( I know its hard, but I know I can do it.) Am I the asshole? Also I have no individual money and I wouldn't know what to do If I did make a decision to leave this money behind.",

We had an argument yesterday because they kept saying I needed to eat and I looked like I was dying.

All the girls called me bitch and basically aren’t talking to me. I messaged alexa saying I was sorry but that it was complete double standards the way they all go on about my weight but say nothing to her, she messaged me back saying ‘maybe cause I don’t look like I’m about to drop dead’. \n\nI’m basically not talking to any of them now but I feel like I didn’t do anything wrong and they’re being really hypocritical.

      "description": "This happened a week or two ago.\n\nBackground: A couple recently moved in to my spare room.\n\nThe other day I was out the front of the garage maintaining my bike. On the ground near me was a pair of scales I was using to weigh some parts. My housemate came into the garage and started moving things around in his van, looking like he was getting ready to leave. I started to move my stuff out of the way. My housemate started moving his van of the garage while I was still moving my things out of the way, and drove over my scales. \n\nThe scales were given to me by my aunt as a moving out of home present a few years ago, and [are reasonably expensive new](https://www.josephjoseph.com/en-rw/triscale). The moment he drives over them he stops and wonders what just happened. I walk over, pick them up, and show him they're broken. At the time he looked sorry, and we said that we'd sort it out when he got back.\n\nLater that night I let my housemate know which brand of scales they were and that I'd let him sort it out.\n\nRecently he transferred me some money for getting his bike wheel fixed and I asked him how he was going with the scales. He replied saying \"They were much more expensive than i thought\" and \"Also thinking about it not really sure if it was my fault but happy to negotiate\"\n\nI'm not sure what to do. At the time that he broke them he didn't have a proper job having just moved and was doing uber eats deliveries on his bike. He just recently got a job as a carpenter (his professional trade) and is earning good money. Given he's my new housemate I don't want to muddy the waters and make things awkward straight off the bat, but at the same time I did like those scales and would like them replaced.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "Even though I'm going to be a lifelong bachelor (and am used to the lifestyle), I do entertain guests every once-in-awhile, during which time I do everything I can to make sure they're comfortable, in a reasonably clean environment, and that they aren't inconvenienced in my home.\n\nI was called up by an ex, and a couple days later by an old friend I hadn't spoken to for years, asking for my help getting her moved. Sure.\n\nWe killed it, and had the U-haul back an hour and a half earlier than we expected, largely due to my being objective about it and just getting shit done.\n\nWasn't expecting much that weekend...of course there would be a mess. But it was her birthday the very next weekend, and we made plans to get together and for me to spend a couple nights. I offered to cook dinner, etc.\n\nA week goes by, and I go down. The exact same dirty dishes are still in the sink from the previous week, plus some. In fact, there isn't a single clean fork or plate in the place. My friend finally went out and bought a box of plastic silverware, but I went out and got paper plates and trash-bags...because the garbage was overflowing to the point where I couldn't even cut up an onion and throw the bag away without it tumbling onto the floor.\n\nThe whole weekend, they proceed to spend most of their time in silence, staring at their phones, in complete silence except for the occasional laughter as they shared memes over FB while they're sitting 10 feet from each-other, and here I am, no data-plan, not a phone junkie, sitting there wondering why, between a childhood friend, and an ex, there's no conversation going on while we're all in the room together.\n\nI got a bit pissed...but didn't show it until a week or so later, when something my ex said on FB set me off. I called her out that they were willing to call me their friend, but didn't treat me like one, and they both got pissed, and \"hurt\"....to the point where I had to apologize just for them to talk to me.\n\nSo what I gather from this is that if I say something that hurts them, it's my fault....but if I'm hurt by the things they've done, it's also my fault, and I should apologize.\n\nGranted, I wasn't particularly nice when I told them off, but I managed to explain my side...it wasn't just a string of curse-words or anything.

      "description": "Names are fake for privacy.\n\nI've been living with Roommate for a few years and we get along alright other than the shit we give each other sometimes. Recently, Roommate has been going over to our friend Bill's house to smoke weed. Every time he goes over, he always asks to smoke, and his was of making up for not having his own weed is giving them money. They don't seem to mind it at all, so I guess it works.\n\nTonight I was hanging out with Bill and Co. and Roommate got stoned. As soon as he did, he wouldn't shut the hell up. Some of the things that happened include:\n\n- Requesting music from Alexa while someone is in the process of picking a song (ex. someone says hey alexa and before they can finish he yells a song real loud)\n\n- Being really loud in general\n\n- Backseating everything we do (ex. someone looks for a clip on YouTube and he says \"hey we should watch this\" repeatedly)\n\n- Taunting people when they ask him to stop being an asshole (ex. a friend told him to shut up and his reaction was \"fuck you ya piece of shit\")\n\n- Yelling when people are beating him in games (its like a low pitched HEY that almost sounds like barking and he won't stop doing it)\n\nThis is just a small assortment of how he acts sometimes. It's a big reason I don't hang around him when he smokes. One of our other friends almost punched him for being obnoxious. When he gets home, I planned on taking some time to tell him he needs to stop being such a dick when he's high. I have done that in the past and he has always said \"I can't help it, I'm high. That's just how I act when I'm high.\" And I find that extremely hard to believe because I have been stoned before and I never had the urge to yell or anything.\n\nSo the big question is would I be the asshole for telling him he's being an asshole?",

      "description": "I took off 10 days at my fast food job to study for a big test coming up at my school. Now I know that can be a bit of overkill, but I really need to do well on this test as my ability to get a higher education depends pretty heavily on this. \n\nNot only did I take this off to study, but I took it off for my mental health and to allow myself to relax and have time to do things that I don’t get to do. \n\nI requested this time off about a month ago, and I was told that Valentine’s Day is a “required” day to work at my job, after I requested it. I was scheduled for the whole time off completely. But when I was talking with my managers they said that I have to come in on this day even though I  requested this chunk of time off, and the GM approved it. \n\nI told them that if they were severely understaffed, I would come in, as that also applies to the rest of the time that I took off, but I was told by several other people that Valentine’s Day doesn’t really get busy. \n\nI was told the only reason why they schedule people to work on Valentine’s Day is so that people don’t get mad when others don’t have to work it and it shows favoritism. But I’m pretty sure they’re going to just send me home after 3 hours because I’m always the one they send home first. Even then I never work Thursday’s, and they don’t need a fully staffed store to work that day. \n\nI’m not spending this time to be with someone, go on a date or anything, I’m spending it doing homework and studying. I don’t think that I should be required to go to work on a day that I don’t normally work, even though it’s not “fair” to the others. The GM isn’t showing favoritism because I’m taking more that just that day off, and it’s literally the first time I’ve requested off in the almost 4 months I’ve been there. Is it wrong that I think I shouldn’t be required to work a day when I know I’m just going to get sent home early? \n\nAlso to add, nobody else in my store except for a select few people are in relationships, and I’m like 80% sure that none of them care that I have the day off, because I’m not using it to go on a date or anything. They also all know how important this test is to me and nobody has told me that they find it unfair that I was scheduled off.  I really don’t want to make my coworkers mad at me for not coming, but at the same time I’m one of the only ones who has never called out and always shows up for their shift on time. I will go if I really have to, but I would really prefer to spend this time studying. ",

      "description": "(backstory) One day he tells me of a group chat he is a part of with his other friends and I want to join in; and after some time he lets me in. Most of the people on it are internet trash. After realizing it'd be impossible to be good friends with those people I decided i had enough of them and blocked most of them. I have this other steam friend i've been friends with for much longer than my first mentioned steam friend and as of recently they have been coming onto steam less and less and I've been sort of sad about it whereas before we'd talk often.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo one day randomly I message my first mentioned friend messages me out of the blue, as normally I'm the one to start talking to him. When I got the notification for a steam message, I was hoping it would be for my better-known friend, but instead I got my other friend. I, (completely feel I was the asshole HERE) went in a small fit of rage in frustration over him not being my better known friend and then shortly realized after I had been an asshole and did a quick apology. I don't normally have stupid tantrums like that but I did. He, in response, tells me he wants to spend a week without talking to me, which I can respect. 3 days later a mutual friend of ours invites me back into the group chat, and I get to read what my friend that Ive known for a year for and his other internet trashy friends that somewhat hate me for being in a fandom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUp until this point I've kept my promise of not bothering him, but then I read some of the stuff he said behind my back I had to confront him about it. He said stuff like \"EVACUATE\" once he saw that I was being re-invited and before that I found he and his friends talked about how I was a loser with no friends except for my \"dead\" friend and the one mutual friend. I felt the need to confront him about him back talking me and when i did, he didn't respond. I unfriended him on the spot. When he found out I unfriended him, my mutual friend copy pasted his text and sent me him saying \"he isn't my problem anymore\" as if i was a nuisance. I try using our mutual friend as a courier to relay messages as Ive already unfriended my 1 year long friend and I try telling him \"I feel really hurt by your actions\" and proceeded to say again \"well that isn't my problem anymore, he said he would fuck over anyone who wronged him and he's been wronging me ever since (friend I've known longest) has been taking more absence so why shouldn't I try to fuck him over?\" (direct quote). I ask our mutual friend to have my other friend re-add me so he wouldn't have to be a courier anymore, as the mutual friend stated he's felt awkward relaying messages as such. our mutual friend relays, \"I really dont want to talk to him, just don't be a messenger. Just tell him I'm done with him and that's that.\" and that was that. I tried saying to him \"I'm done with HIM not the other way around\" to keep a sense of dignity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA in total?",

We both were best friends before we started dating and after my ex broke my heart we have been fighting for two months on the most random things cause we try to keep the promise we made about still remaining friends of a break up were to occur. He was roasting me and making me feel angry and he told me that I can’t roast him and I say oh yea I can, I can make u cry. He says try all u want that’s impossible. And I did, I made a roast on his dead Uncle. It was along the lines of how his Uncle is thanking god he left before having a look and my ex’s dull and boring future. The worst part is, I regretted it the moment I sent it and I was gonna delete  it but then he saw it. And he hates my guts now.  But am I really the asshole? He kept demeaning me by saying I can’t roast him to the point of crying and when I attempted to he thinks I’m insensitive and a bitch. I gotta agree I was insensitive but I can’t take the whole blame right? ",

I'm 14 soon to be 15 and for Christmas I got this real nice Bluetooth speaker, I barely have a good time to use so I usually play some real nice classic rock with the speaker(shout-out to classic rock fans!). \n\nBoth siblings do not like my music (TBH I think it's only because I listen to it.) And both my parents love my music but aren't home when this happens because of work. My younger kind of entitled sister always yells, never asks, but yells at me for playing my music and demands I turn it off. The only reason I don't is because I am usually a pushover and I don't want her to think she can do whatever whenever. My brother on the other hand will usually ask and most times when he asks I do turn it off because he asked(and also he is a huge jerk most other times).\n\nBTW I mostly play music in the morning because my parents tell me to turn it off if they are doing literally anything.\n\nAITA?",

      "description": "There’s a person at my school that I’ll call S. Basically everyone teases him and makes fun of his anger outbursts, since he has autism. I decided to be a decent person and be a friend to him, and naturally he got very attached to me, as some autistic people do.\nHe asked for my number, and I gave it to him. I kind of expected it would happen that he slams me with 50,000 texts a day and gets pissed when I don’t respond. I respond as much as I possibly can, but I do have activities and stuff I have to tend to.\nOf course he gets pissed and spams me endlessly. Sometimes I just don’t want to talk with him, because he wants to do this very weird role play with me that has the same exact plot, he gets kidnapped and it’s up to me to save him before he gets killed. (I’m male btw, he’s not trying to make it a romance role play. I mean, he knows I’m gay, but he points out a lot he is straight.)\nI’m sick of doing the exact same role play. It’s not fun and he overdoes it and stresses me out, demanding I reply. I have never ignored his messages on purpose, but I’d like to. I have told him he texts too much, but he ignores it.\nReddit, am I an asshole for considering just ignoring him when I don’t want to do the role play and/or chat?",

      "title": "AITA for asking my girlfriend to stop being so violent whenever she complains about her problematic sister-in-law?",
      "description": "Some background. Been dating my girlfriend (will be referred to as “Jen”) for about four years, since my senior year of high school (she is two years older than me). \n\nShe has a brother (I’ll call him “Ben”) who has been in a pretty rocky relationship with his girlfriend (She’ll be “Pip”) for around two years. Ben is from my high school graduating class, I think she’s a year younger. Ben and Pip’s relationship has been difficult for a myriad of reasons I feel I’m not informed on enough to give a complete account here, although I can say with certainty that they have broken up several times, both cheated at one point, both displayed some emotionally abusive behavior (she once claimed pregnancy to prevent him from leaving, and I don’t think he’s been a star boyfriend either). They’ve been through one abortion (possibly more, don’t know for sure) but about 11 months ago Pip got pregnant and they decided to keep it. They had the baby, and now live together.\n\nNow, to contrast, Jen and I’s relationship is very strong, I can confidently say that marriage is very likely to be our future, and we’ve discussed so in the past. \n\nEver since Jen learned of some of the emotionally abusive behavior Pip demonstrated, Jen loathes Pip. Jen refuses to be at many family gatherings and events if Pip is in attendance, and when she is, Jen will avoid her at all costs. Whenever she talks about Pip, it is with some pretty vile language. She has a darker personality/vocabulary/whatever so it’s not uncommon for her to verbally wish she’d die in a car crash, for example, or saying she’d like to slit her throat. \n\nRecently, Pip has made some very questionable statements/actions that cause great concern in Jen for her new nephew. For example, Pip has announced she is skeptical of the benefits of vaccines, and may not vaccinate the kid. Also, she has a particular distaste for the “LGBT Agenda” in that she opposes the existence of a gender spectrum or non-heterosexual behavior being taught in schools, and has expressed a desire that her kid be “Straight, or nothing.” Jen identifies as a member of the LGBT community and thus LGBT issues are very important to her.\n\nFinally, the reason for my post. When Jen brings up the stuff she dislikes about Pip, I agree with almost everything she says, and share her passion and concern for the child. But I also urge her not to use such violent and descriptive language when talking about her. This happens often, and usually ends in her being furious with me because she feels she isn’t being heard by her family at large, so when I bring this up she gets a similar feeling. \n\nI don’t want her to use that language for two reasons: one, so that it doesn’t affect her mental health, constantly wishing death and violence on someone she knows in person. Two, if there is ever a custody battle over the child, I don’t want her comments (some in text message form) being used to make the case the child is not safe with her side of the family. (Her fam has some shady stuff in their past that could contribute to that case) \n\nAm I The Asshole?",

Neither of us are working(he has a job but it's choose your own schedule and he chooses to not work), so most of our money comes from hoarding what we get from holidays and birthdays. As such he asked that instead of paying me back in cash if he could do my household chores to pay me back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him no and he said I was being heartless and that I have no sympathy. I understand why he'd rather work it off rather than pay me back in cash, but then for the same reasons that's exactly the reason why I want cash rather than having him do my \"backbreaking\" chores(all I do is take care of our cats and take out the trash once a week). He did agree to go and actually start taking jobs to pay me back(although he's only giving me half of what he earns even though we live with our parents and have no expenses?). He's still super pissed though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n So AITA?",

      "description": "I have considered a guy my best friend for about six years, and have had some feelings for him for several of these. He always seemed to be giving signs of interest, some really quite blatant, so like 3 or 4 months ago, I texted him to tell him how I felt (something I find incredibly difficult).\n\nHis response was positive - while he said he \"didn't want to jeopardise anything\", he also \"really likes [me] too\", and I was overjoyed. His offer was to \"hang out as more than friends\", and while I kind of wanted a relationship, I felt this to be a good starting point.\n\nEver since, in school (I know, I know) he has been pretty normal, and has been even more physically affectionate, always putting his leg against mine, touching me unnecessarily, and other, slightly more direct approaches. He also makes lots of flirty jokes, frequently  calls me \"pet\" and sometimes \"babe\", etc.\n\nHowever, ever since the text, he has totally blown off any plans I tried to make with him, claiming to be busy. Meanwhile however, he makes no effort to hide the fact he regularly meets other people for coffee, meals etc, which I find somewhat offensive. He doesn't text that much either. This is on top of other signs of disinterest he showed prior to this - quite openly not caring to remember my birthday, showing off slightly extravagant gifts he was giving to others while having never given me a gift of any sort in six years (as I recall).\n\nYesterday, he also talked to someone else about how he would go to the school formal (similar to prom, I guess?) next year \"if [he] had a boyfriend by then\". This was sort of the straw that broke the camel's back, as I guess it showed that he wanted a boyfriend- just not me, given the lack of serious interest he had shown, and despite what he said. I feel like he just said yes to keep me around as some sort of insurance if he doesn't find someone better, or he wanted attention/affection without having to actually do or commit to anything.\n\nThoughts? Am I being unreasonable? I don't want to pressure him into anything, I'd be happy if he would just not lie (I see no other explanation) about being too busy to go for a drink or whatever. The fact he enthusiastically tells me about how hot he finds practically every single passing human male doesn't help either, especially given the lovely lifelong self esteem issues I've got going on.",

      "description": "The garage I took my girlfriend's car to to get it fixed decided to fix the stereos wiring while they had the dash apart replacing a few gauges that stopped working. (NOTE THE STEREO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHY THE GAUGES WHERE MESSING UP). We have a contract for the work that he was doing and the price. So when I go to pick the car up the person who man's the cash register tries to charge me a extra 50$ for fixing the wiring and replacing a speaker that was shorted out. I'm assuming the $50 was mainly to cover the cost of the speaker they put in but still. I gave him the original $300 for the work we agreed on and have a contract for. And asked for my keys. The cashier refused  saying I didn't pay the full amount.First I suggest just having the mechanic take apart the door to remove the speaker they added. The cashiers called the mechanic and talked to him for a little while. But ultimately I was told no and to just pay the extra money.  We get into a short argument over it I said if he doesn't hand over the keys I'll call the cops and report that the shop stole my car. Eventually the cops are called because I was tired of trying to reason with the guy and he had brought my girlfriend into it who was with me to drive the car home. Once the cops arrived they ordered the cashier to either give me my keys and let me go or have one of the people that worked in the shop remove the part.  He gave my keys back and let me go. AITA for not paying for extra work I didn't consent to? \n\n\nTLDR: the shop  did extra work without my consent and tried to charge me for it. Cops where called after he brought my girlfriend into the argument. I got my keys back and left without paying the extra charge. ",

      "description": " \n\nMy 24 year old step-son, let's call him Caden, used to be such a sweet, bright kid. We spent many a night talking about our favourite animes, like naruto and dragon ball z. He was the best kind of kid you could ask for. When he turned 18, I assumed that he would pursue his dream of being an animator, like he had talked about many times before. However, he just burrowed deeper into his shell, losing his friends from high school and becoming quite ornery and lazy. I did not give up hope though, and still tried my best to encourage him to pursue his dreams, yet he became more and more stubborn with me.  \n\n(I should mention at this point I caught him smoking weed often. Being a frequent blazer myself, I thought that this wasn't related, but now I see how he used it to escape reality, whereas i just used it to unwind)\n\nAs the weeks and months and year passed, I began to lose hope. Somewhere along the line, caden started browsing 4chan and he started to become radicalized. He began to spout alt-right rhetoric, and soon I found him saying racist things I would never expect to come from his mouth. When I asked him if he had found a job, he would scream at me about how the jews steal all the money and give it to transsexual gay n-words. I mean, he was just flat out bigoted and ignorant. This was really weighing on me, but last week was the final straw. I entered his room while he was in the bathroom, and what I found shocked me. A layer of filth reigned. A foul stench overpowered me. But this was nothing compared to what I saw when I looked up. All over the walls, posters with neo-nazi slogans and disgusting comics depicting minorities were pasted. I nust lost my temper completely. As a man whose ancestors were oppressed for their faith, I just could not let this happen in my house. Reddit, I lost my shit. I gave him $50 and told him I never wanted to see his face again. I was absolutely gutted after the rage wore off, but I knew I could not play any further role in supporting this disgusting behaviour. All I want is for my cute, smart little caden to come back, but I know that can never happen again.    \n\nTLDR; bigoted, racist scumbag son gets kicked out for his appalling behaviour",

      "description": "So, a bit of context here. I'm 17, turning 18 in May. My father has been smoking since long before I was even born, (First child) and in fact was involved with many other kinds of drugs and alcohol and the like. Luckily, he cleaned up his act once I came around and now he only smokes his cigarettes. But the thing is, he smokes constantly. Like, every half hour constantly. I figure this type of thing is normal because my uncle who lives with us does the same. My father had only recently moved back in with us as he had done jail time and so I had gotten pretty used to not smelling the smoke all that much. But now that he's back, I smell it literally everywhere. His clothes, his jacket, and especially on him. I'm very conscious about this type of thing and would rather not be near him during and after the smoking. I can smell it when no one else can, and know exactly when and if he had been smoking. \n\nAt first I figured he was understanding about it because whenever I told him about the times when my uncle would wave a cigarette in my face, he would get very upset. But now I see how he really thinks. Whenever I walk past him smoking, I cover my face. Whenever we're in the car and I can smell it, I cover my face. I rarely give him hugs because he reeks of cigarettes. And this seems to piss him off immensely. He constantly says stuff like \"Oh we're outside you can't even smell it.\" \"Youre exaggerating.\" or the one that kinda ticks me off most, \"Oh stop covering your mouth because know your little brother copies you and he's going to act just like you.\" as if it's a personal offense to him that I dare cover my face. \n\nNow the only reason I absolutely hate the cigarettes is because I've seen what all those substances have done to my dad and his side of the family. The drugs, the alcohol, even the cigarettes. I've made a personal vow to myself to not even touch a cigarette, yet I'm constantly breathing in the smoke from my dad. I'm not asking him to stop smoking, I just don't understand why it's such a big deal to him that I cover my face around him. By the way, I act the exact same when my uncle smokes and he's even worse, calling me a baby and shit like that for not wanting the smoke in my face. \n\nAm I the asshole for expecting my dad (and uncle) to understand my feelings about the smoking? Am I actually being a baby about this?\n\nTL;DR : I cover my nose around my dad because he constantly reeks of smoke and smokes near me, and gets angry that I do. ",

      "description": "I want to start off by saying I am not the least bit transphobic, I believe everyone should have the freedom to live however they want to. I may not understand it, but I would die to defend your right to live happily. However, when you sign up for tinder, you explicitly have to list your gender, and you have to list what gender you are interested in. This is done so all types of sexualities can find what they are looking for. So it’s a little unnerving when I’m swiping and I come across a transgender woman. It seems futile on their side, because the tinder parameters they chose means that everyone they are swiping on is a straight male. It would seem like for their benefit, they should state they are a man looking for other men, rather than submitting that they are a female looking for men. It’s not like anyone with the tinder parameters “male looking for female”  is suddenly going to see a transgender woman and decide that’s what they’re looking for. Anyways, please enlighten me, and I know this is a touchy subject and I have no ill will for the transgender community at all, so I’d appreciate a civil response. Thanks.",

      "title": "AITA for 'abandoning' my mother and not having any contact with her even though she needs me?",
      "description": "This last month has been the worst month I have ever lived through in my entire life so get ready to read some drama. I'm on mobile so sorry for any typos. Also, I'm leaving some stuff out but I will answer with extra info if people ask about it.\n\nI recently turned 20 and was living with my mother until around two weeks ago - but a month or two ago is when shit really started to get bad. \n\nMy mother has had depression and suffered from mental illness from when I was around 7. She would usually take prescribed medication to deal with these problems but within the last few months she decided that she would come off it (without consulting a doctor) so she could lose weight. Mind you, she didn't come off just any medication, she came off of her anti-psychotics. Life soon became constant mood swings and arguments. I would stay in my room all day to avoid her, sleep when she's awake, etc. \n\nThe whole reasoning behind stopping her medication was because she wanted to be more skinny for her new man. At the start of the summer she decided to start dating her best friends recently separated husband in secret. He soon went to prison wanted for theft so they'd been talking to each other via phone calls and prison visits. \n\nHe wasn't giving her the time or attention she wanted and she soon became really paranoid maybe he was playing her. She would write him really angry letters and then write him really sappy apology letters straight after. She thought up about a million scenarios in her head about how he could be using her or cheating on her (somehow from prison?) and she analysed everything he ever said to her. Even really random obscure things from months ago that could possibly have a hidden meaning.\n\nEventually she called accused him of being a compulsive liar over the phone because she didn't believe anything he said. He hung up on her and after that he didn't call again. She assumed (and rightly so) things were over. \n\nSomething made her snap and she told her friend about how she had been seeing her separated husband. She regretted it almost immediately as essentially she had lost one of her best friends and mostly everyone she knew afflicted with them. It wasn't easy and there were a few screaming matches, but I managed to convince her to go back on her medication to help her feel better.\n\nThis part of the story is where it escalates... So, about a month ago there was some supposed 'hackers' trying to get into her Facebook. Immediately she assumed it was her ex best friend. She changed all her passwords. Then it wasn't Facebook, it was PayPal that was 'hacked'. Soon after it wasn't just PayPal and Facebook it was everything. None of her passwords worked. I tried to tell her that she probably just changed them and forgot about what they were, but she KNEW it was hackers. \n\nI'd like to throw in, my mother also knows nothing about technology. She barely knows how to navigate to google. \n\nSoon after the 'hackers' were into her accounts, she then got it into her head they were also 'tapped into' our wifi as well as her phones. At one point she said the house was bugged. She started believing that people were stalking her. People were 110% watching her and listening to her 24/7. \n\nEvery time she came to me with a problem I was able to solve it. For example, her fingers were too fat to go into her settings menu, so she was completely convinced it was the 'hackers' doing. I just touched it in front of her and it opened and she would say something like \"Oh, well it worked because it was you. The hackers don't want you\". \n\nI tried my best to explain to her that she doesn't understand that that's not how hacking works or technology and I was giving her rational answers - but she was having none of it. She bought two new phones and an iPhone. She bought a new house phone. She got the wifi router changed.\n\nI began telling her that she needed help and that she had lost it. I told her that the hackers weren't real, that she needed to stop this. She became enraged and all hell ensued about how I was the most terrible awful daughter for not believing her, how could I ever do this to her? Why was I against her? Was I the hacker? She told me she was suicidal and I'd regret how I treated her when I come home and find her hanging.\n\nTwo weeks ago it got to the point where she wasn't sleeping or eating, the house had become a bomb site. She was paying some random man to come and fix her devices and she needed my iPad for some reason. I refused to give it to her. She poured water over my head while I had my eyes closed in bed. She took the worst tantrum I have ever seen and she began shrieking and acting completely nuts. She took a glass bottle and I thought she was going to throw it at me but instead she set it down and lifted up a curling iron. Started banging it off the drawer. I was terrified. \n\nAfter she left my room I just stayed there in shock and scared to get up in case she heard me and came back in. I was crying, she was crying, it was hysterical. She left in her car to go get something from a local shop and as soon as she left I packed my bags and I didn't go back. I found out that this entire time she had been lying to me and she wasn't actually on her medication either.\n\nI ended up sofa surfing for a week until I was blessed to have found an organisation that would give me somewhere to live until I could get back on my feet. This is where I am currently. \n\nEarlier today, I was speaking to the son of basically the only friend my mum has left. I wanted to know if my mum was ok, and I told him that I had rang my mums doctor and explained what had been happening and if he or his mum were able, I asked him if they could convince her to go and see her doctor. He told me I needed to suck up how I was feeling and be there for her. He said she needed me and I had to put whatever feelings of my own behind hers. I told him I felt like it was rude for him to say that to me when he doesn't fully know the situation. I was also told by the support workers from the organisation that not talking to her and staying away from her (for my own mental health) was the best option for me. \n\nThis is what he said to me:\n\"All I know is if my mum was like yours I wouldn't abandon her after years of her rasing me because I'm a self centered cunt who needs the world to feel sorry for them. If your mum actually kills herself, whether it's on purpose or not, and I really believe that might happen, it'll be on you. So don't go back to her, or do. Whatever. I've my own shit to sort out. Bye.\"\n\nI don't want the world to feel sorry for me. I don't ever talk about my problems publicly. I never wanted this to be about me, but that day she went nuts with the curling iron made me realise I couldn't be around her without feeling scared. I felt like I was literally living with a crazy person. \n\nRegardless, of course I am concerned about her. I love her so much. I just wish she was how she was before any of this stupid shit ever happened. I miss how we use to be. I feel really conflicted after he said that to me, though. Maybe I actually am being selfish by not being there for her? I don't know anymore.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being there for her?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "This is somewhat of a long story so I’ll try to keep it as informative and short as possible but please bare with me.\n\nFor context, I am an almost 25 year old woman and my younger brother is 22. My mom is 56 and my dad is 53.\n\nMy dad had an affair with a random woman in 2011. My parents had seemed to work it out. My mom wanted couples counseling but my dad never followed through with that and then everything was forgotten (I did not forget). Great, whatever, that’s their marriage.\n\nHowever, last year my mom found out that my dad was having another affair. This time with a family friend. This woman, let’s call just call her Gloria, had known my dad in high school but were never friends until later in life when we would rent her cabin on a lake for family vacations. Gloria was always super sweet, fun, and had hung out with my family a few times on these vacations. Gloria and her husband started befriending my parents more, and her and my mother became closer friends.\nA few years pass, and my dad’s mom dies. Suddenly he’s going to visit his hometown (about 10hrs from where we live and where my grandmas house is) to go through old belongings and I suppose to reminisce. We were all very supportive. \nBut then, my mom starts hearing from friends who live there that they’ve been seeing Gloria and my dad out and about together, in an inappropriate context. My mom confronts my dad and he admits that yes, he’s been seeing her for 2 years behind her back. Apparently all the times he spent in his hometown, he was really with her. And when he went to Florida to fix up a trailer my family owns (which we rent out), she went with him.\n\nThis was much more devastating to my mom, me, and my brother than the first time. We know this woman personally, and she also has a husband and son. It cut deep.\n\nFast forward 6 months and my parents are still “trying to work things out” and he claims he is not seeing or talking to her anymore. My dad and my mom have always had a retirement plan to sell their current home and move near the town they went to college to and get a home on the lake. My mom is close to retirement. So my dad tells my mom he’s been applying to jobs in that area and he gets it. My dad heads up there and he finds a house, and he buys it. My mom agreed to all of this.\nHowever it was all a lie. My dad tricked my mom into signing documents that tie that new house into their current house’s mortgage. And now Gloria is living with him up there. She even changed her address to that house!\n\nGloria’s husband divorced her when he found out about the affair, and share custody of their son who is a senior in high school. However, my parents refuse to divorce for financial reasons, and instead are just separating.\n\nNow comes the important part. This really hurt my brother and I. It hurts to see my dad treat my mom this way with absolutely no remorse. As an adult, I can also empathize with my mom and it’s hard.\n\nMy dad has never apologized to me and my brother for hurting us.\n\nAfter an extensive conversation with my brother we decided to confront my dad together and give him an ultimatum which is “We don’t care if you separate from mom and date other people, we just don’t want you with Gloria. If you stay with Gloria we are cutting you out of our lives completely” this includes not coming to my graduation, wedding, being in grandchildren’s lives. Ya know, the stuff that is supposed to matter to a parent. \nWe explain to him why we want this. That Gloria will forever be a symbol of the pain he caused, that we don’t want her anywhere near us. And that he never apologized for hurting us and that hurts even more.\n\nMy dad’s response? “Well I’m not married to you guys, you live your life and I’ll live mine”. In the 45min conversation where we laid out all our feelings to him, he still refused to take responsibility for the hurt he caused and he still hasn’t apologized. \n\nHe then goes on to call us awful for giving him an ultimatum like that, and he doesn’t understand why he can’t be with Gloria even after we clearly explained how we felt and why we felt that way.\n\nI blocked him on all social media accounts and I intend to stick to my word. I’ve come to the conclusion that he’s selfish and he’s never really been there for us anyways. But it’s still bothering me if I’m really doing the right thing here. Maybe my dad was right, it was unfair to do that? But he showed no remorse, took no responsibility, and never apologized before OR after we gave him the ultimatum. \n\nSo, AITA for giving my dad an ultimatum and then cutting him out of my life?\n\nEDIT: To be fair, I genuinely do not care if he isn’t with my mom. If they’re unhappy I want them to divorce! Find other people and be happy!! My brother and I just can’t find it within ourselves to forgive Gloria and move past it. The only reason why we gave my dad a second chance is because, well he’s our dad.\n\nI don’t want Gloria in my life and if I ever have kids I certainly would not want her to know them or for them to know her.",

      "description": "This has been eating away at me for a while. The story is kinda long and boring but I hope you can help me settle this.\n\nI have this very, very close and old friend, (fake name) Arya. I moved away from our hometown to a different country with my husband. We rent a place from some really nice people. I let her know she could come visit anytime.\n\nA couple of months pass and she wants to come to the country we live in to see a festival. She asks if she can stay with us; unfortunately we planned a vacation at that time but I tell her it's fine and that I'll give her the keys to our apartment somehow. She has other friends she could stay with, but prefers having a flat to herself. \nAt this point I already have some conflicted feelings about this, as I'm not totally comfortable about leaving the keys to anyone; it's a rented place and we never talked to the landlords about situations like this, and I feel they wouldn't be 100% happy about it. \nMy husband is also generally uncomfortable with both using other people's places while they are away and letting people stay at his place when he's not there, but he's willing to compromise in this situation as Arya and I are really close friends. I love her vey much and don't feel like telling her not to come; I want to do this favour for her.\n\nA few weeks pass and we don't get a chance to see each other (I don't fly out to our hometown and she doesn't travel where we live either). We both totally forget about the whole thing and just 3 days before we leave for our vacation I message her about it and ask if she has any friends I could leave the keys to. She does, and gives me her contact. Her friend is extremely rude and tells me she can't take the keys as she's busy, but lets me know I can leave them to her mom (?) at her mom's workplace (??) and that if she's not there when I come I can leave them at the reception (???). \n\nAt this point I'm getting extremely uncomfortable and I tell Arya that I don't really feel like doing this and ask her if she could change her mind and stay with her other friends. She gets extremely angry and doesn't talk to me for weeks. When we finally talk again, she won't really explain why she got angry and says that it's obvious.\n\nAITA in this situation for asking her to reconsider staying at out place? We never really talked this out and just ignore it now, but it was a pretty big fight.",

      "title": "AITA for forcing my mom to sell the property she planned to retire in?",
      "description": "My mom lives in a different state. I moved away from home awhile back and have lived in a different state for close to 16 years, let's say Oregon. She and I are the only family each other has - I don't have a dad, don't have siblings, she doesn't have siblings, that's it. She put everything she had into raising me, and I love her dearly for it. I'm there to support her in a lot of different ways, and she is extraordinarily involved in my life, sometimes to an unhealthy degree.\n\nFour years ago, she told me that it would only make financial sense for me and my husband to buy a condo in Oregon, where we've been living and paying rent for all these years. My husband and I didn't have a large amount of savings due to previous financial hardship, so she offers to put in the money for the closing costs, which would be somewhat substantial. I went back and forth on it and told her that I didn't know if I wanted to stay in Oregon, that my husband and I were thinking of living somewhere else when we have kids, and that I couldn't possibly take her money because it was most of the money she had saved up for herself for retirement. For awhile I resisted, but she said we were wasting money and that it would be an investment for her too and she really wanted us to do it, so she convinced me to go through with it.\n\nSo the arrangement we settled on was that she would put the money into the closing costs as an \"investment.\" My husband and I would live in the condo and he and I would cover the monthly mortgage until we were ready to move out, and that hopefully we would move out into a bigger place in Oregon when we have kids and she would move to Oregon to be close to us and retire in the condo that we all bought. We reasoned that if my husband and I wanted to move before then, we could always rent the condo out. \n\nFast forward to now. My husband and I are strongly considering moving out of the condo because we want to move to a different city where we think we would have a better quality of life. In the four years since we bought the condo, they have passed legislation/bylaws that essentially forbid renters. My mom is not yet ready to retire, so she isn't ready to move into the condo. She also reasoned that she only wanted the condo to be close to us, so if we are going to move somewhere else, we should probably just sell it. This would essentially leave her without a place to live when she retires. She would likely get most of her money back from the sale, but would be without a place to retire to. My husband has been incredibly supportive and understanding throughout and is fine with whatever works out best for us all, moving or staying, but I feel so guilty about all of it. I feel like I owe it to her to stay here. \n\nAm I an asshole for wanting to move? Would I be an asshole for putting my mom in this situation? ",

Often times I'll miss a message or two because I'm at work or doing something else even when I go read through all I missed. But I just miss messages in general because I'm not always aware of what I'm reading. Recently we got into another fight about it because they feel I'm always better to others but never to them, and that I selectively ignore their messages, while I always respond to others. \n\nTL;DR\nThey're going through a tough time in life so maybe they're just taking it out on me persay.

      "description": "So my brother’s gf of three years recently broke up with him. My brother (18M) and his ex (17F) made plans to return borrowed stuff and say some final goodbyes.\n\nAt the time, my parents were out of town. So I was asked to drive my brother from our university to home since it’s a bit of a drive and he was taking the break up really hard. The plan from there was that my brother would drive to his ex’s house after arriving home and exchange belongings/words and then drive both himself and his ex over to our house to again exchange belongings/words.\n\nSo we reach home and my brother goes off to his ex’s house. About half an hour later, he returns distraught and breaks into tears. He said that he was returned his belongings, but was unable to talk to his ex much since her parents basically pushed him out the door saying that they were uncomfortable with him being there and that his ex’s grandmother was over.\n\nAfter hearing this, I was pissed. My brother was treated like a complete stranger by people he had met many times before. On top of that, this had been planned for two weeks, he gave a notice of what time he’d arrive an hour in advance, and there was no mention of it not being a good time to meet. Because of this, what little trust I had in both his ex and her parents was absolutely gone. To be fair, it’s possible that my prior biases influenced this since I never especially liked the ex and strongly disliked her mother, but this incident really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nAt this point, my brother had been told that his ex would be dropped off at our house so that they could do the second half of the exchange. I thought that it was also likely that one of her parents may come in as well. My brother was planning on walking with his ex around our house to pick up what they needed. I wasn’t ok with this. I wanted the ex and her parents to be within earshot of me and to be out of our house as soon as possible. I didn’t trust them to be considerate of my brother in the least.\n\nI decidedly didn’t give my brother a choice in what to do with his ex’s belongings. I told him to get what was hers and put it on the kitchen counter. We got into a bit of an argument and so I took it upon myself to grab what I knew was hers and put it on the counter. After asking if that was all, he reluctantly said yes. I wasn’t planning on controlling any other part of their exchange and was going to sit in an adjacent room out of sight when the ex arrived. In the end, the ex and her parents never came to our house and my brother was told to bring her stuff to their house about an hour later.\n\nI do think that I was in the wrong and did end up crossing a line by trying to control a part of my brother’s personal life and his rightful privacy of a situation (especially now since he is legally considered an adult). However, despite this I still can’t help but feel like I had to protect him in some way at that time. AITA for trying to control my younger brother’s breakup?",

We were in long distance relationship in recent three years and were together for more than 5 years. We we're meeting after 5 months and we had planned 2 weeks long vacation in a new country.\n\nFrom the very first day she started acting weird. She said that the relationship might be over after the vacation. We we're having some miscommunication so I said yes, we can take a break and revisit later. \n\nSo, during the vacation, she was spending more time with her phone. No physical intimacy or anything. I was really frustrated and I was trying to make things better. She said that she was not feeling right to be in relationship or something. And she said that there was no particular reason for leaving me.\n\nIn the second last day, I went through her phone. I found out that she was cheating on me for more than 2 months. She even had a another vacation planned with that guy.\n\nThings ended right there. I was shocked and sad. I still have not recovered. \n\nNow, she has been describing me as a \"creep\" to our mutual friends for going through her phone. I don't want to respond to that but it makes me wonder what would have happened if if I never knew. \n\nDo you think I was an asshole for going through her phone? I would feel like shit I had found nothing but my  suspicion came out to be true. \n\nThanks for reading!",

      "title": "AITA for outing my best friend's cheating (now ex-) girlfriend in public?",
      "description": "About two years ago, in our last year of university, my best friend at the time got a girlfriend. She was his first everything: first girlfriend, first kiss, first sex, etc. It was long-distance (he was from the UK, she from Spain) but he was totally smitten with her. After they'd been long-distance dating for a few months, he made a trip to visit her for Christmas. He was super excited and we were all extremely happy for him. \n\nAfter he came back, though, he was a little down and wouldn't tell anyone why. A month or two later, he confided in me that she was still hanging out with her *\"ex\"* (more on that later) regularly, and even brought the ex along on some of their dates. That explained why he had been down, he was worried she was still involved with her ex.\n\nHe went to visit her a couple more times, then one day he we went completely off the radar. He deleted his Facebook account, stopped signing into Discord or Steam, stopped answering his phone and replying to messages. He even stopped turning up for work and got fired. One or two people managed to get through to him in this time, so we knew he was alive.\n\nA month later, he opened up contact again and told us his girlfriend was coming to London to meet everyone. I happened to be in another country while she was in London, but I'm told everyone loved her. She was incredibly sweet and charismatic. Everyone welcomed her with open arms and she fit right in to our little group.\n\nI came back to the UK and my friend opened up to me. He agreed to tell me everything that had happened as long as I kept it a secret from the rest of our group (perhaps I'm an asshole for posting it on the internet though).\n\nHer *\"ex\"* was never her ex, they were still dating. Furthermore, over the course of their \"relationship\" she had slept with 11 different guys. She was completely unapologetic about this, and had been tormenting him with it regularly. She would message him saying \"I'm horny, I guess I'll invite a guy over\" and things like that. She even went to meet a guy she had met on the internet when she came to visit London.\n\nDespite this, she had kept up a perfect image on the outside. Her friends thought that she was in a committed relationship with her *\"ex\"*, and that my friend was some weirdo who had a crush on her. They knew nothing about the 10 other guys that she had slept with over the past year.\n\nShortly after my friend opened up to me, he had another social blackout. This time *no one* could contact him at all. We literally didn't know if he was alive. His girlfriend starting blowing up our group chats trying to garner sympathy. She would say things like, \"I'm so worried about him, I hope he's okay\". Everyone we knew had completely fallen for her and was giving her all the attention she craved, comforting her and \n\nI was going through a pretty dark time (being cheated on by my own girlfriend) and couldn't stand it. I confronted her and said, \"You can't think of any reason he could be sad, can you?\".\n\nShe played dumb, so I pressed some more. She kept insisting that she had no idea what was wrong and people were beginning to get angry at me, saying that I shouldn't give her so much trouble when she's clearly just worried about her boyfriend.\n\nSo I dropped the bomb and in a group chat of almost 200 people said something along the lines of, \"You've slept with 11 different men over the course of your relationship, that's why he's sad.\" She stopped replying. The people who were angry at me before sent me private messages apologising.\n\nA week or so later, my friend came back online and told me that the girl had broken up with him. I told him everything that happened, and it looked like they broke up the day after I called her out in the group chat. He was a little upset with me, and we drifted apart over the next year or so (I moved to another country, so that could be why we drifted apart).\n\nI'm going back to the UK for Christmas and we're gonna hang out, but I'm wondering if it was wrong to tell everyone. Am I the asshole here?",

      "title": "AITA for not housing my \"retired\" aunt who has nowhere to live?",
      "description": "Long story short, my aunt retired from a long museum career at 55 with no savings, very little benefits, and against everyone's advice (including my dad, who is a financial adviser). We all knew she would run out of money in a few years, and couldn't understand what she was thinking. She does have some health problems which, to complicate matters, she often exaggerates to the point that no one is sure how seriously to take her. For example, she's overweight and experiences problems with her knees, back, etc. because of it, but will do anything not to acknowledge this and lose some weight. She also claims to be \"mildly diabetic\", but somehow doesn't need to take insulin. On the other hand, she was hospitalized for a minor procedure last year, and is now saddled with understandably overwhelming medical bills. She is not grossly financially irresponsible by any means that I know of, excepting this rather strange retirement.\n\nShe simply has no money to pay rent, and has been trading house sitting, pet sitting, organizing, administrative work, etc. to live in friend's guest houses for the last five years. Her last arrangement ended, and she is now in need of a place to stay. She has five siblings, including my mom, none of whom are well off enough financially to provide housing for her, and none of whom even have a spare room for her to stay in (everyone lives in 1 bedroom apartments). She has no partner or children, and her parents have both passed.\n\nI'm a 25 year old female, and will be moving soon. I can barely afford a studio apartment in the neighborhood where I work, but perhaps if I committed to a much longer commute I could help her out. In spite of her flaws she's a really lovely person, although she has a lot of things she needs to work out. I feel really bad that no one in the family can help her, and I feel partially responsible for her well being, but I also selfishly don't want to live with family, whom I have been very happy to have some distance from. Would I be TA for not offering her some kind of help?\n\nTL:DR my aunt will have no where to live soon because she retired with no savings, medical debt, and few benefits. Would I be TA for not trying to help her?",

      "description": "So I have know this guy for about 8 years. We met in high school and quickly became friends since we both were kind of the outcasts. He has always been the type of person who is kind of annoying but I never cared because I knew he was just trying to be funny. (side note, he has adhd) Well a few years after high school we ended up working at the same store and I thought it was great! I always enjoyed his company.  We went away to help build up a new store (Same store only in a different city) I really wanted him to go with me since he was my best friend and I'd feel so much better with him there.\n\nWhile working he would continue to be annoying, I thought I was used to it but I guess not. And after awhile he even been to be condesending towards me. Saying stuff like:\n\"You can't handle more then that?\"\n\"You are to slow, stop slacking\" (I was working to the point that I wanted to go cry in the bathroom because of my anxiety)\n\nI asked him to stop multiple times, and guess what, he didn't listen. So after 4 days of putting up with his crap I resorted to text him, telling him to stop annoying me and stop putting himself above me. It was my first time ever building up a new store and he had done it once before but also worked other jobs so of course he could handle the pain and long hours (it was 12 hour shifts with little to no breaks, was going to be working for 14 days ended up leaving after 5). He texted me back saying that I had never asked him to stop annoying me, never asked him to try and be nice etc. He even dragged his 3 year old daughter into it saying:\n\"Even my daughter (not going to write her name) knows how to say stop and she is 3!\"\n\"You learn how to say stop in kindergarten, maybe you should go back there\"\n\nAfter awhile I got tired of this and told him that I appreciated the time we had and hoped he had a good life. I got back:\n\"Sounds good, I don't need people who can't say no in my life. Maybe try and stop being a little bitch 👏🏻 Goodbye 👋🏻\" \n\nSo the reason why I am asking is because almost everyone of our mutual friends says that I was the one who didn't tell him to stop, that I made a mistake breaking up our friendship, you know, since he is just such a good guy. So reddit:\nAITA?\n\n(P.S my first time ever posting anything on reddit and also I am on my phone) ",

      "description": "So this is a complicated situation. Been with my girlfriend around 2 years and have lived together like a month. I love her a lot. Sexually though, we’ve had some issues. She’s down to make out, give head, handjobs, etc. But for whatever reason she’s not into penetration. I really don’t know why. She says it’s unpleasant even with lube. I have tried foreplay, sometimes for hours. It doesn’t seem to help. \n\nThing is though, whenever she drinks, she’s totally fine with penetration. She’ll even get on top and ride me, which is just not a thing if she’s sober. I’m starting to feel bad. I look forward to nights when she goes out with her friend after work and comes home tipsy. Sometimes if she doesn’t hit the bar I’ll make drinks for her, hoping one thing will lead to another. \n\nShe’s never really brought this up. But there have been a few times in the morning she’s asked if we had sex the night before. That concerned me and I got scared I had sex with her while she was blacked out. I was always honest though about whether we did it and she never seemed bothered by it. \n\nBy the way, she’s a very functional drunk. Always coherent. A stranger probably wouldn’t even know. But she’s much more adventurous, which I happen to enjoy. \n\nAm I messed up for this?? ",

      "description": "Recently my car has had some troubles with the clutch (the pedal itself, not the actual clutch). I took it down to a fancy German car garage - I drive a small Audi, and while it’s not particularly expensive, it is my baby and I was willing to pay more to have my car fixed properly. They tell me it’s a pin, and the part should cost me £15, and per hour they are £120 and it’ll take around 1.5 hours so they quote me at £190 something pounds. The per hour fee is expensive, but I’m in an expensive city and in an expensive garage, so I don’t mind, assuming the work will be done perfectly. \n\nCut to go picking up my car after 3 days, got the nasty surprise that they didn’t include tax when quoting me so it ended up being around £240 or so. Whatever, I just want this whole ordeal to be over. It’s a Friday, and I drive myself home (about 2 miles) then to the supermarket (round trip of a mile) and then pick up a friend from the station (half a mile) and the clutch goes again. I’m fuming. My car has done all of 5 miles and it’s broke again. I took it to a bit of a dad garage when I was at home, and they “temporarily” fixed it on New Year’s Day using a bit of plastic. That’s lasted around 700 miles on my car and I paid £15. \n\nI take it back to the garage and the receptionist tells me to speak to the mechanic. He explains he was trying to make it as cheap as possible for me by only replacing one part, but now the entire pedal-box has to be switched over which I don’t think is going to be cheap. My dad says the whole thing is a bit dodgy and I’m thinking of taking it to another garage depending on the price they quote me tomorrow anyways, but I want to be reimbursed/refunded. It was a huge waste of my time, I lost my car for 3 days. I had to Uber back and forth from the garage (it was freezing and there’s no close station), and the price they charged me was extortion. It may not have been their fault that my car is broken, but I asked them to fix my car and they didn’t. Does it make me the arsehole to want my money back, even though they technically provided what I needed? \n\nTL;DR garage charged me money for fixing the car, car was fixed for 2 days and broke again, do I deserve my money back or is it just one of those things.

Being the curious gf and also wanting to giggle a but more about it (was trying to steer the relationship to be alright to talk openly about anything, be it embarrassing stories or exes, and to show him it's no biggie). He says he doesnt want to talk about it that he forgot who it was so I ask it it was so and so. He says yeah so I'm like \"omg no way!\". But it didnt add up with his story at the time. \n\nSo cut to rn, we do a secret-for-a-secret, so I bring  it up, turns out it's a completely other person. I asked why he lied, and he argues that it wasn't a lie, that I should be asking those questions in the first place. I tell him not to lie like that and he freaks out and says we are going to eat out anymore because of my \"fit\". Hes in the restaurant rn waiting for me, said to come in when I'm done. So, am I the asshole? Comment if you need any additional details. ",

One of the days I sit down on the train at 6:45 am and I return home at 8:00 pm. A long day. The train I get home is a VERY popular service and is always crowded when we leave the Capital but after a few stops as we get closer to my station, I always have people sitting next to me and they won't move to an open seat. My social anxiety is bad enough, but I am tall and large and I need my space. Also, I get to the train 10-15 mins early to sit in my ideal seat. \n\nAm I the butthole if I ask them to move to an open seat?",
